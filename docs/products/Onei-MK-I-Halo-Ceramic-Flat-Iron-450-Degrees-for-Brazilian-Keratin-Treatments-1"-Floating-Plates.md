<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had this for two years and it still is the perfect flat iron for my very thick, frizzy, big hair. It heats up in seconds, jas auto shut off, and the temperature adjusts. This was the best hair purchase I have made in a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift. She used it twice and it stopped working completely.  Such a high price for such a bad product. Returning immediately.</li>
    <li> I had a pretty good titanium iron ffom babyblyss that unfortunately broke. Ordered this one based on the reviews. It costs less, but does the job pretty well.  With babyblyss I would often burn my fingers because it would get so hot, this one while can be super hot does not burn the fingers. And it also leaves my hair super shiny. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love it and it&#x27;s worth the money. I use it every day. Get one! its a great buy. Works so good, it should cost more.</li>
    <li> The product works great. Much better than the Chi it replaced.  Heats up very quickly,  retains heat well and does not need 30 seconds to heat back up after each pass.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about a month, and it works exactly like I want it to. It heats up in a matter of seconds, flattens my naturally curly hair in no time at all, and glides smoothly along my hair without pulling or burning. I also use it for soft curls by holding it at the base of my hair and twirling it slowly as I pull to the ends (I have naturally curly hair, so I suppose that helps with the curling).</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t spend alot of time looking at the features so when I found the push button controls I thought I would be turning it off all the time and it would turn into a tedious routine.  Actually the design rocks and straightening my hair is more effortless than ever before. I especially love the auto turn off.  LOVE THIS THING!</li>
    <li> I never tried a flat irón machine before ; so this is my first one, but I Am very HAPPY for now with it. It takes me about 40 minutes to do all my hair as I have so much.&lt;br /&gt;I just really  love this product!!!.</li>
    <li> lOVE THIS FLAT iron. the fact that it heats up to a HOT 450 degrees get my hair pin straight! (a lot straighter than my old fflat iron haaha!) Also with the help of the brazilian keratin plates! Its durable seemingly and not really bulky. I wish it came with a glove and or a bag, since it is 80$!! BUT I do love this flat iron regardless.</li>
    <li> This is everything it says....lasts for as long as needed, flat ironed daughters hair which usually lasts A FEW HOURS AND IT LAST A MONTH Almost until she shampooed it. She has thick curly mixed race (black/white) hair. . Mines is fine but extra curly, well nappy and same results</li>
    <li> I loved dealing with this company, they were fast in the delivery, package was not damaged while being shipped.  I loved the flat iron so much I purchased the hair dryer as well and love that just as much as the flat iron. Thank you for being very professional&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;Robin</li>
    <li> I like that the outside remains cool so I am not burning myself.  Heats us fast and auto off also great</li>
    <li> I flatiron about twice weekly, and this iron does a great job! My hair is naturally curly and always frizzy, but I you can&#x27;t tell after using the iron? It leaves my hair soft, shiny and straight.</li>
    <li> This flat iron glides through my hair without pulling it and because of the rounded edges I can easily turn up or down the ends of my hair for a slight flip.  It took a little playing with to figure out the heat controls, but it turns out to be simple.  It heats up quickly and has reduced the time it takes me to style my hair. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon. At first I was a bit skeptical because I had a CHI for so long and liked it, but I&#x27;m very glad I bought the Onei because it does a very good job straightening my hair. My one criticism is that it&#x27;s not dual voltage. I travel a lot, so I&#x27;d have to take a converter with me, but for this price I wish it was dual voltage.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Heats up quickly and works like a dream.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It seems well made and so far is holding up really well. The shipping was quick, the price was good, and the seller has excellent follow up. We have owned several Chi flat irons but they do not seem to last very long.  This flat iron works better than the Chi and seems to be built better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron, after purchasing 3 others including 2 Chi&#x27;s that did nothing for my hair.  The reviews were good so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  It works perfectly.  I have very course, thick, wavy, color treated hair and I&#x27;ve used the flat iron 3 times now with excellent results.  I turn it up to 360, I have not had to go as high as 450.  My hair is so much straighter and it does not curl up once I walk outside in the humidity.  Its very easy to use, and slides off my hair without difficulty.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier, and would recommend this flat iron to anyone with thick hair that is difficult to control.  It also hits up with 30 seconds to the temperature you need, it tells you the exact temp. you&#x27;re at and turns on and off easily. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener! Usually I can never completely straighten my bangs and they always kink back up right after, not with this one! Definitely worth it&#x27;s money!!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly works very well love shut off auto in 30 minutes slim fits nicely in your hand not heavy</li>
    <li> I have been using flat irons that were ONLY coated with ceramic.....this Onei ceramic flat iron is fabulous!. This flat iron makes my hair so shiny and smooth.  I am so happy I bought it!</li>
    <li> So far, I am very pleased with this iron.  It heats up fast like lightening and flattens one or two strokes.  Ergonomically comfortable!  I do like the long cord, but it would be nice to have a retractable cord for easier storage.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have purchased this excellent Flat Iron years ago.  My hair looks marvelous.</li>
    <li> My wife has had this for several months now and has great results. Great price and delivered on time. Buy from this vendor I recommend.</li>
    <li> Returned this item. It did not maintain it&#x27;s temperature!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to read the display and works well.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> by far the best flat iron i have ever owned. heats up instantly. sturdy construction. glides over hair snag free. very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing. It straightens my kinky curly hair with ease and it gives it incredible shine.  I&#x27;ve used it for regular styles and for a straightening treatment. Love the extra long swivel cord and the body of the iron is touchable which makes it easy to use it to curl your hair.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one!</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron as a birthday gift from a friend of mine who is a hair stylist.  Since she cuts my hair, she had mentioned that I needed to use a straightener that wasn&#x27;t so harsh and cruel to my hair.  After using the Onei Halo for a few months, I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to my old flat iron again!  This flat iron gets hot very quick, stays hot throughout the entire time I am using it, and I really notice a difference in the way my hair feels.  My hair stays straight for days and feels much softer and more healthy than it used to.  I like the controls on this flat iron too, as they are easy to adjust and makes it simple to see what setting you are using.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who straightens their hair, whether occasionally or even on a daily basis.  This flat iron really is the best one I have ever used!</li>
    <li> this product did not live up to the hype...I suspect the sellers posted all those glowing reviews..it did nothing for me..sorry I purchased it &amp; wish I could return it..it seems to burn my hair even at a low temp...worthless &amp; will prob go in the garbage</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing -and amazingly hot! My hair is very thick and unmanageable. It slides right over it and smooths it right out. I have purchased much more expensive models (such as Chi) that didn&#x27;t work as well on my hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this Iron!  Had it on my wishlist due to all the reviews and got it as a B-day gift from my Mom in Law.  Wishes do come true!!!  I love this Iron.  After a wash, my hair is thick, curly and frizzy,  This Iron leaves my hair smooth and for the first time looking silky.  I found that I only need to use it at about 410 or 420 degrees, If I ever loose this Iron I will definitely purchase another just like it!</li>
    <li> My hair is very long, very thick, and very curly. I turn this flat iron on to 410 degrees and with one swipe through it&#x27;s straight as a board. I have to use a heat protector and frizz reducer first, I use Suave with Moroccan oil...</li>
    <li> I have very kinky hair, so I put the temp on 400.  It straightened fine...for half of my head.  I took a break and came back to finish the other half, and it won&#x27;t heat up!  I keep getting some kind of error message, CH7 that flashes.  I try turning it back off by holding down the on/off button,but it just stays on.  I have to unplug it and plug it in again to get it to turn back on, but the same thing happens.  Bad thing is I ordered this a couple of months ago and I don&#x27;t think I have the receipt to return it.  Don&#x27;t buy this.  Get a gold n hot for a 1/3 of the price.  I should have known better.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I like being able to control the temperature. The only downfall is that i consistently hit the off button on accident while falt iron my hair. Not the products fault, just the way my fingers lay on the device</li>
    <li> Good product and sturdily built.</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase my teenage daughter a quality flat iron and looked around a lot before deciding on this one. The ratings by users were better than the Chi flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, and already have, recommend this flat iron to others. My daughter has very thick, very fine hair and it is great. Her hair has a tendency to be frizzy but after using this it is smooth and shiny. The last flat iron I purchased took forever to straighten her hair but not with this one. It is not an exageration to stay that it only takes a quarter of the time that it did previously.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. Great value for money. Adjust the temperature to your liking. Doesn&#x27;t burn hair. Able to curl and Do so much more with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I had initially wrote. After about three weeks the straightener stop working. Temperature would not work. I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. I have since contacted the customer service department and was told a replacement would be sent. It&#x27;s now been six weeks and I still haven&#x27;t received anything. DISAPPOINTING!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to write the review but I jsut want to say that I love it. The best I ever had.</li>
    <li> I loved this product so much because it does the job so much faster then most of the other irons I have used in the past. However, the reason why I will not give it a 5 star rate is because it sometimes has a mind of its own. For some reason when I am using the product it either turns off or the temperature drops. Usually that is good in case you forget to turn it off, but this should not happen while I am using it.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, frizzy, damaged hair and this flat iron is amazing! My hair was so shiny and straight after I used it! It heats up really fast too!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is really great. Heats up very fast. I use it on my clients as well as myself and it leaves the hair shiny and soft. Its also pretty much a single pass iron. I usually use it on 410 and it works great. For the price this was an amazing buy. I had the t3 before this one and I must say this one has been a whole lot better. As per other reviews of the chiming sound. Their new ones do not have it so no need to fret of annoying sounds. I purchased from mkt dist. And customer service is great. Also customer service from onei themselves has been amazing. And last but not least the warranty is the best.</li>
    <li> My hair has started falling out and breaking off and I&#x27;ve only had it a week. I Do Not recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Digital display and control is nice. Cord is sturdy, and revolves so as to avoid tangles. Now the only foreseeable issue is longevity, but with such a good warranty even that is mitigated.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with the Argan oil that was automatically recommended by Amazon, and both were great buys! This flat iron was a steal for the price. Compared to my big box store one it&#x27;s untouchable. When you compare it to a Chi I would say it&#x27;s a little better. It glides smoothly over the hair and the plates are a little bigger. Unlike all my others I have had it has not pulled my hair. The lighted blue degree indicator is bright and the fact that it does automatically turn off after 30 minutes is a large plus for me!! this flat iron glides smoothly and only takes two passes over each section of my hair. It does not fry the ends of my hair. my hair will stay stick straight and not have a bit of frizz from root to tip all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my fair share of hair straighteners and spent so much money trying to find one that works like this. Finally my search stops here.This is my favorite by far and can&#x27;t believe how affordable it is!! My hair turns out so shiny and smooth. My girlfriends, after seeing how well it worked bought themselves one as well and all have had amazing results and are in love with this straightener. It heats up so fast and is very lightweight. Simply the best flat iron out there!!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine, curly, highlighted and roots done regularly hair, and after much convincing, have had a Keratin Treatment.  Even after the treatment my hair was still curly every time I washed it, so I would blow it dry then flat iron it, still spending way more time than I really wanted to, but everyone said it looked better and I looked younger with it straight. So, I used my $20 Target Conair Flat Iron and would still take a while and I had to wash it every other day, because for some reason even though my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy, it would look tooooo flat by the third day and since I was used to curly hair, it was hard enough getting used to it straight, that flat was just not working for me, so every other day, I&#x27;d wash, blow dry &amp; flat iron it.  Then I used my sisters professional flat iron and decided I needed to buy one.  Best purchase ever! Still not sure how it makes it sooooo much better, but like other reviews stated, I truly can go 4-5 days without having to restyle my hair.  My hair stays soft, bouncy and looking great after using my new flat iron.  I had no idea that it could make that much difference, but after spending a small fortune to color &amp; Keratin it, I&#x27;m soooo glad I took the next step and bought a great flat iron to style it, and it cut my styling time in half, better and quicker and lasts longer, that&#x27;s a no-brainer.  Like other reviews said and like the directions say, make sure you hold the on button for 3 seconds or it won&#x27;t turn on, and be careful not to hold the same button while styling or it will shut off, but it warms up faster than one brush stroke. With Amazon&#x27;s return policy, you have nothing to lose to try it... so glad I did!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best straightening iron I&#x27;ve owned -- the plates heat up fast and the temperature is adjustable. The plates provide constant and consistent heating at the desired temperature (unlike other irons). The design is such that your hair (if fine like my own) doesn&#x27;t get tangled into the edges of the plates. It has an easy shut off mechanism and the instruction booklet comes with a handy guideline for which range of temperatures are appropriate for your hair type.</li>
    <li> Did a really nice job of straightening my hair. I have thick, curly, coarse hair and this did a decent job of straightening it. My mom liked it so much she decided to take it from me. It stopped working though, there was an electrical shortage and I am not sure if that is from my moms carelessness or an issue with the product. I had a cricket before this and now I have a Chi, and they all did about the same job.</li>
    <li> Got this for my gf for her b-day and she loves it says it straightens her hair in half the time.</li>
    <li> I searched for hours for the perfect flat iron and finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best features:&lt;br /&gt;- Auto shut-off (this was hard to find!)&lt;br /&gt;- rotating cord so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled&lt;br /&gt;- temperature control is easy to read and adjust&lt;br /&gt;- heats up in seconds - no waiting&lt;br /&gt;- I use it to flip my hair under (I have a mid-length bob)</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat Iron was happy when i got it then i started to use it for a while and one day i went to use my iron and it didnt go to 450 heat any more it started to burn my hair I only had it for 6 months i will never order hair products from online again. Waste OF MONEY</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this flat iron. It&#x27;s light, heats quickly, and smoothed her hair without frying it. She did note that her roomie, who has thin, fine hair, couldn&#x27;t use it. But if you have thick, wavy tresses, this is a great iron.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a flat iron that had multiple temperature settings along with an automatic shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been perfect for her and her looks outstanding !</li>
    <li> Never worked!  I bought this for my wife because she wanted a good iron with autoshutoff.  Unfortunately the iron wouldn&#x27;t even heat up.  She pulled it out of the box plugged it in and it flashes and error code repeatedly.  We tried all sorts of things to try and get it to work, but it was defective from the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully Amazon is great about returns, I&#x27;m afraid to order another one for fear they&#x27;ll ship out another defective unit or that it will die right after the return period.  Overall, the size, shape, and design are fantastic, however, unless you only want to use it for a nightlight or paperweight I&#x27;d look for something else.</li>
    <li> I put it down on my desk for one second while I picked another piece of hair, the flat iron caught on fire and continued to melt and burn the whole way throughout, starting with the ceramic plates. Awful.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much easier hair styling could be with the right tools!  I hesitated to buy this flatiron because of it&#x27;s price, but learned after using it for the first time that it is WELL worth it!  It cuts my styling time in half!  A must purchase if you&#x27;re in the market for a new flatiron.</li>
    <li> I was worried that I had never heard of this brand before, but I read all the excellent reviews and so I tried it and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve owned many brands of irons and they keep getting cheaper by the minute(Chi is one of these). Overall, I am happy with the product and would tell anyone looking for a new hot iron to try this brand. I really like the results I got!</li>
    <li> Update 8/18/2016 - I STILL LOVE this flat iron!!!! I bought this Onei Flat Iron last week and I sooooo love! I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of flat irons so would rarely use them but this one, for whatever the reason, is so easy to use. Heats up in seconds...it&#x27;s crazy fast. I have short hair and love how I can add a flip to the ends. Love the long cord. The auto shut off is awesome. It is so much nicer than my daughters&#x27; over-priced &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; irons.</li>
    <li> Ok, so i like the feel of this iron but hate the fact it beeps all the time, every time i am using it on high heat! It beeps everytime i set it down and will turn off when im still using it!! The heat keeps fluctuating from low 430&#x27;s when i keep &amp;#34;locking&amp;#34; it on 450. Its really aggrivating. That said, it doesnt pull hair, hasn&#x27;t broken down yet and seems to put off consistent heat, so i&#x27;m torn...if it wasnt so annoying with all that beeping, i may have liked it better.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! My hair has never looked so good. Seriously! It&#x27;s as if I just stepped out of the salon. I&#x27;m so impressed. I recieved this as a gift from my wonderful sister. It heats up really quickly and takes me no time to get the style I love.</li>
    <li> I was over 60 and having fits with my hair when I bought this flat iron/straightener.  It makes a tremendous difference in the way my hair looks and behaves, and it saves me lots of time, because I do NOT have to keep working with it every day.  I get up, brush my hair, maybe pin it back from my face, and go about my day.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Within 3 months of purchase, one side stopped heating. Obviously it was defective, no big deal, stuff happens... the good news was that I had settled on this Iron because of their 4 year warranty (which is longer than most) it showed they stand behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;Oh was I wrong... I had been happy/satisfied with the product until that point despite the defect, but when I emailed and called about a replacement/exchange they said they couldn&#x27;t do it because the warranty wasn&#x27;t registered and I had to register it at the time of purchase. I&#x27;ve got my proof of purchase that is only 4 months old, clearly this would be covered under the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;At this point I am out the $ that I spent on the iron and now I have to buy another replacement within 4 months! I am very frustrated and would not recommend this product due to the poor customer service.</li>
    <li> when i first tried the flat irons my hair wasnt freshly washed so i figured the smell was due to my hair being dirty. so the next day i washed and conditioned my hair and flat ironed it. the irons left my hair smelled fried and burnt. yet my hair looked silky and felt the same. they make my hair look fabulos but it makes it smell horrible</li>
    <li> Just bought this flat iron about a week ago and I&#x27;ve had way too much fun playing with it.  It is a LOT more effective than my old Conair, and I love that I can see the exact temperature setting.  It also has a cute little jingle that plays when you turn it on or off.  And, as it says, you can definitely use this for straightening AND for curling.  It took me a few tries to get the technique, but once I got the hang of it I was able to curl my hair pretty quickly (roughly on par with a normal curling iron).  UPDATE: Holy cow, the price has doubled since I purchased this for $30 a year ago.  The only drawback I&#x27;ve found in a year of use is that you cannot have the heat set too high if you plan on curling with it.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product I use on my hair, but if you are curling your hair on a temperature higher than 370 or so, it will start to melt and warp the black plastic plates on the top and bottom of the iron.  Both of the black plastic plates on my iron have been disfigured to the point where they fell off of the iron, which makes curling more difficult.  It still works great for straightening, and as long as you are aware of the heat limitations you shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble curling.  Downgrading my review to a 4 out of 5, because I think that the plastic should be able to bear up to its own heat.  Still love, would buy again.  FINAL UPDATE:   I bought this in July 2012 and finally, nearly 4 years later, it has worked less than perfectly.  I plugged it in this morning and one of the plates no longer heats up.   I&#x27;ve used this flat iron almost daily for four years, including extensive travel, and it has held up remarkably well.   I&#x27;ve loved it so much that I had to update my review one last time for anyone who is considering this product.  Four years of near-perfect service; HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I love it onei  because let me the hair smooth and glossy I recommend this pruduct it have everything that i need.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. It heats up quickly. Leaves my hair silky and shiny. Not too fond of the auto 30 minute turn off feature but I&#x27;m getting used to that. All in all a great item at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever used. I bought this flat iron for my hair stylist as a gift and now know that I will be buying one for myself in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick long hair that is naturally curly. This flat iron straighten my hair easily in 25 minutes when it normally takes at least 45!!  This will be the best buy you make all year!</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the best straightener I have ever owned. I recently bought another high end model off of a discount site. I hated it, it felt like every time I ran it over my hair, the light flashed showing it was heating back up. This straightener never does that. It heats up in less than 30 seconds and retains the heat the entire time I&#x27;m straightening, even if my hair still has a little dampness to it. It glides through the hair so smoothly, never pulls or leaves kinks. It makes my hair feel incredible, the style lasts forever, and it can provide a curl under at the end. I use this every single day and have considered getting a back up one. My hair looks healthier because this can straighten it in half the time of other straighteners, and at a lower heat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good flat iron for the price.  I have very curly hair and this iron straightens it after a few passes.</li>
    <li> I used this flat iron for about a month (bought in July) during which I really liked it -- it heated quickly, didn&#x27;t pull my hair &amp; I liked the digital read-out.  This morning it heated to 260 degrees (that&#x27;s what was on the digital screen) and wouldn&#x27;t go any higher.  I normally used it set at 320+/-.  Of course, I turned it off and on a few times &amp; reset the temp a couple times.  I went ahead and used it quickly &amp; carefully on a small hank of hair &amp; I could immediately smell burned hair.  Obviously the thermostat or the read-out went kaput; either way it&#x27;s not usable.  Maybe I got a lemon, but it&#x27;s very disappointing.  I would not buy this brand again and would not recommend it to anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After posting this review I received a Comment from someone supposedly a company representative. He said to contact him and he would arrange for a replacement.  That was 8/21/13. I contacted the company and have heard nothing since then.  Company&#x27;s customer service is  nonexistent (9/12/13)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t create frizz&lt;br /&gt;Straightens in one pass&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;Gets hot enough&lt;br /&gt;But most importantly, to me, DOESN&#x27;T catch any hair with each pass!! I don&#x27;t have strands stuck in the iron when I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a win for me.</li>
    <li> I did lengthy research on hair dryers because both my husband and I have very curly hair (and his is frizzy) and we needed something that would really work to straighten and de-frizz. This dryer is amazing. In general, it seems the ionic dryers work best, but we have another Baby Bliss one that doesn&#x27;t work as well as this. This one is lightweight and fairly quiet as well, and it straightens the hair so smoothly. We both love it and HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> i was so upset when my old flat iron broke that i was really hesitant to look for a new one. I did some research and heard some great things about this one. I was definitely not disappointed! I have course curly hair and it straightens my hair much more quickly than my old straightener and it also heats up very quickly after turning on! The ceramic plates leave my hair really soft and shiny compared to my old flat iron. I love it!</li>
    <li> Not impressed. I purchased this after combing through lots of reviews.  Decent price but I don&#x27;t like the way it flat irons my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  I&#x27;ve owned a chi which I like, my favorite thus far is the Hana which came with a steep price tag but you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;ll most likely give this to my daughter and buy a Hana or Babyliss.  My hair is long and fine, it just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping around for irons for a while, reading reviews and what not. The bad reviews on Amazon speculate that the good reviews are fake; you don&#x27;t know what to believe and it&#x27;s very frustrating. I gave this iron a shot because the price was reasonable and it promises a 4 year warranty. My previous iron was a Chi, which provided me with 6 years of faithful service before it burned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon my first use of this iron, I knew I made the right choice. The main thing I noticed is that it did not pull on my hair, which I greatly appreciated since this happened all of the time with my Chi. The second thing I noticed is how hot it was; much hotter than my Chi. I was able to straighten each section of my hair with just a single pass. For reference I am Caucasian with hair that is thick, coarse, wavy and frizzy. After using this iron it was smooth, glossy, and perfectly straight. I used it on the hottest setting - 450 degrees, but I will probably turn down the temp because my hair smells just a teensy bit burnt. In my opinion, the hottest setting would be perfect for ladies with harder-to-straighten hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not know of course, is if the iron will hold up over the years, or if the warranty will be honored should a problem arise. If it lasts even as half as long as my Chi then it is worth the money in my opinion. I will update this review if anything changes but at this point, I am extremely happy with this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******UPDATE****** I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 2 years. I took it with me to Korea and it burned out when I plugged it into an outlet, (I was using a converter and my laptop, cell phone and blow dryer did fine, but the iron died). When I got back to America, I called the company and told them that my flat iron would not heat up over 112 degrees. They told me to send it back. Less than a week after I mailed it, they sent me a new iron, no questions asked. I was EXTREMELY impressed with their customer service and the fact that they honored the warranty when they didn&#x27;t even know the circumstances under which it broke. I will be an Onei beauty customer for life because of how well they treated me.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use and dummy proof. After reading MANY reviews I went with the Onei over the Chi and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> This is a *fantastic* product. I&#x27;ve previously invested three times the amount my Onei costs, and those products simply can not match up to Onei. It heats up quickly, never smokes or scorches, and leaves my hair silky, smooth, shiny and frizz free for days. No need for touch ups! It also curls the ends like a dream. I am SO pleased with this product, I got one for my sister, and she has the exact same feelings. LADIES, YOU CAN&#x27;T NOT HAVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> When I first received this iron, I was so very happy with it.  However, after about 2 weeks, the temperature started to act up. One night I plugged it into a regular outlet. Within minutes I smelt smoke. I turned to find the iron was smoking and the plates melted right off the iron. VERY BAD PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> love my new flat iron  I have short hair and is really thin, but with this iron make my hair loos beautiful.</li>
    <li> Flat iron was everything they said it was. Shipped very fast I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received my onei flat iron! Its super light which helps when you are ironing long hair. It heats up really quickly which is always a plus in the morning before going to work. I&#x27;ve been using flat irons for a very long time and I&#x27;ve used all the famous brands and honestly onei is the best one I have used so far. Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my new onei! I have purchased many straighteners before but this is by far the best. It leaves my hair looking fresh out of the salon every time! I will deffinetly let my friends and family know about this product!!</li>
    <li> This tool has made the process of straightening my hair and still leaving a wave much easier and quicker.</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron! So happy with this purchase!  I loved how my hair looked after using it!  Great seller!</li>
    <li> I use this iron everyday !! I love how easy-to-use and fast it works . Love love love it !!</li>
    <li> Bought for wife for Christmas she is very happy with this flat iron. I bought this brand because consumer report reated in the top ten for quality and preformance.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi for about 5 years before this. I love this straightener. I mostly love that you can adjust the heat, which you couldn&#x27;t do on the chi. Also has auto shut off in case u forget to turn it off.  Have had it about a year now and it has been a great product</li>
    <li> I do not flat iron my hair often (Natural with 4a hair) but when I do this has been great. Gets hair straight on 1 pass (i usually do 2 passes to really get it straight) and it is controlled heat. Great flat iron Also I show a video of how i flat iron the hair and how it gets straight on 1 pass https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;rSJ_NBkSVNk  I have Natural Hair (Type 4) And use 380 Degrees</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 Chi flat irons that I have loved...with one exception - the cord always breaks after about 2 years!!  I don&#x27;t wrap the cord tight or bend it into a drawer constantly, but both of my Chi iron&#x27;s had the same problem after about 2 years.  The plates still looked like new, but they shorted out because of the cord.  I had my husband cut and re-saughter the cords on both, which was a temporary fix...until they completely broke.  After that experience, I decided to research other brands of flat irons and came across this one on many review sites.  It got rave reviews and comes with a 4 year warranty!!  I&#x27;ve been using this iron for about 2 month&#x27;s now and have nothing negative to say about it - great product at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I have owned many, many expensive professional flat irons, this one is by far the best one EVER! My hair has been pretty damaged by coloring and have been using hair masks and keratin treatments. This flat iron makes my hair silky, and shiny like NO other flat iron has!</li>
    <li> This was a bootleg item, I do not recommend that anyone purchase it.</li>
    <li> Heats very fast and very hot! Love the lock on the side which prevents accidently turning up/down the heat.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, I used it on my hair after the treatment and its easy and safe and works as expected, it works on 127V &#x3D; 110V. thank you seller.</li>
    <li> I had a much more expensive one. After I broke it two times I gave up on that brand.&lt;br /&gt;This one was much less and works much better.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Renee C</li>
    <li> I just love this flat iron....my hair stay nice and shinny all day, I like that I can change the temperature as well... No frizz at all... Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I really liked this flat iron....it heats up really fast and cools down quickly BUT honestly it does not leave your hair as silky and soft as another flat iron I purchased on AMAZON.......I thought because it was ceramic it would be better for my hair but it really did not work THAT well.....it&#x27;s very expensive for the results I got. :(.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 1 week now and I love it!!! The cord is long and doesn&#x27;t get tangled! Heats up fast and gets hot but doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. Would buy this again for me or great for a gift!!</li>
    <li> Even after reading the reviews. the iron is better than expected, and i was a die hard chi girl.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE this flat iron.  The best I have ever used.  It is definitely different but in a positive way.  I am grateful I found this!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great!  I love the digital settings.  It gets hot in seconds!! I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It heats up super fast, turns itself off and it makes my hair so soft and straight. No frizzy left in my hair, feel like I&#x27;m at the salon.</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast and leaves my hair shiny and soft. I like it. I recommend it to everyone. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. This is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned and I am picky. Works perfect for Brazillian blowout. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have that kind of hair that frizzes out very easily in humid (and not-so-humid) weather. This flat iron works great and takes very little time to achieve fabulous results. Plus, the cord is super-long! I love it!</li>
    <li> This one works just as well as the $150 dollar one I bought from the salon that broke a year later!!  Hopefully this one will last longer making it an even smarter purchase!</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up fast, does a good job, and turns off automatically.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so I can&#x27;t attest to its longevity.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this, I was IN LOVE!  It truly straightened my hair with a single pass and I thought to myself, &amp;#34;Finally!  A flat iron that I can use on my very frizzy hair!&amp;#34;  But after the 3rd use, it stopped working.  The temperature would flicker on and off and finally would shut off.  I sent it back but am leery of ordering another one!  For that price I would expect to get one that works the first time!</li>
    <li> The plates were uneven, instead of closing flat it closed and the tip pieces of metal clamped together and the rest had a gap unless you squeezed very hard. Even pressing lightly should your hair fall between the tip of the two plates that closed together first, it would rip/pull your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a high quality flat iron with this issue. I returned the item -- I couldn&#x27;t stand having my hair ripped out of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the ideal placements of temperature buttons, and the fact the temperature went from 140*-450*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did heat up fast, but even the joint mechanism of the iron was plastic and extremely cheap looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the flat iron for a little over a month now and I have to say I love this flat iron.  I like the fact I can change the temperatures on it and it does not burn my hair....  I have very fine hair and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this one.  The shipment was fast and the company followed up with me to make sure I was satisfied with my order.  You can&#x27;t ask for better service than that.  I would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, my wife loves it so far. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. We haven&#x27;t experienced any of what the negative reviews have said about the product at all. One of the selling factors for me was the 4 year warranty on the item.</li>
    <li> My girls are very picky about the hair appliances they use and I wanted to make sure they both used the flat iron before commenting.  I works well and they like the digital read out on the side and the ability to control the temperature so as not to burn their hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron based off  its great reviews on amazon.com. It did not work well while I had it and It stopped working after less then a month.  Very disappointing! A waste of money!  Save your money and buy a flat iron from the drug store with the same type of plates. It will probably last longer and work just as well! It also went down in price. I paid $80 and now its 59.99.</li>
    <li> A gift for my wife.she says it&#x27;s a very good flat iron.</li>
    <li> Item as described working great.</li>
    <li> I did like this at first. After about 4 months it does not work as well anymore. I believe the thermostat stopped accurately working so it&#x27;s been frying my hair. I like an iro to be slimmer, gets closer the those fly aways.</li>
    <li> The onei flat iron is a great iron.  I was looking for one that had adjustable settings.  I am hoping this one lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Was in need of a new straightener and found this one. Read pretty good reviews about it so decided to try. It&#x27;s easy to use, heats up quickly and straightens nicely. My hair feels soft and sleek afterwards. Would recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s used to take more than an hour to straighten my hair, now with this purchase it&#x27;s less than 30-minutes and I have a thick hair.</li>
    <li> Very good!!!! Easy to use and amazing results if you use it to do your own Keratin Treatment.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this product. I have had it less than 6 months and one of the black labels has fallen off. I could live with that if it performed the way my HAI performed, which it does not. With that said, I paid $180 for my HAI in 2007 and it lasted until 2013 with AMAZING performance. My hope was that I could spend $100 on this and have the same results, um, not so much. Lesson learned - there are certain items you HAVE to pay for - this is one of them. It works, it does NOT work like my HAI worked. God rest its soul.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a new flat iron after my Euro-tools died after 3 years. I looked at a ton of reviews and this one seemed to be the best for the price. Everyone raved about how smooth and shiny it made their hair look. I used the iron the first time and it did not make my hair smooth or shiny. It made it slightly crispy, even on a lower setting than I used to use with my old iron. My hair is think and fairly coarse, so I need a higher setting. It also did not stay straight for more than 15 minutes after I left the house. The two sides of the iron also do not open very wide so it&#x27;s difficult to straighten my hair close to the root. Basically, I&#x27;m returning it because I think I can find something better for the price. We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle of Moroccan oil from the Jen Family and I am very pleased with the service. It arrived in perfect condition, was an amazing price, and got to my apartment even earlier than expected! Would def order from them again!! The straightener itself is way better than my old chi....my hair is long, thick, and wavy and it takes me 10-15 minutes to totally straighten it. People were asking my of I had gotten my hair professionally straightened!</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair the 200 degree setting is enough for you. Two passes and it&#x27;s shiny and smooth city. This is worth the investment so treat yourself. I do wish it would save the degree setting each time you turn it off but otherwise I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my Chi that broke after 7 years of service. I intended to buy another Chi, but took a chance on the Onei MK-1. So glad I did! It heats up super fast, and gets my hair really smooth! Easy to create curls too!</li>
    <li> This product is comparable to a Chi straightener. Its heats up quickly and leaves hair super straight. Delivery was quick, and product looks better that it is pictured.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightener I have ever used. It is so easy and saves so much time. It used to take me 20-30 mins to straighten my hair(waivy) but now it takes only 10 minutes with this amazing straightener. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good hair straightener which saves time and is worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> Purchased a 2nd one for my granddaughter for Christmas because I have had such great luck with my my one.  She is 21 and takes care of her items.  Her new flat iron stopped working just before the 60 day mark but after the 30 day return policy - go figure.  Now I have a dead flat iron I paid good money for.  There should be a longer return policy especially for Prime members.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It heats up nicely and does not snag my hair. Item arrived on time and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Broke within 6 months, only one plate heats up now.  Worked well while it worked.  Keep looking ladies this is to expensive to have to replace this soon.  The digit temp was nice.  Fast heat up.  Happy I waited to write the review otherwise this would have gotten an undeserved 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I wanted a flat iron that specifically stated it would reach 450 degrees, since not all of them do.  I was previously using an HAI iron with a maximum temperature of 400 degrees and my hair stylist said it was better to use a higher heat and make fewer passes through the hair to minimize damage.  After researching other reviews for this and other irons, I selected this Onei MK-I Halo.  I have now had it about a week and am very impressed with it.  As promised, it reaches the desired temp literally within seconds (the digital display actually shows you the increasing temp).  It is lightweight and easy to handle.  I like that all the controls are on the side, where your hands can&#x27;t accidentally hit them. Also, the way the plates are positioned, I have not accidentally burned my hands at all, which it seemed like I did regularly with my old iron.  It glides through the hair quickly and smoothly and leaves no hesitation creases.  I have shoulder length, thick, naturally curly hair.  Of course this means that I have spent my whole life trying to eliminate every trace of curl.  This iron does a wonderful job.  I use a small amount of MoraccanOil treatment prior to blow drying and a heat protectant spray before I straighten.  My hair looks great.  I would definitely recommend this.  Absolutely no need to spend $150 or more for great results.</li>
    <li> I have naturally, very curly hair which is also past my shoulders.  I have tried several brands of flat irons, including Chi and BioSilk.  Both of these brands did fairly well but I had to go over and over my hair to get it straight.  This flat iron works perfectly, I don&#x27;t have to set it to the hottest setting, the auto shut off works great, the cord is super long so you aren&#x27;t fighting to reach your hair.  I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about or anything I think could be improved.  This flat iron performs just as well as the one my stylist uses, I am a very, very happy customer!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good hair straighter only thing I some how put the tempeture setting to Celsius n don&#x27;t kno how to get it back to farenheight it&#x27;s no problem just lil stuff bothers me like that but for the most part it&#x27;s bomb. Com</li>
    <li> My hair was dry all of the time. It seemed like no matter what I put in my hair it would just leave my hair more oily looking and I still had the dry ends.  So far this iron has left my hair looking shiny and normal.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great.  So far I haven&#x27;t had any of the temperature sticking as the other customers reported.  It operates smoothly and may be the best iron I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite hair iron. I have a wavy hair n never had frizz. After using this my texture was horrible,even with using  heat protectant. I tried it so many times but same result. Finally returned it. If you have long hair wouldn&#x27;t recommend 1 inch. After this I got baby bliss nano pro and it was the best decision.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was exactly what I was looking for. I needed a high heat iron to use with Organix Keratin Treatment and it worked great with a high temperature of 145 degrees.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron, and I was a little hesitant. But the first time I used it I was so pleased with the result. It is so smooth, so easy to use. The temperature setting is very helpful. I used healing oil and my hair was so soft and so shiny. I have naturally wavy hair that goes crazy on humid days. My hair stayed beautiful all day, even in the Houston humidity. I priced many other flat irons, and read countless reviews. Based on price and customer satisfaction, I chose the Onei MK-I Ceramic Flat Iron. So glad I did. Would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The thing I like the most about this is that it is lightweight! The 30 minute auto shut off is also very handy, since I constantly worry  about it being on or off when I left the house. It does a good job straightening and leaves my hair not looking as damaged as before. At first, I was a little confused on how to get the temperature changed. I thought it was broken or something, but it just has some functions to get used to, etc. All in all I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase, just hope I can say the same in 1-2 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many flatirons and this is the best ever.  Super smooth and gentle on my delicate (fine, color processed) wavy hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best one I have ever used. It is better than a Chi because it makes your hair like silk. I have tried so many irons, and with my hair, even the high end irons destroy my hair. This iron doesn&#x27;t even require product. You can use it to add to the shine, but this iron gives such a sleek look-and you do not have to run it through more than once. If you want amazing hair without turning your hair to straw-get this iron!</li>
    <li> I suffered from a trauma to my scalp which drastically changed the texture of my hair.  My stylist recommended a flat iron and it&#x27;s made such an improvement in appearance.  I love this flat iron because it heats up &amp; cools off quickly (I have a toddler in the house, so keeping hot appliances tucked away in a timely matter is a must).  It has a digital temperature gauge, to ensure I&#x27;m not using too much heat.  It also doesn&#x27;t become too hot to the touch during use.  I was really impressed with how quickly I received my product from the seller and their concern for  my satisfaction.  I would highly recommend this model to someone looking for a quick, convenient, reliable product for a good price.</li>
    <li> I gave it a month before I wrote a review, I am in love with my MK-1 &amp;#34;Because of the floating plates I am able to add bounce to my short hair, because my old hot ironed dried and burnt my hair, I was very nervous buying another flat iron. After one month of use My hair is still in great shape looking forward to my hair getting longer. I I would highly recommend purchasing the MK-1.&lt;br /&gt;I am purchasing one for my daughter for her birthday, Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> love LOVE LOVE THIS FLAT IRON...MY HAIR IS SOOO SILKY SMOOTH..IT WAS SO QUICK i WAS ABLE TO DO MY HAIR AND BOTH MY DAUGTHERS IN LIKE 20 MINUTES TOTAL...AWESOME BUY OVER A CHI!!!</li>
    <li> 1) Has a lit up digital readout.&lt;br /&gt;2) Has an automatic shut off -Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;3) Does not pull or break thick wavy hair AND leaves your hair feeling shiny!&lt;br /&gt;4) Works as well as my Hai Nano flatiron before it broke&lt;br /&gt;5) Cheaper than the Hai Nano.&lt;br /&gt;6) Wasn&#x27;t a crappy fake like my recent Hai Nano purchase.&lt;br /&gt;7) Doesn&#x27;t have a swivel cord but the cord is long.&lt;br /&gt;8) A little thicker than the Hai Nano but stays cool on the outside of plates.&lt;br /&gt;9) Sellers seem vested in their company and value their reputation. Great Communication!&lt;br /&gt;10) I would buy another one from Onei Beauty.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up SO fast, I love the LED display, and best of all it gets my hair just as straight and shiny (if not more so and at a faster rate) than my croc, which cost almost twice as much.</li>
    <li> I love my straightener! It&#x27;s taken me 26 years to find a product that tames my curly locks but I&#x27;ve finally found it! Nothing else makes my hair so straight while protecting my hair.  It was the best birthday gift!</li>
    <li> A very good iron. I believe it was rated one of the best flat irons for 2013. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this,I was really impressed,but as I use,it more and more,am deciding that it is pretty much like all the other flat irons out there. It doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair,and slides through easily,but doesn&#x27;t really give me the smooth sleek finish that I was hoping for and burns my bangs just like all the others,no matter what products I use or what heat setting I have it on. I am disappointed in the product for the cost</li>
    <li> The ceramic plates do not pull!  The temp is adjustable, heats up fast and auto shut off! Everything I need!</li>
    <li> Works better than my chi did.  After one year of use one side quit heating, Onei replaced it with no questions asked very quickly. I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best! I&#x27;m just sorry I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner. My daughter has very thick hair and this works wonders!</li>
    <li> I love that this flat iron heats up so quickly and does not burn my hair. The only con I have is that it wont stay on the lower temp when I adjust it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more of a user error.</li>
    <li> I love this iron. I would have given it 5 stars but the plates do not close tightly together:(</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and works great! I love the digital LED display too! Works just as good or better than the CHI</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  It&#x27;s fast, comfortable in my hand and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  My hair looks like it was salon-styled.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best straightener I&#x27;ve used. It warms up so fast it&#x27;s especially great when I&#x27;m in a rush. I also love how it straightens my hair so nicely. I will never buy another and if I do it will be just like this one!!</li>
    <li> I really liked it. I specially loved that it was 100% ceramic. Definitely better than the chi. I straightened my hair dry and I only had to pass it through once, and my hair is very thick, and I didnt even have it at its highest temperature. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> This initially worked great but after a couple weeks it would give me a strange CH4 reading and the temperature would go up and down super fast and not heat up.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this new flat iron, it heats up fast and the lite weight makes it great to travel with.  Highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> This flatiron is very good. It is very easy to get to the temp regulator and it heats up very quickly. It goes through my hair easily and very little snagging. The secret is very little hair each pass.  I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I got these 5 months as a gift for a friend who always complained that her flat irons couldn&#x27;t control her kinky, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;She immediately loved these! and they&#x27;re still holding up just fine, no uneven heating or any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE. I cannot count how many times the older straighteners were left on and probably almost burned our house down multiple times. I have had to come home from work to check before. What a drama. I looked for EVER to find a straightener that shut off automatically, why are they so hard to find?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. So, besides the fact that it shuts off automatically (preventing your house from going up in flames in the event of a malfunction), it heats up very, very quickly. Wife used to let the old one heat up forever, who knows how hot it got, no indicator. We purchased all of the best, advertised, talked about, wow. Too many. They all had some crazy features but ultimately were all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is DIFFERENT. Shuts off automatically and heats up quickly. GET IT.</li>
    <li> LOVE this flat iron, from the quick heating to the cool down and automatic shut off.  My hair is left shiny and silky and the tool fits well into my hand. The design of the tool is excellent and comfortable to hold and use.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Try it.  I think you&#x27;ll also find that it&#x27;s a nice looking flat iron, too, which makes the experience even more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> OMG...this flat iron is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best!  It heats up extremely fast and also cools down very fast too.  It can get very hot, 450 degrees, but I prefer to set it to 330 degrees.  It has a digital display for the exact temperature setting.  I&#x27;ve used many flat irons and this one is far superior in ease of use and performance.</li>
    <li> Like this Flat Iron, easy to use and leaves my hair very straight and smooth without pulling. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> so quick to heat up,!! Very clear to check the temp. via LED window&lt;br /&gt;easy to carry with, gives me sleek straight shiny hair&lt;br /&gt;Under $100 with four yrs warranty&lt;br /&gt;Love it! By the way, my hair is coarse and thick&lt;br /&gt;Asian color treated hair. will save a lot of money for&lt;br /&gt;keratin treatment wow!!</li>
    <li> Not what was expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was used several times although did not meet expectations. The unit left hair frizzy and not looking good. I did like the temperature setting but not much else.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron as a replacement to my $150 one, and for the cost I think this is a much better product. It works better on my hair leaving it smooth and silky, plus it has the swivel cord, digital display screen and automatic shut off which I love! I wish it had a wider opening like my last one, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent me from being able to style my hair quickly so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get something for My GF and this was perfect. I wanted something that looked better than everything else, but after talking to my girlfriend she said &amp;#34;it works better&amp;#34; than anything she has ever had.  I have probably only gotten my GF a few gifts she thanks me for all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GUYS!:&lt;br /&gt;You cant go wrong with the gift of beauty and health, and its worth getting something like this with a 4 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;On that note, I went to sallies Beauty to get a chi, and it was more money, and they wanted $14 bucks just for a 1 year warranty, what a ripoff for a iron that doesn&#x27;t even have digital readout etc.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron that went to 450 degrees to give my daughters keratin treatments at home to save $$$.  I purchased the same keratin treatment used by the salon (and paid $300 for the treatment at the salon), but needed the flat iron that would work.  I was afraid that a salon-quality flat iron would cost a fortune, but was pleased to find this one for under $100.  The next test was my older daughter&#x27;s hair.  I&#x27;ve NEVER seen hair so curly and soooo thick.  But, this flat iron worked really well.  Her hair was completely straight until she washed it 3 days later (a requirement of the treatment).  She plays sports and takes a PE class where they run a mile to a mile and a half twice a week.  He roots didn&#x27;t even kink up!  My only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; was that the flat iron starts to beep with a little more frequency that I think is necessary at 450 degrees.  I didn&#x27;t have that experience at 400 degrees, but at 450 degrees, it does tend to warn you a little often that it is at 450 degrees.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a security precaution, but I think it might beep a little often.  Otherwise, a REALLY great product, especially for the price!  I would absolutely recommend this product - even if your hair is VERY curly and VERY thick!</li>
    <li> I have never tried this brand of falt iron before but after reading the positive reviews on it I thought I would try it out. I am glad I did. I am very pleased with the product and it leaves my hair feeling so nice and it&#x27;s not frizzy at all. My hair looks great and stays strait all day long!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my granddaughter to replace her broken Chic and she loves this iron I know this is a first time but this was a great first impression.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using flat irons for 15 years.  This is the first one that burnt my hair.  So upset.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light, works faster, and my hair looks better than it did with my previous ceramic flat iron.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all.  I was so excited at first because I&#x27;ve  never spent a lot on a flat iron before.  So I ordered this the week before it took longer than I expected because they we&#x27;re out of stock. Finally received it today used it and in about 10 minutes of use it shut off. OK auto shut off. I tried to turn it on but it didn&#x27;t go on. Decided to wait a bit, still didn&#x27;t turn on. Plus side it did heat up fast, I like the result of hair after it was straightened even tho I didn&#x27;t thru half of my hair. Will I get another one...I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> This flat iron heated up very fast and straightened my hair instantly. I have never owned a better flat iron and it has a very nice settings display.</li>
    <li> nice flat iron. It didn&#x27;t glide like I expected but hopefully it&#x27;s just cause it&#x27;s new. Love the quick heat up as well</li>
    <li> The flat iron arrived on time. I love it! It does what it&#x27;s meant to do ;)&lt;br /&gt;It heats quickly and I like the control over the temperature setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service was great! No concerns with it. I would definitely BUY from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Fantastic flat iron! Heats up quickly and works well! I would totally recommend this to anyone who is looking for quality! I have purchased several flat irons over the years and have spent quite a bit on them. This one, by far works the best!</li>
    <li> I love it. It straightens on the first turn and you can can curl easily without burning your fingertips as long as you keep your hand on the back. All flatirons burn your hands if you try to hole the front end. Hairstylist don&#x27;t get burned though I don&#x27;t know how they do it but anyways I have course hair like yea those really tight curls like my hair is almost shoulder length and it tough water my hair shrivel up look like I got a boy haircut. So yea this a bomb flatiron. I recommend it for us black women. Got my hair looking like its relaxed. One thing I used to do though is putoil on before I flatiron to get that bone straight result. You don&#x27;t have to do that with this flatiron plus it says not too on the directions for use. It probably says that on all flatirons but hey I did what to had to do.</li>
    <li> One of the best flat irons I ever had</li>
    <li> I did my research on flat irons when I was looking to replace my old Conair Infinity.  After reading several great reviews on beauty web pages, I decided to splurge on this Onei flat iron.  I am VERY happy I did.  This is a lovely product.  It is well made, and is quite honestly much nicer than I expected.  That being said, its how it works that matters right?!!!  It straightened my long frizzy hair quickly, with generally one pass.  The plates float and this does help a great deal in making sure all the hair in the iron is straightened.  The biggest change I noticed from using this Onei iron, and my old Conair, is that my hair is soft and silky after straightening.  Truly.  I was skeptical when I read this in other reviews, but it is the case.  My hair has never looked better.  ALSO my hair remained straight for the rest of the day and then the next day as well.  Wow.  That is cool.  This is a good quality iron, for a fair price and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my second Onei flat iron (due to teenage daughter dropping my first one way to often) and I love it. It&#x27;s under lock and key now and all mine. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Had a CHI for 12 years and it finally died. Read all reviews and decided on this one. I love it!! Very sleek and easy to use, should have bought one of these sooner.</li>
    <li> Love how fast it heats up. Great if your short on time. For African American women i suggest using argan oil instead of thermal sprays. Organix for example made my hair feel hard.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my wife and daughter and they love it. Highly recommend. The iron has a temperature gauge that you can set, this is helpful for different types of hair; my wife needs the temperature lower than my daughter.</li>
    <li> I never wanted to spend much on a straightener, so I have had a $30-40 straightener that I&#x27;ve used for a while... I have thick hair, so after waiting for it to warm up, it would take quite a whole to straighten my hair. I&#x27;d even have to wait for it to heat back up a couple of times. I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend fixing my hair, so I decided to splurge on this product... I just got it, tried it out, and love it! It heats up in half of the time my other straightener does, straightened it much better, and did so in about a tenth of the time!!! Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Got sick of waking up with beadhead all the time and finally decided to invest in a hair straightener. Heats up super fast and so far I&#x27;ve managed not to burn myself (or my hair!). Digital display is a definite plus, as I can control the temp very easily and have consistent results. Only thing I&#x27;m not so happy with is that mine arrived with a few scratches, but the flat iron itself works perfectly. Great Starter flat iron and I&#x27;m seriously considering getting one of these for my friend&#x27;s graduation present...</li>
    <li> Great product.  It has an auto shut off feature and a digital display.  It heats up very quickly and easily maintains its temperature.  It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair.  So far, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Overview: I would definitely buy this product again, and will recommend it, and the seller, to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Onei MK-I Halo Ceramic Flat Iron for about a week now, and, so far, I love it. I will update this review in the future if I have any negative feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background:&lt;br /&gt;I have long, bleach blonde hair (due to the bleach it can get very dry and easily damaged with heat).&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a Forever Young Flat Iron for about 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally straight, so I use a flat iron for a smooth and sleek look, or to curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived on time and exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;The plates on this are so smooth and there is not drag or catching with use.&lt;br /&gt;I love the digital thermometer. In the instruction manual, I found it helpful that it had recommended heat settings for different types of hair. It heats up VERY quickly, and cools down fairly quickly, also.&lt;br /&gt;The 30 minute shut off can be annoying, but ultimately it is for safety and I do appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is very long (I believe 9 ft), so its perfect for moving around.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels amazing after using this. It never feels dry, and it smooths any frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it is high quality, so it hopefully will last.&lt;br /&gt;The seller (D.R.G Trading LLC) sent a follow up email, which was unexpected and very appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome. I have owned several expensive irons and this one tops them all for half the price! It flattens my hair quickly and leave it shiny and smooth with little effort. I  flat iron my hair everyday... but the first day I used this one I had a friend ask me what I did different to my hair!  She told me how great it looked.  It really does make a noticeable difference.  Best of all, it stays straight for several days without having to go over it again! It is truly amazing :) So glad I bought it and you will be too :)</li>
    <li> This flat iron is perfect in my opinion. It has a wide range of temperature choices, which makes a difference regarding hair types and controls. It heats up immediately and gets hotter than my previous drug store version. This allows my hair to get straighter with less passes through, and it stays smooth longer throughout various weather changes. I have had it for over a month and use it daily. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Like a lot of women I&#x27;m on the hunt for a great, long lasting flat iron. For the price of this one the results are just so so. I&#x27;m a black woman w/medium thickness hair that rests on my shoulders. This iron does get hot but I&#x27;ve gotten equally good results with store bought flat irons &amp; my CHI flat iron. I will say that this iron has been knocked onto the floor several times &amp; remains intact.</li>
    <li> Right off the bat, this is a new generation of flat iron for me.  Plug it in and it makes a sound.  Unlock it for it to heat up, what a Great Safety  Feature!!!!  Watch the digital display of the temperature as it heats up super fast!!!!  Very balanced and comfortable in the hand.  Do NOT hesitate to get his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be warned - it gets VERY Hot!!!  I used to set my CHI at 410 degrees, but I only need 375 on this one.</li>
    <li> My wife loves her flat Iron. The controllable settings are nice, but she basically leaves it in the main default setting (plenty hot).</li>
    <li> Works very well and is just as the description states, can use to straighten, flip or curl under and does it easily.  Heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have had it for a few weeks, but so far I have to give it 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and does the job great in very little time! My problem was that the plastic things on the outside came off due to melted glue from the heat :S</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever! This thing is awesome, my daughter&#x27;s hair natural and very coarse &amp; when I do her hair people always ask if I perm her hair. Love it &amp; u will too.</li>
    <li> I spent months thinking that my hair would just not get silky straight ( I have a fair amount of kinky curls), but when my stylist suggested I might need a new flat iron, I found this Onei. It works wonderfully! The amount of time it takes me to straighten my hair has dropped dramatically. My hair has added shine and does not pick up the humidity and does not&lt;br /&gt;become frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The auto shut off is handy if I forget to turn it off. The only negative I might add is that I have on occasion mistakenly turned it off while using it as the power button is on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I made the purchase and at a good price.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair about every day and this straightener gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST straightener I&#x27;ve EVER owned.&lt;br /&gt;I can straighten my hair and create curls and waves.&lt;br /&gt;This straightener doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or burn it.&lt;br /&gt;This product exceeded my expectations and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will surely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> This product turned on for about five minutes and then shut off completely and will not function at all. RETURNING IMMEDIATELY.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fantastic.  The adjustable heat is perfect for different hair types, it heats up quickly, and the floating blades are well made and gentle on the hair.  Because it is a thicker built flat iron, it is much better for creating waves and curls over other brands.  It also never pulls my hair like my old CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make this even better, when I was traveling internationally the power difference blew a fuse in my flat iron and it no longer heated up. Onei replaced my product, no questions asked, and shipped the replacement the same day they received mine returned.  All I needed to provide was my Amazon receipt as proof of purchase, and they honored the A to Z guarantee even though I&#x27;d never registered my product (which I will do next time).  Throughout the process their customer service department was very responsive - I never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a reply.  I am very impressed and will be an Onei customer forever!</li>
    <li> I love the size, the fact that it heats up quickly and that I am not likely to burn myself since it is really easy to maneuver.  I&#x27;ve used the CHI before and I like this better.</li>
    <li> This product arrived much sooner than it was estimated to and it was well packaged so I was very pleased with that but I am even more pleased about the product. It is accurately advertised, it actually straightens my hair - I have thick curly hair - it doesn&#x27;t leave a burnt scent in my hair, it saves me more than half the time it usually takes to straighten my hair, I love the 360 swivel cord, I love everything about it! This is what I have been looking for in a flat iron and I am very glad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> I received two emails from my wife today (I am currently out of the country):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subject: \\&quot;I LOVE!! The flat iron! :)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Why did you choose it, how did you find it? It&#x27;s the BEST!:)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subject: \\&quot;The flat iron.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It&#x27;s sooo much faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever used! Or had used on my hair:) Thank you my love!:) I love you:)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can probably tell my wife loves her new flat iron.  I had a chance to Skype with her today and for the first 30 minutes all she wanted to talk about was her new flat iron by Onei.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her top three pros:&lt;br /&gt;1 - WAY faster straightening than other flat irons she&#x27;s used in the past.  What used to take her almost 2 hours (she has a lot of hair), now only takes her about 20 minutes. \\&quot;I would feel comfortable straightening my hair before work with this. I mean, I would totally have enough time to.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- The Onei flat iron doesn&#x27;t burn her hands. Every other flat iron she&#x27;s used would get hot to the touch around the pads, or where you grip the tool.  She explained that on flat irons there are places that you have to push to clamp in on your hair.  On other flat irons the places your fingers touch would heat up and get very uncomfortable.  With the Onei flat iron the pads stayed cool enough to keep on straightening without any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - The Onei flat iron heats up fast and cools down fast.  She was really surprised at how fast the thing heated up.  She also really likes that she didn&#x27;t have to leave the iron out on the counter, where our son might be able to pull it down, because it cools down so fast.</li>
    <li> I shopped around a lot and read a lot of reviews before making a buying decision. I&#x27;ve owned other brands before (Remington, Jose Eber) but the quality wasn&#x27;t very good and they ended up burning my hair. Although I hadn&#x27;t heard of this brand, it had every feature I wanted and the price was reasonable. I finally decided to get it after seeing pictures of Onei customers on their Facebook page. I thought that was pretty neat. As for the product itself, it meets my criteria: digital, ceramic, able to flip and curl hair, non-pull plates, auto shut off, adjustable temperature and a high max temperature of 450 degrees so I can also use it for Brazilian Keratin Treatments at home. It makes a cute little chime when it&#x27;s plugged in and when the temperature is adjusted. I really think the auto shut off feature is important so if you ever get distracted it will shut off on its own. It moves very smoothly through my hair, which is exactly what I needed. The one downside is that it didn&#x27;t come with a protective case, BUT the company shipped me one for free along with a nice letter thanking me for my purchase!! Pretty impressive. I&#x27;d also prefer a large lanyard hole for hanging, but if you don&#x27;t hang your straightener it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. If you&#x27;re considering a new hair straightener I highly recommend the Onei.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist I am always looking for the perfect tools to use on my clients! I absolutely fell in LOVE with this iron from the second I turned it on! Its the perfect iron for just basic styling or amazing for Brazilian Blowouts! I think I will be sticking with this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Best Flat Iron EVER!!! I love it!! It heats up turbo fast! I had it on the highest temperature at first and had to lower it because in one run, it straightened what my CHI would do in 2-3.  I love it; the price was phenomenal!!  I would buy another one.  I hope it lasts for a long time, but for now, I just love it.  I wish it balanced better on a flat surface, scared that it will tip on its side, but hasn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve reduced my \\&quot;hair time\\&quot; and my thick long hair is silky smooth. :) THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> She showed me how rough the plates were compared to her last flat iron and I doubt these are 100% ceramic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the straightener for about a month and cannot find anything to complain about. I bought and returned three different straighteners until I finally found this one :) It heats up crazy fast and the auto off feature is nice for those of us forgetful people. I have long thick hair and this straightener makes my hair smooth, shiny and straight in one pass through. It&#x27;s awesome! Can&#x27;t speak to the longevity, but for now, it&#x27;s the best straightener I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I purchased one as a gift after doing some extensive research and looking at reviews and comparing several flat irons.  Although not 100% sure, I took the risk and purchased one for my child because we are also trying Keratin treatments.  She loves it and after I tried hers, I returned and bought one for myself because I was so happy with the results.  I love being able to set the temperature and auto off feature.  The long swivel cord is a plus also.  I only used it a couple of times and from the reviews it looks like it is to new of a product to honestly say but I hope these do last long.  We have absolutely no complaints thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> A friend of mine brought this flat iron to work for me to try.  At first I was skeptical; especially since my hair is wavy and frizzy.  I mean, what was so great about this one, I own a Chi and Hai brand!?  I must say, I truly love this flat iron.  I love how it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it heats up in seconds, and it doesn&#x27;t require me to drench my hair in flat iron serums/gels.  I can get my hair done in 10 minutes without having to go over the strands continuously.  What&#x27;s even more awesome, is that my hair doesn&#x27;t kink up during the rest of the day!  I am an avid flat iron user, and the final confirmation was when I had a few of my girlfriends ask me what brand I use!!  WINNER!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MK-1 Halo is lightweight, easy to handle, and beautiful, for starters.  I love the white color and I really love the blue digital display lighting! I like the way it sings to you when you turn it on and off.  (Not too loud, though, so I don&#x27;t worry about waking anyone up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up very quickly, and has auto shut-off - which is a must for me. I also like the fact that it reads OFF when it is off. You can easily change the temp by pressing the up or down button - the digital display goes up or down by 10 degrees. (If you hold it down, it will go up quickly and without singing to you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a fantastic job at flattening/straightening my hair in only a few quick sweeps. I was so impressed with this one that I immediately dragged my daughter and my son&#x27;s girlfriend to my bathroom to show it to them as soon as they came in the house! I think I will get one for my daughter for her bday in March - her Chi broke a couple of weeks ago, and she is still talking about getting another Chi. I think she would be happier with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Sedu, which I really liked.  However, it just didn&#x27;t heat up one day after about 1 1/2- 2 years.  It was really expensive, and I hated to use my Christmas money to buy another one not knowing how long it would last.  So I started my research, and I am THRILLED with the MK-1 Halo! There is a reason it has been consistantly rated 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The digital readout for the temperature will not read above 230 now.  I&#x27;m not sure, but I think the actual temperature does go up to 400 or above, but I hate that I don&#x27;t know how hot the iron is while I am using it. I am taking off one star for that reason, especially since I have only had it since January. I still really like this product, though.</li>
    <li> I have had a Chi for over 5 years and started to short out. I decided to try this because of the temperature settings, the price and the 2-day shipping.  It has worked really well for me and I am pleased.  I hope this lasts as long as the Chi. Only reason for 4 stars is that it does &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on my hair a little more than the Chi and the ONLY reason.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with hair irons and I hate that all the ones I have bought ended up as &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; hair tools.  A friend let me use hers a few weeks ago and I loved it and had to get my own.  This iron is just wonderful, there is no tugging, it gets very hot and works great.  Thanks Susie for the recommendation!!</li>
    <li> This is my second Onei MK-I Halo Ceramic Flat Iron. The first one lasted close to three years and still worked properly, but the black plates had fallen off both sides so I decided to order a replacement even though the reviews had become worse over the last year. This one lasted ~ less than 4 months and now turns itself off for no reason when it&#x27;s being used - I think it is a problem with the power cord as I made sure I was NOT touching the button when this was happening.  Frustrating as I can no longer return through Amazon and now will have to figure out how to deal with warranty issues.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing this flat iron.  Then I crossed my fingers and purchased.  I am soooo pleased with my purchase.  I have lots of extremely curly, fine hair that quickly becomes frizzy.  This flat iron straightens my hair perfectly.  I love it!</li>
    <li> After reading countless reviews of flat irons of various brands and price points, I decided to purchase the Onei MK-I Halo. I am so happy with my decision! I truly believe that this flat iron will last for years. I had never heard of this brand, but the glowing reviews lead me to take the plunge. This small company seems to be devoted to putting out a quality product for its customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;- Automatic shutoff. This was a must for me, as I drive myself crazy wondering whether or not I turned the flat iron off. This feature was surprisingly hard to come by, but this may be because many professional flat irons are used for extended periods of time and therefore wouldn&#x27;t want or need the iron to turn off after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly. I turn on the iron, and it&#x27;s heated and ready to go by the time I grab my hairbrush and spritz on some heat  protectant. This is great, as I usually don&#x27;t have a moment to spare in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable heat with exact temperature reading. The iron heats up to a maximum of 450 degrees, but I usually leave it on 360.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s just pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other features:&lt;br /&gt;- The cord is extremely long. This could be a benefit for some people, but I don&#x27;t really need it. Since I found myself stepping on the extra cord, I tied up the excess with a cable tie.&lt;br /&gt;- The swivel cord seems to work really well. I don&#x27;t anticipate any kinks or tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works:&lt;br /&gt;My hair is basically straight, has a mind of its own, and loves to flip out at the ends. I always thought it looked fine when I left the house, only to discover that it had morphed into a hot mess by the time I get to work. I didn&#x27;t expect a new flat iron would make a difference, but it did! I use it to straighten and smooth my shoulder-length bob. The rounded plates allow me to gently curve the ends under, and that&#x27;s exactly how they stay. My style stays sleek and shiny all day, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality:&lt;br /&gt;This plates are smooth and glide through my hair. The iron feels solid in my hand, but is not too heavy. The black plastic panel on the top tends to squeak when I press it with my thumb, but the wand seems very well crafted in spite of that. I have handled several well-known (and very expensive) flat irons in stores, and I believe that the Onei is of equal or better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase. My daughter loves it, too. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product to a friend.y:&lt;br /&gt;This plates are smooth and glide through my hair.

    <li> I bought this after doing a lot of research. It heats up VERY fast and I love that it has the auto shut off - gives me the peace of mind I didnt have with my last straightener. I would absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading rave reviews on Amazon and I now have to add my own. I absolutely LOVE the Onei and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quality flat iron. I have straight hair, but use a flat iron to reduce frizz on a daily basis. I was so happy that this straighter could handle thick hair without catching, pulling, or damaging my hair. I was amazed by how quickly it heats up (it can get to 400 degrees in just a few minutes.) But most of all, I love how this product has transformed my hair. Multiple co-workers complimented me the first day I used the Onei, specifically saying that my hair looked noticeably shinier and healthier, especially at the ends. I read one review that talked about the fact that the product beeps annoyingly, but I actually have not noticed this. I&#x27;ve only heard it make noise as it is powered on and when you change the settings. The only small criticism I have (and seriously the ONLY thing) is that the cord is very long. This actually might be helpful for some people, but in my small bathroom sometimes the cord gets in the way. But seriously, that has done very little to damper the fact that this is an AMAZING product. I am so glad I purchased it and it was worth every cent. I also liked that this product came from a small family-run business. Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this after reading the rave reviews. I was so disappointed when I received it. It is listed as smooth with virtually no pull and is just the opposite. I can&#x27;t even pull it through my hair without it snagging and pulling it. I also have to go over the hair multiple times to achieve the same results of my old generic Chi which was wearing out. I&#x27;m returning it. Now I don&#x27;t believe the reviews for the item are real as I can&#x27;t have been the only one who had this problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for one of her birthday gifts. Cause the chi was driving her crazy cause the lack of not knowing the temp among other things. This one heats up really fast. She does her hair at 370 and it was ready to go within a few minutes. It normally takes her about an 1:15 minutes to straighten her hair. (She has pretty thick hair). With this it took her less than 20. I was amazed. She has no complaints and says this was the best she has used.</li>
    <li> Really angry about this, I bought it in April and now literally only one side of the flat iron works. It has not even been 6 months. I have never had a straightener die in less than 18 months. It was great, but just 10 days ago stopped working on one side.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and plates glide smoothly through hair. I love the temperature options because it allows you to use less heat, which means less damage. I&#x27;m a natural African American woman with 4c type hair. I used 350 degree heat.</li>
    <li> Warning!!! If you buy one of these then you might buy three. Because every woman in your life will want one!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my daughter and have to listen to her &amp;#34;ooooh&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;aaaaah&amp;#34; over it every morning as she prepares for school. The bottom line is that I was skeptical spending money on an item like this. But my daughter told me how great it would be..... &amp;#34;But Dad, you just don&#x27;t understand, you&#x27;re a man&amp;#34;. And over the past week she has straightened, curled, flipped, flopped, swirled and done things with it that are amazing. So, I was wrong. She was right. She gets the results she wants and feels good about the way she looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that it seems that it would be difficult to burn yourself, it&#x27;s easy to set the temp and has an automatic shut-off. Very user friendly. Good stuff. No regrets. This seems like a quality product that does precisely what it said it would. And more. There is no better testimonial for a product than a happy user. And you&#x27;ve got them on this sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now my wife wants one.... And I&#x27;m sure that soon enough my mother-in-law will as well.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course, naturally wavy hair that goes full out frizzy in humid weather.  This flat iron smooths and flattens my shoulder length hair quickly.  I use the 400 temp on my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought  this for my girlfriend as a gift and she finds this flat iron to work really well!&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the other ones she has, this one does the job well by making her hair straight with minimal hair dryness.&lt;br /&gt;It works so well that her sister is also getting one!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is amazing. I hate when I have to always buy new ones because they break. The halo flat iron is extremely durable and I definitely recommend this flat iron for everyone who needs one</li>
    <li> Purchased this iron to use after figuring out that my old iron wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough and I needed one that reached closer to 400 degrees.  This has been great and since it was less expensive than other high end brands, I a very happy with it.  I like having the ability to select a temperature and how it shuts off when not in use.  The only warning is that it gets VERY HOT and can almost burn your skin if it touches it.  I would easily buy it again.</li>
    <li> I read TONS of reviews before making my purchase, and decided to buy the Onei MK-1. I&#x27;m very glad I did. As a Black woman, I&#x27;m skeptical of any hair product that makes bold claims about how well it can straighten my hair. I&#x27;m glad I did my research, because this flat iron does straighten my hair remarkably well - VERY little pull with one pass straightening. I simply cannot get that result with cheaper straighteners. The results last 2-3 days, depending on my activity level and the weather. My favorite feature is the automatic shut off, which adds a level of safety to using it in a house with two infants. The generous warranty tipped my decision to buy the Onei, and so far I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron!  My daughter uses it every day, heats up fast, with auto shut off! No more worries.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  it runs through my hair smoothly and really calms the fly-aways seen a lot during the winter.  i love the auto shut off option.  it is great for a busy mom of a busy boy.</li>
    <li> This straightener is marvelous! It&#x27;s about 1/3 the size of my old Remington that crapped out on me, and It glides effortlessly over my hair. I have quite possibly some of the angriest blonde hair in the world, it&#x27;s extremely thick and takes an hour to straighten with other irons. This flat iron achieves it in 30-45 minutes for me, depending on if you are a perfectionist or not too. Doesn&#x27;t seem to fry my hair; it leaves it very smooth. I chose not to buy a CHI or another more well known product after seeing that some manufacturers distribute fakes. I chose this model on a whim and it couldn&#x27;t be better. My friends love &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it. It arrived an extra day early too!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly - very, VERY quickly - and gives great results. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with my hair getting caught in it, which has happened with cheaper straighteners. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> last year, i damaged my naturally curly hair with a flat iron. so I decided to get a perm to keep from damaging it further. after a few months, I decided I would try to straighten my hair. it was ok. not the straightest and pretty frizzy. I decided to get a new straightener and that was a piece of junk. I couldn&#x27;t even get halfway through straightening it before I would give up and go curly. my stylist told me before that chi was really good. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money. I came across this one and the reviews were awesome, so I decided to buy myself a mother&#x27;s day present. I am so glad I did. this straightener is awesome. with the perm in my hair, I have never had to heat it up past 380 degrees. now that is saying something. a week before I bought this, I got my hair trimmed and my stylist asked if I wanted it straight. I said, yeah! so she did (she had a different brand) and I asked what heat setting she had it on. she said 410. I was kind of shocked cause I didn&#x27;t want my hair damaged again. my hair turned out great and that&#x27;s when I decided to look for one of my own. I was very hesitant to spend that much on one, but after reading the reviews I knew this was the one to try. so glad I did. this flat iron leaves my hair so soft and smooth and straight! I have never had an iron this good. a lot of people commented that there was an annoying noise, but mine does not make a noise at all. it heats up in like 10 to 15 seconds. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this flat iron. it is definitely worth the investment! and It shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this flat iron just to do Keratin treatments at home as it goes to the recommended hear setting of 450 degrees but will use it exclusively as it does have a digital temperature control which I love as you can lock it in place. AND it turns itself off after about 20 minutes I think, so no more driving back home as I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; I may have left it on!</li>
    <li> ONE WEEK AND IT CAUGHT ON FIRE!!! RUINED MY MARBLE COUNTERTOP. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT, UNLESS YOU WANT TO BURN DOWN YOUR HOUSE.</li>
    <li> I have owned several different brands of flat irons for years as I have long hair and it&#x27;s a quick hairstyle for a mom of two. Out of all the ones I have tried I LOVE my Onei Flat Iron. It&#x27;s design is fantastic and even when I leave it on to long it won&#x27;t burn my bathroom countertops! (can you tell that has happened to me in the past!) My husband bought me this one because I was so upset about the last one burning my countertops! BUT, more than anything I love the product and the way it makes my hair look and feel!!! Great buy!</li>
    <li> It lasted 1 day and quit working so embarrassing I gave it as a gift and could not find the receipt for a return</li>
    <li> It worked great, but then it suddenly wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore after around 2 months of using it. I didn&#x27;t drop it or abuse it any sort of way, and I only straightened my hair a few times a week. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Other straighteners I&#x27;ve had lasted a lot longer than this one.</li>
    <li> Thank you Onei for this awesome flat iron!!!  I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am to have chosen this flat iron.  This flat iron heats up really quickly and leaves my hair soft, shiny, silky smooth and straighten perfectly.  It leaves my hair straighten for days.  The temperature setting option is a great thing to have on a flat iron &amp; it has always worked wonderfully.  I only have to use 340 degrees setting and it works amazingly on my long and jet black hair.  It was a good price for the quality that it provides.  I have used over $200 flat irons in the past but nothing is compared to Onei flat iron.  I absolutely love this flat iron, and even bought two for my close friends.</li>
    <li> My puppy chewed the chord of my 5 year old Ozon Titanium, and they don&#x27;t seem to sell them anymore, so I bought this. It straightens my thick, long, frizzy, wazy/curly hair pretty well, but made my hair smell like it was fried...VERY strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another reason I bought it was because it said it had floating plates so I could curl my hair. I pretty much curl it every day, since it takes less time than straightening. But this thing is sooooo thick and square, it is impossible to curl anything.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!!!  I WAS A MODEL IN MY YOUNGER YEARS &amp; BEAUTY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF MY LIFE.  I GO THRU STYLING TOOLS &amp; AM ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED UNTIL THIS ONEI FLAT IRON.  I&#x27;VE HAS IT FOR MONTHS &amp; IT&#x27;S STILL GREAT AND WORKS PERFECT EVERYDAY.  SIMPLY THE BEST!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this Flat Iron.  I have used many in the past but this is definitely worth the money!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This item seemed a bit low quality in design. It snagged my hair and the plastic on the outside was jagged.</li>
    <li> Ok, this has been put to the test by my 17 year old daughter since June 14 when it was purchased.  three months of rigourous daily usage.  My daughter is, how can I say, Spoiled so she has had had some of the best flat iron brands on the market today.  So when she told me it is the best iron she has ever had it meant something to me.  I paid about half the price of a couple others that only worked right till out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says it heats up very quickly and had well distributed heat along both iron plates. She also stated she has noticed that it takes about half the time to do her hair and that she has less split ends than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come into her bathroom after work and found the iron still plugged in but that the auto off functioned worked as designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great iron at a fraction of what it costs on other sites.  I am now a Onei believer and plan to buy her a blow dryer and my wife a iron when here GHD dies.</li>
    <li> I am African American and my hair is not chemically processed (kinky texture) this flat iron works miracles without causing any heat damage. Plus my hair doesn&#x27;t have that burn odor it does with other popular flat irons.</li>
    <li> My wife got it as a gift from her friend&lt;br /&gt;She likes how it heats up really quick and works well with her straight hair&lt;br /&gt;Silk smooth&lt;br /&gt;Def a  high quality product&lt;br /&gt;Recommended -</li>
    <li> Better than my old one and half the price!&lt;br /&gt;Received first one as a gift and now am buying to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought my girlfriend the \\&quot;Flat Iron\\&quot; for her birthday. She use to pay big bucks for salons to straighten her hair and now she does it herself at home. We both travel most of the year for our work as yoga instructors. It&#x27;s not dual voltage so we have a converter for other countries. This Flat Iron is convenient, compact and has made things easier while saving us money. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener...Leaves my hair silky &amp; smooth-my hair is naturally frizzy and curly.  It takes me half the time it usually does to do my hair.  Would definitely recommend to anyone!!! Thanks D.R.G. Trading!!!</li>
    <li> As a individual with thick, naturally wavy hair I have been on the look out for a straightener for years.  I have tried every brand and they took hours to get my hair straight, even after blow drying it.  The product heats up quick and is able to get my hair silky smooth in a matter of minutes.  The quality is top notch.  The shipping was quick and came before the estimated date.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using a flat iron because of the thickness and texture of my hair.  However after my most recent haircut, the stylist encouraged me to shop for a high quality iron with digital temperature control.  She told me I would need a high setting to manage my hair and gave me a couple of tips.  I read reviews on Amazon for a few products and selected this one.  It has not disappointed - it heats up very quickly and is easy to use.  I can style my hair in much less time than I expected.  I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Onei MK-I Halo Ceramic Flat Iron and am very satisfied. The plates are super smooth, it heats up very quickly, and makes my hair silky smooth! It can curl my hair and straighten with one run through. I love that you can also set the heat control. This is the best flat iron ever!</li>
    <li> It heats up fast but it doesn&#x27;t clamp down evenly and hence just doesn&#x27;t flat iron hair evenly.  It was frustrating to work with, especially if you are trying to hurry in the morning.  Had to return.</li>
    <li> As always when making a commitment to replace an existing (which was a Chi) much used hair tool it&#x27;s always hard to part with the one you already have.  My reason for replacing my old flat iron was because it was out of date.  I opted for the MK- Halo because of it&#x27;s build; embracing new technology in addition, I have taken to having keratin treatments on a more regular basis so I needed something that would enhance them to the fullest.  This flat iron covers all of those perquisites exceptionally.  Initially I thought it was rather chunky but then once I reaslied the reason is to protect the user from the intense heat near the skin I understood the design better.  It heats up quickly, is easy to maneuver over short or long hair.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and would most certainly recommend it to any one who is looking to update their existing hair tool.  Do remember, all new tools take a while to get used to--particularly when you are accustomed to a different brand and build yet to all intents and purposes this is perfect.</li>
    <li> awesome heats up fast and love the fact it shuts off and wont stay on all day if i forget to turn it off</li>
    <li> My hair is straight but still out of control. I have used other straighteners to soften the ends and take out much of the volume (my hair is thick). With this straightener my hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I wish that the iron opened just a little wider. Other than that, I love this iron. I have thick wavy hair and I can straighten my hair one day and only need minimal touch ups for up to two days later. It heats very quickly and I love the digital screen. Fabulous!</li>
    <li> Well, it came in a few days ago, and at first I was happy with it. I do like that it heats up very quickly. It would have been great if it came with heat resistance gloves, but thats ok. What I absolutely hate, is the NOISE that it makes, every few minutes!! It drives me insane. A email to customer service later, basically told me that it was a &amp;#34;CHIME&amp;#34; that most customers like. I am not one of them. Once the noise starts, you have to press the lock button to stop the noise. Once oe twice might be ok, but no..... You have to keep pressing the button seems like every 2 minutes. My daughter has naturally curly wavy hair that is very thick. Constant pressing of that button (not to mention that it scares both of us crazy) takes unnecessary extra time. I don&#x27;t know if it will shut off if you ignore the noise. What I also do not like is nowhere in anything it comes with, does it mention the noise. But as far as the flat iron goes, so far so good....</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  The first one I got the LCD didn&#x27;t light up. I contacted the seller and they responsed very quickly.  They sent me a new one right away and the new one works perfectly.  I was very impressed with the seller and give them the highest recommendation possible!  The iron is good quality. It doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out as others have in the past, and I really like the auto shut off after 30 min, it gives me piece of mind.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my wife because her chi broke on her. She has not been disappointed. The digital display and auto shut off features great and so far she loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awsome ,but the only problem is with the voltage is 110 and it&#x27;s rare in our country we use220 voltage</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron but it melted through it&#x27;s side panel within the first few months of owning it. Gets the job done and has a great temp control range. May contact Amazon about replacing it since it has a guarantee but unsure if that covers the meltage.</li>
    <li> I have always used CHI flatirons and loved them, so I was hesitant to purchase.  The results of using this iron are the same if not better than using the CHI.  I DO NOT heat to 450 degrees.  This will fry your hair!  I repeat... do not heat to 450!  I set it on 390.  I have VERY thick hair and this flattens to perfection.  Edited to add:  Do not purchase this product.  One of the heating plates stopped working and the company will not honor their return policy or return emails.  It&#x27;s useless now.  I never had this problem with a CHI product.</li>
    <li> Cant wait to use it, looks even nicer than pictured!! Super excited!! Will post more after I use it!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews prior to purchasing this flat iron, but it didn&#x27;t work for my thin hair, I was so excited the first day I got it and I tried it right away, my hair looked ok because I had already used the flat iron I have in the morning, second time I was in a hurry so I didnt do it properly and I thought maybe because of that,  so after using it 3 times I gave up and I am retruning it, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it&#x27;s braking my hair, like frying it without strainghting it, this flat iron is expensive and is not worth what you pay for. so don&#x27;t waste your time and money in ordering it.</li>
    <li> I have the most stubborn hair ever !!!! Half the time I wear a hat! I have 4 flat irons sitting in my bathroom drawer ! This one straightened out my hair instantly ! It heated up before I could pick my clothes out of the dryer ! Best birthday gift a busy college girl could ask for !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps love the display&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aka ms sanchez</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great! I went from a chi to this and definitely do not regret it. It heats up quickly, and for the price is worth it .</li>
    <li> It suck having to write a bad review seeing I only used it once,but it damaged my hair and does straight at all. Left my hair with clumpy ends. The lock system is a down fall.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Farouk Chi Flat Iron (original) for several years now (the same one). But, recently noticed that it may be time to replace it. So, I did some research thinking I was going to buy another but found out the reviews on the Chi&#x27;s made now may not be a &#x27;true&#x27; Chi. So, I kept researching and settled on the Onei simply because it has a 4-year warranty. (Chi has come down from a 4-year to 1-year warranty.) The Onei flat iron delivers. I am not disappointed with my purchase at all. It does as fine a job as my original Chi and I will definitely purchase again, so long as the 4-year warranty remains. Also, buying through Amazon, it came at a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for about a month now.  I have fine hair and use it at 360 degrees.  I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all like the CHIs do, but I&#x27;ve never met a CHI I liked.  It heats up really fast and cools down fast too.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is since it has an automatic shut off sometimes it turns itself off before I get around to using it if I decide to put on my make up first or something.  Other than that it&#x27;s a great iron.  I had 2 HerStyler irons before this one.  I definitely like this one better and you can&#x27;t beat the price and warranty.  I was torn between the onei and a paul mitchell iron.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife months after her cheap straightener broke.  It had the best reviews for the money on Amazon, and apparently the reviews can be trusted.  She loves it and I think her hair looks great. You can get a straightener for a fraction of the price but this seems to be worth the extra money for sure.</li>
    <li> wish it had a beeper to let you know it has reached the temp you want, that&#x27;s the reason I dropped it a star, but I love the placement of the on/off switch and the temp button. very easy to read, easy to set, easy to use. the buttons are on the side, so you don&#x27;t have to slide your fingers underneath the blades to set things, a design I always thought was a little like playing with fire ;)&lt;br /&gt;nice feel, not flimsy at all, and an elegant design. very smooth ceramic plates, so your hair glides through.</li>
    <li> Worked for two days then quit.</li>
    <li> My daughters are extremely finniky about their hair products.  I was quite hesitant to purchase an iron that was unknown to me - and them.  I read the reviews and specs and took a chance on this iron as an extra Christmas - something for each of them.  Both love the iron!  It heats quickly and glides smoothly through the hair leaving it beautifully shiny and straight.  Both have long hair - one wavy, and the other a bit curly and coarse.  This iron works equally well on both types.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after looking through many of the reviews. My last iron of a few years was a chi. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on one day. This flat iron is pretty cool. The digital temperature gauge is great. I have thick and frizzy hair. I usually have a keratin treatment but am currently needing one. My hair looked so good after the first few days of using it several people commented. Including my sister asking me if I had gotten a keratin treatment. The seller was great. Order came on time and in good condition. They also emailed me to make sure I was satisfied. Customer service was without a doubt wonderful. Hope you are as happy as I am.  Yes, it might be on the higher end price point. But sometimes good quality is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Love this flat Iorn. Heats up really well and does a great job of smoothing my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service as well.</li>
    <li> this is a product we researched and chose due to quality reviews.  very sturdy looking - it is for my daughter and she should be coming by to pick up and use within the week.  she has very high expectations, and will let me know what she thinks once she uses it.  i will update at that time.</li>
    <li> Flat iron works beautifully. I had to experiment with temperature settings. Do not start out on hottest setting. That is for keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Gets very hot, very fast and straightens my thick, frizzy hair faster than any device I have ever used. Love it!</li>
    <li> Product works great! I have frizzy hair and this help smooths everything and looks straight. It gets hot very fast so there is no slow down when getting ready in a rush. No seriously, I was surprised how quick it warmed up. The only reason I knocked it a star is the price. I have had one that was cheaper and gets to 460 degrees so it worked just as well. It didn&#x27;t warm up as fast by far but was only 20 bucks so worth the wait. I had it for so many years that it finally crapped out on me so I bought this as a replacement. Like I said, it is a great product and works very well with my crazy hair. If there is anything else I would complain about it is the shape of the paddles. They are a little bulky and square shaped for my taste but still an excellent product and well deserves the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> It did not turn on after only two weeks of receiving it</li>
    <li> Perfect flat iron. Heats super fast and gets the job done in less than an hour. I have really long mixed/biracial hair. So my hair is thick and curly. This flat iron straightens my hair in less than an hour! I absolutely love it and the price is awesome for what it can do. I used to go to DryBar and pay $40 per blowout. Now I can do my own hair in less time while spending no money! I think this flat iron is a must have. It has multiple heat settings for all hair types, its just wonderful.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of getting my hair straight, but it snags my fine hair.  It may be better for someone with thick strands of hair. It also seems bulkier than my last few irons.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever used.  Straightens the hair in half the time while leaving my hair looking healthy and shiny!  Truly an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I used this on my fine extremely kinky collar bone length hair (when straight - 2&amp;#34; when kinky) with the Palmers Keratin treatment. This was my second attempt with the Palmers product I bought at walmart. The first time I used my Conair Flat iron that only goes up to 28 I have no clue what that means, but my hair didn&#x27;t really look straight and certainly didn&#x27;t stay semi straight for more than 1/2 day. Because of all the rave reviews and the &amp;#34;keratin treatment&amp;#34; sales pitch I decided to invest in this item and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your supposed to run the flat iron over your hair 5-7 times to seal the keratin in but my hair is so fine 2 times was more than enough and my hair stayed bone straight from root to end for 5 days! I washed it out last night and strand twisted it because I want to give it a rest. Before heating it up again this weekend. I love my wearing my hair in a curly afro as well as wearing it straight every now and then.  This helps me to be a flexible as I want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW for those who are worried about heat damage I used the recommended keratin friendly shampoo this time and could notice my ends (where I concentrated the product on ) stayed straight. The last time my hair went right back to its kinky state because I used the motions CPR then the CPR shampoo to get all of the product out.  I&#x27;ll do a follow up a few weeks from now when I use the sulpher shampoos again to totally get this product out of my hair until then I cant say whether or not there&#x27;s heat damage but I highly doubt it because my hair was straight from root to end and only the areas where the product was concentrated appear straight.</li>
    <li> I needed a new flat iron and I am glad I picked this one. I love the fact that I can set the temp and the cord is so long. I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with the Onei MK-Halo Ceramic Flat Iron.  It heats up to 350 degrees very quickly and then allows you to increase the heat to 450 degrees.  The flatiron easily glides through my hair and leaves it shiny and straight.  Last, but certainly not least, the auto-off feature is a God-send.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I used to get to work wondering whether I left my curlingflat iron on.  No more.  I know that if i was forgetful, the Halo will shut itself off in 30 minutes.  Excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this beauty 2 weeks ago, all the experience has been great I received it  next day even though I paid for a second day service, and the most amazing thing is to straight my hair so quickly (about 20 min.) since my hair is so big curly and thick it was so hard to straighten fast and keep it long lasting ,it usually took  me about 40 min. But Onei now makes my life easy and leaves my hair beautiful and shiny so different comparing it to my last Chi tool. It also heats up really fast and you can totally control temperatures. I am happy to say I can&#x27;t regreat  my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had an older one that I just loved (different brand), but I dropped it and it came apart. I bought this one because it was a lower price than the one I had originally and because it had a better rating. I have to say that I just love it. It handles very nicely, I feel like I have greater control over the heat because it is digital instead of a dial. I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone looking to purchase one.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair so to straighten it I use a blow dryer and round brush, then a flat iron to really “flatten” and polish.  This iron is working great, much better than my old one (from Sally Beauty Supply).  The plates heat very quickly and evenly, and the digital temperature readout is a very nice feature (and one I was looking for).  The beveled edges on the plates let me put a little curl in my hair if I want that shaping.  Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had at least four other flat irons.  This one is by far the best.  I love that there is zero pulling on my hair when I use it.</li>
    <li> My hair gets so straight with this! It gets extremely hot, so you have to do fast strokes, or your hair starts to smell like  it&#x27;s burning.  It does only take half the time to straighten  unlike the other flat irons I have used.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it - score one for team Amazon reviews.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and have tried many flat irons over the years. The ones that did actually work always burned my hair. This flat iron not only straightens easily and thoroughly without burning or damaging my hair, but my hair stays straight even in the humid climate I live in. I used to have to spend at least 30 minutes drying my hair with a round brush before using a flat iron, only to have it curl up in humid or rainy weather. Now I don&#x27;t even have to dry it straight first, I can go from wavy to straight in no time. The only negative is that it does occasionally snag my hair, but I highly recommend it as a great product!</li>
    <li> I have recently used the whole line and wow! I am so impressed! The brushes worked so well and the flat iron smoothed and straightened my hair in under a minute!</li>
    <li> Shipping is fast. The product beat the Amazon expected delivery date. I have purchased 4 flat irons the past 3 years and this is by far the BEST!!!  The difficulty I have with my hair is it&#x27;s thick and frizzy curls. This product is amazing. I set the temp to 410 degrees and my hair is flat and SHINY. The plates are rounded so I can even add curls. The iron is very easy to use and I like the swivel cord so it never tangles, great finger grips so the iron is not slippery. A great product. I checked other on-line stores and Amazon is the cheapest I could find at the time.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is so is so amazing! I am a Hair Stylist and have been for 33 years. This Flat iron DOES make your hair soft and silky. I have thick curly hair and can get the most silky hair  that has a beautiful swing to it.. I use it at work and not only does it make your hair soft, silky and beautiful, I can provide a flat iron service in half the time. Because of the drastic change in my hair I am providing more flat iron services. I highly recommend this Flat iron to everyone. You will love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because of the great reviews here on Amazon, and I am so, so pleased with it! I had been borrowing my daughter&#x27;s Chi after my flat iron broke, and I liked her Chi a lot. But after reading the reviews here, I decided to go with this Onei flat iron instead because of the price, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This is comparable to my daughter&#x27;s Chi, only this is better because you can adjust the temperature and it has the automatic 30 minute shut off! (My daughter has called me from the school bus several times to ask me to make sure that her Chi is off.)  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Good iron for the price.  Works well and heats up fast.  I gave it 4 stars because the handle gets a little warm.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. I started using a flatiron 2 years ago and had purchased a mid-grade Revlon model. Since I use it daily, I wanted to purchase a better one in hopes of better results (faster, higher temperature and a smoother finish to my hair). The only thing this delivered is the first thing--it heats up faster. Other than that, my $40 Revlon one gives a better end result. I am thinking of returning it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a flat iron that would leave my hair looking and feeling the way it does when my hairdresser styles it. After many different brands (ceramic, variable temperature, etc.) I thought my only option was a professional one. After reading the reviews for the Onei MK-I, I decided to take a chance on it. I have shoulder-length, frizzy hair, that even with periodic thinning looks like Roseanne Rosannadanna&#x27;s hair. Ordinary straighteners tame it, but not enough. This one does as good a job as my hairdresser&#x27;s professional one! My hair feels smooth and soft and stays manageable until I wash it again. It has even stayed smooth during hot, humid, summer days! I just used it as a normal straightener, not for the Brazilian Keratin treatment. This is the best flat iron ever!</li>
    <li> Love this Straightener! I have had it for about a year now and have not had problems! It heats up super fast, maintains its temperature and the plates haven&#x27;t chipped or anything. My only complaint is the long cord which is a plus for others but mine just stays in my bathroom so the cord ends up coiled in the floor which is mildly unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron as I can easily see the heat adjustments and regulate it because I have the keratin treatment. I find 350 about right. I will experiment with it each time I use it</li>
    <li> Great product. It works just like promised. Heats quickly and has an auto turnoff. Highly recommended for any hair type.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Flat iron after using my daughters really expensive one, i was a little apprehensive about burning my hair with a cheaper product but was very happy to receive this great product! Works just as well if not better than my daughters which she paid much more for. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use a hot iron every time I wash my hair.  Of the Chi&#x27;s and other varieties I have owned, this is my favorite.  I can&#x27;t really tell the difference in the way it irons (from the other brands), but it warms up super fast and shows the temperature digitally.</li>
    <li> I was using another hair iron for awhile before I found this Onei Mk-l Halo Ceramic Flat Iron for my hair!  My hair comes out so smooth and it looks so much better than before...  Thankfully...now ..when I iron my hair ..it looks like I had it professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is highley recommended if you have especially wavey hair and want a nice smooth look...  Buy this product...you won&#x27;t be sorry!  I ordered it and it came so quickly to my home and I just love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda&lt;br /&gt;RI</li>
    <li> I purchases this flat iron after my Chi finally died :(&lt;br /&gt;Works just as well as my Chi. Heats up quickly. Plus it has the automatic shutoff which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had if for a few months now with no problems.</li>
    <li> I have used FHI irons for years.  They were great.  This one is amazing! For whatever reason I broke away from my FHI and went with something new and I am blown away at the improvement in how my hair turns  out with this product.  My hair retains its full appearance after using it - it doesn&#x27;t get all flatened down.  I have baby fine hair, so this has always been a challenge for me. Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome ! We use it in our salon and it leaves everyones hair so sleek and shiny ! Clients are always asking what kind of flat iron it is and we always highly recommend it to them !!!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron. It heats in few second and it&#x27;s easy to use without tangles.  It&#x27;s light and the result is awesome.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Stainless steel flat iron for years.&lt;br /&gt;It was drying our mine and especially my daughters hair.&lt;br /&gt;I saw all the reviews on this flat iron, and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;ITS AWESOME!! I especially love how you can see the temperature!&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair so I use it at 300 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;Shiny, straight hair! Truly awesome!&lt;br /&gt;As long as you use it at the correct temp for your hair (Guide in the box)&lt;br /&gt;You will LOVE the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pssst,,,,takes about 8 minutes to straighten my daughters hair:)</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it.  best flat iron ever</li>
    <li> I thought that I liked it except for this morning it quite working! It only stays on when I am holding so the plates are touching! When I open to use it shuts off!  So sad because it was highly recommended by my hairdresser! Now what do I do???  :-(</li>
    <li> Well, I year later, I&#x27;m here to say this great flat iron stopped heating today in any chosen degrees except &#x27;warm&#x27; which means it didn&#x27;t matter what degrees I set it on, warm does not get the job done. It wasn&#x27;t a cheapie. Totally disappointing, I used it once a week for 30 minutes (and a $20 curling iron other days,,which 5 years old and still heating fine).  I don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;re suppose to last. Maybe that&#x27;s normal. I took good care of it, never over heated it or used the high temperatures. Once Great but now gone!</li>
    <li> Works great! Well made. Nice display, gets hot quick.</li>
    <li> As an entertainer, my hair NEEDS to look great. Mission accomplished with this flat iron, minus the need to re-do my hair several times throughout my work shift. I only had to do it once and it lasted until my hair got washed. Since  my hair is very thick, curly and long, I usually have to iron it several times to keep it looking neat and I used to be concerned about damaging my hair with the constant use of irons-not anymore. And it looks shiny and feels so soft. I had tried several other flat irons before, never as pleased as with this one. Great!</li>
    <li> Just received my first Onei MK-I Halo Ceramic Flat Iron and noticed that the flat iron is shorting every time the flat iron is rotated - making an electrical crackling noise at the base where the handle and the wire connect, which shuts the flat iron off. DANGEROUS! Returning immediately.</li>
    <li> Sucks.....shuts off continuously.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My daughter loves it&lt;br /&gt;And uses it daily</li>
    <li> I have very thin, color treated hair.  So, an iron with temperature settings is a must.  I&#x27;m able to set the temp at 310° so I don&#x27;t damage my hair.  Also, it slides down my hair without catching, unlike my old iron.  I recommend this iron.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only had my flat iron one day, I could not be happier. I used it yesterday and my hair this morning is still shiny and straight! It heats up faster than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve had and leaves hair as shiny as those commercials -about hair products- you see on TV. It might be too soon to review this product, but I&#x27;m so happy with the results that I could not wait...</li>
    <li> I Have very curly hair and I am very use to use flat irons, I had a chii fore over 5 years and it worked much better than this one. This iron does not open wide enough and my hair get kind of stock on the plates. It loos very modern and nice but is just ok.</li>
    <li> I love how fast it takes to heat up, and that I can actually WATCH it heat as the temp climbs! And when I&#x27;m straightening it&#x27;s such a pain when I press buttons and accidentally turn off my straightener or change the heat, but with this flat-iron I can \\&quot;lock\\&quot; it and don&#x27;t have to worry about that again! When I style pieces of hair continuously, my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel fried after words either. My guy roomie even uses it!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after reading online reviews.  I&#x27;ve had it for just one week and I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments on my hair.  I&#x27;ve never felt my hair swing before!  My husband thought I was using different &amp;#34;products&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m not even putting ANY products in my hair.  The flatiron heats up in seconds, is comfortable in my hand, and straightens my coarse, curly, extremely thick hair in half the time that it took me before.  It also gets it straighter than any iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  Even humidity doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my hair after I use this iron.  It&#x27;s truly miraculous!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron for smoothing unruly hair without damaging it, which is key for my fine, frizzy locks. High shine too. I recommend this product to anyone. In addition, this company&#x27;s after sales care (ensuring that I was happy with the product and offering a direct phone line for any questions that I might have) is excellent.</li>
    <li> The cord is super long! It flattens the hair with just one pass. It leaves it shimy and bouncy. I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered as a gift for my daughter. She said, &amp;#34;I love it!  It heats quickly, is not hot on outside edges, so I don&#x27;t burn my fingers. It does an amazing job. It is the best ever. &amp;#34;. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron like around 2 months ago and I just had a chance to use it (busy schedule) on my 13 yr old daughter. We both loved it, I bought her straightening shampoo, conditioner, and oil to protect her hair and I totally loved the results! My daughter has a lot hair and very thick hair and it didn&#x27;t take a long time to straight out her hair not only that but it left it soft and silky and to top it off, it didn&#x27;t turn frizzy. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely coarse, thick and curly and this flat iron really gets it straight! I&#x27;m very happy I gave this a shot.</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast which was great since my last flat iron died a horrible death.  I had the last one for 6 years so didn&#x27;t know what to buy.  I found the reviews mixed on this product but everyone who said they had a problem said the company was great to deal with if there was one so I chose this flatiron even though it was more $$.  So far so good.  I find it heats up quickly and is a good temperature and the bonus is that it is much lighter weight than my old one.  There is a warranty card I will mail in just in case but if I had to I would buy it again and from this seller as well for the prompt service.</li>
