      <li>Great mascara!!</li>
      <li>Awesome product for the price</li>
      <li>but the brush isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
      <li>I also did some research on the ingredients and they aren&#x27;t very good for ur eyes...</li>
      <li>This product was a very good price, and it even does wonders on a persons eyelashes.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>Italy\\&quot; and about the amazing price!</li>
      <li>Thank you, Jordana for your amazing mascara!</li>
      <li>But most importantly I&#x27;m into getting the best of the best!</li>
      <li>(which is what a good mascara is supposed to do).</li>
      <li>and it seemed good.</li>
      <li>I had heard a lot of good things about the Jordana mascara, but just could not imagine that a $3 mascara would work for me.</li>
      <li>I bought this mascara because of the majority of the reviews were good.</li>
      <li>So I guess it could be a good layering</li>
      <li>I was delighted to see it&#x27;s carried at the drugstore if I ever need to buy in a pinch.  </li>
      <li>I had always heard good things about Jordana mascara</li>
      <li>Shipping was good and the condition was good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get my hopes up after reading the great reviews and beauty blog posts about this mascara, because it just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>great love it thank you</li>
      <li>It is very good mascara and an excellent low price.</li>
      <li>Too many chemicals!</li>
      <li>Love this mascara!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve try so many mascaras!</li>
      <li>I have tried many mascaras before but nothing can beat this one!</li>
      <li>I like this better than any mascara I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;ve bought a lot!  </li>
      <li>sooooo glad I did!</li>
      <li>Her eyelashes looked amazing.</li>
      <li>IT IS TRUELY AMAZING .</li>
      <li>so for that, I am giving it a nice 4 star.</li>
      <li>I suggest shelling out an extra dollar or two for Maybelline Great lash mascara, which is the best drugstore brand mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t honestly see the hype.</li>
      <li>I heard so many good things about this.</li>
      <li>no clumps and nice  coverage..</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t have as good of an experience as most of the reviews here.</li>
      <li>I have to say, if you apply 3-4 layers nicely, it does stay on....</li>
      <li>It washes off nice, doesn&#x27;t pull out any lashes while getting it off either.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to live with because it&#x27;s cheap and is an excellent mascara.  </li>
      <li>What a wonderful surprise that this mascara is not only as good as all the high-end products I have tried, but it is even better than most of them!  </li>
      <li>Better than the top ranked mascaras!  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>When I wore Maybelline, sometimes I felt like my eyes got irritated, so I think Jordana is more on the safe side when it comes to my brown eyes.</li>
      <li>If you put on to many coats it will smear.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is inexpensive and I liked it, if you apply a light coat.</li>
      <li>and it was very inexpensive, those are all great.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I even noticed that while wearing this more of my eyelashes fell out maybe because of the dryness of it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again.</li>
      <li>I am hoping that this is not a sign of it being discontinued because I&#x27;ve enjoyed the $$ savings.</li>
      <li>this stuff is like magic</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mascara.</li>
      <li>Plus its really cheap! :)</li>
      <li>It has a much better brush and you won&#x27;t be dealing with these clumping headaches.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite drugstore mascara.</li>
      <li>Better than any brand I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I could not ask for more.  </li>
      <li>I picked up mine at Walgreens for about  $4; they had several mascara by Jordana, but this was the cheapest (and also the best reviewed on MUA), so this was the one</li>
      <li>The formula itself seems okay:</li>
      <li>but to be on the safe side, I stopped using this mascara</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for the price.  </li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>Like the lashes on cute Disney animals.  </li>
      <li>I love the wand on this mascara.</li>
      <li>The brush is excellent, very similar to L&#x27;Oreal voluminous.</li>
      <li>This mascara adds length and, most importantly for me, CURL!</li>
      <li>and I love it &amp;#60;3 no raccoon eyes..</li>
      <li>I got it very recently &amp; was very happy!</li>
      <li>The color is also excellent, very nice, rich black.</li>
      <li>I get it at Walgreen&#x27;s for $2.99, and it&#x27;s well worth it!!</li>
      <li>Product wonderful actually have liked very much</li>
      <li>I loved it when I first bought it because it&#x27;s VERY pigmented and gave really good volume and length</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as good as many high end mascaras I have used</li>
      <li>Jordana Best Lash Extreme Volumizing Mascara can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>It also washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
      <li>ALWAYS on the hunt for a better mascara, I was impressed with the application and the look...but within a few hours it flakes.</li>
      <li>At night, it removed relatively easily with soap and water.  </li>
      <li>THIS ONE DID THE JOB EASILY</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easily buildable and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff ... especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Lengthens and pumps up with out clumping and falling off through out the day :)</li>
      <li>It goes on beautifully, does not flake, and produces long, lovely lashes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>and I felt better right away!</li>
      <li>(Not that I like spending that much, but I dislike having raccoon eyes even more!)</li>
      <li>a couple of L&#x27;Oreal mascaras that other people swore (SWORE!!) were the best.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This offer is for only 1 tube, tho the price would suggest 2.</li>
    <li> I was amazed when I first applied this! It made my lashes look very long and thick. I would absolutely recommend this mascara. However, it is not waterproof. Like I care! I put a coat of waterproof mascara over it and the product stays put all day. That&#x27;s quite a feat considering I live in South Florida where it has been rainy and humid since March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, this formula is very wet so it has a tendency to get all over the place if you aren&#x27;t careful, but a wet q-tip will fix that.</li>
    <li> best mascara.  No clumping.  Better than any brand I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Read about Jordana mascara on a beauty blog and ordered it right away, figuring I could not go wrong for the price. My usual mascara brands are high end department store ones.  What a wonderful surprise that this mascara is not only as good as all the high-end products I have tried, but it is even better than most of them!  Better than the top ranked mascaras!  It goes on beautifully, does not flake, and produces long, lovely lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it!  Great mascara!!</li>
    <li> OMG! I&#x27;ve try so many mascaras! And this is one I know I will come back for to put in my makeup kit! It didn&#x27;t clump or smudge But made the lashes look like I had faux ones on!!!!😍</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every high end mascara out there, yet they don&#x27;t deliever the results this stuff does. It&#x27;s amazing! You cannot beat the price. This is my go-to mascara for life now.</li>
    <li> I love the wand on this mascara. Design of a plastic wand but has bristles! Awesome product for the price and I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I adore this mascara!!! First of all, it&#x27;s the cheapest around. I get it at Walgreen&#x27;s for $2.99, and it&#x27;s well worth it!! The brush is excellent, very similar to L&#x27;Oreal voluminous. The color is also excellent, very nice, rich black. The formula is very thick, so you may need to scrape off a little first. One coat is really all you need, two if you want to go a little more dramatic. It adds length and volume better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried-and I&#x27;ve used the higher end mascaras too. And, this formula is very long lasting. I don&#x27;t even need to do a makeup check at work, because I know it didn&#x27;t smear all over my face. It washes off nice, doesn&#x27;t pull out any lashes while getting it off either. Go get one, because you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Did not like. Just get Loreal mascara.  Same price</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this mascara. I bought it bc it was recommended to me. It&#x27;s way too heavy and makes my lashes fall after curling them.  Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I had always heard good things about Jordana mascara &amp; I knew it was cheap, but I&#x27;ve never seen it in drugstores where I live (Atlanta, GA) so I was just curious. I got it very recently &amp; was very happy! I&#x27;ve used much more expensive brands and it is just as great if not better and at a fraction of the price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this mascara at all. My biggest issue with it is how clumpy it is, you MUST use a lash comb with this mascara otherwise you have spider lashes. It has nice coverage and color (very black) but the formula isn&#x27;t my style.</li>
    <li> Makes your lashes fall</li>
    <li> This mascara does not perform well. It leads to the dreaded &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay more than a few dollars, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this product even if it were free.</li>
    <li> i SIMPLE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MASCARA IT IS VERY NICE.  IT ISN&#x27;T CLUMPY AND DOESN&#x27;T BURN YOUR EYES.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT ANY HESITATION.</li>
    <li> After getting this mascara ill never go yo any other this stuff is like magic I recomend this to everyone! Plus its really cheap! :)</li>
    <li> I had been using this for 4 weeks now on and off since I got it and I ended up with the worst dermatits/excema around my eyes the professor said he had seen in years.&lt;br /&gt;It started as a small rash under my left eye, that then spread too my eye lid and then over to my right eye. It was so swollen and sore, I am on heavy medications now to try and bring my immune system back under control. So I now have swollen red and itchy eye sockets, not a nice experience at all. The product itself is wonderful, I enjoyed it, but it caused the worst reaction for me Ive ever had. Please do a patch test before using, the pain torture is not worth risking it, wish I&#x27;d never bought it now, Im still 6 weeks off being normal unable to use any make up at all and taking steroids to try to counteract the issues this product caused!</li>
    <li> This mascara is made in Italy. I bought it in downtown LA but could not find it again. I found it on Amazon. It is very good mascara and an excellent low price. It coats every lash and I have used every time of mascara from Loreal to Dior.  You can beat this product for the price and extends your lashes out.</li>
    <li> This product was a very good price, and it even does wonders on a persons eyelashes. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Jordana Best Lash Extreme Volumizing Mascara can&#x27;t be beat. I have tried dozens of mascaras and this one is by far my favorite of them all. It gives my lashes both length and volume and lasts all day without flaking or smudging. It also washes off easily with soap and water. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll like it too</li>
    <li> Yes!!! I finally found an inexpensive mascara that does its job right! This beats my Maybelline falsies mascara, that WAS my holy grail. When I wore Maybelline, sometimes I felt like my eyes got irritated, so I think Jordana is more on the safe side when it comes to my brown eyes. OHH and it doesn&#x27;t clump. No clumps, no harsh chemical, and accentuate my eyelashes. Will buy and buy again, just hope this stays cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara at Walgreens for a couple of bucks and what a bargain. The best part is that I love it! I have used the staple drug store mascara for 9 to 12 dollars (Revlon, Maybelline and Loreal) also, high end like Lancome Hypnose and Bad Gal by benefit and I still prefer this one. It holds the curl after I use the curler, doesn&#x27;t flake as bad as others, washes easily since I hate waterproof. It thickens and elongates the lashes. I am buying more because I can&#x27;t get enough</li>
    <li> I just received this \\&quot;mascara\\&quot; today and I&#x27;m very disappointed. I ordered mascara and did not receive mascara. Instead of mascara they sent a liquid liner pen. -_- I&#x27;m sad I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Great price and it really works. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Product wonderful actually have liked very much</li>
    <li> I usually pay $25 -$35 for mascara--Bobbi Brown, Jane Iredale, Dior- and heard about this on one of Lauren Curtis&#x27; YouTube videos.  The reviews were so positive that I had to try and I ordered it.  It is awesome!!  It&#x27;s not always the easiest to get off even with my face oil cleanser, but that&#x27;s a trade-off I&#x27;m happy to live with because it&#x27;s cheap and is an excellent mascara.  I was delighted to see it&#x27;s carried at the drugstore if I ever need to buy in a pinch.  Finally,  I&#x27;ve found something I can save money on and not feel like I&#x27;ve skimped!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow! I have heard of Jordana mascara for a long time but never got around to trying it. I am a mascara fanatic and LOVE trying new ones so I finally caved and bought a tube. It was cheap and I expected it to be average. I was blown away by it! I like very long, thick, dark lashes. I have straight, medium length, thin ones that really need a good mascara to make them pop. After one coat I knew I had a winner. After two, my lashes were really long and had decent volume as well. No clumps were seen anywhere. The brush is pretty standard but it gets to every lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is just a touch watery so I did get a little bit on my face when applying because my lashes were so long that they touched my skin. That was easy enough to remedy and now I know to apply a bit more slowly so as not to get the product on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the low price, this a heck of a macera. I don&#x27;t have any flaking throughout the day and my lashes stay curled even with three coats of mascara on them. People have remarked about my long lashes, wondering if I was naturally born with very long ones or if it was my mascara. I told the truth. No shame in having average length lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara washes off with facial cleanser or eye makeup remover and isn&#x27;t irritating. It&#x27;s as good as many high end mascaras I have used (and I have used a LOT of them). I definitely recommend Jordana Best Lash Extreme Volumizing Mascara to those who like dramatic length and volume. It may be a bit TOO dramatic for people who like the natural look but I LOVE dramatic eyelashes and am so pleased to get them with this mascara. Although I hesitate to give beauty products 5 stars because there is always something that could be improved upon, this one, for the low price really is a 5 star mascara for me. If it were $30, I would go with 4 because it does tend to be slightly watery and can leave marks on my brow bone or under eyes but only when I apply sloppily and quickly. And removing those is as simple as a QTip and a bit of coconut oil. A new favorite!.simple as a QTip and a bit of coconut oil. A new favorite!.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of mascaras, from expensive to cheap, and this one is by far the best. My eyelashes are of medium length but stick straight out and look quite short if you&#x27;re looking at me head on. This mascara adds length and, most importantly for me, CURL! I was blown away at how much of an upwards curl this gave my lashes. It looked like I used an eyelash curler (which I try to avoid as it can be damaging). I wore it for approximately 14 hours before removing it and not a single smudge.</li>
    <li> I have got no complaints with this mascara. It is very wet when you apply it and goes on evenly. The color is very black. I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future!</li>
    <li> this mascara is the bomb . BUY IT . It lengths and volumizes your lashes . and it creates that false eyelash look which I LOVE . I WAS AT WALGREENS DEBATING IF I SHOULD BUY THIS MASCARA OR THE MAYBELLINE FALSIES (I HAD RAN OUT AND WENT TO PICK UP A NEW ONE) BUT THEN THIS MASCARA CAUGHT MY EYE. BEST DECISION I MADE ON BUYING IT. DEFINETLY WORTH IT . PEOPLE SAY ITS CLUMPY BUT ITS REALLY NOT, ITS JUST THAT THE MASCARA TUBE BRINGS A LOT OF MASCARA, SO WHAT I DO BEFORE APPLYING IT IS THAT I REMOVE THE EXTRA MASCARA ON THE WAND . I WIPE IT OFF WITH THE RIM OF THE MASCARA TUBE . THE FORMULA IS NOT TO DRY NOT TOO WET. IT IS TRUELY AMAZING . ITS THE BEST MASCARA IVE EVEN BOUGHTEN . MY EYELASHES ARE VERY HARD TO GET LENGTH OUT OF THEM , BUT THIS ONE DID THE JOB EASILY NOW IT APPEARS THAT I HAVE LONG THICK BEAUTIFUL LASHES .</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on well, but left dark circles under my eyes with in a matter of hours. I wanted to send it back but couldn&#x27;t. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> makes your lashes long, with no clumps!! Has a funky smell though, but i don&#x27;t mind. i would repurchase, when i run out!!</li>
    <li> Ok, straight up, I HATED THIS MASCARA WITH A PASSION the first time I used it. And the second. And the third. I had heard that this is one of those mascaras that you need to let dry out in order to like it, and holy shiz, is that right. But even after I&#x27;d let this dry for awhile, it was still a clumpy, goopy mess. Then I saw KathleenLights (on you tube) say that she hated it until she scraped the wand on the tube first. So, I tried it. I pulled out the wand and scraped it on all sides on the tube opening and it was like the heavens opened and little baby jezus came down and made my lashes beautiful. The first few times, I could do 3 coats of mascara on each eye without repumping the wand. THAT&#x27;S how wet this mascara is. Now, it&#x27;s been about a month or so, and I can apply it without scraping the wand and it&#x27;s seriously the best. My only qualm is that it&#x27;s really hard to get off, almost like a water resistant formula. Maybe it is, and I just never knew that. Regardless, it takes a makeup remover wipe, a cleansing with my Purity by Philosophy, and then sometimes even some coconut oil to get all of it off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get my hopes up after reading the great reviews and beauty blog posts about this mascara, because it just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I curl my lashes before applying mascara, and this mascara immediately weighed them down, straightening the curl out. I didn&#x27;t notice any more volume than I have with my regular Maybelline mascara, though the color is quite a bit darker. It&#x27;s a very &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; mascara, too, and seems to take a while to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I layered it over my usual mascara, long after the first coats had dried just as a refresher, and it did boost the color of my lashes. So I guess it could be a good layering product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I randomly chose this mascara and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s volumizing and long lasting. You need to apply a few coats, but once that second or third coat is set you can truly see a difference.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite drugstore mascara. Will always repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara at the recommendation of a blogger and I am a big fan! It lengthens and volumizes my lashes, and doesn&#x27;t flake or clump.. and it&#x27;s a crazy cheap. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This product is very drying and flakes really bad. I had seen a review on it online and it seemed good. Not pleased with the mascara at all.</li>
    <li> It didnt do what it says it does. I didnt like it. It doesnt give volume and its not black enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY different mascaras and have yet to find the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; one for me.  I decided to take a chance on the Jordana brand after reading great reviews of this mascara on the web site Makeup Alley; an added appeal was the low price.  I picked up mine at Walgreens for about  $4; they had several mascara by Jordana, but this was the cheapest (and also the best reviewed on MUA), so this was the one I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I liked about this mascara is that the tube is relatively thin--so many of the newer mascaras are HUGE, which is completely inconvenient for storage or travel.  I also liked that the brush itself was smaller; I have small eyes, so larger-style brushes tend to be difficult for me to use.  One thing that I DIDN&#x27;T like is that when the wand was pulled from the tube, a lot of excess product remained on the brush.  This is a mascara pet peeve of mine--I much prefer mascaras that are designed to automatically clear the brush of excess mascara rather than forcing me to do this manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I was quite impressed with this mascara.  Once I did remove the excess product from the brush, it applied without clumping.  It also significantly lengthened my thin, sparse lashes (despite the \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; label).  I had no issues with smudging or smearing; I found that this mascara lasted well all day.  At night, it removed relatively easily with soap and water.  Although this is still not quite my \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; mascara, it is working very well for me so far.  I will continue to buy this product until I find something better, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> For the price this mascara is not bad. The biggest drawback is that it has a tendency to clump up. Also the shipping took 2 weeks!!!</li>
    <li> Fabulous mascara. I switched from the traditional pink and green Maybelline, and have no regrets. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this.  It makes my lashes look long and thick, without clumping or smudging.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. You really don&#x27;t even need fake lashes because this will make your lashes really long. It can get clumpy but that&#x27;s the only con I&#x27;ve found thus far and I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this mascara I was very happy with it. The price is cheap, ur eye lashes are extremely long and colonizing and dark. I thought I won the lotto with this mascara.. Unfortunately in a few days I noticed that I&#x27;m developing a really bad Allergic reaction to this product. My eyes were swollen, red, very itchy and I was itching my whole body after... I was very nervous and thought maybe it&#x27;s something else but to be on the safe side, I stopped using this mascara and I felt better right away! I also did some research on the ingredients and they aren&#x27;t very good for ur eyes... Too many chemicals! Becareful what u ladies buy.. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fact that it&#x27;s made in \\&quot; Italy\\&quot; and about the amazing price! Ur health is number one...and I&#x27;m back to my usual loreal mascara&#x27;s. Good luck everyone!</li>
    <li> The reviews convinced me to buy this, after a youtube MUA recommended it. Its a very Wet mascara, which is great if you want to build your lashes quickly, but I find it smudges a bit during wear, My lashes looked longer, and bigger in general though, so overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this!</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m one who is very in to high end makeup. But most importantly I&#x27;m into getting the best of the best! This mascara is the holy grail of all mascaras! It lengthens and volumizes lashes and conditions them too. I have every mascara in my drawer known to man and this one beats them all. I discovered this mascara on a makeup tutorial on youtube . Lauren Curtis, a makeup artist, who also uses high end products swore by this mascara and said she would buy a lifetime supply because nothing compares... Not maybelline, loreal, MAC, Dior, Armani... Nothing so I thought what the hey, I&#x27;ll try it and sooooo glad I did! I have been racing about this mascara to everyone and even buying it for friends and family! Thank you, Jordana for your amazing mascara! Please, never change a thing about it!!!! Thanks, Ashley Owens</li>
    <li> I heard so many good things about this. ALWAYS on the hunt for a better mascara, I was impressed with the application and the look...but within a few hours it flakes. It ALWAYS transfers, no matter if I use primer of not. It&#x27;s also impossible to remove without losing a few lashes. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a YouTube beauty guru&#x27;s review. I was so excited and WANTED to like it. I&#x27;ve tried it numerous times. It&#x27;s a clumpy hot mess that applied with the lightest hand makes my lashes look like Tammy Baker. Total waste of $7. I went back to Chanel and coughed up the dough for great mascara. Some things you do get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t believe the hype. This stuff is bad in every regard and has a strange odor. Maybe I got a bad batch but its in the makeup junkyard now and I won&#x27;t try this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mascara at Walgreens for $2.99 because a friend of mine recommended it. Honestly, I do not see what&#x27;s so great about the stuff. The formula itself seems okay: it&#x27;s easily buildable and doesn&#x27;t flake. However, the packaging and applicator wand are awful. Mascara clumps all over the brush, and as a result, all over your lashes. True, you could take the time to wipe down the wand every time you go to use it, but think of all the product you will just end up throwing away. I suggest shelling out an extra dollar or two for Maybelline Great lash mascara, which is the best drugstore brand mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a much better brush and you won&#x27;t be dealing with these clumping headaches.</li>
    <li> It does create volume as advertised and the colour is quite vibrant.  The downside?  It clumps so be very careful when applying and use sparingly.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it has some flaws, like it is a pain to remove, but, hey, this is a good problem! ;D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had nothing but success with Jordana&#x27;s Best Lash Extreme Volumizing Mascara in Black.  The color is deep and true and it stays on all day.  Never a problem with flaking or clumping, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  My only complaint is that in the first few uses too much product comes out on the brush.  Easy fix: brush some back into the tube.  I previously used Dior Blackout and this product stands up to it.  Lately I&#x27;ve had trouble locating it at my local drugstore (even tried three different locations!).  I am hoping that this is not a sign of it being discontinued because I&#x27;ve enjoyed the $$ savings.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara because of the majority of the reviews were good. I do not hate this mascara but I didn&#x27;t have as good of an experience as most of the reviews here. It arrived fast with no problems, it was free shipping and it was very inexpensive, those are all great. But it flakes after a couple of hours and my eyelashes look clumpy. This mascara is more on the thicker side and as time has passed it only gets thicker and its drying out even though its closed tight. It doesnt go on easy and it looks kinda bad. I wouldnt recommend and i wouldnt buy it again. I would rate 2 1/2 stars to Maybe 3stars but 3 is pushing it.</li>
    <li> This is inexpensive and I liked it, if you apply a light coat. If you put on to many coats it will smear. Shipping was good and the condition was good. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This mascara is by far my favorite!  It really gives my lashes volume and the price is definitely right.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find such a good mascara for such a low price! It doesn&#x27;t thicken my lashes, but it lengthens them and makes my eyes look beautiful without having to apply false eye lashes. The mascara goes on wet, so after a few minutes of being careful not to blink too hard, I have beautiful lashes. Absolutely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I Purchased this mascara because it was very inexpensive and I thought had decent reviews however after using the product I felt too much mascara was left on the thin brush leaving my lashes a bit too clumpy. I prefer a larger brush to separate my lashes. The mascara itself didn&#x27;t seem to flake but with the application alone I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> i used to wear fake eyelashes..i decided to give them a break and try mascara..and I love it &amp;#60;3 no raccoon eyes..no clumps and nice  coverage..</li>
    <li> This stuff is ultra-cheap (check the discount stores) and works like mad! It&#x27;s just amazing that you&#x27;d get results like this from such a cheap product. I&#x27;ve layered it a lot, and it gives you the look of lots of lashes, makes me almost think of the Twiggy look from days of olde! As a matter of fact, next time I hit the shops, I plan on actually stocking up on this mascara, because it&#x27;s sometimes hit-or-miss on fiding a supply of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those occasions when you want a more extreme lash look, Jordana is the one for you to try.</li>
    <li> Worth the moneh. Definitely buy it</li>
    <li> Gorgeous long natural defined lashes! Highly recommend! You will not regret purchasing and you will love it, as I do!!</li>
    <li> I thought this mascara was going to be amazing due to the reviews by one of my favorite makeup artists, but I was extremely disappointed. Too much product is on the brush, causing the lashes to become really clumpy. It is also impossible to build up volume. Not going to purchase this item ever again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price.  Nothing to really rave about but for the price, it&#x27;s not too bad.  Don&#x27;t think I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> From reading my other reviews, you can see that I will spend $20 or more on mascara if it gives me what I want and need. (Not that I like spending that much, but I dislike having raccoon eyes even more!) I had heard a lot of good things about the Jordana mascara, but just could not imagine that a $3 mascara would work for me. No way, not ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my Lancome was at an end. I&#x27;d tried (and been disappointed by) a couple of L&#x27;Oreal mascaras that other people swore (SWORE!!) were the best. I was at the store and saw a Jordana display and thought, what the heck do I have to lose if I don&#x27;t like it? I had ZERO faith that I would like this mascara, after seeing how inexpensive everything in their line was. (It reminded me of the Wet N Wild products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied this, none of the usual frustrating things happened: no clumping, it didn&#x27;t end up all around my eyes as I applied it, it didn&#x27;t get all sticky and gross. It dried very quickly, no glued-together-eyelids! At the end of my work day, I was SHOCKED to see that not a hint of black smudge existed under my eyes. You could still see the mascara on my lashes, too, so it didn&#x27;t even flake off and go anywhere! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I have a little basket of products I use daily in my drawer, along with a couple of mascaras I won&#x27;t toss until they are gone. But, I reach for the Jordana every single time. I&#x27;ve had one tube for 2 months now and it&#x27;s still going strong. (For sanitary reasons you should not follow my example and just keep mascara but should toss it regularly) I can&#x27;t believe all the years I have spent more money, and THIS mascara is so wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced the wearability of this in rain, snow, or crying conditions: so I can&#x27;t report how well it withstands moisture. I normally prefer a waterproof mascara but so far I haven&#x27;t regretted this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve edited my original review of this. I loved it when I first bought it because it&#x27;s VERY pigmented and gave really good volume and length (which is what a good mascara is supposed to do). I did find (especially after awhile of use) that it tends to clump pretty bad, making a lash comb or old clean wand necessary to declump and define lashes. Many mascaras out there require this, and at around $3 at Walgreens, it&#x27;s worth a try. The biggest drawback (and reason for all of the clumping) is because there is nothing to wipe off the brush as you take it out of the tube. I&#x27;ve read other reviews suggesting the use of an old Covergirl Lash Blast Clump Crusher (which is my personal HG mascara) wand to help with this problem. I&#x27;ll try that once i&#x27;m done with my Lash Blast tube.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me and I love it. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of mascara from cheap to expensive and until this I never found one that worked. It goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly like so many of them do. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very clumpy, spidery, does not apply smoothly. Makes lashes look hard and straight even after curling them.</li>
    <li> Love it. It makes my lashes super long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid thirty bucks for a mascara.  This one cost three.  I like this better than any mascara I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;ve bought a lot!  21st century mascara is one of those products that sends me into grumpy old lady mode:  When I was a girl, you could buy mascara that did not leave you with racoon eyes, unless you rubbed your eyes or suffered an emotional meltdown.  When I was a girl, mascara did not leave you with a few spidery-looking strings in place of lashes.  And what&#x27;s with these huge, stray fibers?  It looks like the cat got into my make-up.  You get the idea.  This mascara goes on good, with no clumps, no wild fibers, no spider-lashes, and no racoon-eyes.  With this mascara, my lashes look like patent leather, long, and full.  Like the lashes on cute Disney animals.  I could not ask for more.  I hope like heck they keep making this...  PS~ after using several of these mascaras, I have found that it is possible to massively overload the brush if you just pull the brush straight out of the container.  So just make sure there is not too much product adhering to the brush before you start to apply to your lashes.</li>
    <li> Clumps a bit, but not as bad as some other brands.</li>
    <li> I heard about Jordana Lash Extreme Mascara via Instagram from a YouTuber recommending it. Her eyelashes looked amazing. I love trying new mascaras, I love the fake look; that&#x27;s what I aim for when applying mascara. When I received my mascara in a decent amount of time, I tried it the next day. I was EXTREMELY disappointed bc it wasn&#x27;t coating evenly or completely. I have to use 2 different mascaras to even get full lashes. It&#x27;s safe to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> Kinda dry for what i usually like. When input it on my eyelashes feel dry like really dry.. I even noticed that while wearing this more of my eyelashes fell out maybe because of the dryness of it idk.. (Weren&#x27;t falling like  crazy tho) just more than usual.</li>
    <li> Loveeee this mascara!</li>
    <li> great love it thank you</li>
    <li> i really like the formula of the mascara but the brush isn&#x27;t the best. don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be repurchasing this mascara.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff ... especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Lengthens and pumps up with out clumping and falling off through out the day :)</li>
    <li> I must say that I am very impressed with this mascara! It is thick and has a really dark shade of black! This is exactly what I have been looking for. I have tried many mascaras before but nothing can beat this one! Get this asap, especially for all those mascara lovers!</li>
    <li> I too bought this mascara based on some beauty makeup artist recommendation videos on Youtube but I can&#x27;t honestly see the hype. I&#x27;ve used it 8-10 times now, and one of those on top of another mascara, and while I do like it, I think it&#x27;s above average mascara. It looks pretty - make sure you curl your lashes first and then apply the mascara and put 2 coats. It is a wee bit stickier than other mascaras, so brushing your lashes to straighten things out might be challenges but it holds up well and washes away well too.&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say, if you apply 3-4 layers nicely, it does stay on.... so for that, I am giving it a nice 4 star. Now off to my search for the real killer mascara. Any recommendations? :)&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful to you.</li>
