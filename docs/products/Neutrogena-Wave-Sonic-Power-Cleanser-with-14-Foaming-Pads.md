      <li>loved that!</li>
      <li>Considering the price, it is really good deal!</li>
      <li>shipping experience was also great.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It worked great for like 2 months and then went kaput.</li>
      <li>I have seen a great change in my problem area....</li>
      <li>WORKS GREAT.  </li>
      <li>Of course at some point you still gotta throw &#x27;em out, because sponges are great collectors of germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought the Neutrogena Wave Sonic Power Cleanser based on all the great reviews and the recommendation of friends that swear by it.</li>
      <li>WORKS GREAT.</li>
      <li>but i would probably if there was a cheaper kind that was real good</li>
      <li>In all honesty, I was happy returning to my cleansing towelettes.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as great as advertised on how well it cleans your face as opposed to manually cleaning it with a quality cleanser and textured pads or a manual scrubbing brush.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about the Olay spinner is that you can use your own cleanser; I wish that was the case for the Wave Sonic.</li>
      <li>I bought the wave because I heard great reviews, and I bought the microdermabrasion system as well...</li>
      <li>or you will not be so happy.</li>
      <li>I am 30 and just this summer my chin wanted to get acne bump happy out of nowhere.</li>
      <li>This was given as a gift and we were told that it was great.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, the best product I&#x27;ve used which has been very effective in removing make-up is [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Everyone love it!!</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>Now, this cleanser may be perfectly for more resilient, youthful skin, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>perfectly so I can get that citrus burst and better delivery with my Neutrogena Wave Sonic.</li>
      <li>(I noticed a reduction in pores within a handful of days - remarkable)</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t wait for my skin to be all nice again!</li>
      <li>Great for oily skin and large pores!!!!!</li>
      <li>After using is 3 times she is happy to announce that she suffered no reaction to the pads, and is very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Love the tip of using cotton pads and your own cleanser!!</li>
      <li>Good - you don&#x27;t have to wash them out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good product for the idea.</li>
      <li>words: \\&quot;Good value.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this product a try after my Neutrogena microdermabrasion applicator died after 4 good years of use.  </li>
      <li>There are some really good tips on how to use it.</li>
      <li>in all it does a good job to exfoliate your skin, but if I could buy this type of product over again, I&#x27;d get the Olay version with the bristle brushes instead.</li>
      <li>It was a good buy.</li>
      <li>I LOVED the effect this had on my face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good product for the idea.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Conclusion: for the money it may be a good starter scrubber, but I think I&#x27;ll upgrade and get a sonic unit instead...</li>
      <li>But... in a pinch, this may be a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;really good.</li>
      <li>good to use good quality&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>In theory this sounds good for your face</li>
      <li>Good while it lasted...</li>
      <li>But... in a pinch, this may be a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this is a good device</li>
      <li>I have them all, I bought the mia first($120)at Sephora and it was good in the beginning I had nothing to compare it to</li>
      <li>The products is a perfect fit for the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion pads for deeper cleaning.</li>
      <li>That is fair.</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t let the brand name fool you, is a good price but a piece of garbage product.&lt;br /&gt;Comment is not for the seller, product came on time and well packaged.</li>
      <li>on time with good wrap up</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t do as good a</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and it feels great on your face.</li>
      <li>Perhaps if I wore \\&quot;stubborn waterproof foundation,\\&quot; I would be more impressed with the Wave Sonic Power Cleanser, as it claims to be 50 times better at removing this than</li>
      <li>I love this, it makes my skin feel GREAT</li>
      <li>Well, I am so very glad I did not fall for all those ads for Clarisonic or even Olay.  </li>
      <li>For guys, I think this would be best to use right after shaving.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this article!</li>
      <li>Neutrogena is a company I must admit I gravitate toward for the most part anyway!  </li>
      <li>i love it!</li>
      <li>Men do love using gadgets!  </li>
      <li>Aside from those, I love it - and so does my wife!</li>
      <li>I love my Sonic Wave!</li>
      <li>I love wave!</li>
      <li>If you own one, be sure to break off the head of the unit every day or so to wash it out!</li>
      <li>If you own one, be sure to break off the head of the unit every day or so to wash it out!</li>
      <li>Amazing considering the price difference in the products.</li>
      <li>She got the $100+ Clarisonic and had amazing results.</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>Great for light microdermabrasion.</li>
      <li>Good idea but needs more I think.</li>
      <li>I think I need the brush kind and stronger cleansing tool</li>
      <li>You could surely use re-chargeables if you loved using it, of course.  </li>
      <li>BTW-One really nice additional feature:  </li>
      <li>It is very compact for traveling and works great!</li>
      <li>I liked this cleansing machine.</li>
      <li>And I liked that I could use my own cleaner and not have to buy replacement pads.    </li>
      <li>I liked the way it felt.</li>
      <li>I liked that.</li>
      <li>&quot; Affirmative.</li>
      <li>- It feels nice.</li>
      <li>Throw some warm water on your face, stick a pad on the device, and scrub away.</li>
      <li>I liked the feeling of the spinning pad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is really good and worth every penny. The price is great compared to other products in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shipping experience was also great. I live in Brazil and my wave sonic arrived on time!</li>
    <li> I love my Sonic Wave! I&#x27;ve had trouble with my skin for the past few years, mostly mild acne and black heads. I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now and all my black heads are gone! This product really gets deep down into my skin and leaves me with a great, squeaky clean feeling. I do add some salicylic acid based cleanser (Yes to Tomatoes acne wash to be exact) to it just to get an even deeper clean!</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin and large pores!!!!! My skin is radiant and healthy after the first use!!! I highly recommend this product for all skin types..The products is a perfect fit for the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion pads for deeper cleaning.</li>
    <li> I liked this cleansing machine. It is the first time that I tried this one as opposed to another one that is made by the same company. The other machine is a little easier to hold for me and is easier to get into all the small spots. The Wave Sonic is a little bit clumbsy.</li>
    <li> Basically, all this does is spin a circular pad around at different speeds to clean your face. I actually got some soap in my mouth when I used it so I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with that (undoubtedly, I am not very cordinated) but the pads that come with this just lather up your face. There are exfoliating pads you can buy but for less than $6.99 you can also buy a tube of facial scrub that will probably last you longer. Overall, I was just not very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Perhaps if I wore \\&quot;stubborn waterproof foundation,\\&quot; I would be more impressed with the Wave Sonic Power Cleanser, as it claims to be 50 times better at removing this than other cleansing regimens are (leaving aside my skepticism about how this would be measured). However, as a day-to-day cleanser, it left something to be desired.  I found running the small scrubbing head over my face fussy and much less convenient than simply using a washcloth.  I would have preferred to use it with my own cleanser rather than being limited to the cleanser in the pads, and throwing away a single-use pad each time seems very wasteful.  Using it in the shower was handy, but using it at the sink was a drippy mess; no matter how lightly I tried to moisten the pad, it wasn&#x27;t possible to convey it from the faucet to my face without having it drip all over.  It was a fun gadget for a few days but not something I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
    <li> I got the Neutrogena Wave Sonic Cleanser for my young teen granddaughter, who has been trying to keep some acne at bay.  She tried several popular cleansers that seemed to irritate her skin, rather than clean and clear it.  You perhaps could call any powered appliance for cleansing skin a gimmick, but if it keeps you regularly cleaning your skin, and the soap/cleansers are gentle and thorough, then I think it&#x27;s a winner.  The replacement pads are reasonably priced, and I have ordered them on the Subscribe and Save plan, which makes it very very convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking care of my face diligently for the past few years and have gone through several types of cleansers. This was my first time trying any kind of electrical solution, and while all-in-all I prefer plain ol&#x27; cleanser and water, I found the Sonic Cleanser fun to use. (By the way, &#x27;sonic&#x27; has nothing to do with sound as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s more of a catch-word. The device just spins, at 2 speeds.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels nice, like a mini massage.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use: stick on the pad, run under the water, start it spinning, move over the face. When finished, remove the pad and throw it away, rinse the face.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof, you can stick the whole thing under running water and not worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;The price of the main part is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14 pads won&#x27;t last you long, you will definitely need replacement pads. It looks like basic replacement pads are 30 for about $5. That&#x27;s not too bad, just a bit more expensive per use compared with face cleanser + a towel (+ cotton rounds + witch hazel). You may want to wash your face twice a day, but I recommend using this just once a day. (This point isn&#x27;t so much of a con as something you will want to consider.)&lt;br /&gt;The pads have a lot of soap on them, way more than the face needs, and it feels like a waste. I use the rest up on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Even on the lower setting, it&#x27;s rough on sores, and scrapes off the healing skin.&lt;br /&gt;The pads catch on my hair, the hair then gets caught in the spinning part.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions could be better, i.e. they don&#x27;t tell you how often to use it, how hard to press, or how fast to move it across your face to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cover some other issues I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews: Yes, it cleans my face. No, it doesn&#x27;t leave pieces of pad behind. If I turn the device on and shake it off before using it (after rinsing) it doesn&#x27;t drip down my face. After rinsing and applying moisturizer (Gold Bond Ultimate lotion) my face did not feel dry. The scent was not strong for me. I had no problems cleaning all areas of my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just 1 other type of cleaning pad and I found this option more practical. I don&#x27;t wear makeup typically so I can&#x27;t say anything about how this works with removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like using the Sonic Power Cleanser occasionally, but it&#x27;s not something I really need or will invest much in. The cost of the replacement pads will add up, and it&#x27;s just one more thing to store in my bathroom. You have to ask yourself, do I really need this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ease-of-use and relatively inexpensive price (of the initial package) make it a fun thing to try out and a good gift idea.oblems cleaning all areas of my face and neck.

    <li> This does not seem like a well thought out product. It works but not well enough to be worth using on a regular basis. I can only guess that this product was aimed at a very narrow range of people with a specific skin type and I&#x27;m not one of those people. For all the trouble it is to use this product, I&#x27;m not getting any results and it seems to annoy my skin. I also cannot see how this product is any better than using a facial cleanser by hand.     However, it does run and spin and you get cleaning pads so it may be of use to some people. The claim of 50x better cleaning is only comparing cleaning stubborn foundation from your face, not comparing cleaning your skin.     I also do not understand why this product is called the Wave Sonic. There is no Wave motion and there is no Sonic (audio, vibration, etc). I also find it hard to imagine that a dermatologist is going to be able to determine if this Wave Sonic is ok to use if you have sensitive skin, as the info says to contact your dermatologist in that case.     Overall, I think Neutrogena got carried away with the hype on this product. If you read it all, you end up expecting miracles from this Wave Sonic and for me I didn&#x27;t even get any improvement.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for my wife, but decided to give it a try too so I could write a review. I have skin too, so hey, why not right?  So, here&#x27;s my experience with this Wave Sonic Power Cleanser:  - First of all, the foaming pads stick on easily, and the device is super-easy to use. There&#x27;s an on/off button, and a button to turn it to a higher speed. That&#x27;s it. Throw some warm water on your face, stick a pad on the device, and scrub away. Easy-peasy.   - It feels nice. You know the difference between brushing your teeth with a regular toothbrush versus using an automatic toothbrush like a SoniCare? It&#x27;s the same thing, but for washing your face. The pad vibrates gently as you move it over your face. It&#x27;s a little abrasive so it scrubs at the same time. It&#x27;s basically like washing your face with a tiny, slightly rough, soaped up vibrating washcloth. For guys, I think this would be best to use right after shaving.  - In terms of design, the device has an easy grip and is easy to use. My wife mentioned that she wishes it came with some sort of holder or stand for when you&#x27;re not using it. Right now you just have to kinda sit it on the edge of the sink or the tub, which she&#x27;s not wild about. A simple stand or holder would have been a definite plus.   - The pads are disposable. That&#x27;s good and bad. Good - you don&#x27;t have to wash them out. Bad - you&#x27;re on the hook to keep buying new ones. They&#x27;re not super expensive, but it&#x27;s still an ongoing expense, if you care about that sort of thing.  All in all, I like this thing. I really just got it for my wife and wanted to use this once to write the review, but I could see myself grabbing it once in a while. The only features I&#x27;m not wild about are the lack of a stand or holder, and the fact that you have to keep buying pads. Aside from those, I love it - and so does my wife!</li>
    <li> Two speeds -- slow and slower.  Just does not work. Please save your money. I really do believe in aggressive skin cleaning but this item is absolutely useless. Sorry, Neutrogena, I love so many of your other products but this one is a definite miss.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to exfoliate you skin, this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an OK product, but it does not make my face feel as clean as an exfoliater does (I use St.Ives apricot scrub, which is pretty harsh, but I need to use it at least 2X per week to clean out my pores as I&#x27;m prone to blackheads).  The only positive aspect I see to the wave is that it did make my cheeks and forehead feel smoother after a couple of uses but there are some definite drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Because of the shape of the wave, you cannot get close to your nose, leaving spots on my face not completely cleaned of makeup. When I wiped my face with a cotton ball with toner after I used this it came out with lots of makeup residue on it after a full 5 minutes of using the wave on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The pads that come with this have a lot of soap on them.  When I do my forehead I have to be careful because it generates so much soap that it will run into my eyes.  I bought the exfoliating pads to help with my blackhead problem and while they have less soap on them (no soap in the eyes - thank goodness) they do not exfoliate at all (they feel no different from the regular pads)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It seems a little weak.  I was excited to get the wave duo with two speeds, but even on the higher speed, the wave doesn&#x27;t do much for my face.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how light or hard you press on this, it doesn&#x27;t feel like this is really doing anything to clean my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to exfoliate skin.  This is the first electronic product I have gotten for my skin and figured it would make it easier to exfoliate and deal with problem skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion - I will use this on occasion to keep my forehead and cheeks smoother, but I will continue to use a deep exfoliater 2 X a week to get rid of blackheads and I will also have to prewash my nose area before I use this(which seems ridiculous, since that is the point of this product -to clean the face).</li>
    <li> I am 13 years old and have had ok acne. when i got this it made my acne worse. it made it redder and more zits and pimples showed up. after two days of using it my face started to get really hot after i used it. that only happened twice. now my face is really dry and peeling. i would not recommend this product. it may just be my skin type because i know people who have it and don&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I like that it&#x27;s clean so I don&#x27;t have to use my hands and put more bacteria in my skin. You do have to be careful and make sure you use a mosturizer afterwards, because it does clean very deep.</li>
    <li> I thought coz was &amp;#34;Neutragena&amp;#34; brand was good, but NO, has no power to clean your face. Please don&#x27;t let the brand name fool you, is a good price but a piece of garbage product.&lt;br /&gt;Comment is not for the seller, product came on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> The white plastic disk you adhere the cleansing pads to started peeling off around the edges the first time I got it wet, and had completely washed off within a week. Which left me with a 15$ chunk of plastic and a box of useless refill pads. Thank you so much Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> It doesnt work. Broken after 1 week used and i dont understand why . never buy it again</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of this product at first glance.  You put a cotton pad, containing a cleansing foam that&#x27;s activated by water, onto the spinning head which rotates at either a slow or fast speed.  I found the slow speed didn&#x27;t seem to do much exfoliating, so I preferred the faster speed.  After the first use my skin was noticeably smoother and fresher than after washing with my regular cleanser.  This definitely seems to provide a deep clean.       The only drawbacks were that it doesn&#x27;t, of course, clean or remove makeup from the eye area, so you&#x27;ll need to take care of that separately.  Not a big deal, but it might bother some who like to get all their cleaning/ makeup removal done at once.  The other concern is that water gets into the area between the rotating head and the rest of the gadget-- again, not a big deal, but it does need to be laid out to dry.         Overall I really liked this product.  It cleaned deeply but was gentle and never irritated my skin, even at the high setting.  It was fun to use and felt like getting a facial massage.</li>
    <li> My wife was the test dummy for this product. She was a little apprehensive about using it as the pads used contain salicylic acid (aspirin). After using is 3 times she is happy to announce that she suffered no reaction to the pads, and is very pleased with the results. The product gently cleaned her skin, with no appreciable drying or irritation. She wishes that the pads were reusable, but they are not particularly expensive or wasteful to dispose of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, she is very happy.</li>
    <li> I have combination-to-oily skin and, going into my evaluation of the Neutrogena wave sonic, my skin was more or less clear.  My cleansers, exfoliators, and moisturizers came from LUSH, and they mostly succeeded in keeping my oily T-zone from going out of control.    The wave sonic definitely does cleanse as advertised; I didn&#x27;t have a single breakout while using it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and comfortable to grip.  There were a few things about it that I didn&#x27;t like, though:    1.) The lather was much too runny, regardless or how much or how little water I used to activate the pad.  It was constantly getting into my eyes and stinging.    2.) Although my skin felt clean, it also felt very, very dry.  Even after moisturizing, my skin felt tight and even slightly itchy.    3.) The original unit doesn&#x27;t come with instructions on attaching the pad, beyond &#x27;attach the pad&#x27;.  It wasn&#x27;t until I bought a refill pack that I realized I&#x27;d been putting the pads on upside down.    Overall, though it does perform as advertised, I can&#x27;t recommend the wave sonic wholeheartedly.  It may work better for different skin types than mine or with a different moisturizer, but it just didn&#x27;t work in my particular regimen.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid twenties and have never had an acne problem, however, my skin tends to be fairly oily in the t zone and dry everywhere else so I decided to try this product. I bought it a few days ago, went home and immediately used it. The item is comfortable to hold and the spinning is a great feature but the foaming pads that come with it are horrible. They smell like chemicals and fragrance (Not common with Neutrogena products) and 30 minutes or so after I used it, my face broke out in a very itchy rash which is still there 3 days later. I refused to give it another go, so I returned it to the store I purchased it from and replaced it with an Olay Pro X spinning brush with which I can use my own facial cleanser. It was twice as expensive, but so far, worth it. If Neutrogena would come out with a cleanser free pad that you could add your own wash to, this product would be worth more than 2 stars. I guess you never know unless you try.</li>
    <li> I liked the feeling of the spinning pad. It gave me that clean feel but I think it could have been better. Maybe some sort of exfoliating pad. The pads were fine but I just didn&#x27;t feel that deep clean. Also i would like to be able to wash my face &amp; my eyes ate the same time but this can go nowhere near your eyes. Good idea but needs more I think.</li>
    <li> I love this product even better that the olay proX and the clarisonic mia. I have them all, I bought the mia first($120)at Sephora and it was good in the beginning I had nothing to compare it to but then it became a pain in the butt, its comes with a charger and the charge life would run down too quickly and I would always forget to charge it, plus it just vibrated on my face I felt like it wasn&#x27;t giving me a deep clean. Then I bought the olay($30)at Walmart and after just one use I loved it way better than the mia but after a while it to became a pain, I had trouble opening the battery door, having to replace the heads(2pk for$10 a month) plus the cleanser was almost $30 a month, equals too much money plus it said it was water resistant I thought that was just a another word for waterproof!, I was wrong! water got it the battery door and it stopped working so I bought the wave sonic, first off! big price difference! loved that! it was around 15bucks at Walgreen, plus I had a coupon from the website and the refills are inexpensive too like 5bucks for 30pk, but since it was so cheap I wondered of it would really give me that deep clean I wanted well... IT DOES Ive had it for months now and I love it. So it goes to show you even inexpensive products can work just as good as expensive products.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Neutrogena Wave Sonic Power Cleanser.    The Wave Sonic Cleanser is easy to hold and comfortable in the hands. It works on 2 AA batteries which were included.  There are 14 Foaming pads also included.  The pads require a few drops of water to activate the foaming cleanser.  The device is useful for most of your face.  You don&#x27;t want to get it close to your eyes or under your nose or else the soap builds up quickly and will end up geting into your nose or eyes.  The two speeds are not too much different in speed.  I just used the faster speed on my face for 2 minutes multiple times over a few weeks. Once you finish with the pad on the Wave Sonic, you should manually wipe your face with the other side of it to get the most out of the foam cleanser.          Using this device on the forehead was not convenient.  It slowly pulled my hair from the hairline down and it become messy. I recommend using the other side of the soapy pad after you are done to wipe down your forehead before discarding it.  For guys with facial hair, the pad will start breaking apart slowly.  For women, it should not be a problem.  Overall, my face did feel cleaner, and there was a cooling sensation possibly due to the cleanser.  This device does give the face a good facial muscle workout when holding it closer to the face.    Recommended, but it&#x27;s not necessary.  It&#x27;s not as great as advertised on how well it cleans your face as opposed to manually cleaning it with a quality cleanser and textured pads or a manual scrubbing brush.  The product says \\&quot;clinically proven to clean up to 50x better than ordinary cleanser.\\&quot;  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more like 2x. You don&#x27;t need this device to remove stubborn makeup. Makeup should come off easy if manually cleaning with a textured pad and a quality solution.</li>
    <li> I love this product, Neutrogena Wave Sonic Power Cleaser with 14 Foaming Pads. Neutrogena is a company I must admit I gravitate toward for the most part anyway!  Why? Because they THINK about their products. They appear to be constantly evolving, and making positive progress. They actually seem to have an interest in seriously caring for people&#x27;s skin, not in just making money. I have used Neutrogena products of all sorts for around thirty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this to test and was delighted to see that it arrived with two packaged batteries, so you don&#x27;t have the aggravation of going into the drawer in the kitchen where you throw your batteries and searching around for the right size. They were high quality batteries as well, not cheap batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I was also happy that the foaming pads were right at hand so I could try this out instantly. Sometimes a product requires a secondary product, or even two, before you can get going. I don&#x27;t know how busy you are but I get up at 5 AM and I fall into bed and pass out with exhaustion anywhere between 11 PM and&lt;br /&gt;1 PM. During this time I have to do a LOT of work as well as caring for my family. I cannot afford to waste time. I am pretty certain you are the same way unless you are very, very fortunate. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out after splashing my face with water. Then I put water on the pad, too. It was invigorating, yet not at all irritating to my skin. I liked the way it felt. I used both speeds available. I liked both of them enough to actually continue trying this handy little Sonic Power Cleaser on my neck and chest. After I rinsed off the cleaser used on the foaming pad and discarded the pad, I felt as if I had actually done something to care for myself in a really positive way. I decided to STOP&lt;br /&gt;everything and actually play with some makeup, get dressed up (well, for me) and make my husband take my picture!&lt;br /&gt;In other words, this one little Neutrogena Sonic Wave Power Cleanser really gave me a boost in a variety of ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say your skin is your major body organ. I think that if you treat yourself right, inside something clicks. If you have been neglecting paying attention to yourself and then suddenly you get something you were unaware you really needed, it is SO worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe I read that some reviewers think the Foaming Pads are expensive. I don&#x27;t agree for the reasons I have written about above.&lt;br /&gt;I felt clean and really good inside and out. It did that much for me. It was worth it therefore, and I will continue to use this system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. I liked everything about this Cleansing System with the Foaming Pads. I \\&quot;back\\&quot; this product, Neutrogena Wave Sonic Power Clanser System, whole heartedly!  Thank you, jeaney say your skin is your major body organ.

    <li> I have the Olay spinner and this Neutrogena Wave Sonic. After using the Neutrogena version, my Olay spinner has not been used since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest skin difference between the two products? My skin has become so incredibly soft, in just the first few days of using the Wave Sonic. I didn&#x27;t even realize how &#x27;unsmooth&#x27; my skin was until I began using this and felt such a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Olay and Wave Sonic brighten skin and remove extra impurities, so they&#x27;re no different on that front. The best thing about the Olay spinner is that you can use your own cleanser; I wish that was the case for the Wave Sonic. For this, you&#x27;re going to be hooked on buying their disposable refills, aka \\&quot;foaming pads\\&quot;. What a drag... Maybe someday in the future they&#x27;ll create a more permanent pad that you can add your own cleaser to. Reusable pads would be better for the environment than adding more disposable pads to landfills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this product 5 stars, minus the fact that they&#x27;ve got DISPOSABLE foaming pads that you have to buy over and over again if you wanted to keep using the product.</li>
    <li> Not sure what is sonic about this, other than the name. It spins in a circular motion with no vibration. I think the name is deceptive.</li>
    <li> i love it, very easy to use and give refresh to my face.</li>
    <li> Let me be clear. The Neutrogena Wave Sonic Power Cleanser was for my wife, not me. OK...now let&#x27;s get to the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her words: \\&quot;Good value. Convenient. Excellent cleansing and exfoliation. My skin was clean and refreshed.\\&quot; (Proof that those were her words, I&#x27;ve never used the word \\&quot;exfoliation\\&quot; before today. Had to look it up to check the spelling.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I asked her...\\&quot;Are you going to keep and use the NWSPC in the future?\\&quot; Affirmative.</li>
    <li> The item came really fast and nicely packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt believe the online price, so i had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone, the 12$ I spent was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dont leave it in the shower or it will stop working, and if it slows down change the batteries.</li>
    <li> You know, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but just the name of this product led me to believe that it in some way incorporated sound waves into the cleansing process. Sort of like the Sonicare tooth brush. I guess I had this idea if sonic waves vibrating the dirt from my pores. After just one use it was clear that it was merely a spinning cleansing pad.  It does, however, emit sound while the cleansing pad is spinning around. So technically, I guess, Wave/Sonic isn&#x27;t a total fabrication.  My daughter uses it and has fun with it. (She is ten) Also, it&#x27;s safe to use in the shower because it&#x27;s water resistant. The soap on the cleansing pads was very drying and I didn&#x27;t try the ones for sensitive skin, so they may be better. Overall, I think it does a decent job of cleaning, but nothing ground breaking. If you like novelties, then you&#x27;d probably like this little device.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but......  I have very good skin and have always received compliments on my complexion not to sound cocky or anything but  I purchased this item from Walgreens a couple days ago (should&#x27;ve read the oldest reviews first). Instead of getting the original wave I bought this one thinking since it had two speeds it would work better. the first day yes my skin was softer and glowing, but I guess it isn&#x27;t for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; because now my skin is getting a little aggravated after only the second use my cheeks are kind of red and I swear I have three new small pimples in a row going across my cheek that were never there before because i rarely breakout. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product, hope fully I can get some of my money back because it ws not worth 16.99.  Do not use if you have sensitive skin that can get easily aggravated.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product. I guess if one wanted convenience and was not overly motivated to manually scrub one&#x27;s face off with regular pads then this might come in handy, but it really is basically just a tool that cleans one&#x27;s face, with the option of different speed levels. The foaming pads are OK. Honestly, the best product I&#x27;ve used which has been very effective in removing make-up is [[ASIN:B001E96KZU Aveeno Active Naturals Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads, 28-Count Pads (Pack of 3)]]. The exfoliating pad on one side and the foaming cleanser on the other do an excellent job in cleaning make-up off my face, leaving a smooth, clean face which has been less prone to breakouts since using them (the Aveeno cleansing pads).</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Wave Sonic power cleanser is fun!  It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate your skin.  The way the cleanser works is you are given pads to attach to the front of the device.  You turn it on, get the pads wet, wham bam you use on your skin.  Does it clean? Yes.  Could you clean your face just as well with a wash cloth? Probably.      I did notice that my skin seemed to look lighter and more blemish free after only a few uses.  That I found to be a particularly fun added surprise.      Makeup comes right off and the pad is able to clean your entire face.  I think people with alot of acne would benefit from trying this product.  It does seem to take makeup and other products right off without any trouble.    Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
    <li> I want my money back, pronto.    As a woman who has terrible skin that requires a lot of makeup, I was expecting this to be a godsend. It wasn&#x27;t. My hands and a washcloth get my face 10 times cleaner, smoother, and doesn&#x27;t leave a disgusting layer of oily flakes behind. I&#x27;m STILL applying moisturizer and feeling all the dead skin it failed to slough off. THa pad is too soft and fluffy to actually DO anything.</li>
    <li> Junk. Broke after 2 weeks. Power switch slowly failed over 3 days, now it won&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I had seen the commercials advertising the product and many other companies were starting to promote similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t think about the piece the soap discs attach to.&lt;br /&gt;1. It is a flat surface, meaning it can&#x27;t get into the sections next to your nose.&lt;br /&gt;2. The soap discs take a while to foam up and when you think there isn&#x27;t anything in there and you are rinsing the machine off... BAM - FOAM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it does a good job to exfoliate your skin, but if I could buy this type of product over again, I&#x27;d get the Olay version with the bristle brushes instead.</li>
    <li> This thing is really just useless. The little pads foam but it does not clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;Just another junk item in the drawer.</li>
    <li> i got the wave very excited. i used it right away and was quickly disappointed. it broke me out, it didn&#x27;t even clean my skin. don&#x27;t buy it save your money too go to doctor and get stuff that works !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love cool gizmos.  My initial impression of this (first use) was that it seemed weak and had pretty slow rotation, but then, this gizmo does seem gentle and does seem to do a good job.  After many uses now, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  It&#x27;s easy to use, not too loud, and my skin seems quite clean.  If the replacement cleanser pads aren&#x27;t too expensive, I&#x27;ll likely continue using this.</li>
    <li> Well, I am so very glad I did not fall for all those ads for Clarisonic or even Olay.  This is the best little device I have ever used to clean my skin.  I am a Chemist and I formulate all of my own personal cosmeceuticals; and, I use max percentages of very expensive high end actives with strong carriers.  The delivery of these serums and creams to my skin after using this little gadget is amazing.    I love this little gadget. I have been using the Neutrogena Wave and the various pads (cleansing and exfoliating) for a good 3 years, but the Wave never left my skin feeling like the Wave Sonic.  I mean I can only describe it as felling \\&quot;minty fresh.\\&quot;  And I never use anything with a scent or fragrance. This is just the Neutrogena Wave Sonic and the cleansing pad or gentle exfoliating pad.  I am sold and I am a difficult person to imress pr won ver when it comes to skin care and products that really work.  To get my endorsement, the product must prove it&#x27;s effectiveness.  The Neutrogena Wave Sonic has won my vote.    I am so glad I did not get soaked for 200+, 100+, 60+, or even 30+ bucks since this lttle device does the job.  Also, I loe the small platform.  It can be used at home and easily packed for travel.  I do not have to invest in a standard size and then a travel size...etc. I lve this so much that I sent 3 to relatives and friends who seem [leased with it&#x27;s [erformance as well.    BTW-One really nice additional feature:  The wave sonic is far more effective (e.g., the rotating action) than the AL&amp; Clear Morning Burst Surge Machine; but, the Clean &amp; CLear Morning Burst Surge pads fit the Wave Sonic perfectly so I can get that citrus burst and better delivery with my Neutrogena Wave Sonic.</li>
    <li> This little gizmo does what it says it will do. Works great.  I can notice a difference in my skin already.  The foaming pads and exfoliation pads work wonderful - I like this technology.</li>
    <li> Good while it lasted... I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one. Just threw mine in the garbage pail in my bathroom.  It worked great for like 2 months and then went kaput. The control buttons (speed buttons) either got stuck (meaning they wouldn&#x27;t stop unless you banged the darn thing) or it wouldn&#x27;t stay put on a certain speed (meaning in order to make it work, you had to hold down the buttons). What&#x27;s the point then?  I ended up buying a bunch of the refill pads to go with it and now have resorted to using them manually on my face.  Grrrrr. Don&#x27;t bother purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I usually wash my face in the shower but I find I really like this cleanser for the times I want to wash my face outside of the shower. It&#x27;s easy to use, you just put one of the pads on the device and it sticks very well. You wet it and then turn it on. Personally I like the high speed, but it&#x27;s nice to have options.     It feels nice to use on the face. It&#x27;s also refreshing.     Afterwards I do think my face looks clean and healthy. I have no complaints about this except that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to rinse all the suds out. Still, there are no flaws that I&#x27;ve found so far that would cause me to remove a star.</li>
    <li> This little gadget might be okay for me still.  It seems neat to have an automatically powered deep-cleaning product for the face, especially if you suffer with acne, which I do.  I didn&#x27;t really care for the little pads that came with it.  They don&#x27;t really seem to clean that well, plus the smell of the chemical on them is a bit strong for me.  So I cut out a little circle of a buff puff pad and used it with the little Wave Sonic Machine.  It is very deep cleaning and sort of fun to use - makes LOTS of lather with plain soap, but after a while, I am finding it a bit more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  The batteries seem to be running down on it pretty fast.  You could surely use re-chargeables if you loved using it, of course.  But it&#x27;s one more thing to sit in the shower, and I really don&#x27;t have room for one more thing, so I haven&#x27;t been using it lately.  It&#x27;s possible I will start in again, but it is definitely not an indispensable product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I got this Sonic Power Cleanser at about the same time I got the Olay Pro-X.  After trying them both, I gave the Neutrogena Sonic Power Cleanser to my daughter and kept the Pro-X for myself.  The Pro-X fit into the crevices of my nose better and up closer to my ear.  I felt like it did a better job of exfoliating my skin.  And I liked that I could use my own cleaner and not have to buy replacement pads.    My tween daughter likes the novelty of using the Neutrogena Wave Sonic Power Cleanser.  After a few weeks, she still uses it.  Before, it was a struggle to get her to remember to wash her face, but she seems to do a better job of remembering now that she gets to use the Wave.  It is more convenient than the Pro-X in that, with the Pro-X, you have to apply the cleaner to your face with your fingertips and then use the cleaner.  So for a somewhat lazy person, eliminating that extra step could make a difference.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the scrubber barely vibrates and so I don&#x27;t think it cleans and exfoliates any better than a cleanser out of the bottle.  It is supposed to have 2 settings but, honestly, I could not tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, because the cleaning tip of the Wave is flat, it doesn&#x27;t work with the contours of my face.  I&#x27;m used to the brush cleanser and that seems to get every part of my face clean including the ridges of my nose and my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the Wave uses these cotton pads that rub off on your skin so you are left with cotton pieces on your face.  Also, the instructions state that you should wet the cotton before you clean your face, but once you start the machine, all of the water just dribbles down into your eyes (which really burns your eyes because of the cleanser in the cotton pad) and down your neck and you are left with a wet mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a much better product if it used a brush head rather than a cotton pad.  I would rather use an exfoliating cleanser out of bottle rather than the Wave to clean my face.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I had the wave at first, but unfortunately, it was not waterproof. I got this and...wow! This cuts down the time I have to spend cleaning my face to about 30 seconds. And,I had less breakouts!</li>
    <li> Received this through the VINE program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really didn&#x27;t do anything that you can&#x27;t do with a little exfoliating brush.  You have to use the round soap -infused pads that are made for this item.  I personally did not like the scent of these pads.  Even though the price of this device is reasonable, I would not buy it, having now tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say -- I do have the Clarisonic cleaning brush, which costs a great deal more ( and is also not \\&quot;worth it\\&quot; in my opinion) but having used the Clarisonic, the Neutrogena was almost inevitably doomed to be perceived as less than stellar . . .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37 and have fair, sensitive skin.  I sunburn if the lightbulb is too bright (not really, but you get my point) and I have always had an issue with acne. My general method for washing my face is using pre-treated washcloth-like disposable wipes that foam up when you wet them.  This occasionally dries out my face (depends on season, time of month, etc) but as long as I follow with a moisturizer everything stays in balance.  The first time I used the wave my face because very red, and I thought maybe a) my face must be getting cleaner than usual and this is an amazing product and b) what if this is too harsh for my skin?  I used the wave regularly for a few more days and my face seemed to get even more irritated.  If after several days of irritation my face had begun to glow and heal and all was right with the world, that would have been fine--but it just continued to hurt, and not because my skin was dry. It felt a bit too much like sandpaper for my taste, and I started to imagine I was basically sanding my face.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this is better for younger skin?  I don&#x27;t want to knock the product just because it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and this might be a great product for you--In all honesty, I was happy returning to my cleansing towelettes.</li>
    <li> This is the next model of the neutrogena wave spinning cleanser. This came with batteries and was pretty easy to set up. There are 2 speeds to choose from depending on how \\&quot;deep\\&quot; a cleaning you desire. Personally, I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference between them. This does not pulse like the original wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser came with 14 deep cleaning pads. These pads are saturated with soap, you hold this under the water and then start cleaning. It is water proof so you can use this in the shower. There are 2 different types of cleaning pads you can get, deep cleaning and gentle exfoliating. The soap on the deep cleaner is a bit drying and I usually prefer a gentler cleanser. I have found that if you rinse out the pads after a use, you can keep reusing them with your favorite cleanser. You can get quite a few uses out of each pad which is a nice way to save some money. My face does feel quite a bit smoother after I use this. I only use this every couple of days and my skin does feel quite a bit smoother and cleaner. The refills for the microdermablasion also fit this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real problem with this is that you have to be very careful about your hair. I had a few loose strands that slipped onto my forehead and this thing yanked them out. Other than that, this does a relatively good job of cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> I just bought the Wave Sonic a couple days ago, and while it might be premature to write a review, I must say that my skin has never felt cleaner or smoother in such a short amount of time.  I was sold after the first use, and immediately went out and got the different refill pads.  If you have acne prone skin like me, you know how gross your skin feels by the end of the day, but now my pores feel like they are breathing for the first time!  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This unit is weak, particularly if you apply any pressure at all, it almost grinds to a halt.  The pads are very small, &amp; in essence, it would be as effective to use a soapy washcloth.  This is only the 2nd bad review I have posted in many years of regular purchasing @ Amazon, so trust me......save your money![[ASIN:B000V2J3ZK Neutrogena Wave Power-Cleanser and Deep Clean Foaming Pads]]</li>
    <li> Since I prefer using more natural ingredients on my skin, I used a cotton disposable make-up pad, instead of the supplied product.  It easily stuck to the Wave.  I put a little citrus facial scrub on the pad and wet it. After using the Wave, my skin was very soft and looked great. I can&#x27;t use a scrub that contains particles with the Clarisonic. With a little improvisation, my Wave worked great, for a terrific deep cleaning and a fraction of the Clarisonic&#x27;s cost. I can use the Clarisonic for regular cleaning and the Wave every few days, for deep cleaning. Of course, it&#x27;s also practical to use the Wave, again with a plain cotton pad, and use a gentle cleanser of one&#x27;s choice for regular cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she likes it very much. it is easy to use and it does the job. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed!  Not a very strong rotation.  Pad holder continuously falls off making it impossible to use. Eats up batteries very fast! Waste of money wish I could get my money back.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> The original vibration style is much much better than the spinner type</li>
    <li> My wife got this to try out instead of her normal face washing routine. It works really well and is pretty effortless. It runs on alkaline batteries and is water proof so you can use it in the shower if you&#x27;d like. Overall, she&#x27;s happy with how clean and fresh it leaves her face.  The only down side is that you can go through the pads pretty quickly. However, even if you&#x27;re not using a machine like this, there is always a cost for cleaning supplies.</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena Wave works really well. It&#x27;s also a lot more fun than just using my hands to wash my face. Well, not that washing your face is ever &#x27;fun&#x27; but it was a lot less dull, that&#x27;s for sure. My skin felt instantly smoother and softer after the very first use, and stayed that way each time after. It is very simple to put on a foaming pad and remove it. There&#x27;s nothing to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this cleanser is worth what it can do. There are so many different things similar to the Wave on the market that cost so much more money, but do the same thing. I&#x27;m satisfied with my Wave, since it made my skin clean and soft. I can&#x27;t ask for much more. The foaming pads can be found at any CVS type of store, and there is couple different kinds you can buy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brianna Lee Book Reviews</li>
    <li> There is a lot of marketing hype on the label about how much cleaner your skin is with this cleanser, but I honestly dont know how they would ever measure that!  As annoying as the marketing is, I have to say that my skin is definitely much better after using this product.  I am going through menopause and have had a very hard time with breakouts on my face.  Nothing I tried seemed to work, but I noticed a lot of improvement after using this cleanser.  I left it at home when I traveled and my skin started breaking out again!  So, for me, it has really been effective.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product from walmart before and love it. It cleans my face very well and makes my pores look smaller. I love wave!</li>
    <li> For the price my husband decided to buy this one even though it was pink. Both him and I use it and are really pleased with it. We use it in the shower and also out, hold up really well and fits nicely in your hand, the pads already have the cleaner on it which you just wet slightly and use, I can usually get 2 sometimes 3 uses out of each pad. Worth the money to try</li>
    <li> When I got this to review, I have to admit I thought it was some gimmicky thing that would serve no real purpose.  I mean, after all, how hard is it wash your face?  Do I really need a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; electric face washer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonic I think is misleading in the product name, implying the product uses ultrasonic waves to blast your face clean. No such thing. The product consists of a turntable (for those of you old enough to remember) or a spinning disk that you attach the cleanser pad to. The pad is pre-loaded with Neutrogena cleanser.  You can select from two speeds (why, I don&#x27;t know).  It does make washing your face kind of fun.  And, I immediately noticed that the pad does exfoliate better than washing with my hands as my skin felt smoother immediately.  The cleanser is pretty good.  I did notice that it rinses easily and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use this all the time though.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of having to buy a lot of disposable things and I would think the pads can get expensive. Plus, I really like being able to choose my own cleanser.  I did cheat a little by trying to use the pad multiple times (after about 2-3 washings they were out of soap).  And, I even used my old cleanser after the pads were out of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this is a good device and it will get your face cleaner than washing with your fingers.  If you don&#x27;t mind buying the Neutrogena pads, I&#x27;d say give it a try.</li>
    <li> I used this all last summer, morning and night, and it made my skin very nearly perfect.  I don&#x27;t recommend using the Neutrogena pads, though. They work okay, but I got much better results using my Aveeno Skin Brightening Scrub. CVS makes plain pads that fit the Neutrogena Wave--they should be right next to the Neutrogena pads on the shelf. I&#x27;m sure any thick cotton rounds would work.  I sadly left mine at home when I went back to school and my skin got horrible again in a month. But I just got a new one and I can&#x27;t wait for my skin to be all nice again!</li>
    <li> Diminished my pores better than any other product. GREAT CLEANSER! A MUST BUY For Any One Who Has Ever Had Skin Trouble!</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;ll start with my disclaimer. One: I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple of days Two: I&#x27;m starting off with pretty good skin (Thanks to the genes my mother passed down) Three: My skin is pretty tough I can use St. Ives Apricot Scrub on my face with no problems    I LUV this little gizmo!! I&#x27;ve had my eye on the Clarisonic system, but being a single mother and a full-time student makes me a little tight with the purse strings.    I have two very irrating problems One: Oily-combination skin, which no matter what I do looks like I&#x27;ve been frying in the kitchen all day by 3pm and Two: awful pores and blackheads surrounding my nose.   I&#x27;ve always followed the same routine. Little to no make-up daily, plenty of water, exfoliate once a week, hot water. To no avail I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid the above mention issues.  But as of the second day of using my new little wonder I can proudly say, not only is my skin glowing more then usual, but the pores are cleaned out and the shine at the end of the day is non-exsistant. OMG!! Say it isn&#x27;t so!! I&#x27;m kind of skeptical because it couldn&#x27;t possibly work that quickly?! Could it?! (I&#x27;ll update this review after I run out of the sample pads (in about 14 days)  I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews and I would you suggest you do to. There are some really good tips on how to use it. It does take some getting use to, manuvering around the crevices of your face, the dripping water aspect. But it&#x27;s well worth the effort. For the cost of the machine and the ease of use. Love the tip of using cotton pads and your own cleanser!! All about the savings!! For under $20 is well worth it!!</li>
    <li> This little machine leave your skin so smooth, we love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days so far so good I guess, I just wish the pads came with nothing on them. I would have preferred to use my Olay cleanser.</li>
    <li> Much Cheaper than in the store, i Love this product. It works perfectly, like a home massage for your face</li>
    <li> I love this, it makes my skin feel GREAT and it doesn&#x27;t smell really strong like other face cleansers. The first couple of times you use it, it feels kind of abrasive on the fast mode, but you get used to it quickly.</li>
    <li> Good action for travel kit! Compact. Durable.</li>
    <li> Amazing! (: works in the shower you get such a clean soft feeling. 2 thumbs up for the wave sonic.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. My skin feels nice and fresh after I use it.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this product a try after my Neutrogena microdermabrasion applicator died after 4 good years of use.  I immediately regretted purchasing it after the first use.  The head spins and easily catches hair and snags.  Ouch!  I&#x27;m inclined to go back to the microdermabrasion tool or even try Olay&#x27;s version.</li>
    <li> It was hard to hold to do the way I thought it should, wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I used this for about 3 months and I found it cleaned my face no better than using my hands, I still had unsightly pores and it just couldn&#x27;t power through my makeup for removal. I ended up using it on the portions of my body that I sometimes get razor bumps and I did find it useful for that but it just did nothing for my face. Bottom line save another $30 and buy something like Olay ProX cleanser system instead.</li>
    <li> It was okay. I guess I expected more dermabrasion qualities. I liked the fact that the pads had cleanser embedded on it. Nice.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this product I noticed a difference. My skin felt so smooth and soft! I have very sensitive skin but there was no irritation, and as stated it&#x27;s gentle enough to use daily!</li>
    <li> Doesnt really clear up face or anything like that. Constantly having to change foam pad since I have really bad acne. A scrub would probably clean your face better than this product. This product is only good for massaging your face and thats about it!!</li>
    <li> Not enough spin power to my liking.  Does an adequate job though.  I haven&#x27;t tried the exfoliating pads yet and that may make a difference.</li>
    <li> My skin always feels ... refreshed after using the neutrogena wave! Best cleanser there is! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but as slow as the head turns on this thing (even on high speed), you get better coverage in far less time by just using a cleansing bad with your hands and swirling it around manually.  Plus, with your hands you can get areas like the side of the nose much easier because you can contour the pad as you use it.  With the slow spinning flat head on the Wave Sonic, it&#x27;s actually much harder to use than just using your hands.  This is a novelty for people looking for a useless gadget.</li>
    <li> The spin setting tends to grab long hair if the user doesn&#x27;t pull their hair back.  I definitely recommend the exfoliating pads add-on!</li>
    <li> Great for light microdermabrasion. Removes all the dead skin cells and makes skin smooth and cleans skin really well. Reduction in acne too!</li>
    <li> This product was horrible made my skin feel like sand paper</li>
    <li> I had my doubts  about&lt;br /&gt;this machine, but it really works. Makes your face feel clean and soft. Pad foam up nicely too.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> cleans  well, tones skin too.</li>
    <li> very good Amazon! I love this article!</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product. My sister and I have similar problem skin- oily, with blackheads and frequent breakouts. She got the $100+ Clarisonic and had amazing results. I decided to try this out because of the price point, and I got the same great results! Amazing considering the price difference in the products. My face is brighter, acne-free, even-toned, and feels so clean after using. I use twice a day and it&#x27;s been a month. I will keep using this product as a part of my regular regimen to maintain my new complexion!</li>
    <li> Ok....not sure what this thing is doing for me. I have had some breakouts but I am not sure this is the cause. I don&#x27;t really get this thing, the spin resolution is good. Won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
    <li> The whole product. Completely cleans my face, and doesn&#x27;t make my face oily afterwards. Usually products do, but I have yet to have that happen. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, and already I am seeing a difference. My zits are still there, but there aren&#x27;t any new ones being formed, so things are looking up!!!</li>
    <li> I use Neutrogena wave sonic power cleanser  just once a day before bed time and it cleanses my skin a lot and feels&lt;br /&gt;really good. You must buy one. You don&#x27;t regret it .</li>
    <li> My daughter bought me one of these at a local drug store.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks and really, as some other people have said, I wonder how the high-priced gadgets like it can be much better?  I am 75 years old and have milia (little hard white bumps) all over my face plus deep lines as well as finer ones.  I saw an improvement right away, but checked with my daughter to see what she though.  She said my color was  brighter and more uniform, no more dark spots.  Roughness is gone.  The top layer of skin over the milia gradually gets abraded away, and they either come out on their own or with just a bit of scratching or rubbing (be gentle!).  The deep lines really are shallower, because the outer layers of essentially dead skin are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just looking at the reviews, thinking maybe there was something even better, but now am convinced I won&#x27;t need to look further.  Some of the suggestions in the reviews are helpful, too.  The thing I do to save money on the refill scrubbers is just set it somewhere to dry for the day and then use it again in the shower, so I get two uses.  I suppose eventually I&#x27;ll catch some dread disease, but so far, so good, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m in any danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering whether this type of thing works, try this one.  It has such a low price, and I&#x27;ve never heard anyone was hurt by one...</li>
    <li> Love this product as expensive facial alternative. I have already bought a lot to give as gift to my sisters!! Everyone love it!!</li>
    <li> Its okay for what I use it for not daily. I think I need the brush kind and stronger cleansing tool</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser to replace my old one - which was the original Neutrogena wave.  I thought that it would be an upgrade, but it is a disappointment.    Swirling action - My old one vibrated - so I swirled and it would go back and forth.  Although I thought that it was too mild to be doing anything, it worked well.  This new version swirls.  So, I have to stop swirling.  Ok.  Fine.    Wet and soft pads - So, I reach into the pack and find that the pads are wet and soft.  I apply it and so now there is a wet and soft pad that is lathering up my skin.  No exfoliating action at all.  And, yes, the cleanser is drying.  This might be good for acne, but overall, my thoughts are - why buy a power scrubber if not for better/faster exfoliation?      Battle of the sonic scrubbers - My other takeaway is that Neutrogena must have made its sonic version to compete with Olay&#x27;s popular sonic scrubber (Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, $30).  Olay (gentle scrubber with gritty cleaner) is competing with Clarisonic ($118 and up; interchangeable brushes with your own cleanser).    My next move will be to try the Neutrogena sonic wave with different cleaner pads.  If it exfoliates will, then it&#x27;s a keeper.  Otherwise, I think I&#x27;ll spring for the Clarisonic... there is something to be said about not having to buy pads all of the time.      ------------  Update - I tried other exfoliating pads.  No luck.  They are all \\&quot;too gentle\\&quot; for my taste.  The search begins...   Update - I am now happily using Nutra Sonic ($100 or less; bought mine refurb for $55).  No more single use pad; it uses brushes.  Now I can use my own cleanser - which changes by seaon.  Yes, the sonic brush  costs more upfront, but I&#x27;d rather invest than to keep paying out the nose for something that I&#x27;m not sure is working.    No questioning whether my skin is exfoliated with the sonic brush - it can feel it and, most importantly, I can see it.  My skin looks great!  After the first time, my skin looked much better.  No scrathes.  The brush is soft but it does the job.  After the third day, my skin looks beautiful again.   Sorry Neutrogena. I&#x27;m waving goodbye to the wave!</li>
    <li> I just received my Wave Sonic and decided to test it out immediately. I was expecting a normal clean feeling, having used pretty much all cleansers out on the market, but was extremely shocked to find that the Wave Sonic really means \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve never felt such a clean feeling in my life. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this product! My face feels 10x softer than before using Wave Sonic, even after only one simple use! I truly recommend this to anyone! :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this due to promotion and advertisting but i must admit looks cool and can feel the sensation on face BUT big BUT,made me break out even more I know that everyones skin is different and this clearly doesnt work with mines</li>
    <li> I....can&#x27;t stand this product. I had the original for a while and noticed improvements in my skin that were consistent. The original, after a few months just shorted out and stopped working. I went to regular face washing and felt that extra buff was missing, so I decided to Amazon Prime another. Well apparently, that&#x27;s not an option so I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... if you have hair, basically don&#x27;t. It is pretty aggressive (ALL the settings) which is not safe for skin in general but it also sucks up all the little baby hairs around my face. NOT IDEAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse than that though, is it stopped working after 4 uses. What a horrid, non-quality product. Last time even bothering. I would recommend the original a while ago, but this is abrasive and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love my face wash it removes dirt ,removes old skin,cleans pores ,makes my face smoother and fresh feeling like the exspensive ones!!Teens will love</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to try power cleaser. The first and second time it really did make a big difference to my face that my face glowed. But maybe I used it too often （2-3 time per week) that in the following days my cheek and nose skin became dry and peeling. I have stopped it now for half a month and my nose finally recovered. I guess dryness in winter in the north didn&#x27;t help either. I still enjoy the rubbing feeling and I would try to use it in summer again.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying the affect it has had on my complexion and keeping it exfoliated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 34 year-old man who is not ashamed to use Neutrogena products. Even ones that are pink and look kind of like epilators, as long as they work. And I&#x27;m no stranger to a decent product to keep breakouts away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all being said, the Wave Sonic is kind of an odd duck. I was expecting more of a pulsating motion, but the pads spin. And they spin pretty fast on the low setting, and ridiculously fast on the high setting. It almost feels like this was developed for the laziest people on Earth, rather than serving a useful purpose that can&#x27;t be accomplished with a plain Neutrogena cleansing pad in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a guy, you&#x27;ll need to take special care when using the Wave Sonic. If you have even the slightest bit of facial hair, the pads get torn up almost immediately, and leave a cottony mess. And by \\&quot;slightest bit\\&quot;, I&#x27;m not taking about five o&#x27;clock shadow. I mean \\&quot;you&#x27;d better use this almost immediately after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that though, even the [[ASIN:B0014L29RQ replacement pads]] are fairly cheap, and if you&#x27;re getting them here on Subscribe &amp; Save, they&#x27;re even cheaper. I was really surprised to see that they cost less than the old-fashioned \\&quot;use it in your hands\\&quot; [[ASIN:B000FPTEO8 Neutrogena 2-In-1 Foaming Pads]] that I normally use.</li>
    <li> The NEUTROGENA WAVE SONIC POWER CLEANSER is a handy little gadget that removes make-up, deep cleans your pores, and exfoliates your skin, giving it a nice, healthy glow.  It is small, easy to use and to store, and comes with 14 days (2 weeks worth) of single use cleansing pad.  The price seems reasonable and the refills are not too bad.  I was really hoping that I could add the NEUTROGENA WAVE SONIC POWER CLEANSER to my daily routine.  Unfortunately, after two weeks of testing, there are definitely some downsides to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NEUTROGENA WAVE SONIC POWER CLEANSER really does do a very nice job thoroughly removing make up and deep cleaning your pores, especially in that pesky t-zone area.  However, I have \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin, and the standard pads that come with The NEUTROGENA WAVE SONIC POWER CLEANSER are very harsh on the rest of my face.  My cheeks and jaw line, especially, became red and irritated, with little red bumps popping up.  Now, this cleanser may be perfectly for more resilient, youthful skin, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  There is a sensitive skin version of these cleansing pads available, and I am willing to give them a try.  Hopefully, my skin will react better to them, and just glow a nice pink - not an angry red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two speeds on the NEUTROGENA WAVE SONIC POWER CLEANSER; one for daily cleansing and one for weekly deep cleaning.  To be quite honest, it was hard to tell the difference between the two modes.  I had to listen very closely to the little motor to determine which was the deep cleaning speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with two double AA batteries which last a long time in the NEUTROGENA WAVE SONIC POWER CLEANSER, it is waterproof (so you can take it in the shower or the bath), and it is a snap to clean.  The replacement foaming pads are readily available, and it is definitely convenient to use.  One note:  I see where some folks have been tempted to reuse the cleansing pads multiple times.  These are SINGLE USE pads only.  Using them multiple times will spread bacteria, something you do not want on your face!  Please read the instructions and replace after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the concept of the NEUTROGENA WAVE SONIC POWER CLEANSER.  I just need to find the right cleansing pads for my skin type.  For now, I am going to stick with my regular daily cleansing routine, and use the NEUTROGENA WAVE SONIC POWER CLEANSER for removing make-up only.hem multiple times will spread bacteria, something you do not want on your face!

    <li> love the cleaner  i had before but grandchildren drowned it and it wouldnt work after that</li>
    <li> I loved it, it feel very clean, i used only once yet, it heavent broken yet, like i saw in many reviews, so far, is very good, i liked!!&lt;br /&gt;Will replace the cleaning pads for regular cotton when i run out of the one that come whith, and see if is good too!!</li>
    <li> I bought the wave because I heard great reviews, and I bought the microdermabrasion system as well...I like the Micro one a little bit more because it had power and I can feel it working..the wave is very sensitive and soft. But with my face I need something to work hard and get the oils and makeup off from the day.</li>
    <li> pros: great for daily use, deep cleans for heavy make-up users, inexpensive, battery lasts for a very long time, water-resistant for convenience in-shower&lt;br /&gt;cons: low-speed is unnecessary, not enough variety of disposable pads</li>
    <li> I really love this wave sonic face cleanser. It takes off my makeup with ease and isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin! It makes my face really soft after using it. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product does its job, I&#x27;ll give it that. Put the Velcro that is on this product already came off and it&#x27;s only been about a month since I bought it. Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has done it again!  I know I can count on Neutrogena products and have for years!  Now that I&#x27;m into the &amp;#34;wrinkle repair&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;wrinkle defense&amp;#34; stage, I continue to rely on Neutrogena to meet my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I like that this cleanser can be used in the shower and Neutrogena&#x27;s stronger Microdermabrasion pads fit this power cleanser too!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered three more ... two for younger sisters and one for my mom!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son - he was just not washing his face good enough!  He was also resistant to twice daily facial cleansing.  Lots of black heads, constant break outs.  I was always yelling at him to wash his face, he was always saying he did when I knew he hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is pink, I bought it for him.  Men do love using gadgets!  The same is true for teenage boys.  He uses it each night and a traditional soap/scrub in the morning.  He follows each wash (day and night) with an astringent to close the pores up.  He also occasionally uses an acne style face lotion if his face gets dry.  (This is rare, though.  He is 15 with really oily skin.)  This regimen has been wonderful!!!  Within just a couple of days he has had significant facial clearing.  Within 2 weeks his face was almost clear.  Black heads that were not gone already can be very easily removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that he slacks on using the traditional soap/scrub in the morning, but this Power Cleanser really picks up where he slacks off.  It is especially helpful along the hair lines where he tends to have increased acne and the T-zone area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of Advice - We are now purchasing our second Sonic Power Cleanser within just 3 months.  It is not as &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34; as they claim.  The first one failed quickly due to water corrosion.  This one we will be much more careful about keeping dry. Not matter what the box says - do not use it in the shower.  It will rapidly fail.  And if you run it under the faucet, be VERY careful where you splash the water.  This is the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Please just don&#x27;t waste your money on this, there are plenty of other (BETTER) facial scrubbers out there, that will actually get the job done. I hated this product, It made my skin very dry, and pretty much destroyed my skin. Please ladies, and gents..Do yourself a favor, and get something else.</li>
    <li> Cleared my skin of acne. I am so in love with the neutrogena wave. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it two days in a row now and I definitely feel the clean. Great product. I feel like the results will be worth it.</li>
    <li> I just bought this today and used it for the first time today. My first impression was that it didn&#x27;t seem very powerful, so I didn&#x27;t expect it to do much. It was kind of fun to use, massaged my face. I liked that. My skin is pretty oily, and the cleanser did soak up the oil pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to rinse my face, I was shocked at how soft my skin was! It felt great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll use this everyday (but as I feel how soft my cheek is right now, maybe I will) because I don&#x27;t really like the idea of having to buy these cleansing pads.</li>
    <li> Cleans your face really well. I didnt use makeup remover once just to test it out! Everything came off. My face enjoyed the massage.</li>
    <li> I Love love love love love this product. So glad I bought it.  I use it at night and my face feels super clean and soft.  Since I&#x27;ve bought it I haven&#x27;t had one stitch of acne. I usually struggle with sporadic busts of acne here and there, but haven&#x27;t since buying this product. I highly recommend this product.  It may dry out your face, but that is why I only use it at night, people with a drier face may only want to use it every other day. Definitely worth the 10 dollars</li>
    <li> Ordered for myself and love it. long battery life and small to storage. also like the 2 speeds. great price and received early</li>
    <li> This actually exfoliates!  Who knew?  Just make sure you put any loose hair around your face, back in a headband or you will not be so happy.</li>
    <li> bought for my 12 year old daughter. she loves this thing! cleans the face well and helps her forms good washing habits at a young age</li>
    <li> For when I want my face REALLY clean and soft. Love this product</li>
    <li> Bought this at Walmart ... Has very little power worthless you could do better with a rag . In theory this sounds good for your face but this machine is powerless to do so</li>
    <li> I bought the Neutrogena Wave Sonic Power Cleanser based on all the great reviews and the recommendation of friends that swear by it. Unfortunately, it caused a really bad breakout (I had not had a breakout in over 10 years). It also irritated my skin, even though I was very gentle with it and did NOT use any amount of pressure while using the device. Needless to say, I would not buy this again nor do I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hundreds of blackheads on my face for at least 10 years, since puberty. Not in a grotesque kind of way, I just have large pores that stay full of gunk. The aesthetician was very tired of squeezing all the little blackheads out of my face when I got a facial, and I was RED! And despite washing my face twice a day for a lot of years, and squeezing my pores out in the mirror every day, and using masques and enzyme peels, I still have these blackheads. So I was hoping this would be my miracle cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a couple weeks (trying to to do it every day) I gave up on using the spinning action and just started scrubbing manually, using it as a hand hold for the pad. It works much better this way, especially on and around my nose. The spinning didn&#x27;t work on my nose, simply because of the shape. And I worried that the spinning action was doing my skin harm, by dragging the skin downward in it&#x27;s path, so using it manually I can scrub sideways and up instead of down. I will probably keep using the pads and get rid of the machine. The pads are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the pads: I reuse them. I&#x27;ve been using one pad for the whole time I&#x27;ve had the machine, and I just replaced it today (like I said, it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and it was just starting to get a little dingy). The initial lather on the pads is a lot - you can get away with using the pad for 2 or 3 uses without adding extra soap. Now I just add extra cleanser every time I use the pad. I found the lather from the pad irritated my skin, and the fragrance made my sneeze. Still, I think these pads clean my skin better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and I will continue to use them with my Eternalist cleanser. I&#x27;m glad I tried this product because it lead me to these pads. I&#x27;m hoping with continued use my blackhead problem will cease - I&#x27;m already seeing some progress</li>
    <li> The package sat in Reno for 4 days.. Eventually getting to its final location a whole week late. ARRIVAL DATE MEANS NOTHING ON THIS ITEM!</li>
    <li> I am 22 years old and have been suffering from horrible breakouts on my chin. They are the type of pimples that are deep and painful beneath the skin that never really result in a white head. I decided to try the sonic wave and have had pretty great results with it. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it feels great on your face. My face feels refreshed and soft after I use it. I usually do it once per day before I go to bed. I haven&#x27;t had any bad painful breakouts yet after a week of using it. The only cons that I see with this device is that it seems to burn through batteries pretty quickly and loses some power. It should also come with some stand to put on. It has an awkward shape so you usually just have to rest it on its side. Other then that, I am pretty pleased. It definitely gets deep down in my pores and keeps my face breakout free!</li>
    <li> I bought the Sonic Wave a few days ago and my face has already started clearing up. I do, however, use the pads more than once. The pads do have an excessive amount of soap on them so when I am done I gently rinse it (like one quick swipe under running water) and put it up for the next time. Then once I use it the second time I rinse it thoroughly. You can also add a normal face soap after if you want to reuse the pad more than twice. The pad can be a bit abrasive for some but my mom (who wanted to really scrub her face) was a little disappointed when she said that she couldn&#x27;t feel the scratchy bristles on the pad. I think the pad is just the right amount of &#x27;scrub&#x27;. Overall, I am satisfied with this product and am looking forward to using it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some have been saying that it leaves their face dry, I use a simple moisturizer (the generic kind from Target) after I wash and my face hasn&#x27;t felt dry at all. You can get some for about $3 and I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> my face is so fresh and young!</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would help reduce skin oil, it doesn&#x27;t do that. The package came damaged, luckily the contents were intact. It works on cleaning but not deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel sooo smooth, I add additional cleaner though</li>
    <li> Revitalises with very little bother. Skin is smooth and glowing afterwards.would recommend it to anyone, very easy to use well worth the money</li>
    <li> Definitely better than using my fingertips, but not exactly the &amp;#34;clean feeling&amp;#34; I was expecting. And the head ALWAYS comes off when I try to remove the foaming pads! I&#x27;ll continue to use it though. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne most of my life, going as far as getting prescription medication, which did little to remedy the issue. I bought this as a shot in thr dark and was amazed at the results! I paired this with the neutrogena 2-in-1 fight and fade gel and in 12 hours, I saw a noticeable difference! I would recommend to everyone with oily skin (like mine)!</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift and we were told that it was great.  Just the right amount of grit.</li>
    <li> I loved it at first, then it started getting glitchy. At first, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on/spin unless I was holding down the power button. Then, it wouldn&#x27;t stop spinning until I took the batteries out! Now it&#x27;s back to not spinning until I hold down the power button. I really don&#x27;t want to buy a new one but it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to take out the batteries after every time I use it. Anyone else have this problem? I thought at first maybe it wasn&#x27;t waterproof but that makes no sense, plus the description says it is &amp;#34;water-resistant.&amp;#34;  **Also, I hadn&#x27;t even used it for long. I was still in my 1st pack of 14 pads.</li>
    <li> I only used it once on my face.  Don&#x27;t plan on daily use because of sensitive skin.  I do find it a bit hard to handle.  It doesn&#x27;t work that well around the nose area.  What I really like about it is that it removes all the dry skin from my toes.  I once got cream from the dermatologist but that did not work. I tend to get dry skin on my legs during the winter so I am sure the wave will take care of that.</li>
    <li> Generates so much soap that it gets into your eyes.  The battery lasts a long time but sponge refills are expensive.  After a while - no difference from the manual method.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! I bought it at my local walgreens and the price isnt bad at all for the kit and the refills come with 30 pads for $6... That is fair. Anyway i washed my face with it and noticed a big difference in just one use!! My skin felt squeaky clean and so soft :) So happy i bought this!</li>
    <li> This product is OKAY. I have many pros and cons for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- makes your skin smooth (in a way)&lt;br /&gt;- i&#x27;ve had this for 8 days and so far my face has been clearing up. In the first week though, you might get a few breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- water proof; however, you cannot fully submerge it into water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- even though it made my skin somewhat soft, it also made it dry. On a scale from 1-10, 10 being ridiculously dry and cracked, I would say I&#x27;m about a 4. This could be fixed with a good moisturizer though&lt;br /&gt;- you have to keep buying pads regularly&lt;br /&gt;- it might irritate your skin if you don&#x27;t use the right setting. I use the low setting but towards the middle/end, i switch to high for 30 seconds then back to low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if this product clears my skin up, I&#x27;m willing to keep it. I honestly don&#x27;t care if my face gets dry, as long as its clear. I can just use a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> good to use good quality&lt;br /&gt;but i think the price is a little expansive&lt;br /&gt;ship on time with good wrap up</li>
    <li> My skin troubles is getting better since I use this wave sonic power cleanser. Considering the price, it is really good deal!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product. When I first used it, I enjoyed it, but it left my skin pretty dry. I did wash my face first and I think that&#x27;s why it was so very dry. I tried it again today without washing my face first, and walaa, I LOVED it... It min. my pores, and left my face feeling silky smooth, and no dry skin... Just glowing skin...</li>
    <li> Using this products makes me tend to my face long as in washing longer. I say I probably twirl this little baby on my face about 10 minutes each time while taking shower. Way longer than the quick 2 minute rag wash I usually do. I have seen a great change in my problem area....MY CHIN. I am 30 and just this summer my chin wanted to get acne bump happy out of nowhere. Since I have been using this my chin is almost bump free and smooth again. I have been using it for 1 month so far and can only say it has made me aware that I need to focus on washing my face longer to see improvements which I have. Would purchase again if the one I have breaks. User for life.</li>
    <li> I bought one of Sonic Wave 3 months ago. I used it for about 15 days then I was broken ( It did not spin anymore). I thought that It was just this one. Then, I was able to return and get a new one. But it was just broken again ( did not run after 2 months). I do not know what happened. I won&#x27;t buy anything like this if I can only use for a couple of months. Avoid cheap Chinese made thing like this.</li>
    <li> I LOVED the effect this had on my face. It actually did what the commercials said it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that I have now purchased 3 of these. The first one started malfunctioning- wouldn&#x27;t turn off, then wouldn&#x27;t turn on. So, I bought a second one thinking the first was just a fluke. It was the version that didn&#x27;t spin. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about that, but then I was less crazy  when it, too, stopped working. Once the third one dies, I&#x27;m done with Neutrogena products.</li>
    <li> It is very compact for traveling and works great! Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> purchased for my pubescent son. he said, &amp;#34;Mom! it&#x27;s pink.&amp;#34; ...to which I replied, &amp;#34;that&#x27;s the only color it came in.&amp;#34; ...but after using it he likes the way it makes his skin feel and it helps with the blackheads.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I have tried this once - looks like a great way to clean your face.  I need to try it a few times but I think you can&#x27;t go wrong with anything made by Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Clinically proven to clean up to 50X better than ordinary cleansing&amp;#34; Ha! I feel foolish for having even bought this silly machine. It did absolutely nothing, no power whatsoever, and after using I got out my exfoliating scrub and face wash and washed my face the old fashioned way. Maybe there is something to power face cleansers but I&#x27;m sure you have to pay considerably more for one that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel 50X stupider than I did before I bought this and back it&#x27;s going. Did give me a good laugh though.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT.  I JUST LOVE IT.  WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t as powerful as i hoped it was just a concept of spinning basically it does come with batteries and the 13 pads with soap on them but i would probably if there was a cheaper kind that was real good the had bristles that moved like a oral b toothbrush yes i would choose that option. It was pretty expensive for the product you are getting.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works way better than the regular wave sonic. I really like how I don&#x27;t have to use my hands or anything when washing my face anymore, this can do the job for me much better. The only think I do not like is I can never tell which side of the pad should be facing up! But other than that, I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Wave Sonic Power is very easy to use, can be used in the shower with no problem. Amazing! i love it!</li>
    <li> DID NOT LIKE IT RETURNED IT</li>
    <li> Love it. It exfoliate my face well and leaves my skin feeling soft and radiant. It was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Very useful for my daughter in teenage</li>
    <li> Awesome face cleaner, this is my 3rd one (this is for a family member). My face always feels fresh &amp; soft after using the sonic wave. I use both types of pads too.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day and I adore it. The cleansing pads tingle nicely and my face feels so clean every time!</li>
    <li> I am sure I am not the only one that was intrigued to try this product after coming across it. It looked like a fun concept and I thought to myself why not? So I picked one up at CVS where I work and decided to give it a try. Now, I am going to be breaking this review up in 3 categories, so you can easily make a decision if it&#x27;s worth your investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Package Inclues the following:&lt;br /&gt;- The Wave Sonic&lt;br /&gt;- 14 foam pads sealed together in a package&lt;br /&gt;- 2 batteries for your device&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wave Sonic - The device is about the size of your palm and very easy to hold, even with the batteries installed the weight is pretty light for the average person, so it will be easy to control. It has two buttons, one for power on/off and the other is to control the speed of the rotation. There is only two rotation speeds, slow and fast. The body is made out of plastic but it has a purple/pink grip on the outer area so you can grip it with ease, even with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foam Pads - These come sealed in a plastic package. The package contains 14 pads. The Foam Pads come with a lot of cleanser inside it and leaves a cooling effect on your face after your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life - As of now I have had this product for about 3 weeks. I use it almost everyday, 2 times a day for a duration about 30 to 45 seconds, so overall the battery life isn&#x27;t so bad it will last you for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the basic information known, this device does have some cons. The speed of the device (In my opinion) is very slow. Even with full speed, it feels as if it is barely cleaning. When you apply pressure on to your skin the device&#x27;s rotation turns very slow and it cannot clean. If you have acne prone skin, avoid it because it will pop your pimples and might cause more breakouts. The Pads come installed with a lot of cleanser inside and can be used 2 times per pad (tested). All you have to do is wash your face using the deivce for about 45 seconds, hold the device under the sink for about 2 seconds to clean it off and you should get another wash out of the current foam pad. However, considering they run for about 5 dollars and some change for 14 pads at your local drug store, it can turn into a pretty expensive investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product for the idea. It does leave a cool effect after you clean your face which I love and it does overtime peel some dead skin off your face which might&#x27;ve caused discoloration so that is a great thing. The Pads can be expensive but if your someone who doesn&#x27;t mind spending the money, this can be a fun alternative for your every day facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I helped make your decision easier, if you have any questions or thoughts, let me know and I will get back to you quickly.

    <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago since lately I&#x27;ve been seeing all kinds of face wash brushes and pads out there I thought for a relatively cheap price I&#x27;d give it a shot. I suffer from occasional breakouts around my chin, jawline, and hairline as well as blackheads around my nose. Right after the first use my skin was SOFT. No more dry flaky skin from my acne cleansers either. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the pre-soaped pads and would absolutely prefer to use my own wash of choice. I decided to use the pads multiple times until the soap was gone and I could apply my own cleanser. Of course at some point you still gotta throw &#x27;em out, because sponges are great collectors of germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- You will have SOFT skin right off the bat&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces flaky dry skin&lt;br /&gt;- Will initially help clear up pores and acne (I noticed a reduction in pores within a handful of days - remarkable) It didn&#x27;t keep up though over time&lt;br /&gt;- Is absolutely better than hand washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-This thing pulls hair like an angry 2 year old. It spins in a continuous circle and any stray hair that gets caught up in it will be pulled right off your head! OUCH! And no hair is too short!&lt;br /&gt;- It spins in only one direction - so... for me this means that one side of my nose, cheeks gets a better scrub than the other. On my right side, soft smooth skin, fewer noticeable pores etc,... left side? When I use it, it fills my nostril right up with soap! YAY!  : P And it doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.&lt;br /&gt;- The batteries don&#x27;t last long if you use it twice a day. Prepare to have extras on the ready.&lt;br /&gt;- Why pay for two speeds? They&#x27;re both slow.&lt;br /&gt;- The pad is FLAT so it&#x27;s hard to get around your nose etc. with any consistency&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t use your own cleanser with this and I&#x27;m not personally a fan of the one it comes pre-soaped up with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: for the money it may be a good starter scrubber, but I think I&#x27;ll upgrade and get a sonic unit instead... one that recharges, one that has a brush I can use my own cleansers on and one that doesn&#x27;t spin and pull my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Maybe not. I think I&#x27;d just skip ahead to a non-spinning brush unit instead. But... in a pinch, this may be a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/1/2012:&lt;br /&gt;First, the unit this edit is for: I switched pads the other day, and the top snapped off... underneath was a graveyard of germs, gunk, and old soap. I was noticing the unit wasn&#x27;t doing it&#x27;s trick any longer against my breakouts and tada! It was GERM CITY inside the actual head of the unit. *gag* If you own one, be sure to break off the head of the unit every day or so to wash it out! Otherwise, every time you use it, it&#x27;ll be a lovely mix of soap and germy gunk washing over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New Kid in Town: I just received my Clarisonic Mia 2 yesterday and tried it out. The difference is like night and day. I thought this cheap little number was OK... not great, but it did leave my skin soft and smooth afterwards... The Clarisonic Mia? THIS is smooth skin. I suffer from small breakouts and the occasional cyst, just after my first use all the little bumps and starting pimples are gone... over night. No exaggeration. I&#x27;ll update with a Mia 2 review after a few weeks or so, but I had to say, wow, what a difference. The sensation of cleaning with the mia v. the unit here is quite different. The Mia absolutely gets you a deep clean, it also pulsates against the skin which helps to build up firmness. The brush doesn&#x27;t spin on the Mia, but it absolutely scrubs away everything there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for the Mia 2 review in the coming weeks., one that has a brush I can use my own cleansers on and one that doesn&#x27;t spin and pull my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?

    <li> It has my face feeling fresh, clean and smooth</li>
    <li> Love this facial cleanser! It has two different speeds and the head spins. It works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister. She loves it. I haven&#x27;t actually used it on my face but I tried the speeds out. There are too speeds which is nice. I fits perfectly in the palm of my hand.</li>
    <li> have been using it over a year and i love it. i use it with Neutrogena Wave Deep Clean Foaming Pad as recommended and it really helps me control my acne, specially in summer.</li>
