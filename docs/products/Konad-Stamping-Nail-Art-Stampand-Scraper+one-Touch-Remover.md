      <li>I use konad :)</li>
      <li>I was worried about the quality of this product, because I have read many different reviews, but they are great!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I need more practice but am learning to be able to do it better.  </li>
      <li>My wife used them and really enjoyed them</li>
      <li>(they are replacements) yet, but I LOVE the one touch pump nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>Hope this helps. :)</li>
      <li>The nail polish remover bottle is a top pump.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase!  </li>
      <li>The stamper is better than the knock-off I bought, although the knock off plates are worthwhile.</li>
      <li>The delivery was very quick.</li>
      <li>I also like how easy it is to use polish remover without getting it on my nail art, which I use in combination with the Handsdown circular plastic-backed remover pads that I get from Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>This putter is precise , so easy to get used to.  </li>
      <li>Makes it easy to use remover to clean the plates and holder without ruinings art in progress on your hands.  </li>
      <li>I ordered on 12/17 and got it on the 21st that was great.</li>
      <li>always dispenses just the right amount :)  </li>
      <li>It can be used with one hand and is super easy to use.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this bottle for anybody who does their own nails or owns a nail salon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot of fun!</li>
      <li>The stamper works great the one touch remover was long needed.</li>
      <li>Im sure teens and girls in their early 20s would love to work with it.  </li>
      <li>The burnished head is much easier to use and the most scarce to find.  </li>
      <li>I was fascinated when I saw a video on youtube of someone showing how easy and quickly it was to create fascinating nails, and I knew this is something I must have to make my nail pretty in a short time</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to all who enjoy nail art!</li>
      <li>The one-touch remover bottle is fabulous and super handy, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it for this long!</li>
      <li>, it is really easy and the pump works really well.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and the products made stamping really easy.</li>
      <li>I wish the seller was more consistent because I ordered another one because so many people hadn&#x27;t received the double ended one.</li>
      <li>The two-sided stamp is great; the larger side is awesome for full nail designs and the small side offers better placement control for the smaller designs.  </li>
      <li>other than that I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchases.</li>
      <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Now my friends wanted me to teach them how to use it and we now have our own collection of nail arts and regularly exchange them.</li>
      <li>and I thought it would be handy to have an extra stamp when sharing with friends and doing nails.  </li>
      <li>I use the small end more often because it allows for more precise placement of the images, but the larger end does come in handy for some of the patterns.  </li>
      <li>The double sided stamper is great and the one thouch remover is a plus, it holds about an entire bottle of nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>It was a really great deal to get an extra Konad double ended stamper.</li>
      <li>Loved the stamper the smaller side is terrific, and the bottle for nail polish remover is great, it helps keep the smells down too!</li>
      <li>and i messed up 4 nails the first time.</li>
      <li>It saves the hassle of opening and closing the top on a regular bottle of remover.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews and many people say they didn&#x27;t get the double ended stamper.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what the picture showed...</li>
      <li>i love the double ended stamper, it is so much easier to use than</li>
      <li>so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say the rubber on this stamper is very soft and pliable and produces very crisp, high quality images.  </li>
      <li>Polish remove bottle very helpful in doing nails.</li>
      <li>If you do konad or nail art, it makes it so much easier to put nail polish remover onto a cotton ball without ruining your nails that might already have nail polish on them.</li>
      <li>This item makes it so much easier to apply nail polish remover.  </li>
      <li>Very handy!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>What I really want to gush about is the bottle for nail polish remover that comes with this set.  </li>
      <li>I switched to cotton pads because the dollar store sells them (hahaha)</li>
      <li>It might be a little tricky at first, but it is pretty easy to get the hang of.</li>
      <li>The longer you hold it down, the more it will moisten the pad.  </li>
      <li>The scraper and stamper were both fine, but the remover bottle was empty.</li>
      <li>quite a few people say that they prefer the plastic scrapers, but I find that this metal one works better for me.  </li>
      <li>These are both necessary items to have for Konad nail art, which is fun to use.  </li>
      <li>It also has a little reservoir where you can leave a little pool of polish remover which works great for using cotton swabs.</li>
      <li>I used to use these stamps and special nail polishes to decorate my nails, but give up after a short time of trying as it took way too long for the nail polish and is very easy to mess up and have to start all over.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to the stamping world.</li>
      <li>I received the product quickly and it was what I expected.</li>
      <li>You simply place your cotton pad on the top and push down, and it moistens the pad with one hand.  </li>
      <li>I hope one day Konad will change the stamper color to a clear silicone.</li>
      <li>When the package arrived, I was surprised -</li>
      <li>The one I used worked for about 3 weeks before it completely stopped pumping any liquid out anymore after 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>When i did spend a little time, my nails came out great, but that&#x27;s only happened twice in the past year that i&#x27;ve owned it.</li>
      <li>Or if you only want to travel with a small amount of nail polish remover, just pour half or whatever amount you need into this bottle for easy and light traveling.</li>
      <li>The scraper was damaging my plates, so I found a thin plastic card works much better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The shipping was fast and the products made stamping really easy. I always get compliments everytime I use konad :)</li>
    <li> These items are a must-have for any Konad enthusiast.  The two-sided stamp is great; the larger side is awesome for full nail designs and the small side offers better placement control for the smaller designs.  I&#x27;ve heard quite a few people say that they prefer the plastic scrapers, but I find that this metal one works better for me.  The one-touch remover bottle is fabulous and super handy, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it for this long!</li>
    <li> I like the stuff and it all works. . . but I do not really think you need to buy it if you already have a scraper and a stamp.</li>
    <li> Love this Konad Stamping Nail Art and the One Touch remover is very comfortable !! this is the best package so far</li>
    <li> The delivery was very quick. I haven&#x27;t gotten to use the stamper/scraper (they are replacements) yet, but I LOVE the one touch pump nail polish remover. If you are like me and do your nails often it is a great purchase. It makes it easy to avoid getting nail polish remover on your already done nails when working with your own or someone else&#x27;s nails.   I hope one day Konad will change the stamper color to a clear silicone. Trying to transfer a color that was close to the color of the pink stamper made it very difficult to transfer the image to my nails. other than that I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchases.</li>
    <li> I ordered on 12/17 and got it on the 21st that was great. The stamper works great the one touch remover was long needed.</li>
    <li> i bought Konad stamper and scraper, black and silver nail polishes and a couple of plates from [...] AND I LOVE THE PRODUCT!!!!!!! Everything is great quality and just like in the add. Shipping was real quick! I would highly recommend it to all who enjoy nail art! The images do not transfer to the nails very easily and i messed up 4 nails the first time. But with practice I learned how to work with Konad and I LOVE THE RESULT! It&#x27;s a lot of fun! I want to thank people who invented it!</li>
    <li> Received this on Christmas, with [[ASIN:B003ILUQPM Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]]. This gift totally rocked my world. If you like doing yours or other people&#x27;s nails then this is a must have. It might be a little tricky at first, but it is pretty easy to get the hang of. I would not recommend using the products special stamping polish, because if you get the smallest amount on your fingers it will be incredibly hard to remove. I use a Wet and Wild brand from Walgreens that only costs me a dollar. The one touch remover bottle is not necessary, but I do like it a lot. Again this product is very nice and I would definitely recommend it. Hope this helps. :)</li>
    <li> The stamper with both small and big sizes is a must . . . don&#x27;t just get the one-size stamper.  I bought the one-touch polish remover bottle because I spilled polish remover and ruined a piece of furniture (which already needed refinishing).  This one will still leak if you knock it over, but the damage will be minimal compared to what a half-cup of remover would do.  I also like how easy it is to use polish remover without getting it on my nail art, which I use in combination with the Handsdown circular plastic-backed remover pads that I get from Sally&#x27;s.  Makes it easy to use remover to clean the plates and holder without ruinings art in progress on your hands.  Definitely helps you waste less remover, too, as it takes more than one pump to get the pad wet, so it doesn&#x27;t gush out too much at once.  This would be a nice gift for anyone who likes to do their nails.</li>
    <li> These are both necessary items to have for Konad nail art, which is fun to use.  I need more practice but am learning to be able to do it better.  Polish remove bottle very helpful in doing nails. and I thought it would be handy to have an extra stamp when sharing with friends and doing nails.  Was purchased through Amazon and  service was very good and fast.  Would use them again when ordering nail art.</li>
    <li> I received the product quickly and it was what I expected. I would definitely order from them again if I need something in the future.</li>
    <li> The double sided stamper is great and the one thouch remover is a plus, it holds about an entire bottle of nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> If you are getting into nail stamping, this kit is a must. The stamper is better than the knock-off I bought, although the knock off plates are worthwhile. The stamper works like a charm. The scraper was damaging my plates, so I found a thin plastic card works much better. I use an iTunes card - my credit card was too thick. The one touch remover is an amazing convenience.</li>
    <li> The stamper works as expected, so I can&#x27;t say much that other reviewers haven&#x27;t already covered.  I use the small end more often because it allows for more precise placement of the images, but the larger end does come in handy for some of the patterns.  I&#x27;ve never used the generic brand stampers so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say the rubber on this stamper is very soft and pliable and produces very crisp, high quality images.  The scraper works well, also, but there are a two little notches on the side that get polish in them and are hard to clean.  In terms of functionality, it doesn&#x27;t matter if there is polish in those notches, but it does look a little gross after a while when there is multiple colors of dried polish stuck inside those areas.  What I really want to gush about is the bottle for nail polish remover that comes with this set.  I can&#x27;t believe I ever lived without this!  You simply place your cotton pad on the top and push down, and it moistens the pad with one hand.  The longer you hold it down, the more it will moisten the pad.  I absolutely love it!  No evaporation and no spills.  It also has a little reservoir where you can leave a little pool of polish remover which works great for using cotton swabs.</li>
    <li> Loved the stamper the smaller side is terrific, and the bottle for nail polish remover is great, it helps keep the smells down too!</li>
    <li> i love the double ended stamper, it is so much easier to use than the on ended and the nail polish remover pump is so convienent i cant imagine not using it now!!</li>
    <li> If you are expecting to get a two way stamper,don&#x27;t order this product it&#x27;s not what you get.  The seller sends you a regular stamper and scramper, and gets away with it by the way it&#x27;s titled not by the way it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
    <li> The One touch remover bottle lets you put in your own remover of choice and then you can pump up the remover to a cotton ball without having to use to many fingers, it is really easy and the pump works really well.  It was a really great deal to get an extra Konad double ended stamper.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I did get what was pictured, the double ended stamper, scraper, and remover bottle. I read the reviews and many people say they didn&#x27;t get the double ended stamper. I wish the seller was more consistent because I ordered another one because so many people hadn&#x27;t received the double ended one. It wasn&#x27;t overly expensive and not worth it to return it so now i just have an extra. The remover bottle is amazing though, love it!</li>
    <li> I love this set.The polish bottle is so nice, you don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling polish all over, just pump and it bubbles into the top allowing you to soak it up onto a cotton pad or a q tip, wonderful product. The stamper is Way better than I thought it would be, I purchased it with the bundle monster plates and I get compliments on my nails daily![[ASIN:B003ILUQPM Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]][[ASIN:B004XJNQXW Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 25pc]]</li>
    <li> I found this too hard to work with, but maybe cuz im 20 something and lazy.  Im sure teens and girls in their early 20s would love to work with it.  They do have some neat designs and some boring ones.  When i did spend a little time, my nails came out great, but that&#x27;s only happened twice in the past year that i&#x27;ve owned it.</li>
    <li> Very handy!&lt;br /&gt;Very useful!&lt;br /&gt;Love the one handed operation.&lt;br /&gt;Would pass this on to my many friends who work on their nails.</li>
    <li> I used to use these stamps and special nail polishes to decorate my nails, but give up after a short time of trying as it took way too long for the nail polish and is very easy to mess up and have to start all over.    I was fascinated when I saw a video on youtube of someone showing how easy and quickly it was to create fascinating nails, and I knew this is something I must have to make my nail pretty in a short time, so I got this and [[ASIN:B003ILUQPM Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]]    It took me some trials and errors to grasp the technique to use this tool but it is well worth it. Now my friends wanted me to teach them how to use it and we now have our own collection of nail arts and regularly exchange them.</li>
    <li> this is for nail polish remover. It does not leak or spill. It can be used with one hand and is super easy to use. I love it!</li>
    <li> The bottle is just what I wanted to put my polish remover in. It comes with the Konad Double side stamp set, not the small one. So I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This putter is precise , so easy to get used to.  I have only been golfing 16 months ( 29 handicap ) but this is helping to improve my putting accuracy on a daily basis.  I let a couple of the female golfers try it , low and behold the next week one of them had purchased a white one.  Beware they are getting VERY hard to find. The burnished head is much easier to use and the most scarce to find.  I did alot of research and trying putters and this one is the one.</li>
    <li> I thought that it was the actual remover,It is listed as Konad Stamping Nail Art Stamp&amp; Scraper+one Touch Remover,instead of One Touch Remover Bottle.But it is all good I can still use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the stamping world. The scraper and stamper were both fine, but the remover bottle was empty. There was no indication that the bottle would be empty and I had no idea that you need to fill it yourself. I was disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> My wife used them and really enjoyed them they were very nice, and would recommend them to anyone that does nails.</li>
    <li> When the package arrived, I was surprised - the stamper was the little short one, not the longer two-ended model. I figured I would use it as well, and it never hurts to have an extra scraper so I just went ahead and separately ordered a the two-ended model. I was a little disappointed, but after rereading the description, it just said \\&quot;stamper\\&quot; and did not specify double ended. I guess I was just misled by the image.</li>
    <li> I pour in my nail polish remover and no worries about tipping over the big bottle if I forget to put the cap back on. It delivers the perfect amount onto a cotton ball. If you do konad or nail art, it makes it so much easier to put nail polish remover onto a cotton ball without ruining your nails that might already have nail polish on them. Or if you only want to travel with a small amount of nail polish remover, just pour half or whatever amount you need into this bottle for easy and light traveling. I highly recommend this bottle for anybody who does their own nails or owns a nail salon.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what the picture showed...a double ended stamp with a scraper!  The nail polish remover bottle is really handy too!  Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase!  The nail polish remover bottle is a top pump.  You just put your cotton on it and press.  It saves the hassle of opening and closing the top on a regular bottle of remover.  Plus, the best part is spill prevention!!!  That&#x27;s a BIGGIE in this household!</li>
    <li> Comes with an empty bottle which allows you to add any remover you want into it. And it comes with the mini rubber stamping and scraper.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the quality of this product, because I have read many different reviews, but they are great! Not too soft, not too hard. You push down and it releases the correct amount of acetone! Plus! Is easy to fill! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This item makes it so much easier to apply nail polish remover.  No more filling the cap, or turning the bottle upside down onto a cotton ball to get the acetone.  I switched to cotton pads because the dollar store sells them (hahaha) and they are exceptional with this bottle!  always dispenses just the right amount :)  I definitely recommend this item!</li>
    <li> This product is good and easy to use when you make your nail. Este products the ayuda a hacer el process mas simple the hacer y no Tienes que abril la botella y volver a cerrarla</li>
    <li> Love this pump so I don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking over a bottle of nail polish remover while doing my own nails.</li>
    <li> I bought 2.  One for myself and one as gift.  I only used it 1-2 times a week! The one I used worked for about 3 weeks before it completely stopped pumping any liquid out anymore after 3 weeks.  The one I gave as a gift worked for a while but was really hard to push.  You had to push REALLY hard to get any remover to come up.  A big pain.  I would not recommend.</li>
