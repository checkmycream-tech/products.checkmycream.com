      <li>Love, love, love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Amazon has been the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find this mascara</li>
      <li>Everything ok as announced.</li>
      <li>I am thankful that I was able to find this item on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have another L&#x27;Oreal mascara which is much better.</li>
      <li>I love the shape of the brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal for many years and have been happy with all the different types.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t disappoint, and has quickly become my favorite.</li>
      <li>Eyes look fantastic.</li>
      <li>I was excited to find this product because it was no longer at the store.</li>
      <li>It allows me to choose how much and where I want the most color.</li>
      <li>but it dries out too quick.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this mascara, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than anything else out there.</li>
      <li>What I  like about this mascara is that it  really thickens my lashes and the effect is fantastic.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth a try for you.</li>
      <li>I like the product very much</li>
      <li>Apply to make your eyes really pop!</li>
      <li>I threw it out after the first use.</li>
      <li>The price was right, but the shipping charge was high.  </li>
      <li>The wand makes getting into the corners of my eyes so much easier.</li>
      <li>It worked very well.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t apply to much of you don&#x27;t want to get built and spidery lashes.</li>
      <li>I was excited to find this mascara because I cant find it local anymore.  </li>
      <li>After buying this product in a local store and being satisfied with it, I purchased several of them on line and shared with my daughter.  </li>
      <li>LOreal Telescopic Explosion allows you to apply mascara with more precision to individual lashses, no clumping, low amount of flaking.</li>
      <li>We love the little brush.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I&#x27;ve been saving the brush and washing it between new tubes of other l&#x27;oreal mascaras, but today I used my grandma&#x27;s original explosion mascara</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>When I first tried this mascara I could not imagine how to operate with this brush, but after several days I realized that the shape of brush does what it should do.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this cheaply for touch up on my corner lashes but it honestly is no good for me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if the product is old.</li>
      <li>But it looked like it was repackaged and old.</li>
      <li>I have always used regular brush mascaras and was very intrigued by the brush that this one comes with.</li>
      <li>The brush is round &amp; so much easier to apply , I&#x27;ve used it since it first came out, then I guess they stopped making it, so I get it from Amazon, when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product highly, I like the telescopic wand that allows you to get to every tiny lash.</li>
      <li>I think I am not going to buy it once again mainly because it takes a long time to apply the product</li>
      <li>At least it was cheap, and it is somewhat useable.</li>
      <li>Like the small brush on the tip and washes right off.</li>
      <li>The little round brush makes it easy to get the corner eyelashes.</li>

<li> The little round brush makes it easy to get the corner eyelashes.</li>
<li> The product seemed new, but since I&#x27;m such a clean freak I decided to just throw it away since thinking of it being used freaked me out. :(</li>
<li> It catches every little tiny lash and makes your eyes look wide open.</li>
<li> I am very sad because I love the wand.</li>
<li> If you use a little your leashes will look natural yet magnificently big and long and thick.</li>
<li> Came faster than I expected.</li>
<li> I usually buy the regular carbon black,but couldn&#x27;t resist the chance to try the explosion given the unbeatable price.</li>
<li> Plus the mascara does not clump like other mascara.  </li>
<li> Thea&#x27;s ara is dark and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
<li> Now I ordered waterproof telescopic mascara, and Carbon black.</li>
<li> This round small brush allows you to put product on every single lash including those naughty outer lashes.</li>
<li> meant it would make lashes twice as long or thick.</li>
<li> It does take a little practice/skill to apply it correctly so be patient.</li>
<li> I like the round brush.</li>
<li> How about a few flacks with my mascara?</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this is apparently old because it is gunky and dried up right out of the package :-(  </li>
<li> But the little brush is not comfortable to apply and it&#x27;s hard to remove the mascara.</li>
<li> nOT SURE ABOUT ANY OTHERS</li>
<li> I am not sure if i would buy again</li>
<li> For some reason this is hard to find in the stores.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to make even coats.</li>
<li> I have always loved L&#x27;Oreal products, but this one disappointed me because I hated the application brush.  </li>
<li> I have thin eyelashes</li>
<li> I hate that it has been discontinued in stores.</li>
<li> In the beginning I hated it</li>

    <li> very nice product and a good quality, loreal products almost like MAC product, I will continue ordering. I order 6 Mascara for me and for my sisters and they all like it</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the results</li>
    <li> Amazon has been the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find this mascara and I love it.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this mascara because I cant find it local anymore.  Unfortunately, this is apparently old because it is gunky and dried up right out of the package :-(  At least it was cheap, and it is somewhat useable.</li>
    <li> I have struggled for years finding the perfect mascara for me. LOreal Telescopic Explosion allows you to apply mascara with more precision to individual lashses, no clumping, low amount of flaking. It does take a little practice/skill to apply it correctly so be patient.</li>
    <li> I have always loved L&#x27;Oreal products, but this one disappointed me because I hated the application brush.  I used a brush from another mascara instead.</li>
    <li> Received my mascara, and love how it separates the lashed and extends them..... definitely a repeat buyer of this!&lt;br /&gt;A+&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE SHORT EYE LASHES BUT ALOT WORKS AMAZING. nOT SURE ABOUT ANY OTHERS JUST USED ON MYSELF . AND WORKS GREAT WITH EYELASH EXTENSIONS.</li>
    <li> I like the round brush. It allows me to choose how much and where I want the most color. I hate that it has been discontinued in stores.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this product because it was no longer at the store. The delivery was on time. But it looked like it was repackaged and old. The product seemed new, but since I&#x27;m such a clean freak I decided to just throw it away since thinking of it being used freaked me out. :(</li>
    <li> I love the shape of the brush. Thea&#x27;s ara is dark and doesn&#x27;t flake. That&#x27;s great BUT after a week or so, it came out of the tube with what I thought was a hair stretching about 3 inches from the tube to the brush. The next day, it happened again. Since then, it&#x27;s usable, but stringy.</li>
    <li> How about a few flacks with my mascara? This stuff does not stay on at all. I am very sad because I love the wand. The waterproof stuff is great.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this mascara, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than anything else out there. It&#x27;s OK, just OK. Oh, and I thought the &amp;#34;2X&amp;#34; meant it would make lashes twice as long or thick. No, that &amp;#34;2X&amp;#34; refers to the color . It&#x27;s just a marketing word . . . don&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> The brush was good because my lashes would bulk up. I am not sure if i would buy again but it was good for a while.</li>
    <li> the ball part was a lot bigger than what I thought. I wanted this to get to the tiny corners but it doesn&#x27;t work like that since its too big.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I&#x27;ve been saving the brush and washing it between new tubes of other l&#x27;oreal mascaras, but today I used my grandma&#x27;s original explosion mascara and I forgot how much I actually love this mascara, not just the brush. Finally, it hit me to try Amazon to see if they carried it. I&#x27;m SOOOO glad I found it. Love love love it.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this mascara I could not imagine how to operate with this brush, but after several days I realized that the shape of brush does what it should do. Eyes look fantastic. Now I ordered waterproof telescopic mascara, and Carbon black.</li>
    <li> Did not like how it applied. The mascara was clumpy and weighty on my lashes. I threw it out after the first use. The price was right, but the shipping charge was high.  I have another L&#x27;Oreal mascara which is much better.</li>
    <li> The brush on this mascara is amazing. It catches every little tiny lash and makes your eyes look wide open.Great Product and Greater price.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this mascara. I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal for many years and have been happy with all the different types. When I saw the smaller brush on this one, I just had to try it. It didn&#x27;t disappoint, and has quickly become my favorite. The wand makes getting into the corners of my eyes so much easier. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the intensity or durability.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product highly, I like the telescopic wand that allows you to get to every tiny lash. Apply to make your eyes really pop!</li>
    <li> I like the product very much but it does get clumpy at times.</li>
    <li> love it wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> I love this and can&#x27;t figure out why it is discontinued. Makes lashes explode.  Easier to apply with the ball brush.</li>
    <li> Wow! Love it!!! I usually buy the regular carbon black,but couldn&#x27;t resist the chance to try the explosion given the unbeatable price. It worked very well. Will buy here again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! The little round brush makes it easy to get the corner eyelashes. there is not another brush like this our there anywhere.  Plus the mascara does not clump like other mascara.  I am thankful that I was able to find this item on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have always used regular brush mascaras and was very intrigued by the brush that this one comes with. In the beginning I hated it but it was simply because I didn&#x27;t know how to use it. Once I got a hang of it I can&#x27;t use regular brush anymore. This round small brush allows you to put product on every single lash including those naughty outer lashes. Don&#x27;t apply to much of you don&#x27;t want to get built and spidery lashes. If you use a little your leashes will look natural yet magnificently big and long and thick.</li>
    <li> What I  like about this mascara is that it  really thickens my lashes and the effect is fantastic. But the little brush is not comfortable to apply and it&#x27;s hard to remove the mascara. I think I am not going to buy it once again mainly because it takes a long time to apply the product</li>
    <li> everything was excellent</li>
    <li> Gave it to a teen for Christmas...she loved it. She said she had wanted to try this! happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this cheaply for touch up on my corner lashes but it honestly is no good for me! The wand is so flimsy it&#x27;s hard to make even coats. I don&#x27;t even understand the practicality of this mascara but to each his own. I would never buy another one of these.</li>
    <li> Really love this but it dries out too quick.  But covers every lash.  If you use it several times I notice it dries out so I added some water to mine.</li>
    <li> The brush is round &amp; so much easier to apply , I&#x27;ve used it since it first came out, then I guess they stopped making it, so I get it from Amazon, when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> After buying this product in a local store and being satisfied with it, I purchased several of them on line and shared with my daughter.  We love the little brush.  The consistency of this product, however, is gloppy.  I&#x27;m wondering if the product is old.</li>
    <li> have not found anything for my short under eye lashes that works semi-well except this so it&#x27;s worth a try for you.</li>
    <li> I love this oroduct.  I don&#x27;t know why L&#x27;Oréal stopped making it.  The brush is the best I have ever used.  I have thin eyelashes but the ball brush gets every one and extends them so I actually look like I have eyelashes.  I am so happy I found this product again!</li>
    <li> Everything ok as announced. I recommend</li>
    <li> Have been using this mascara for awhile and all of the sudden it&#x27;s not on the shelves in stores.  Like the small brush on the tip and washes right off.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!  So happy to find it on line because I was having issues finding in the stores.  I am going to buy more!!</li>
    <li> For some reason this is hard to find in the stores.  Glad I was able to find it thru Amazon. Came faster than I expected. I will probably order more makeup thru Amazon</li>
    <li> I love a good product, and innovative,  you must apply well to see the effect, I love loreal products .</li>
