      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>I had a coupon, but I must tell you that this toner is awesome!  </li>
      <li>In just one month I noticed a difference, and now I&#x27;ve been using the product for eight months and it&#x27; is the best!</li>
      <li>It cools and soothes my skin, and the smell is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Beginning with the organic ingredients, the glass bottle, the perfect spray, and the non-sticky feel on your face makes this one of the best toners on the market.</li>
      <li>Very good product.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff!</li>
      <li>Great product quality for the price</li>

      <li>All of the Acure products come packaged very nice and this product is not an exception.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>I tried this product after reading about their Argan Oil serum (AMAZING stuff!)</li>
      <li>I find it very refreshing and a great value.  </li>
      <li>The person I bought it for was very pleased and loved it.</li>
      <li>It is very refreshing and</li>

      <li>I love Acure!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I switched to rose water and saw a difference immediately.</li>
      <li>Since this one lists that it has Calendula, Chamomile and Bulgarian Rose in it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to make my own toner</li>
      <li>product comes in a matte glass bottle which gives it a nice appearance.</li>
      <li>Does what it is supposed to and smells so nice.</li>
      <li>MOST importantly it&#x27;s good to know you are using a product without all the chemicals and is actually safe for your skin/body.</li>
      <li>Being totally honest, it could just have to do with the fact that it has more of a scent.</li>
      <li>on a Refinery29 blog, and have fallen seriously in love with both the Argan Oil and this lovely, effective toner.</li>
      <li>Love the mild smell, my pores are diminished, I use it before the Acure Firming Serum and my skin looks amazing!</li>
      <li>I am very fair with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel and look better.  </li>
      <li>This toner is SO refreshing...</li>
      <li>it became more splotchy (</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and in great condition.</li>
      <li>I love the toner.</li>
      <li>I love that they are natural, yet are still a great product and seem to work well.</li>
      <li>I SO wanted to like this product, because I&#x27;m in love with the packaging, the beautiful glass bottle, the fact that it&#x27;s vegan, cruelty free, all natural, etc. etc.</li>
      <li>, more oily and fine acne bumps on my forehead and around my mouth.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much I would like a toner that you don&#x27;t wipe on, but I love this toner!  </li>
      <li>My skin breaks out extremely easily and switched to using strictly Acure products to take care of my skin over 1 year ago.</li>
      <li>I use a large number of Acure products and I love them!</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I thought the smell was interesting, but now I just love it.  </li>
      <li>You probably would not like it if you don&#x27;t like Rose, however, it is not that strong perfumy \\&quot;Grandma&#x27;s Handbag\\&quot; Rose scent so still might be ok (probably because ACURE&#x27;s toners are not really potent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they are fabulous and well priced for the quality!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>Acure products are also gluten-free, 100% vegan and free from animal cruelty, which should be huge for any consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>when combined with facial products it will leave you feeling great.</li>
      <li>Both seem to use a light hand on the potency of the ingredients</li>
      <li>I love it very much.</li>
      <li>love this whole line!</li>
      <li>This is the only product I have EVER had that kind of result with in 15+ years of battling breakout-prone skin!</li>
      <li>Love this product, very refreshing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had first discovered Acure products in our grocery store natural grocer and immediately loved the product.</li>
      <li>As natural becomes more and more sought-after, pure and clean without sacrificing quality is almost required these days</li>
      <li>I seem to go through it quickly.</li>
      <li>It is gentle, has a pleasant smell and makes my skin feel clean - not dry, not oily, just fresh.</li>
      <li>its environmentally concsious, isnt pumped full with toxins , its gentle, cruelty free and affordable.</li>
      <li>But for now I&#x27;ll stick to my Mineral Fusion Toner, which is MUCH more soothing to my very sensitive combo/acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
      <li>It helps calm my skin during breakouts too.</li>
      <li>My husband and I did a lot of research on EWG&#x27;s website to find the best daily products to replace in our bathroom as we wanted to try and get rid of as many chemicals in our daily life as possible.</li>
      <li>It feels nice to spritz on, but doesn&#x27;t remove any leftover dirt or anything and definitely doesn&#x27;t help with redness.</li>
      <li>Once I started using this again my skin cleared right up.</li>
      <li>Love this toner, just wish it came in a bigger bottle</li>
      <li>For almost $20 after shipping for only 2oz, we sure hope it is.</li>
      <li>this one actually feels like you are using a light Rose water for a facial mist.</li>
      <li>exactly what i have been looking for.</li>
      <li>but since this one has more of an aroma you can actually tell that there is something in there.&lt;br /&gt;Whereas</li>
      <li>I really do like this toner!</li>
      <li>I recently purchased my second bottle of this because I loved the first bottle SO much!</li>
      <li>A soft Rose scent only.</li>
      <li>Although we actually like Hydrating toners over strong astringents we do prefer this one over ACURE&#x27;s Hydrating toner.</li>
      <li>I will certainly continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I spray the product directly onto a cotton ball first to swipe away any remaining makeup or dirt, then finish with a light spray directly on my face and neck.  </li>
      <li>i use a little bit of rose oil and when i&#x27;m done with my face</li>
      <li>60-65% of whatever goes on your skin also goes straight through to your bloodstream.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Quality at a reasonable price and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I went through one bottle and noticed my skin really cleared up.</li>
      <li>I saw this on sale at Whole Foods and decided to pamper myself a bit.</li>
      <li>This is over priced for what it does, which is really nothing.</li>
      <li>I like to mist it on my face a couple times a day, which makes it go away fast.</li>
      <li>Overall, both of their toners feel like you are just misting your face with water, but this one actually has a nice aroma to it that helps you to think it is maybe doing something.</li>
      <li>Acure products and their purity, that is by far the most critical piece in Acure products.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this line of cosmetic products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy Acure products, and I love not having to worry that I am putting harsh chemicals onto my skin.</li>
      <li>I find it takes away any last remnants and leaves my skin super clean, soft, and not at all dry.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy this product; doesn&#x27;t dry my skin,  and leaves my skin soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>Acure facials products have become my new go-to.</li>
      <li>Make sure eyes are closed tightly, not gently as the mist can still get in and sting.</li>
      <li>I really need to spend the extra money for that additional step in the skin care routine?\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin but still like to use a toner after cleansing.</li>
      <li>I use it in the evenings after Lush&#x27;s Ultrabland cleanser.</li>
      <li>Natural, organic ingredients that work well with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Just for reference, I am in my 30s and have sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much I would like a toner that you don&#x27;t wipe on, but I love this toner!  The first time I used it I thought the smell was interesting, but now I just love it.  I like not having to deal with a cotton ball, just spray and go!  I use this every morning and evening before using m TruSkin Vitamin C Serum and my skin is brighter and softer.  I find it very refreshing and a great value.  I was using a more expensive toner and didn&#x27;t really see or feel a difference in my skin.  I highly recommend.  Just for reference, I am in my 30s and have sensitive skin.  Did not cause breakouts or skin sensitivity at all.</li>
    <li> I love the toner. I&#x27;ve been trying to make my own toner but I gave in and ordered one. I love it very much. My only complaint is that I wish it is in a bigger bottle. I seem to go through it quickly. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
    <li> My husband and I did a lot of research on EWG&#x27;s website to find the best daily products to replace in our bathroom as we wanted to try and get rid of as many chemicals in our daily life as possible. I had first discovered Acure products in our grocery store natural grocer and immediately loved the product. We use everything from the company - shampoo/conditioner, body wash, lotion, face wash, this toner and even the facial creams. The price is not too bad, the quality of the products is amazing. MOST importantly it&#x27;s good to know you are using a product without all the chemicals and is actually safe for your skin/body. I am 29 years old and still suffer from adult acne, especially now post-partum, and this toner helps control my acne and oily skin. I use it every night after washing my face and then follow with the acure oil. There is hardly a smell, couldn&#x27;t even describe the little smell it has, does not burn/tingle in any way, very gentle but helps calm acne and the redness. I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> I use a large number of Acure products and I love them! Natural, organic ingredients that work well with my sensitive skin. I will continue to buy Acure products, and I love not having to worry that I am putting harsh chemicals onto my skin. Highly recommend this line of cosmetic products. Shipped fast and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Love this toner, just wish it came in a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> Probably could use water and drop in a tea bag and it would do the same thing. This is over priced for what it does, which is really nothing. It feels nice to spritz on, but doesn&#x27;t remove any leftover dirt or anything and definitely doesn&#x27;t help with redness. I switched to rose water and saw a difference immediately.</li>
    <li> I use this after removing my makeup with pre-moistened towelettes.  I find it takes away any last remnants and leaves my skin super clean, soft, and not at all dry.  I spray the product directly onto a cotton ball first to swipe away any remaining makeup or dirt, then finish with a light spray directly on my face and neck.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Although we actually like Hydrating toners over strong astringents we do prefer this one over ACURE&#x27;s Hydrating toner. Being totally honest, it could just have to do with the fact that it has more of a scent. Both seem to use a light hand on the potency of the ingredients but since this one has more of an aroma you can actually tell that there is something in there.&lt;br /&gt;Whereas the Hydrating Toner just feels like you are spraying water on your face this one actually feels like you are using a light Rose water for a facial mist. There is no \\&quot;tea\\&quot; smell despite the name. A soft Rose scent only. You probably would not like it if you don&#x27;t like Rose, however, it is not that strong perfumy \\&quot;Grandma&#x27;s Handbag\\&quot; Rose scent so still might be ok (probably because ACURE&#x27;s toners are not really potent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are also not sure why this is the \\&quot;balancing toner\\&quot; toner and the other is the hydrating. Since this one lists that it has Calendula, Chamomile and Bulgarian Rose in it (all known for soothing and hydrating) we are not sure whey it is recommended for normal to oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is toners like these that cause people to say: \\&quot;Do I really need to spend the extra money for that additional step in the skin care routine?\\&quot; Overall, both of their toners feel like you are just misting your face with water, but this one actually has a nice aroma to it that helps you to think it is maybe doing something. For almost $20 after shipping for only 2oz, we sure hope it is.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I wanted something as natural as possible for pregnancy. This product works great.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Makes my skin feel and look better.  I am very fair with sensitive skin.  I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended to me by an employee from one of our local health stores.  Good stuff! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it does seems to make my pores smaller.  My cyst have also reduced in size after using it for 2 weeks.  I anticipate it&#x27;ll go away within a week or two.  Make sure eyes are closed tightly, not gently as the mist can still get in and sting.</li>
    <li> This stuff helps me a lot! It is very refreshing and when combined with facial products it will leave you feeling great.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my second bottle of this because I loved the first bottle SO much! My skin breaks out extremely easily and switched to using strictly Acure products to take care of my skin over 1 year ago. I used this toner to help even out my skin tone and help control any sort of acne I get in the winter months. I have been out of the product for several months now and have noticed a change in my skin- it became more splotchy (redness I guess you could say), more oily and fine acne bumps on my forehead and around my mouth. I attribute my recent flair up in skin problems to the fact that I was no longer using this product. Now I know never to go even one day without it! You will not be disappointed in any of the Acure products- they are fabulous and well priced for the quality!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Great product quality for the price&lt;br /&gt;2. Helped control oil &amp; breakouts along with helped with the tone of my skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. None!</li>
    <li> Love the mild smell, my pores are diminished, I use it before the Acure Firming Serum and my skin looks amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I went through one bottle and noticed my skin really cleared up. I ran out and didn&#x27;t buy a new bottle for about a month - big mistake, and I paid in breakouts. Once I started using this again my skin cleared right up. This is the only product I have EVER had that kind of result with in 15+ years of battling breakout-prone skin! It is gentle, has a pleasant smell and makes my skin feel clean - not dry, not oily, just fresh. I use it in the evenings after Lush&#x27;s Ultrabland cleanser. Acure, please never stop making this miracle toner!</li>
    <li> Nothing has ever made my face look so even toned, it also leaves my face refreshed and soft. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions after washing, and my face feels AH-MAZE-ING. I have acne-prone skin and use this after every wash, in the AM and PM. I use this product in conjunction with all other Acure products. I really do like this toner!</li>
    <li> I love Acure! This product changed my skin completely. My esthetician recommend that I use cleanser, toner, serum and moisturizer. In just one month I noticed a difference, and now I&#x27;ve been using the product for eight months and it&#x27; is the best!</li>
    <li> Enjoy this product; doesn&#x27;t dry my skin,  and leaves my skin soft to the touch. Definitely will buy again, soon</li>
    <li> I saw this on sale at Whole Foods and decided to pamper myself a bit. However, when I got home and used it, I realized that the Witch Hazel, a natural astringent, is a bit too drying for my skin. It is not quite irritating to my skin, but not soothing either. I SO wanted to like this product, because I&#x27;m in love with the packaging, the beautiful glass bottle, the fact that it&#x27;s vegan, cruelty free, all natural, etc. etc. But for now I&#x27;ll stick to my Mineral Fusion Toner, which is MUCH more soothing to my very sensitive combo/acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> --------&lt;br /&gt;INTRO&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;Love Acure products and their purity, that is by far the most critical piece in Acure products. As natural becomes more and more sought-after, pure and clean without sacrificing quality is almost required these days and that&#x27;s where Acure excels and makes their products exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;About 60-65% of whatever goes on your skin also goes straight through to your bloodstream. People often forget that our skin is our largest organ and we need to protect it just as we need to protect our internal organs. There are zero harmful ingredients in their line of products and they travel the globe in search for the highest quality ingredients.  Everything they make is free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, harmful preservatives, mineral oil and artificial colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Acure products are also gluten-free, 100% vegan and free from animal cruelty, which should be huge for any consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;QUICK REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in a matte glass bottle which gives it a nice appearance. All of the Acure products come packaged very nice and this product is not an exception. This product is to be misted on the face from about six inches away. In using this product, I hold the bottle about six inches away from my face and spray it three times. The product smells a little different but it&#x27;s not too hard to get over as the smell dissipates as the product dries on your skin. I have noticed a bit of a difference in the redness of my skin around my nose. It appears like it is less red than it was when I began using this product about six weeks ago. I have also noticed that my skin is a bit less oily than it was. I would buy this product if you want to see an improvement in the appearance of your skin. I would recommend this product with ease. Quality at a reasonable price and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;* sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;* cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;* Paraben free&lt;br /&gt;* Gluten free&lt;br /&gt;* PEG free&lt;br /&gt;* Petroleum free&lt;br /&gt;* Phthalate free&lt;br /&gt;* Silicone free&lt;br /&gt;* Won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;* 100% biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;* All skin types&lt;br /&gt;* Recyclable packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Effective, but don&#x27;t expect Botox type results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.ade in the USA&lt;br /&gt;* sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;* cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;* Paraben free&lt;br /&gt;* Gluten free&lt;br /&gt;* PEG free&lt;br /&gt;* Petroleum free&lt;br /&gt;* Phthalate free&lt;br /&gt;* Silicone free&lt;br /&gt;* Won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;* 100% biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;* All skin types&lt;br /&gt;* Recyclable packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Effective, but don&#x27;t expect Botox type results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
    <li> Love this product, very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very small bottle for toner, but I love how it brings life to my face.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been skeptical about face sprays but this one is nice. i use a little bit of rose oil and when i&#x27;m done with my face i&#x27;ll spritz this on a few times and rub/pat it in. i&#x27;ve had no reactions and no pimple problems</li>
    <li> I purchased this from another supplier only b/c I had a coupon, but I must tell you that this toner is awesome!  Beginning with the organic ingredients, the glass bottle, the perfect spray, and the non-sticky feel on your face makes this one of the best toners on the market.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading about their Argan Oil serum (AMAZING stuff!) on a Refinery29 blog, and have fallen seriously in love with both the Argan Oil and this lovely, effective toner. My sensitive, mature skin has never been happier - the toner is terrific, and a bargain at $12.</li>
    <li> I was not sure how I would like this because I am trying to move away from Proactive. Well let me tell you I really like this product. I will certainly continue to use it. Does what it is supposed to and smells so nice. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin but still like to use a toner after cleansing. This is soothing, gentle and decreases my slight redness.</li>
    <li> love this whole line! its environmentally concsious, isnt pumped full with toxins , its gentle, cruelty free and affordable. exactly what i have been looking for.</li>
    <li> Acure facials products have become my new go-to. I love that they are natural, yet are still a great product and seem to work well. This toner is SO refreshing...I love it! It smells great too.</li>
    <li> great tonic not drying but feel cleaner after</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. The person I bought it for was very pleased and loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sitting here wondering how I can make this toner myself. It cools and soothes my skin, and the smell is wonderful. It helps calm my skin during breakouts too. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so dang expensive. I like to mist it on my face a couple times a day, which makes it go away fast. Sad.</li>
