      <li>Extremely fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>But when you first put it on it may appear stronger than you would want.</li>
      <li>so I tend to buy many different fragrant creams.  </li>

    <li> I Love this product&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this scent! Get lots of compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> Everything went well!</li>
    <li> Smells very nice and fruity.  If you do not want folks asking &amp;#34;What smells like Strawberries?&amp;#34;, I would not buy it.  I am not a perfume person. I find all of them to be just too strong and overpowering. I do however like to smell pretty and feminine so I tend to buy many different fragrant creams.  I think this one will be nice to wear periodically in the summer months. Like many of my other reviews I do not use this for moisturizing.  (My favorite for that is Loccitane shea butter hand cream, which I use everywhere not just my hands, Also surprisingly Jergens new BB body creams (not tanners). It smells great and also moisturizes very well!)</li>

    <li> I think this are one of the best Victoria´s fragrances... i would recommend it. Great smell and don&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this out since I love raspberries. I&#x27;ve never smelled this kind before so I was taking a huge chance. When I got it I loved it! It smells so good. Definitely more raspberry than strawberry but you can smell the strawberry too. The smell lasts all day and it relieves my dry skin faster than other lotions. Going to buy some more of this when I run out. Also, the body spray smells just like it.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time and really love it. I love the strawberry scent in it. It&#x27;s bright and very nice. But when you first put it on it may appear stronger than you would want. But give it time because the scent settles down after a bit. If you don&#x27;t want a strong strawberry scent don&#x27;t pick this one. I LOVE the strawberry scent and it stays with me all day. Yummy</li>
