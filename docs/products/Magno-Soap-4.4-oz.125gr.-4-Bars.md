<li> It&#x27;s not drying and has a very subtle scent.  </li>
<li> Questionable ingredients.</li>

    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this soap!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Good feel, wash, soap. Not so pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just how I remember it. Love this soap.</li>
    <li> I have loved this soap since I first discovered it on a trip to the Mediteranian years ago. It is difficult to find at a reasonable price, so I ordered extra this time!</li>
    <li> We really like this soap.  It has a subtle smell and almost feels like you are washing with a lotion instead of a soap.  We would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a true Spanish  treasure used as both a complexion and body soap. It cleans and smooths your face leaving it clean with a delicious scent. The minerals from this soap come from the hills of La Toja at the northeast coast of Spain. I would recommend it to anyone who has combination skin and loves a clean scent left behind after a shower.</li>
    <li> Questionable ingredients. Too bad, love the smell and feel.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap to strip the oil, dirt, and grime and leave you with a lightly scented smell of an ocean with hints of spice.</li>
    <li> We first used this soap in Europe when we were stationed there some 30 years ago.  The whole family loves it and were glad we found it again.  It&#x27;s not drying and has a very subtle scent.  Oh, and it cleans you well.  We intend to keep buying it as long as we can find it.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had gone to Spain many years ago and discovered this wonderful black soap. It was the perfect Christmas gift for her.</li>
    <li> I learn about this soap a long time ago when I did my summer internship with a Spanish girl. She always smelled like a fresh soap. I thought it was her perfume. When we spent a weekend together I saw she had a weird black soap and smell was coming from it. When I travelled to Spain long time ago I bought some but it is long time gone. I was more than happy to find it on line.</li>
    <li> This soap is scented so it is pleasing to both men and women. Finding a soap that both my husband and I can both enjoy has always been an issue, especially since he&#x27;s very sensitive and revolted by most scents. This one is wonderful--just right. And the soap lasts.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Good purchase</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and creamy.  Love the unique fragrance.</li>
    <li> Residual fragrance is wonderful</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> love this soap - has such a distinctive scent.  takes me back to a happy time</li>
    <li> Good product.  Wife loves the soap.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact this is hard-milled soap and is very long lasting in the soap dish.  Reviews were great...however, I am not thrilled with the smell...kinda yucky.  But it doesn&#x27;t linger and therefore does not compete with my cologne, so it&#x27;s ok.  For the price, I probably will keep looking for a hard-milled soap that smells better. LOL</li>
    <li> Love this soap.Makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
    <li> I have been using Magno soaps for about 35 years now.  This is the best soap for washing your face.  I also like it for bathing and I take it in my travel bag wherever I go.  Excellent product.  Hope I can always buy it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this soap for over 50 years. Having trouble finding it as so many previous places have discontinued it</li>
    <li> my favorite soap now. wish the bars were bigger</li>
    <li> This is by far the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;ve used it for years after receiving a bar as a gift from a friend.  It is long lasting, and makes good lather.  It smells wonderful, (not perfumey), and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and vibrant.  I also like their shower gel.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find Magno Soap through Amazon, and at a good price.  My husband loves it and it&#x27;s not easy to find - so the 4 bars I gave him for Christmas were very well received.  It&#x27;s a hard-milled black soap with a subtle fragrance that works equally well for men and women.  Nice big bars, too, that last well.</li>
    <li> What a blessing to find such luxory in the states.</li>
    <li> This looks odd (black soap???) but has a soft, subtle smell that stays with you and won&#x27;t overwhelm the people around you. Hard soap lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> order was on time and just as expected.</li>
