      <li>Nice shine.</li>
      <li>it was almost too good to be true none of those ingredients on my box were on my list !</li>
      <li>I loved how easy was to apply it.  </li>

      <li>After 1st using it more of my hair was coming out in the comb.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll gladly change my review.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>I finally dyed that gray right outta my hair!!!!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Product is okay.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind because it looks like cute highlights.  </li>
      <li>Kept it for 2 hr to make sure it covers the gray.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
      <li>This brand is premixed with a short application time and smells GREAT!  </li>
      <li>I have 60-70% gray and have not been able to color my hair since I don&#x27;t know when.</li>
      <li>I thought it was just going to be this one time but every time since then I been losing more hair whether I&#x27;m shampooing or just styling.  </li>
      <li>I have to color my hair every two weeks even with using a color safe shampoo.</li>
      <li>Now that I know it works, I will be able to leave it longer on the gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I sure hope you are not allergic to hair dye like me, but if you are, try this box.  </li>
      <li>The great thing about it is you can use it as frequently as you need to.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sensitive to Peroxide, so this was a great product to discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>and it is soooo easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle on my hair and it does a wonderful job of covering my white hair.</li>
      <li>IMPORTANT NOTE:  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this product.</li>
      <li>I was freaking out, excited, nervous and sceptical too.</li>
      <li>It was simple to use, and quite pleasant of an experience.</li>
      <li>It makes my shiny and full.</li>
      <li>Some of the gray hair turned to a bronze color,  but it looks cool..........</li>
      <li>BUT it was good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and no bad reaction.  </li>
      <li>I am still lucky to have found this henna cream.</li>
      <li>Quick service.  </li>
      <li>great product, fast shipping we will be back again to shop at your store.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t sleep on my right side.  </li>
      <li>I must admit that the only reason why I chose to use this dye was because it seemed to be the most benign offering at my local Whole Foods in Boston, and because it seemed to have relatively good reviews online.</li>
      <li>The ingredients in the dye I chose were important to me, but I also wanted easy access without waiting a long time to receive the dye of my choice.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>The main drawback for me is, I have to keep in for an hour to get full coverage around my roots in the front of my hair.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to deal with any messy mixes, it comes ready to use and the black tone is a beautiful one, however you must know that your gray hair will look kind of orangish...</li>
      <li>First, if you have longer hair get two.  </li>
      <li>Too many strays of stubborn gray left.</li>
      <li>Bought 3 bottles and followed directions exactly as stated.  </li>
      <li>I had almost 6 inches of white hair showing and mostly on the front.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Surya Brasil Henna Cream before in another color with good results, but there seems to be several different types of henna using this name.  </li>
      <li>Great colour, dark with no redish tones, no allergy at all, more stable after alcoholic fixation (rincing with 30 percent alcohol for 3 minutes).</li>
      <li>even if left on 4 hours, did not cover roots and washed out very quickly and then roots</li>
      <li>Got this for my brother in law as he cannot use the regular hair dyes, they are too strong and cause him to break out.</li>
      <li>test went really well</li>
      <li>When I use real henna infused with indigo and mix it myself it lasts a lot longer than this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle for my hair</li>
      <li>I will purchase another bottle so when its time to dye again (3 to 4 weeks from now), I will be ready.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited but very nervous to end up with open, oozy ears</li>
      <li>but it has a more dark brown burgundy</li>
      <li>I applied the Black Henna cream, made sure nothing comes on the face.</li>
      <li>I would love to have a glossy black, but something to embrace about this dye is that it truly enhances what you already have.</li>
      <li>well, clever marketing.  </li>
      <li>This product came highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>It made my whole head look more of a natural black hair color vs a chemical processed color.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it wet which made it a huge challenge to shower.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything on the packaging about purchasing more than one bottle if your hair is long, but it definitely would&#x27;ve helped with coverage.</li>
      <li>REALLY BIG SMILE.......</li>
      <li>This product is much better and no strong ammonia odor, and more importantly no breakouts or rashes.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I have to live with since my scalp cannot handle peroxide.  </li>
      <li>It looks very natural.</li>
      <li>wow !</li>
      <li>I have tried many different products to cover my grey hair and they all left me with blisters in my head.  </li>
      <li>(ages 13-16), but I let my hair grow out until now that I&#x27;m 24 years old.</li>
      <li>that there is something I can use which is all natural and does not cause me any reactions.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to hair dyes, even the hypoallergenic all natural stuff,  but have no problem with this henna</li>
      <li>Hair was soft after two applications.  </li>
      <li>After using this product, my 4C hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt because it is a natural product, no chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I realize that it might not have the purest of ingredients (based on complaints from other reviewers), but for what is likely the 5th time in my life treating my hair with color, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think the little bottle would be enough, but it was more than enough.  </li>
      <li>It does not cover grey very well.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive skin; allergic to almost every product, not only hair but cosmetics, creams...</li>
      <li>I still am sticking with it because I am allergic to PPD and there are no other hair coloring products out there that lack PPD.</li>
      <li>The black turned out to be more like a dark brown.</li>
      <li>so though it technically covers grays it doesn&#x27;t blend with my naturally deepest brown hair.  </li>
      <li>Henna is natural and does not damage the hair, it actually protects it.  </li>
      <li>My hair did feel conditioned and soft, but the purpose was to get rid of all my white hair.  </li>
      <li>I am 36 years old and have lot of white hair,  I learned not to care.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works like,  but is better than, semi permanent hair dye!  Henna is natural and does not damage the hair, it actually protects it.  I cannot use permanent hair dye without damaging my hair because of my hair texture.  I used semi permanents but noticed it dried and did some damage also.  After lots of research I settled on henna hair dye and then this brand after trying a few others.  Most henna dyes need to be mixed to a texture like coffee grounds and then stinks like dead wet flowers AND takes hours to apply.  This brand is premixed with a short application time and smells GREAT!  I LOVE IT.  It&#x27;s perfect for ME!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair color for past two years. It does not cover grey very well. I still am sticking with it because I am allergic to PPD and there are no other hair coloring products out there that lack PPD. I wish the black actually turned out black. I have to color my hair every two weeks even with using a color safe shampoo.</li>
    <li> First, if you have longer hair get two.  One is not enough.  I have naturally black hair but I am starting to get a few lighter strands after child birth.  I wanted to intensify my hair also because it gets a red tint after being in the sun.  This made my hair soft and it does cover the silver only if you leave it in for a long time.  i believe it says thirty minutes but leave it on an hour.  I don&#x27;t trust the potency either of the henna.  It begins washing out immediately.  When I use real henna infused with indigo and mix it myself it lasts a lot longer than this.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!! You don&#x27;t need to deal with any messy mixes, it comes ready to use and the black tone is a beautiful one, however you must know that your gray hair will look kind of orangish... I don&#x27;t mind because it looks like cute highlights.  What I have noticed though, is that the longer you stay with it, the longer it lasts... the instructions say 60 minutes over gray or white hair, but I stay with it 2 or even 3 hours.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt because it is a natural product, no chemicals.  TRY IT!!!</li>
    <li> Too many strays of stubborn gray left.</li>
    <li> Umm...it doesn&#x27;t last long and since I have read that real henna doesn&#x27;t occur in black...well, clever marketing.  My gray hair turns a pale yellow so though it technically covers grays it doesn&#x27;t blend with my naturally deepest brown hair.  Used this product for a while because I didn&#x27;t want to go with something chemical, but over time it seemed the undertone was either red or purple and for my coloring not flattering.  It does give your hair a beautiful shine after using.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products to cover my grey hair and they all left me with blisters in my head.  This is the only product that has not caused an allergic reaction.  The great thing about it is you can use it as frequently as you need to.  The only con is that it&#x27;s a rinse, so depending on how often you was your hair will determine how long the color will last.</li>
    <li> Henna is a natural curly girl&#x27;s best friend. Nice shine. Fills the gaps in the hair shaft.</li>
    <li> 1-2 hrs for natural color is awesome</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Easy to use. Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> For what it is, and the point in my lifetime that my hair is in, this dye is good. The black turned out to be more like a dark brown. My hair is naturally medium brown with a natural iridescence of gold, amber, and red, but this henna neutralized everything to be solid dark black-brown.  I would love to have a glossy black, but something to embrace about this dye is that it truly enhances what you already have. It looks very natural. I dyed my hair as a teenager (ages 13-16), but I let my hair grow out until now that I&#x27;m 24 years old. In the past I used L&#x27;oreal Feria, but I decided to experiment with something henna based. I must admit that the only reason why I chose to use this dye was because it seemed to be the most benign offering at my local Whole Foods in Boston, and because it seemed to have relatively good reviews online. The ingredients in the dye I chose were important to me, but I also wanted easy access without waiting a long time to receive the dye of my choice. I realize that it might not have the purest of ingredients (based on complaints from other reviewers), but for what is likely the 5th time in my life treating my hair with color, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I&#x27;m allergic to Parabens and I&#x27;m sensitive to Peroxide, so this was a great product to discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that I have long hair. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8 with a relatively long neck and my hair reaches my bellybutton.  I should have used two bottles to fully saturate my hair. I didn&#x27;t notice anything on the packaging about purchasing more than one bottle if your hair is long, but it definitely would&#x27;ve helped with coverage.</li>
    <li> It did not change my hair color... I used it twice and followed all the instruction but it did not do anything other than conditioning the hair</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use a mixture of Black and Dark Brown on my hair. I finish it off with an Apple Cider Vinegar Mix.  This product makes my hair feel thicker and you wouldn&#x27;t believe the shine. My hairdressers marvel over the great condition of my hair.  It covers the grays up well.  When it fades, the gray turns a deep reddish color which is complimentary with dark brown hair. I color it once a week or every ten days. I will never go back to the chemicals.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  Tried twice.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;m tired of scammy products!  Secondly if my problems with this are due to user error I&#x27;ll gladly change my review.  I don&#x27;t have a ton of gray hair but have just enough that I like to cover a few of them.  I hate Just For Men and feel it&#x27;s terrible to put those harsh chemicals on your head.  Thought this stuff might do the trick.  Left it on some grays for one hour and nothing.  Washed it out and all grays were perfectly intact with no change in color whatsoever.  Is there some secret magic trick to make this garbage work that I don&#x27;t know about?  Like I said, I&#x27;ll change my review if there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing wrong and this stuff actually works....</li>
    <li> I am allergic to all hair coloring products, This Surya Brasil Henna Cream is the only hair color I can use. It is very gentle on my hair and it does a wonderful job of covering my white hair. It also last about 3 weeks. I do not have any allergic reactions whenever I use it. I am still lucky to have found this henna cream.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother in law as he cannot use the regular hair dyes, they are too strong and cause him to break out. This product is much better and no strong ammonia odor, and more importantly no breakouts or rashes.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. The product is great. And the customer service was excellent. Thank you very much. It is my second purchase of this product and with no doubt i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping we will be back again to shop at your store.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Man, this product is WONDERFUL.  I finally dyed that gray right outta my hair!!!!!!!!!  Hair was soft after two applications.  I will purchase another bottle so when its time to dye again (3 to 4 weeks from now), I will be ready.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  Some of the gray hair turned to a bronze color,  but it looks cool..........REALLY BIG SMILE....... I am happy, happy, happy</li>
    <li> This is the only henna I use.  I am allergic to hair dyes, even the hypoallergenic all natural stuff,  but have no problem with this henna and it is soooo easy to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews unless I really loved or hated a product.  I hope this review helps someone who also has severe allergies to hair dye.  About two years ago, every time I dyed my hair whether I did it at home or at an \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; hair salon, I ended up itching like crazy.  I itched so bad I had scabs all over.  I noticed the itching increased each time I dyed it.  In July 2014, I colored it again at home, it was the worse reaction ever.  Two days later, my face was on fire! my ears and face felt like they were cooking from the inside out.  I had tiny bumps that got worse as the day progressed.  I had people stop me and ask me if I had sun poisoning.  A month or so later, the back of my ear opened up from the tip to the bottom of the ear.  I was oozing non stop a yellow thick liquid.  There was nothing I could do to protect it.  I tried wrapping it which only made it worse because whatever fabric touched the opened ear, it got stuck.  I couldn&#x27;t get it wet which made it a huge challenge to shower.  I couldn&#x27;t sleep on my right side.  I ended up sleeping on the couch on my left side for two months.  Then my left ear started to open up, needless to say, it was very hard to sleep.  My pillow and hair were covered in yellow crust from my ears.  I cannot began to tell you how awful I spent 4 months until my ears and face finally healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had blood work done and no answers! I did not dye my hair for almost a year.  I am 36 years old and have lot of white hair,  I learned not to care.  I had almost 6 inches of white hair showing and mostly on the front.  I learned to like it, but there were days that it did bother me.  The idea of going through that again made me like my gray hair.  I finally got my lazy and scared butt to an allergist.  He did a patch test and after 48 hours I finally had an answer, severe reaction to one chemical used in hair dyes.  They had me go back the next day after the patches were removed (total of 72 hours) I ended up with a total of 4 chemicals that were in the \\&quot;hair panel\\&quot;.  I was determined to find one that would not have those ingredients.  I called Aveda, Redken, and other \\&quot;organic\\&quot; \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair dyes.  It felt like finding a needle in a hay stack.  I mentioned that I am allergic to 4 chemicals BUT each one of those names have between 6-15 other aka names!  I almost gave up! I went to Whole Foods again and looked again when one of the attendants heard my story and pointed out this box Surya Brasil Henna and in my hair color - Black ! I didn&#x27;t have my list of ingredients with me, but I bought it anyway.  I ran home and compared all the ingredients ! it was almost too good to be true none of those ingredients on my box were on my list ! I was so excited but very nervous to end up with open, oozy ears again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and left it on my hair for 30 minutes. I was freaking out, excited, nervous and sceptical too. I loved how easy was to apply it.  When I used to color my hair at home with box hair dyes, my hair always tangled so badly but not with this Henna cream! wow ! I could run my fingers through all of my hair.  It felt so silky! I have long and a lot of hair! I didn&#x27;t think the little bottle would be enough, but it was more than enough.  I washed my hair, and it was sooooo silky!!! In the back of my head I was still worried that I would end up breaking out again.  It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and no bad reaction.  I can tell you that it did cover the gray, not 100% like other hair dyes BUT it was good enough for me.  It made my whole head look more of a natural black hair color vs a chemical processed color.  My gray looked like highlights, like a shiny brown. Now that I know it works, I will be able to leave it longer on the gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this, I sure hope you are not allergic to hair dye like me, but if you are, try this box.  You have nothing to lose! At least I know that I am putting less chemicals in my body.  As I&#x27;m typing this review, I get chills just to remember what happened to me last year.s review, I get chills just to remember what happened to me last year.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product. It&#x27;s already pre-mixed so all you have to do is apply to my hair. One bottle does 2 color treatments, but my 4C hair is short. I have a TWA. After using this product, my 4C hair soft and manageable. The main drawback for me is, I have to keep in for an hour to get full coverage around my roots in the front of my hair. I usually do other household chores to past the time. I&#x27;ve never tried it with heat under the dryer, so that may speed up the proces if you&#x27;re short on time. It&#x27;s gentle for my hair and I don&#x27;t feel the damage that I do with other hair dyes. It makes my shiny and full.</li>
    <li> Not as advertised, there are chemicals mixed, takes forever to get any color if any that also not black almost purplish red</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product. After 1st using it more of my hair was coming out in the comb.  I thought it was just going to be this one time but every time since then I been losing more hair whether I&#x27;m shampooing or just styling.  I tried to be fair and wait to see if the hair loss would continue.  I&#x27;ve used Surya Brasil Henna Cream before in another color with good results, but there seems to be several different types of henna using this name.  Anyway, this particular one was definitely NOT GOOD!</li>
    <li> I had never dyed my hair before. This product came highly recommended.  It was simple to use, and quite pleasant of an experience. I have thick black curly hair with plenty of greys on top. After following the directions to a T, my white hairs were all still white.  My hair did feel conditioned and soft, but the purpose was to get rid of all my white hair.  It did not. At all. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have already reviewed this product, I can never say enough about how well it works for me. Thank you</li>
    <li> Not working on my grey hair at all!</li>
    <li> I purchsaed two bottles of this Surya Henna, followed their directions and none of my gray hair was colored.  This may work for other women but not me!</li>
    <li> Bought 3 bottles and followed directions exactly as stated.  It does not cover gray hairs at all!  Big waste of money and an even bigger waste of time.  I sat around for 3 hours on the last treatment with a plastic cap on my head for nothing.  My hair was clean and dry and even rinsed it off with cold water and used no shampoo.  What a useless product!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have 60-70% gray and have not been able to color my hair since I don&#x27;t know when. I have a very sensitive skin; allergic to almost every product, not only hair but cosmetics, creams... you name it and I would be allergic to it. So I was very skeptical. I have used Henna powder before but i run away from the mess; and since this is Henna base cream and considered all natural with No PPD, Parabeans, amoniya etc, and I wanted to cover my grays so bad, I decided to try it out. I did the sensitivity test behind ear just to make sure I don&#x27;t land up with rashes or swelling.&lt;br /&gt;The test went really well and I did not feel a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I applied the Black Henna cream, made sure nothing comes on the face. I was so paranoid the first 15-20 min, but seriously did not even feel any itch, any irritation nothing at all. It just felt like my hair was all wet. Kept it for 2 hr to make sure it covers the gray.&lt;br /&gt;AND IT DID! The results were amazing! It is not 100% black but it has a more dark brown burgundy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure for how long would the color stay after using shampoo a couple of times. But I am very SATISFIED! HAPPY! that there is something I can use which is all natural and does not cause me any reactions.</li>
    <li> Quick service.  Product is okay.  Color do not last too long, but it is expected since it does not contain peroxide.  That&#x27;s what I have to live with since my scalp cannot handle peroxide.  I have to color my hair every 2 weeks, but I stretch it to 3 weeks.  Not good for me, but I am too lazy to do it so often!</li>
    <li> Great colour, dark with no redish tones, no allergy at all, more stable after alcoholic fixation (rincing with 30 percent alcohol for 3 minutes).</li>
    <li> even if left on 4 hours, did not cover roots and washed out very quickly and then roots&lt;br /&gt;turned red/purple and had 2 different colors going on.  have allergies to hair dye but this is not the solution. just doesn&#x27;t do the job as well as i would like it to.</li>
