      <li>Feels very good on the skin!</li>
      <li>and I love it!!!!</li>
      <li>works great</li>
      <li>but when I wake up in the morning my skin feels great.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve written a novel instead of a review, so to condense: great product;</li>
      <li>but, even it it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer by itself.</li>
      <li>This serum is amazing!</li>
      <li>JUST AMAZING!</li>
      <li>I came along this product and couldn&#x27;t believe the amazing results!</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>but it feels good</li>
      <li>Good for the winter weather.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the tea oil scent doesn&#x27;t overpower the product which was a concern for me.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this oil blend!</li>
      <li>But I had to stop using it because it made me break out (tons) more!</li>
      <li>do love it!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s wonderful and keeps my skin clear.  </li>
      <li>love this stuff ...</li>
      <li>I added this serum to my nightly skincare regimen and I have to say my skin is doing a lot better.</li>
      <li>and my skin is looking so much better.</li>
      <li>As always, please use your own discretion for what you feel comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now, I have noticed better skin</li>
      <li>my skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>So i decided to look for it online to purchase:)</li>
      <li>I suffer from hormonal acne and this serum, combined with my favorite CeraVe moisturizer</li>
      <li>so I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I wish I could say I love this.</li>
      <li>and I accidentally used a bit more.  </li>
      <li>It was okay,</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month (started around the end of February) and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>This smells good and hydrates the whole face in  1-2 drops.</li>
      <li>I saw results very quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and I like it.  </li>
      <li>I only use the toner first, because I find the serum works best on damp skin.</li>
      <li>Super healthy.</li>
      <li>The return was fast and easy though, nice customer service.</li>
      <li>Best product ever, hands down!.</li>
      <li>is hypoallergenic, fragrance free, etc.</li>
      <li>It feels like light oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving how this product makes my skin feel: soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t stop acne completely but will lessen it a good deal; I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Works great and doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and flaky.</li>
      <li>When I apply it during the morning (pimples seem to pop up mostly during the day for me, but not so much now since I&#x27;ve started using this), I do it a couple of hours before I put on my make-up in an attempt to maximize what my skin absorbs.</li>
      <li>It keeps my face nice and soft.</li>
      <li>So after moving, and a while later on finding this fabulous stuff, I&#x27;ve never had better skin!</li>
      <li>I have used numerous products before and this simple oil works best.</li>
      <li>I sometimes mix it with vitamin c powder to heal blemishes quickly.</li>
      <li>has cleared my skin up quickly.</li>
      <li>Super zit zapper 👊</li>
      <li>The smell is not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>At first the oil is counterintuitive for acne sufferers but trust me it works!</li>
      <li>but I have found that the results are better if you apply directly to the skin.</li>
      <li>So I try to stick to a more natural approach now when it comes to skincare and get the ones with ingredients that I can understand.  </li>
      <li>have done what tons and tons of prescription medications haven&#x27;t been able to, clear my skin of acne.</li>
      <li>I only use it at night after i wash my face and re damp with rose water.</li>
      <li>Thanks !&lt;</li>
      <li>First time for me to try this</li>
      <li>I would first wash off my makeup then wash my face was with the &amp;#34;body shops&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>At the same time, it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed very quickly.</li>
      <li>: my acne are not completely gone, but it does seem better.  </li>
      <li>If there&#x27;s anything I didn&#x27;t really like about that product</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much change yet, but I will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>(Living in the high desert didn&#x27;t help either!</li>
      <li>, very smooth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it absorbs very well</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really like how oily it made my face.</li>
      <li>product really smells like tea tree, almost medicinal</li>
      <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>: If you are PREGNANT, this contains Rosemary, which may stimulate the uterus &amp; promote flow, possibly causing miscarriage.</li>
      <li>It seems to be of a generous amount for that price and for those organic ingredient, so I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend it) and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about 9 months and all I can say is WOW!!.</li>
      <li>I have been fighting acne all my life due to hormone issues, which I&#x27;m slowly figuring out, always trying to find better &amp; more natural methods to control.</li>
      <li>A little something about me before we get started: I have adult acne, mostly hormonal and mostly cystic, that usually comes to my cheeks.</li>
      <li>after the first night i used it i noticed my acne drying up the next morning</li>
      <li>I tend to get hormonal breakouts and was a little leery of putting oils on my face right before bed, but this is really light and the littlest bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this with african black soap (which I LOVE and reviewed...</li>
      <li>Hopefully my acne will clear up.  </li>
      <li>Too early to tell if it will reduce the blemishes yet</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon and to seventh generation BRING it BACK!</li>
      <li>But so far, I like the texture, smell and the natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Since this is all natural ingredient and no chemicals, I will keep on trying it....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if it works.  </li>
      <li>I really appreciate this product, a little bit too liquid but works very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and has made my adult acne go away unlike every other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Only used it once so far.</li>
      <li>All essential oils guides will tell to to stay away from rosemary while pregnant, so maybe wait until after little one arrives.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stop my acne completely, but it definitely lessened the amount I&#x27;m used to getting, and the ones that do pop up don&#x27;t seem as big or red as before when I wasn&#x27;t using this</li>

<li> pump is a bit wonky; when I use it, it&#x27;ll leak tiny amounts of product, just enough to grease up the sides of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> When I apply it at night, I try to wash my face a few hours before I actually go to bed, because I feel like the stuff sits on my face and will get wiped off all over my pillow.&lt;br</li>
<li> The clearing serum with tea tree is thinner than I expected.  </li>
<li> For this reason, I do wish Seventh Generation made one of their serums without rosemary, or some of the other well known oils that don&#x27;t mix with pregnancy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll probably try the other Boost products too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this stuff ... I have been using it for about 6 months and it&#x27;s wonderful and keeps my skin clear.  I just use it at night.</li>
    <li> I love this oil blend! I have been fighting acne all my life due to hormone issues, which I&#x27;m slowly figuring out, always trying to find better &amp; more natural methods to control. Part of my face&#x27;s problem was realizing it was too dry. (Living in the high desert didn&#x27;t help either! Ha!) So after moving, and a while later on finding this fabulous stuff, I&#x27;ve never had better skin! It soaks in!! I put it on only at night before going to bed. I hope they keep making this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love it! But I also have one cautionary thing to add...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: If you are PREGNANT, this contains Rosemary, which may stimulate the uterus &amp; promote flow, possibly causing miscarriage. All essential oils guides will tell to to stay away from rosemary while pregnant, so maybe wait until after little one arrives. As always, please use your own discretion for what you feel comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For this reason, I do wish Seventh Generation made one of their serums without rosemary, or some of the other well known oils that don&#x27;t mix with pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from another supplier earlier this year, but I have been unable to find it again until now. This serum is amazing! This product has limited the number of pimples on my face, minimized scarring, and enhanced the overall tone of my skin. I use it in the morning and at night after cleansing and applying toner. I only use the toner first, because I find the serum works best on damp skin. I have also tried mixing the serum with my moisturizer (as directed on the box) but I have found that the results are better if you apply directly to the skin.</li>
    <li> Feels very good on the skin!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. works great</li>
    <li> I really appreciate this product, a little bit too liquid but works very well. The smell is not unpleasant. Thanks !&lt;br /&gt;Ben</li>
    <li> Super zit zapper 👊&lt;br /&gt;Works great and doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving how this product makes my skin feel: soft and smooth! Too early to tell if it will reduce the blemishes yet but, even it it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer by itself. Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the tea oil scent doesn&#x27;t overpower the product which was a concern for me.</li>
    <li> I have dry/combination skin with acne and blackheads.  I tried using Proactive but my skin only gets worse and inflamed...probably because of all the chemicals in Proactive.  So I try to stick to a more natural approach now when it comes to skincare and get the ones with ingredients that I can understand.  I received this 7th generation clearing skin serum this morning.  After I washed my face, I put 3 pumps of this onto my damp face.  The instruction said one or two pumps and I accidentally used a bit more.  It has an oily texture.  At first I was skeptical and afraid that oil would only make my acne worse and make my face super oily.  But it absorbs very well and I checked my face 3 hours after and it doesn&#x27;t seem oily.  Should use only 1 or 2 pumps like the instruction said though.  I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can smell the tea tree in this serum.  It&#x27;s not too strong and I like it.  It seems to be of a generous amount for that price and for those organic ingredient, so I highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s too early to tell if it works.  But so far, I like the texture, smell and the natural ingredients.  Hopefully my acne will clear up.  I will update after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE: my acne are not completely gone, but it does seem better.  I do still have a few acne, but my skin seems smoother.  Since this is all natural ingredient and no chemicals, I will keep on trying it....just have to be patient</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with cystic acne and a little bit of scaring on my face. I came along this product and couldn&#x27;t believe the amazing results! I would first wash off my makeup then wash my face was with the &amp;#34;body shops&amp;#34; tea tree oil face wash, then pay my face dry and apply some of this Keeva cream on my face and it would tingle in a relieving way. I saw results very quickly. If there&#x27;s anything I didn&#x27;t really like about that product it&#x27;s just that it didn&#x27;t last too long but I will definitely be re-ordering!!!!! I highly recommend this product to anyone with troubled skin</li>
    <li> I just use it for a few days. So I don&#x27;t feel any difference for now. But it doesn&#x27;t make my skin get worse.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far. Will see how it works.</li>
    <li> First time for me to try this and I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could say I love this. But I had to stop using it because it made me break out (tons) more! It took a couple of days of use for that to happen. Just in time for a weekend trip. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this with african black soap (which I LOVE and reviewed...highly recommend it) and Thayer&#x27;s aloe/rose water/witch hazel toner. I have kept using them but stopped the tea tree oil and my skin is looking so much better.</li>
    <li> Only used a couple times but it seems to be moisturizing without clogging my skin.</li>
    <li> I added this serum to my nightly skincare regimen and I have to say my skin is doing a lot better. I tend to get hormonal breakouts and was a little leery of putting oils on my face right before bed, but this is really light and the littlest bit goes a long way. It feels a little greasy putting it on but when I wake up in the morning my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> JUST AMAZING! I&#x27;ve used this product for about 9 months and all I can say is WOW!!. I suffer from hormonal acne and this serum, combined with my favorite CeraVe moisturizer have done what tons and tons of prescription medications haven&#x27;t been able to, clear my skin of acne. It keeps my face nice and soft. Believe it or not it is not oily, only when its being applied, after that, its like the skin drinks this like crazy!. Super healthy. I hope this guys don&#x27;t discontinue this product. That is all I want to say. Best product ever, hands down!.</li>
    <li> I found this at walgreens a few weeks ago, and decided to give it a try. I am amazed by the results! So i decided to look for it online to purchase:) i have to be cautious of what i put on my skin, but this product. is hypoallergenic, fragrance free, etc.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a couple years now.  I have combination acne prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. I sometimes mix it with vitamin c powder to heal blemishes quickly. I have used numerous products before and this simple oil works best.</li>
    <li> This smells good and hydrates the whole face in  1-2 drops. Good for the winter weather.</li>
    <li> has cleared my skin up quickly. I only use it at night after i wash my face and re damp with rose water. after the first night i used it i noticed my acne drying up the next morning</li>
    <li> The clearing serum with tea tree is thinner than I expected.  It feels like light oil.&lt;br /&gt;I like pumps but this one is messy.  It comes out from the sprout and the sides.  I like the green color bottle though.&lt;br /&gt;The product really smells like tea tree, almost medicinal but it feels good, very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Retin-A Micro at night, a moisturizing wash in the morning, this and then sunscreen moisturizer.  Without this in the winter, I would get a pimple once a week and dry skin because of the weather.  Now, I have noticed better skin so I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ll probably try the other Boost products too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s gentle and has made my adult acne go away unlike every other product I&#x27;ve tried. At first the oil is counterintuitive for acne sufferers but trust me it works! I mix one pump with my moisturizer and my skin has never looked better. I have been using it for a year and was devastated they stopped making it so I bought a 2 year supply. Thanks Amazon and to seventh generation BRING it BACK!</li>
    <li> Added a little extra tea tree and it works wonders</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Felt so very thick and clogged up my pores. The return was fast and easy though, nice customer service.</li>
    <li> It was okay, didn&#x27;t really like how oily it made my face. I had to wash it off because I couldn&#x27;t sleep at night with it on...</li>
    <li> A little something about me before we get started: I have adult acne, mostly hormonal and mostly cystic, that usually comes to my cheeks. So far, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month (started around the end of February) and it&#x27;s great. It didn&#x27;t stop my acne completely, but it definitely lessened the amount I&#x27;m used to getting, and the ones that do pop up don&#x27;t seem as big or red as before when I wasn&#x27;t using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is oily, in the sense that it&#x27;s liquidy and will spill if you&#x27;re not quick, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy (unless you use a lot). At the same time, it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed very quickly. When I apply it during the morning (pimples seem to pop up mostly during the day for me, but not so much now since I&#x27;ve started using this), I do it a couple of hours before I put on my make-up in an attempt to maximize what my skin absorbs. When I apply it at night, I try to wash my face a few hours before I actually go to bed, because I feel like the stuff sits on my face and will get wiped off all over my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is a bit wonky; when I use it, it&#x27;ll leak tiny amounts of product, just enough to grease up the sides of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I&#x27;ve written a novel instead of a review, so to condense: great product; won&#x27;t stop acne completely but will lessen it a good deal; I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much change yet, but I will continue to use it.</li>
