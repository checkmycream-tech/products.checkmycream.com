    <li> My daughter and I absolutely love this soap. It smells amazing. I love that is moisturizes and has antibacterial in it as well. All the other antibacterial soaps don&#x27;t smell so great. I discovered this soap a few months ago, now you can&#x27;t find it in the stores. Is it really that popular or are yall discontinuing it Dial? Please don&#x27;t, we love it and I am not a body wash kind of gal. Bar soap all the way!</li>

    <li> Love this bar soap.  Can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.  Either they have quit making it, or everyone else likes it too!</li>
    <li> Love the smell; I’d say it’s more of a feminine product, due to the lavender/floral aspect. I was happily surprised that this did not dry out my skin. I don’t use the white or gold antibacterial Dial bars due to the fact that they either a) dry out my skin, b) leave a heavy residue on the skin, or c) both. With that being said, my go-to Dial bar that offers antibacterial AND moisturizing qualities has been Dial Aloe Antibacterial bar soap (the green bar). For me, the Dial Lavender bars provide the same results as Dial Aloe. I’m glad that I now have two varieties to select from when I want a moisturizing antibacterial bar soap.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I am so disappointed that it is no longer in stores. I use this product daily and  I have no need to use  insect repellent of any kind with daily use of this product. Mosquitoes and other insects absolutely do not like this product!</li>
