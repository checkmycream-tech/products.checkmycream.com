<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, goes with my kitchen plus I like using loose sea salt in my cooking so this is prefect to sit on my counter.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this was not what I expected and it was immediately returned.</li>
    <li> Love! Matches all my kitchen stuff and is perfect for storing pink Himalayan salt!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son-in-law  who is  quite the chef.  He was thrilled with the design and  color.  It was the perfect gift.</li>
    <li> Beautiful jar that holds a pound of finely ground sea salt.  The only reason it didn&#x27;t rate a five is that the lid is a little warped.</li>
    <li> This item was perfect. Ordering was so simple, and it arrived much quicker than I expected. It&#x27;s also beautiful on top of the ease of ordering! Thank you!</li>
    <li> What more can be said?  This Cobalt Blue salt jar is absolutely gorgeous.  Beautiful and functional - and just the right size.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I expected. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift. My daughter loved it. I also purchased the Malden flaked salt and it was a hit. She put it on her stove and it matches her other blue depression glass.</li>
    <li> Loved it even though it was a little smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so preferable to trying to use salt out of the box it comes in.  Pretty too.  I put Kosher salt in mine and have had no caking problems at all even though it sits beside my stove where it can get a little steamy from time to time.</li>
    <li> Looks great and holds one full box of Maldon salt.  Wish it had a gasket on the lid so it wasn&#x27;t glass on glass though.</li>
    <li> Look around for a salt holder and you&#x27;ll find a few that look good, but aren&#x27;t very practical. This is heavy, looks good and holds a ton of salt safely. I have course gray sea salt in mine and it sits on my stove. The top just sits on the base, so it you need something more &amp;#34;secure,&amp;#34; then this won&#x27;t work, but I love it, and the color is good.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Great color.  Nice durability.  I can get my hand in there easily.  Reminds me of Grandma.</li>
    <li> Way bigger than I had imagined.  Way too big.</li>
    <li> Love it, great for my kosher salt</li>
    <li> Great size, beautiful cobalt blue.  I keep it on my stove.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with it yet, but I love blue glass. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll think of something!</li>
    <li> Cute, colorful addition to my all white kitchen. Make sure measure it is larger than expected.</li>
    <li> Awesome cobalt color and the size was as expected.  Quality appears to be great.</li>
    <li> A little larger than I expected, this is beautiful and very practical</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a salt container for years but never found the right size until now.  Love the cobalt blue and it holds a great deal of salt for easy access.  Love the product and it arrived appropriately packed and on time!  Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Works well for kosher salt</li>
    <li> Blue Glass is good .... you can use the top to look at people with and they look blue ..... showed that to my wife and she said I had magical powers over blue people .... I said no ... I just had magical powers over light .... she said &amp;#34; Oooooh .... &amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t think she knows what that is ....</li>
    <li> We Bought this for our daughter and she loves it. It is reminiscent of the type that her great grandmother might have used. Perfect for when you need just a pinch of salt.</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly suprised that the color true cobalt blue.  Photo does not do  justice to the  actual color. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is very big, too big for salt, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for salt.  I actually use it to put half pound of butter in so I can leave it on the counter and put the cover on (my butter dish is always so messy this contains it more neatly for me).  Very good looking, and matches my salt and pepper and sugar shakers.</li>
    <li> Needed a salt jar for the bags of ground sea salt that I pick up for cooking/baking. Love the quality of the thick blue glass!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Love this item. Nice deep cobalt color and heavy glass. Great for sea salt. Love the nostalgic feel, very cute in my kitchen.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece however it was not packed well and arrived with a broken lid. I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Love the salt cellar, it was just what I was expecting.  Exceptional quality and was packaged perfectly!</li>
    <li> Love it. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Really love this. Had a clear one and broke the lid. This one is just as nice and I enjoy the cobalt color.</li>
    <li> Cool but very fragile.</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture and is very pretty sitting on my counter .I would buy again. And received it in a few days .</li>
    <li> It is much bigger than I expected, fits a whole box of salt,  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This salt holder is prettier than the picture- a real cobalt, bold but bright, blue. And it holds a LOT! I bought Maldon sea salt and it fit the whole bag of it! I&#x27;ve already gotten a couple compliments, and just have it sitting out on my counter- looks great- a very good buy!</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery &amp; love this!</li>
    <li> Great cellar as I bought accompany the other one  I have.  The lid fits nicely and makes it easy get off and put back in place.</li>
    <li> This salt cellar is high quality, dark cobalt blue glass and a wonderful large size (I can put my whole hand inside it).  I am able to keep my salt next to my stove protected and it looks beautiful!  I must admit I feel like a professional chef every time I dip my fingers in to get salt for what I&#x27;m cooking...  I was concerned that it might not work well because of the high-humidity climate in which I live, but there is no problem with salt sticking together!  Therefore, it is beautiful, a good size, and does what it is supposed to do!</li>
    <li> not as nice as the green salt container..too slick and reproduced looking.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this salt cellar. It is just what I was looking for. The color is accurate - unlike the green, which was much darker than the photo appears. I like that there is no seal around the lid, it makes it easier to get the lid off one handed.</li>
    <li> I love it, looks pretty on my counter top, and holds plenty of salt.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Nice solid glass I a beautiful cobalt blue. It is so much easier to keep salt on my cooking space now</li>
    <li> This is a very nice salt cellar. The color is very rich and beautiful! The lid is also glass, which is hard to tell in the picture.  I love this!</li>
    <li> Very nice and useful piece of kitchen equipment. i use it for other things than salt, like jam and different toppings for toast.</li>
    <li> Love this container for several reasons. One because it&#x27;s cobalt blue. Two it adds to and enhances my collection of cobalt blue kitchen items - salt and pepper shakers, salad dressing cruet,  vases, glasses etc. Three, it adds a spark of panache to the cooking process - salt pinched from such a lovely container. Four, it&#x27;s substantial and seems to make the salting process a special experience - like going back to the sea :-)</li>
    <li> Very cool, my wife is happy! Nice retro style.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful salt cellar and I love the size.  It was just what I was looking for to hold more than just a little salt.  I use it everyday.  The lid sits perfectly in place. I like that it is glass and that it is thick and sturdy.  The color is gorgeous too.  I have the blue one which looks just like the picture.  I&#x27;m considering getting the green one too sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This container is a wonderful size (1 2/3 cup capacity) and can be used for many things other than salt.  It would make a very attractive storage container or serving dish for butter, sour cream, sugar, creamer, and so on.</li>
    <li> I love my Miles Kimball Cobalt Blue Salt Cellar. It is a lovely addition to my kitchen decor as well as a highly practical addition to my cooking implements. Salt is always ready for a pinch or a measuring spoon. There are no holes to clog, it&#x27;s just heavy enough to withstand whirlwind cooks and the lid keeps debris out.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the package protected against breakage with out being bulky or too hard to open. I received it right on time and got a nice email too. Thanks Miles Kimball and Amazon.</li>
    <li> This lasted a little over a month.  When I received it, I could see that the glass was of poor quality.  However, I rather enjoyed using it on occasion.  This evening I wanted to use it to salt my eggs.  I was over a hot stove, big surprise.  I lifted the lid about 1 inch, and it slipped bach to the jar, and broke in two pieces.  I was going to use a pinch of salt anyway, but could see blue particles of glass in the salt.  My Mother had a depression era salt cellar that had a hinged wooden top.  I recommend getting one like that.  It you could get something dating back to the 20&#x27;s, even better.  You know that it was made to last.</li>
    <li> Perfect coloring and smooth edges.  Stands out just like I wanted for my kitchen.  Have received many nice compliments on my new salt cellar.</li>
    <li> Even better then expected, the blue is bright and beautiful!</li>
    <li> love it - plan on ordering another one shortly</li>
    <li> This is so pretty. Something you would like to have sitting out by your stove.</li>
    <li> looks like a noxema jar</li>
    <li> beautiful glass but much too large for table use. not worth sending back as postage too much.</li>
    <li> If you buy from &amp;#34;Miles Kimbal&amp;#34; they will send you spam after the purchase. I HATE when a company misuses my information... I&#x27;ve been getting other spam from other company&#x27;s, I am afraid that they sold my email address.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Inexpensive, color is true to picture, lid is easy to get off and on. It&#x27;s big enough that I can fit a small 1/4&amp;#34; teaspoon inside to scoop out the salt.</li>
    <li> Color is just like the picture.  It is larger then I wanted but looks nice so I am keeping it.</li>
    <li> Looks great on my counter!  Love the color.</li>
    <li> I love the look of true blue thick cobalt glass, and this cellar is exactly as depicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I was surprised by the size - it&#x27;s huge, and can hold enough salt for a small army...!&lt;br /&gt;I guess I didn&#x27;t realize that the size stated was actually that large.</li>
    <li> Exactly as it is described and very quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Perfectly Designed for appearance and function. I now use sea salt exclusively to avoid harmful ingredients in Table Salt. This works well for storing the sea salt on top of stove and looks classy doing it.</li>
    <li> Great, holds large amount of used rubbers</li>
    <li> I collect cobalt kitchenware, this will be a great addition to my collection.  I appreciate how carefully packed it was.</li>
