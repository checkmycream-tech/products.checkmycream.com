<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband and after 3 months we didn&#x27;t see much of a change. I found an It Works distributor[...]  and purchased Hair Skin Nails from her website and my husbands hair growth has been AMAZING. His hair is thicker, fuller, and the bald patch is diminishing. He has been taking it for 2 months now so I&#x27;m eager to see what his results are like after 6 months using the supplement.</li>
    <li> It works! It works! i have used a lot of products without success.. but i can see new hair coming.. this is amazing.. few but new hair is coming, I have used the product for 10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Updates to follow...</li>
    <li> I got some of this stuff after noticing a lot of hair falling out on my pillow and in my shower a couple months ago. My hair loss has decreased considerably and has actually made my hair feel softer and fuller. The smell is also not unpleasant, and therefore not offending my wife.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my stepdad two months ago for his birthday.  He has mild thinning in the hair and after using this product for two months, his hair is a lot fuller and the thin spots are hardly noticeable now.  I am so happy with this product! My step dad feels so much more confident now and its all because of this advanced hair regrowth spray! Its so easy to use too!</li>
    <li> Initially when i used all over my sclap , actually i observe increased in hairfall and itching.&lt;br /&gt;After that i tried to apply at blad spot on the corner of frontal hair line , I didnt  observe any regrowth.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now and I must say the results were pleasantly surprising.this treatment actually produces tangible results withing a few days. I actually noticed my hair becoming thicker in areas which previously had little to know hair. Another concern I had was if it would have a negative effect on the health of the hair I still had. I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage and my hair still feels as healthy as it did before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I was worried my thinning hair would eventually render me bald which was my greatest fear. Product after product failed me as my hair continued to thin. However this product  gradually thickened my hair as the weeks went by.</li>
    <li> Thanks! This product worked for me. I have gifted this product to my boyfriend and both of us are happy with its results. Within three months of using it, he was able to observe great improvement. The product is quite simple to use with definite results. With the hair regrowth, my boyfriend was able to regain his confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for NuNutrients for this wonderful product. A Highly recommended one!</li>
    <li> The best way to describe my husband&#x27;s head before and after using this product was less of one thing and more of the other.  Just to be clear - before using this product, my husband had a receding hairline in the front and he had a bald spot in the back that had become more noticeable recently.  He&#x27;s also at that age where he&#x27;s becoming sensitive to these changes which is why, I guess, he bought this product in the first place.  He&#x27;s been using it for about six weeks now and I&#x27;m not sure WHAT the change is, but there has definitely been one.  Before, he had less hair and more of a bald spot at the back.  Now he seems to have more hair and less of a bald spot.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - the bald spot hasn&#x27;t disappeard but it&#x27;s less noticeable.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because this regrowth system makes his follicles thicker or whether the hair&#x27;s actually regrowing.  The jury&#x27;s still out on that one but there&#x27;s definitely been an improvement and old hubbikins seems pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> This spray is a good product to buy to prevent your hair from thinning.  In addition, if you are currently losing hair, I recommend this product because it has helped me out a whole lot.  I am now starting to see a regrowth of hair at a fast rate.</li>
    <li> My husband started thinning last year. He&#x27;s not even in his mid-30&#x27;s yet, so we started looking into products that will help. We&#x27;ve read dozens of product reviews...and have tried several of those items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried shampoos from Nioxin and other companies. We&#x27;ve tried Rogaine products...moose, treatments, pills...etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then finally we tried NuNutrients. After a month of using it, we were able to tell the difference. My husband&#x27;s hair is noticeably thicker, and he hasn&#x27;t had any issues or odd reactions. Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product worked.  Starting about a year ago I started to lose my hair.  I&#x27;m only 25, so I don&#x27;t know why this is happening to me.  After reading about it I realized it could be physical stress, lack of protein, etc.  Honestly, I feel kind of embarrassed.  Normally I don&#x27;t care about my looks that much, but it embarrassed me when my friend ask why is your head shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few hair growth product I got at my local market, but it didn&#x27;t really show any noticeable sign to my hair growing back.  I ran into this product and it was quite expensive, but I decided to give it a try.  I was quite desperate.  I have used this product for 2 months now and my hair is slowly growing back.  I think I might order another one and Amazon actually have the better price compare to where I got it before.</li>
    <li> My husband started balding about a year ago and it&#x27;s really been taking a toll on him, I head about this NuNutrient product after just walking around in the mall and I saw it, He and i were skeptical at first because it was just a spray and we thought how could a spray really help hair growth! After a lot of thought we figured what&#x27;s the harm in it. I&#x27;ve been making sure he&#x27;s been using it everyday for the past six months and it&#x27;s really been working!&lt;br /&gt;  his confidence has really gone up since his hair starting growing back and now he swears by the product, he loves it! He just sprays is everyday on his scalp and it&#x27;s been really helping and i&#x27;m really glad i found it for him! even i have been noticing the results and it&#x27;s really been helping his attitude which is great! i definintly recommend this product for any man who is suffering from hair loss! and ladies you will see the difference in your man&#x27;s attitude as well!</li>
    <li> DHT hurts hairlines. That&#x27;s a fact. And biochanin A can battle it. Give it a shot because I didn&#x27;t do any reading beforehand and now that I know about it I&#x27;m glad because I swear some of it is coming back. Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> looks like it may be starting to work after 2 month use</li>
    <li> I suggested my roommate try NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth for Men. He&#x27;s like an older brother to me and he is really insecure about his thinning hair and bald spot. Frankly, I think he&#x27;s adorable with the bald spot but it bothered him so bad I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt for him to try one more thing. He&#x27;s tried several products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think it would do anything except make my roommate feel better about himself. Like drinking diet soda doesn&#x27;t help me lose weight but I feel better drinking it. I was surprised that after 2 months I saw the difference in my roommate. Quite simply he had more hair! This product works! Well I&#x27;ll be damned! Plus, my roommate loves the convenient spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Scam. No regrowth at all. Multitude of 5 star reviews look like they were written by a small handful of people. We&#x27;ll played, NuNutrients, you got me. Switched to a clinically proven product with Minoxidil.</li>
    <li> I have used it for over two months and it didn&#x27;t work. You have to realize that everyone is different. It didn&#x27;t work for me. I am trying a different product. It is called,  Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic.</li>
    <li> My husband started showing signs of male-pattern baldness last year. In a panic, he tried a bunch of different products looking for a miracle. I ordered this product online for him to try and it has literally restored his self-esteem and his hair is really growing back!!! It&#x27;s thicker than it was in his younger years too! The only side effect is that it is really fragrant... but only until you wash it out.</li>
    <li> I tend to agree with the reviewers giving this product a low rating, that the high rated reviews are probably coming from one or more persons with a financial interest in the product. Have been using for 3 months now with no noticeable change. It smells good and is easier to apply than rogaine, but it just does not seem medicinal at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my stepdad who was starting to get bald spots. He&#x27;s been using it for a little over a month and yesterday when I saw him I surprised at how much his hair has started to thicken. My stepdad is mid-fifties and he finds the spray bottle easy to use and he also indicated that he&#x27;s had no bad reactions or breakouts to the serum. Great product!</li>
    <li> It is beginning to look a lot like... Well this is such a great gift it does feel like.  And what a gift it is.  I am seeing hair regrowth after many failed attempts with other products. What&#x27;s more it is so easily to apply and there is no messiness.  Really impressed with its ease of use and how quickly it works.  I feel 20 years younger as I am well on my way to the hair style I had 20 years ago.  Finally an affordable hair regrowth product that really works</li>
    <li> Think this might work I think this stuff might actually work. I have seen it work in front of my eyes, with my friend and my uncle. So when I started to bald, I knew what to get. Hope.</li>
    <li> Okay, we all know that thinning hair is a sensitive topic, and one that causes a lot of distress for the man in my life. I bought this product for him, not expecting the anywhere near the amazing results he got from just a few weeks of usage. His hair is thicker and fuller, and now I love running my fingers through it. He&#x27;s much more confident and feels younger and sexier. His thinning hair never bothered me, but I hated to see the way it knocked his confidence.</li>
    <li> I found this product and thanks to NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth I have staved off that fear for now. And will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seeing a lot of hair follicles starting to form after using this product. I&#x27;m still thinning but a lot less than before. Will continue to  use this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. It&#x27;s so easy to use on a daily basis. The serum isn&#x27;t greasy or oily and it smells great! Within just a few weeks I could see improvements in the thickness and fullness of my husband&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s so soft too, my husband&#x27;s hair never looked so sexy.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend with thinning hair and it is helping him, but it&#x27;s taking time. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This spray is my husbands best friend. After suffering with hair loss and thinning for over ten years, this product was recommended to me for my husband. Once I convinced him to give it a try, we both noticed a change in the volume in his hair within a month! Five months later, my husbands head is full of thick, healthy hair. To sum things up, we&#x27;re customers for life. We love NuNutrients!</li>
    <li> I approve, it reacted excellent with my hair. Within a month my hair has seen progress. It is great on the go whenever I&#x27;m going on a date as well which are more often. Great product!</li>
    <li> First of all, the box came in all mangled up.  There&#x27;s not much instruction to this product.  Just apply twice a day.  Doesn&#x27;t say how long to keep it in before washing your hair.  The product smells fine, nothing great, nothing bad.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, I haven&#x27;t seen any progress.  I think my hair looks healthier in general but haven&#x27;t seen any regrowth.  There&#x27;s irritation, although I have noticed my scalp seems a bit more dry than usual.  The biggest negative I can say is the direction says to spray until your scalp is damp.  Well, if you still have hair like me, it&#x27;s going to take at least 6 sprays each time to get your scalp damp.  Which means this bottle is only going to last me a month probably.  It is annoying because they expect you to see results in 2 months.  So I have to buy another bottle to see results?  If I don&#x27;t see results after this bottle  I&#x27;m sorry but this product is just too expensive to continue purchasing, but if it does work, then I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> After a few months, I would say four or five months, I am seeing small results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very encouraging and I think it’s great. I am super happy doing fist pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many types of items and none of them have achieved anything of this kind of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it’s not that much, maybe like a few millimeters here and there but that means at some point maybe it will grow even more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this for a few weeks and already noticed some improvements, great product and it gives some great natural looking results. I&#x27;ve tried countless hair regrowth products but this is the one that did the job for me. Extremely happy customer. 5/5 from me.</li>
    <li> Like many others I bought this cause of the many 5 start reviews... Should&#x27;ve checked them better though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product and started using it, the very first application I got lightheaded, weak and tired. Jumped on here to check and see if this was just me or of this was happening to others and found at least 2 or 3 others who had similar side affects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the 1 star reviews before buying. What threw me off is many of the top reviews on this product, the profiles wrote reviews for many other products. Then I paid a little more attention and noticed pretty much all of their reviews for other products were 5 stars and that a number of the top reviewers on this product REVIEWED MANY OF THE SAME PRODUCTS WITH 5 STARS!!! Meaning they are fake accounts that people are using to produce or purchase fake reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your homework, check the top reviews and see for yourself... This definitely not a legit product.</li>
    <li> This is an ideal product if you want your head of hair to be thicker. The formula promotes hair growth in an easy to use spray. It is hard to believe that just by spraying something on your head your hair will regrow. The truth is that this product is just that easy to use and it&#x27;s that effective.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  His hair is thinning, not a lot but enough to start using these kinds of products.  He really likes this one and has noticed the help it is giving his hair and scalp.  He recommends it to guys with a lot of balding or just some thinning of the hair.  It works and is great for anyone -- not just men!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother because he&#x27;s self conscious about going bald. After a few weeks of using this his hair has started to get thicker and even started to grow more to his liking. If he likes it, I love it. Check it out if you&#x27;re in the same situation</li>
    <li> Tried other products, didn&#x27;t work I tried all other products on the market, and sometimes it was the same product but a different brand. I guess I am a sucker. But I have good hopes about this one. Because it is filled with different chemicals than the ones I have previously bought. I am confident this time around and I thank this company for offering up an alternative.</li>
    <li> good so far, 3 months in we&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> All I can say is that , NuNutrients is an affordable way for men to see regrowth. I offer this product to my uncle. He  have tried other products but this one seems to be the safest and more remarkable. I also like the easy way to apply by using a spray bottle....or if he chooses to spray it in his hands. We are seeing great results and love that it too is made here in the US! I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using it on the top of my scalp and my receding hairline.  What else can I say plain and simple other than... This stuff is very effective!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband after he noticed that he’s leaving hair on his comb, the sink and the tub. Appearance plays a big part in my husband’s job and thinning hair wouldn’t look good. We tried different products but, the NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment is the one that we actually saw real results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started seeing results within two weeks and now I can’t seem to get him away from looking in the mirror. He got his self-confidence back all thanks to the the NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment. This is a product that I will recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a bald spot on my head and sometimes it bothers me. I have tried hair treatments in the past and they were a waist of time and money. This one made my spot appear smaller and you could barley tell I have one. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I am glad that i found this NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth product and has opened that door for me for hope that my hair will come back. Hoping begins now.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that this product works as good as it does. I noticed results after 2-3 days of usage. I use this along with Nioxin and man it has been a life saver. I had an abusive relationship a few years back and clumps of hair were coming out regularly from stress. I had since gained most back from getting healthy and nioxin but it had not regained its fullness. It is well worth the money! For what little it has done, it has really changed my life!</li>
    <li> This is the big day of my life when my hair is coming back to my life. I really feel like i have now more confidence than before i was balding.</li>
    <li> My hair was actually long before, so when it started to fall out it was more embarrassing, like a guy with long hair and a bald spot. I cut it short and started all the products and found out they didn’t work until I got to this one.  Infinite is the best.</li>
    <li> I read something once that when a product works, you don&#x27;t hear anything  about it. But when it doesnt work, everybody becomes a critic! Im glad to say that this one works. I put this on the vertex of my head, DAILY for multiple weeks. Im really noticing a difference in not only new growth, but also the thickness of my hair.</li>
    <li> My mantra is try and try until you succeed. This product works and even though not as quickly as one would hope in time to look your best for your best friend&#x27;s wedding in three weeks time, I am definitely seeing some progress with the regrowth and have no regrets</li>
    <li> Most hair regrowth formula I have experience with tends to either vie on the sides of painful, cumbersome follicle growth or an ineffectual waste of twenty dollars. NuNutrients really does it right, targeting on the chemicals that prevent hair growth rather than forcing steroid induced ointments or creams to the scalp. Also, it requires very little use! I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle I got from the store six months ago and am only now on the last third if the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FDA approval also puts me at ease while using this product, as most hair regrowth formula I&#x27;ve experienced doesn&#x27;t usually contain that warning. It&#x27;s inexpensive, guaranteed and super easy to use.  Don&#x27;t let the paltry 2-oz bottle fool you, because even a little bit of this formula this will start working wonders in just days!</li>
    <li> This product is everything I could have ever hoped for.  One of the main things I was looking at when searching for a hair growth treatment was the FDA approval.  I was very pleased to see that this product was not only made in the USA, but also FDA approved.  Big thumbs up! I&#x27;ve been a single dad for almost a decade now.  Since my kids are both in college, I figured I would try to get back into the dating scene.  The only thing holding me back all these years was the fact that my hair looked like garbage. I was seeking something that made me look younger and more appealing to the ladies, if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray was pretty easy to use.  I&#x27;m a goofy and uncoordinated middle age man and this was pretty simple to use.  Just spray it on and rub it in.  Piece of cake.  From what I&#x27;ve read, the active ingredient called Biochanin A is what makes the difference in this product. I&#x27;ve tried a few cheaper brands, and you definitely get what you pay for.  I honestly can&#x27;t see myself using anything other than this for the rest of my life.  My friends barely even recognize me with my new full head of hair! 5 stars for sure.  Great product!</li>
    <li> My confidence is building up and because my hairline is coming back now.</li>
    <li> after 3 months of use this stuff appears to be working.  I have new growth through out my head.  I also see that my hairline has began to move down.  I also feel that my hair feels more healthy over all.  One negative is the small container.  The reality of one bottle lasting 3 months is a pipe dream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reaching a point for I&#x27;m slowly but surely losing hair. This is mainly near my temples, which are arguably the most important areas for hair. I wanted a quick but safe solution that assisted in hair regrowth. I came across this and have definitely been impressed so far using it. It does as advertised with no bull****. Good quantity is provided for the price so it&#x27;s a great value overall. Great for those who know what they want!</li>
    <li> I got this product for elder brother who&#x27;s hair getting thicker day by day. He used a lot of hair treatment product but none product is effective, Then he used NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment . After some time his hair is back.</li>
    <li> This inhibits the chemicals that stops hair from growing. I&#x27;m not a scientist so I&#x27;m not sure but I think it looks right. Also it&#x27;s different from other products I have seen on the market.</li>
    <li> I have used 2 bottles of this, for the equivalent of 6 months, and I HAVE SEEN ZERO RESULTS.  In looking closer at all the &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; reviews this product has had, DO YOUR RESEARCH.  A lot of these user feedback either only have ever reviewed one product, THIS ONE, and it was an unverified purchase (meaning we don&#x27;t really know they purchased it).  In other &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; reviews of this product, you&#x27;ll find people whom reviewed several &amp;#34;health care&amp;#34; products but nothing else, and all the products have a strange &amp;#34;tie&amp;#34; to each other such as all coming from a company called Verified American.  On top of that, if you start comparing one customers review history with another customer&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll find they were reviewing the exact same products as each other.  By the time I looked at review history for 10 &amp;#34;people,&amp;#34; 5 of them had reviewed the same ~10 items!  It&#x27;s like someone is trying to boost overall sales of a company&#x27;s products.  I even found one reviewer whom said with one hair loss product that they were &amp;#34;lucky&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t start losing hair until their 40&#x27;s.  Then, in a review for another hair product, THE SAME PERSON said they started losing hair in their 20&#x27;s.  VERY FISHY.  Our should I say, SNAKE OIL.  Buyer beware.  I am never buying this product, or anything from this company again.</li>
    <li> I am very encouraged by the results and I am ecstatic. It took months but the work paid off.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! It seems to be filling in a little bit and I couldn’t be happier. Love these  product so much.</li>
    <li> My friend suggested me to use this product.I used many products for healthy hair. But all other products are very expensive and waste. Now I am very happy with this remarkable product.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Hair Regrowth is a treatment used to reduce baldness.  NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth works by stimulating hair follicles.  One bottle lasts for three months.  Priced just under $60, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> My brother&#x27;s hair was greatly thinning. He tried several hair regrowth products.  He was not satisfied with any of them. That changed with NuNutrients. This product worked. My brother is a notoriously tough critic, and he recommends this product.</li>
    <li> Must say I was skeptical but thought I would give it a try after hearing Dr. Oz talking about Garcinia Cambogia. It was only been a week but I can tell a difference especially in my appetite. I take it an hour before meals and it really does help you feel fuller and satisfied much quicker. Thanks</li>
    <li> I can not say yet... needed more time, but my wife says see new little hair coming...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it, it does nothing... been using for 4 months not a single hair all these 5 star reviews are fake.</li>
    <li> I am super happy with the results with this product. I use it twice a day and after about five or six months I saw my hairline start to sprout little buds and I swear it grew back like half an inch already after seven or eight months. Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> I saw the sproutage in my head and my confidence is back. I have a spring in my step and I recommend this product if other hair growth products haven’t worked for you.</li>
    <li> I am happy to report to you that my wife says I look different—I have more hair now. I have been using this item for a few months now, and I think I forgot it was part of my routine because I blanked it out since I wasn’t seeing anything. It’s hard to tell day to day what I look like but since my wife says my hair looks fuller, that’s good enough for me to keep using it! Great results. Keep it up, guys.</li>
    <li> Feels good to have a little more hair on my head than six months ago. If I had known about this product earlier maybe I could have save more of it. I’ll take it, though.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment i bought this for my brother. His age is 37 he started to experience hair fall in few days. And he worried a lot. I bought this product and gave to him to use regularly. After few days i got a positive reply from him. That hair fall stopped in a great way and he can find a little growth also.  Now his mirror is so happy to resemble his lovely hair. It energize scalp and make hair to grow and give a healthy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who ever dont like a healthy hair and a healthy scalp. I reccommend this product to all who starting hair fall. Try this product in early stage and avoid more hair fall.</li>
    <li> Well, too bad I did not do my research well enough and bought this product. As someone already has mentioned it here - the product has a lot of fake reviews.  First of all many of them are not verified purchases. The second - just go ahead and pull some of the 5-start purchaser&#x27;s other reviews... See something weird?  Many of them reviewed products such as NuNutrients, Brilliant White, Garcia Cambodia and many others with 5 starts -it just weird...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have been on this product for almost a month now - I see no effect whatsoever. Another rip-off</li>
    <li> This is a good price for a very good product, I have many relatives who have used it with much success. Myself, I just started a couple months ago and I am hoping I have similar results as my brethren.</li>
    <li> I have a feeling that this is an individual reaction to this product but everywhere I put this stuff hair grows thicker. Maybe I’m just really sensitive to DHT but it’s like a magic wand that makes things pop up. Probably only works on my head but I’m not about to try to use it elsewhere! So 5 out of 5 stars for me. I’ve found my new buddy and that buddy is thick, luscious hair.</li>
    <li> I read through the reviews and bought this for my dad. He’ balding and whatnot, but he went ahead and decided to shave it all off. So I have this bottle worth 50 bucks sitting around for nothing. I got sad for no reason because then I started losing my hair too. Well started using it because why not and guess what. My dad shaved himself bald and here I am with my hair standing strong and looking good. Thanks for the opportunity I probably wouldn’t have bought it myself.</li>
    <li> I will keep using this product for sure, and although it’s torture to watch it work so slowly, it’s a good torture. Excited to for my hair to come back.</li>
    <li> After used bunch of hair regrowth product, I almost gave up my hair until I tried this. I&#x27;m an Asian and currently in type IV hair loss pattern. Hair growth is very noticeable in the first couple week and slowed down after that.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months, no side effect has been discovered.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try this for a year and see how it goes.  It is a little pricey​ though, but if it gets back your hairs, who cares!</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for a few months now and I have more hair now. Feeling happy :)</li>
    <li> Wow! I am impressed. This balding thing is for the birds. It started out gradually but accelerated rapidly the past couple years. I was shocked, however, when I noticed a bald dude in one of those elevators that have mirrors on all sides. No place to hide. No denying it. That bald dude was me. Not long after the elevator door opened I started a quest for solutions. I knew I didn&#x27;t want plugs or anything painful or complicated. I tried a few products that sounded awesome on the infomercials. Nothing seemed to work. But this product works! NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment actually works. I have a head full of hair again. And I don&#x27;t avoid mirrored elevators any more. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I used it for almost six months before I saw anything happen to my head. It takes a while, guys. Like weeks or even months to see some results. You cannot just expect it to be miracle grow, it has to be step by step in order to get great results. But now I have some growth and I’m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad, and you&#x27;d not believe the difference. After a few short months, his hair has not only more volume, but more hair! He looks ten years younger, and his self-esteem is starting to catch up with his head of hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> product was good, just need to be consistent and put it on daily.</li>
    <li> solid product, good service. like how easy it is to use this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m 33. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me and I doubt it has worked for any other genuine customer who has bought this. I&#x27;m posting this as &amp;#34;5 stars&amp;#34; so more REAL customers will see it instead of my review being hidden away like all the other 1 star reviews from actual customers. A lot of people have been tricked in to buying this crappy product by all these fake accounts who are falsely giving it 5 stars and raving reviews. Don&#x27;t buy this product, its claims are completely bogus. Save your hard earned money. Trust me, It&#x27;s a scam.</li>
    <li> It takes a few months to work for me so have patience when using this product, but it worked for me.  Just have patience.</li>
    <li> I see results and it speaks for itself. Will continue using this porduct as I really seen with my own eyes that this porduct is very effective.</li>
    <li> My husband has very thin hair at the top of his head . This product really help with strengthening the hair follicles while stopping hair loss . Glad I bought this product for him.Worth every penny .</li>
    <li> I brought this for my boyfriend, have been using for two weeks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use, quick regrowth, able to use without forgetting (no set schedule), noticeable change in less than a weeks use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The bottle seems small BUT seriously lasts about 3 months with twice a day use! DO NOT USE MORE THAN 2x A DAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have your doubts with these 1 star reviews remember: why would I take the time to review if I hadn&#x27;t used the product myself? My boyfriend is very happy and it has renewed his confidence.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day for beat results.I’ve read the reviews on this Amazon page and try it,  when I see a little bit of sproutage in my scalp. I think it must be working on me. And gain some confidence.</li>
    <li> I  see results and it speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> I used some other products and none of them did anything. Thankfully I found this and I use it twice a day and after a few months I have found that it works a little bit.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to have a nasty smell like other serums i tried but it didnt. Seems to be effective so far.</li>
    <li> I just got the product and it looks good. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but ill update my review after i see results</li>
    <li> This is the product that Amazon should reconsider its rating I m using it every day no result. While so many 5 stars it has</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give 2 thumbs up - 1 for not shedding as much hair in the shower, another for how easy it is to use.</li>
    <li> Bad Product EVER !!&lt;br /&gt;My hair fall more than whitout that product !!&lt;br /&gt;Dont lose money ! buy a Rogaine foam</li>
    <li> It’s taking months to sprout  hair growth to my head and it’s nothing like I was when I was in my teenage year. I am encouraged by the results and I hope it has good results for you too.</li>
    <li> This product is easier to apply and will accept my hair fate. and the good faith happen, my hairline is creeping back, I am happy to say  it’s slowly coming back.</li>
    <li> I can believe it. My hair is back again. I really miss my hair. Thank you so much NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My hair might be thickening up on top. My gf is telling me it looks good. I have been using it for six months. So far I am not sure, but I will keep going because it is encouraging.</li>
    <li> This product will give you erectile dysfunction, do not use it. It will not do anything for your hair. Almost all the 5 star reviews are fake.</li>
    <li> I have used many other products to prevent hair loss and this one is a good value. It took a few months to work out but with these things that is par for the course. Enjoying the results and expecting future success.</li>
    <li> I used this product and it took me 6 months to get a good results. I am really encouraging everyone to just wait and make NuNutrients and Time do the work.</li>
    <li> Would buy more, in fact, I am buying more. Because it helped me with a tiny balding spot but I am afraid it will return. So I am using it over and over again and hope that this success will not need to be replicated.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for two months and we&#x27;re both astounded at the results. He has used a lot of hair regrowth products and this one you could notice his thinner strands getting thicker and thicker (he mainly has issues at the very top of his head). I&#x27;m also impressed at how much product there is, especially for the price, because we have purchased things that were much more expensive and less effective. I think that this could last another two months at the rate we&#x27;re using it. He&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad because his hair started falling out. Of course this happens the older you get. I was a bit skeptical of course. There are so many different products but based on the reviews I purchased it and it&#x27;s been working great so no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend awhile back. He is 35 years old, and his hair has been thinning for quite some time. He&#x27;s a good looking guy, but I was totally not ready for him to be completely bald. Luckily, this product did the trick. No more of his hairs in the tub and in the sink, and his hair is starting to look thicker! It definitely helps stop hair loss, and maybe even helps to regrow hair that was already lost. We will see what happens with the next bottle!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> After having thinning hair for the last ten years I finally decided to give something a try.  I didn&#x27;t wanna use one of those expensive surgery options due to the amount it would cost and questions if it would work so I was trying to find a cheaper and safer option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product online and after reading up on it decided to try it out.  It&#x27;s been about 3 months now and u can def see a difference in the thickness of my hair.  It&#x27;s extremely easy to use and the results are obvious to everyone</li>
    <li> used only one bottle untill it ran out,,,can&#x27;t say it has worked for me..</li>
    <li> This product is a joke. As soon as I received it I read the box which says you will need 4 months of use to see results...conveniently the box contains a 3 month supply. Then I read the label. This product is mostly water. It says so on the ingredients. If you want pimples on your head this stuff will get you that. Not much else</li>
    <li> I have finally come back to report to you that I think some hair is coming back on the top of my head. I am really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product as a preventative measure but my hair was falling out in clumps, and I had this product on hand because I know my family history. Their are many chemicals that makes hair loss and NuNutrients keeps hair loss. Use it twice a day and in a couple months I think I see that my hair isn’t falling out as much. I would keep using it to make sure no more damage is done.</li>
    <li> Patience is good when it comes to this product. I have seen many people in my life use it, and because it works on science and inhibiting certain chemicals that stop hair growth, it takes time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a few months, or more. Imagine rebuilding hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a big task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have the patience because if it pays off I will enjoy the locks I used to have.</li>
    <li> That products doesn&#x27;t  work at all.......I just wasted  my money. ..</li>
    <li> I started to use it, and my hair stopped felling. It is very easy to use, and you can see the effects instantly. Before, my hair was falling so quickly, but now, it has totally stopped. No more hair on the table! I would buy it again if I had to! 100% recommendable</li>
    <li> This is simply one of the BEST hair growth products on the market today!  Bar none!  I&#x27;m 40 and have had thinning hair since my 20s.  My wife could not believe her eyes or hands when she ran her fingers through my hair.  Not that bald isn&#x27;t beautiful but hair is better!  Thumbs UP for NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment.</li>
    <li> I started using this product that I really started to see differences in my hairline. It&#x27;s gradual so you have to be patient, I dont think it&#x27;s going to work overnight for anyone! I used it for 3 months and only see slightly more hair, but still it works.</li>
    <li> Two bottles and no results. This stuff does not seem to help at all. Save your money and buy some Propecia.</li>
    <li> I was going bald a bit on the top of my head, and also my hairline was receding. I didnt want to use Bosley because of the extreme cost. I decided I wanted to use a product that is cheaper but that will also work. I looked up a bunch and there was this product. Infinite Growth is really amazing, as I seen results within the week of using this. This product is safe and reliable. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> : NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment for Men - Easy-to-use Spray Bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a miracle of modern science. As a 50 year old man, I do not have the same amount of hair I had when I was 18. I had been looking for a product to grow a little hair back on the front. NuNutrients worked like a charm, helping grow hair back out of follicles that had not produced any in many years. My hair on top is thicker. I&#x27;m very pleased and happy to recommend</li>
    <li> I have to say I was skeptical at first, but decided to give this NuNutrients product to my uncle. He was obsessed in the beginning but after a moth he said: I am glad with your gift! He was thinking before to shave his head but right know he can use cool cot hair designs. I want to say that we appreciate the results after about two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Some pretty clear results so far. Boyfriend&#x27;s hairline has stopped receding and his hair is definitely healthier! I just massage it in for him</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth  and it has certainly paid off. I couldn&#x27;t use the rogaine for women as it burned my scalp after a few months but I have been using infinite for over a year now with only positive results. I would panic if I couldn&#x27;t get it anymore! This stuff is great! Oh, and I only use it once a day, in the evening. I read one comment that said they use it and then blow dry their hair. What do you have to lose other than hair??</li>
    <li> I read something once that when a product works, you don&#x27;t hear anything  about it. But when it doesnt work, everybody becomes a critic! Im glad to say that this one works. I put this on the vertex of my head, DAILY for multiple weeks. Im really noticing a difference in not only new growth, but also the thickness of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great price on this product for hair regrowth. I have seen this product for way more and others like it for a lot more money. Considering this a bargain.</li>
    <li> The second I saw a hair I didn’t have before, I freaked out. All the years and all the products later and now I’m growing hair like it was planted there. Just rub this stuff into your hair and wait. I had a jig in my step and it changed everything. Not saying my hair is why I’m going on more dates than ever but it’s giving me more confidence for sure. I feel awesome.</li>
    <li> I’ve been losing my hair for about 15 years now and I’ve done a good job at keeping it at bay. I’ve used countless products and I can tell you right now that this spray is the easiest one I’ve ever had to use. Just spray it into your hand and rub it into your scalp. It’s not messy and you sit there and let it dry like it was water. Go read a book or something. If you don’t have enough patience to do that then that’s too bad. Because hair growth is a miracle.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, especially negative ones; but this product is an exception; for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This spray, used as instructed, did not make the slightest difference on my hair.  None whatsoever.  I&#x27;m 28 and have a receding hairline,and thought maybe the weaker hair at the front of my scalp would benefit from some special treatment.  I can&#x27;t believe I spend my hard-earned money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Fake reviews, many of them, are all over this page; just take a look at the profiles of people who claim impossibly positive effects, and notice their other reviews.  I should have paid more attention to this type of sham marketing.  It is also a shame for Amazon to fall victim to such a simple-to-detect yet detrimental trick.  It is not just this product, many small businesses take advantage of people&#x27;s trust in Amazon reviews and engage in this type of marketing.  I simply do not trust Amazon reviews anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, up to this point, I would still not give a product a bad review.  Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for me. However,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) After about 20 days of treatment, I started to see dark circles under my eyes; it happened quite suddenly and was very unpleasant.  It took me a while to realize this may be a side effect of the treatment.  This is a known side effect of the drug minoxidil. I would have bought the original minoxidil if I wanted to buy minoxidil.  I used minoxidil before, and it had a temporary effect on my hair, but no side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if this review gets through to you in between all those fabricated junk reviews, please consider keeping your $59.99 and spending it in a better way. Maybe buy your loved one (or whoever you want to impress with that little epsilon of extra hair) a bunch of flowers. Or donate the money to charity or something.  The &amp;#34;hair-regrowth&amp;#34; market is really crappy and not another cent of my money is going into it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference. Not buying this anymore. :/</li>
    <li> I have typically been skeptical of hair regrowth treatments. Products like Rogaine and the like have always left me thoroughly unimpressed and with marginal hair regrowth at best. So, imagine my surprise when I tried NuNutrients&#x27; hair regrowth treatment only to find that it works! Not only does it work, but it works quickly! For me, it was after just 3 and a half weeks that I began to see results from treatment. My previously thinning crown absolutely had better hair growth than approximately one month prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better still, this product is made in the U.S.A., which for me personally gives it an additional value even if it has nothing to do with hair restoration itself. I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I decided not to give up on hair regrowth treatments. If, like me, you are down on hair regrowth treatments, definitely give NuNutrients a try! In short, it won&#x27;t be a decision that you regret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-David</li>
    <li> Tried 2 bottles. it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> People are telling me I look different, that my hair is coming back. It&#x27;s a miracle. After using this for eight months it might be working out for me after all.</li>
    <li> This one is different from other products. If others didn&#x27;t work for you this one has a different chemical compound. I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and would like to give it a good trial period extend it out to six months. If it doesn’t work then forget it, but for me I’m glad I stuck it out as I have a little bit of hair I think filling out the top of my head. Thanks NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth.</li>
    <li> I take this with biotin and my hair is growing back like gangbusters. buy it!</li>
    <li> Similar to everyone else, I bought this product because of the great reviews. After two weeks of use it seemed like my hair loss was actually accelerating, so I went back to the reviews to see if anyone else mentioned that. I read the 1 star reviews (finally) and realized that all the great reviews I had read were fake. I&#x27;m going to return the product, but I am disappointed in Amazon for allowing such blatant deceit. My hair is thinner than it was 2 weeks ago, is dry when it used to be soft, and the product has given me acne on my forehead. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I was ready to give up with my hair problem but when my wife give me NuNutrients spray i just try it but after 3 months of using it and it works.</li>
    <li> For me it took just 6 months to see results of using this product. I used it twice a day for 6 months now and my hairline is power back now.</li>
    <li> I am buying more. Because it helped me with a tiny balding spot but I am afraid it will return. So I am using it over and over again until my hair really grows back.</li>
    <li> Got this product for my husband who was prematurely balding. He found his self-esteem dwindling, making his work harder on him and much more stressful. We’d tried a bunch of different products before I stumbled upon this one! It dries really fast and is super easy to use! The balding spots are already looking thicker and I’m pretty sure it’s reversed the hair loss! Another bonus? IT DOESN’T STINK!</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t know what to believe with  the  reviews here, so I&#x27;ll start one with updates. For me the first bottle lasted about 6 weeks, and hasn&#x27;t worked yet. I just ordered another and will give it 4 or 5 months before giving up. I know there&#x27;s different reasons for hair loss, so just because it does or doesn&#x27;t work, may depend on what  the root cause of hairless is.</li>
    <li> Seems like it wasn’t doing anything but after few months of using it. I looked and it seems like some stuff is coming in. I&#x27;m very happy with the result after some time on using this stuff.</li>
    <li> Came in the smallest bottle imaginable. WILL NOT last for 3 months, 1 month tops. Made hair feel sticky after use. I noticed a small difference in hair loss. I won&#x27;t continue to buy for the price and uncomfortable feel.</li>
    <li> Could not try, It was froze and bottle cracked</li>
    <li> I do see how this company believes, 1 small 2oz bottle can pack such potential into 3 months. I feel I did not pay enough for this product. I have used it for 2 weeks now and bottle is half gone, and the results are great.</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad who has hair loss &amp; he loved it!! Saw results in a few weeks and ended up using it consistently lol</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 5 weeks now. I have noticed some thickening in the front of my scalp. It is too early to tell about new growth as that generally takes longer to see. My only issue and to me it’s an important one is the amount they send (2oz) and say it will last 3 months. I only have thinning hair not nearly bald and there is no way this will last nearly that long. I figure my bottle will last about 6 weeks and this stuff isn’t cheap to buy every month.</li>
    <li> My hair now become more thicker than before i used this product. Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Gift from my brother, that guy. He used it and it worked and now he saw that I am losing some hair. Will have to give it a shot. Seen it work before.</li>
    <li> Found this product very easy to use. Spray bottle is great. I use it twice a day and just pat down my head with it real quick. Takes about a few minutes each time, not a hassle. I have used foams and other things that take a while to dissolve into my head and it’s a hassle. Not with this.</li>
    <li> I tried this for 8 weeks and noticed some new hairs coming through. Ill continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this every day twice a day for about a few months and today someone mentioned my hair. Wonderful! It seems to be filling in a little bit and I couldn’t be happier.</li>
    <li> The hair is coming back! Do I need to say anything else? It’s like a rose growing in concrete. I felt like everything was failing on me. It’s hard to convey the things I was doing. Pills, wigs, hats, sprays, etc. All sorts of stuff that did absolutely bunk. Either NuNutrients got the secret right or my hair just gave up the battle. Keep in mind I feel like these results are highly personalized, like maybe it won’t work for you but if you’re a balding dude like me it can’t hurt to try it. Also from the looks of the other reviews it looks like it’s working for others as well.</li>
    <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t work, likely a scam. Beware.</li>
    <li> I ended up getting this a short time ago for my grandfather as something to try for his lack of hair growth, mainly this one as it was cheaper at the time then some of the others I had looked at. Not thinking much about it a few weeks after he&#x27;s been applying it as directed he starting to slowly notice more fullness, maybe not more volume or length to his hair yet but is noticing some more fullness to his overall hair. So far so good.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and would like to give it a good trial period extend it out to six months. If it doesn’t work then forget it, but for me I’m glad I stuck it out as I have a little bit of hair I think filling out the top of my head. Thanks NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth.</li>
    <li> I began losing my hair a few years ago and it really took a toll on my confidence. I am 57 and my wife is 35, so I have always felt the need to appear younger than my age. The final straw came when my wife and I attended a charity ball and I was repeatedly mistook as her father. Not only was the experience embarrassing for me, but it also made my wife very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have tried numerous products that claim to regrow hair, but have been disappointed thus far. When my wife ran across this product online, I had decided that I would look into hair transplants. This was my last ditch effort to avoid the expense of such procedures. I am more than satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Since using this product, I have regrown most the the hair I lost! Not only did my hair grow back, but it is much fuller and healthier than it has been since I was in my twenties. Everyone has commented on how much younger I look and my self-confidence has grown tremendously. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone suffering from hair loss.</li>
    <li> If I had known about this product earlier maybe I could have save more of it. I’ll take it, though. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I never thought that would happen, but give this product a little bit of patience and maybe see something take off. Give time for this product to make its work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many weeks into months and I finally saw some buds of hair sprouting from my scalp. Will just be patience until all my hair come back.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product if other hair growth products haven’t worked for you. Because this product is very effective for me and also for you.</li>
    <li> Being a 20 year old male, it&#x27;s hard for myself and others to believe that I&#x27;m beginning to bald and thin around my head. I was too embarrassed to go out without a hat, and too ashamed to see a doctor. That&#x27;s when a family member introduced me to NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment for Men - Easy-to-use Spray Bottle. At first I was skeptical because I had heard of so many stories of different hair products to treat baldness that simply did not work. Little did I know, this product would turn my life around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later, and I&#x27;m already seeing amazing results. My hair looks fuller and the bald spots have turned into hair spots! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other product other than NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment for Men. If you&#x27;re looking for a discrete, easy to use solution that works, then this is for you!</li>
    <li> I was pretty upset about my loss of hair, as it was particularly noticeable when I put get in my hair. Well I&#x27;ve been trying to use this product now for the past 2 months, and it seems like its been working so far!</li>
    <li> The serum comes well packed with directions to use printed in a simple and easy to understand language. It should be noted that while the serum bottle is small and contains about 2 oz of serum it is meant to be applied only to the scalp. We have had the product for only a few days now and its really hard to tell if there is any significant improvement. You can spray a little serum onto your finger tips and massage it in well onto your scalp concentrating well on the affected areas. You need to ensure that you stimulate your hair follicles well. That being said, while its too early to notice any improvement it is good to know that the product is FDA approved and has not resulted in any side effects from the daily use. The product is not nasty or weird smelling as is the case with some oils that are used for hair growth. You can go about what ever tasks you have planned without wondering about people asking questions like &#x27;What is that smell!?!&#x27;. Another thing I have noticed about the product is that it does not leave any kind of residue on the scalp skin and it not oily. This is good because whatever growth treatment you are on you would not want the bald spots to shine till you see results!&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am very satisfied with the product and will provide updates on the results as and when I see them.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product at a deeply discounted price for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my father-in-law who had hair loss for quite some time now and had tried all different products but none worked as much as NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment. After using it for 2 months religiously, he started to see improvement in his hair growth. He is extremely satisfied with this product and wants to continue it for a long time to come. He is in India and there is no such product like this in India so I keep sending him from here and he has recommended it to his friends also back home. I am glad I found NuNutrients and highly recommend everybody who is going through hair loss to use this product. I am sure you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This has been helping me with the little thinning patch on the back of my head. I have noticed a difference after using this product for the last two weeks. It is so worth the money for me to get some results because nothing I have used before was helping. This has been a big confidence booster for me when I go out with friends.</li>
    <li> I didn’t bother with treatments because I was worried about chemicals and whatnot, but this product seems safe. I would recommend a little patience. Give time for time for this product to take it&#x27;s effect.</li>
    <li> Over the past few years my husband has been feeling really insecure and unconfident in his appearance due to his.. well you know.. balding problem. He&#x27;s gone through so many hair products which promise great results however they fail him every time because they give poor results which normally last short term. And of course, he becomes more and more discouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, to our rescue we found out about the Nunutrients Advanced hair regrowth treatment for Men. Obviously we didn&#x27;t get our hopes up because of past experiences, although in a matter of a short time, my husband started to see results. I mean great results! I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it worked so well and so efficiently with no side effects. He looks 15 years younger and his confidence is through the roof. And most importantly, he&#x27;s happy again. I couldn&#x27;t be more proud we found this product and I recommend it to everyone dealing with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
    <li> I tried this for 8 weeks and noticed some new hairs coming through. Ill continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I remember that was the time when I started to notice my dad&#x27;s hairline. I wanted to take preventative measures against going bald myself, so I decided to use NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth to keep losing hair. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I was freaking out when I found out because in order to notice it, it has to have been happening for a little bit of time already. I started to use hair growth products and this one stood out to me for results and price. I am back on track to having a full head of hair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I decided to go for it and buy this product  from Amazon. And after 6 months of use it  works. I guess it take me too long to get result, but still it works</li>
    <li> Thanks to Infinite for being a company with integrity and charging a fair price for a great product. Their product really works.</li>
    <li> Spray bottle is convenient and not a hassle to use, like some foams that take minutes to dissolve into your head. Easy to use and dries in seconds. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I wish it worked faster than it does, and that&#x27;s my biggest gripe with this product.  I have used it for a longer period of time for 3 months and noticed that my hair is much thicker.</li>
    <li> Luckily I am still a men with my hair, unlike my good friend. As a gag gift i decided to purchase the NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment for Men for my best friend&#x27;s birthday. Little did I know the attempt to use this product would be followed through by him. I recently had an outing with him and right away noticed a difference. At first i asked him if he had gotten implants.  When he explained to me that he had decided to give the product that i purchased for him a go, he said it actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He explained that its easy to use, quick, and actually produces results. Unlike Rogane Topical, this product is very convenient do to the spray bottle technique. I strongly suggest others give this product a try. Oh and hey, I have seen my father, so i know i will be purchasing this product some day. CHEERS &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My husband is getting older. He has been very concerned about losing his hair. Since I know this is a sensitive topic for him, I purchased this product. He was pleasantly surprised that I got this for him. Furthermore, he is happy with the results. We both have seen his hair grow back! Also, he remarked how easy it is to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, the price is not extremely cheap, it is worth every dollar. My husband has regained some self-esteem by this hair regrowth product. I will buy him this good product again. I am glad that we live in the modern age where there are helpful products such as this one.</li>
    <li> Great price on this product for hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen this product for way more and others like it for a lot more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering this a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> so far used it for five months, good stuff, good results.</li>
    <li> my hair grows now after 4 months of using this product. thanks</li>
    <li> I used this product for more than 6 months and thanks that i have patience and my head is full of hair now I haven’t seen results like this anywhere else. Really patience is a virtue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s a fail waste of money and time</li>
    <li> Would buy more, in fact, I am buying more. Because it helped me with a tiny balding spot but I am afraid it will return. So I am using it over and over again and hope that this success will not need to be replicated.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth is almost like doing magic and the magic takes time. It took almost  a year to see some results.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this product originally 3 months ago, this is the 2nd bottle we have purchased. After he first 3 month supply we have seen some results nothing groundbreaking but hair is coming in and his thickness of his remaining hair has improved. All in all very shocked and works better than rogaine and smells so much better.</li>
    <li> it really works for me my hair grows back together with my self esteem.</li>
    <li> I have a bit of a bald spot up top and I would love to see it gone. I have been using this product for almost three months and I have found it easy to use and easy on the wallet as well. I know it takes almost double my time or more to see any results so i am crossing my fingers. Here&#x27;s to hoping.</li>
    <li> It’s wonderful feeling when your hair grows back and also make  your confidence grow back also. love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the free sample from super cuts. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know but it seems good so far.</li>
    <li> After ten years of losing my hair, it&#x27;s a relief to finally find something that truly works. NuNutrients is such an awesome product, and it&#x27;s brought my hair back even fuller than it was before I started to lose it. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to look young again, but this stuff has made me a believer. It was such a simple process, and it started working so much more quickly than I anticipated. My hair feels full and thick, packed with color and body that my hair hasn&#x27;t had since my twenties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having my hair back has been great for my career, my marriage, and more. My wife sees me in a whole different light, like she did when we were first married thirty years ago. I love seeing the look in her eyes when she sees my hair in all its lustrousness and color. Coworkers have complimented me, and I think I drew the eye of a woman twenty years younger than me at the grocery store last week. Thanks so much NuNutrients! I couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> I switched from Rogaine to this product after a recommendation from a friend, and I actually continued balding and lost hair. Seriously, 50 dollars for this garbage? Despicable.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I was starting to have my hair thin a little bit in the back of my head and started taking this product. The product works wonderfully.  My hair has already started thickening after only three weeks.  It is so easy to use with the spray bottle  and it doesn’t have any weird smells or other negatives that I have heard of in other products.  I am buying a bottle for my father and brother-in-law so that they can regain some of the lost confidence they have from thinning hair.  If you are looking for a reliable hair regrowth product, make sure to check out NuNutrients first before anything else.</li>
    <li> Oh I can’t tell you what it feels like to have your wife run her fingers through your hair after five years of not being able to do so. It’s wonderful. Use this stuff!</li>
    <li> This spray is like bug spray if instead of bugs it warded off the specter of hair loss. Happy and purchased.</li>
    <li> It’s easy to sit and say we shouldn’t place so much importance on certain aspects of looking pretty or handsome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I started to lose my hair and I always said I wouldn’t care, but the little digs and loss of respect from people really affected me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was at a cliff—should I just shave it all off or I could try to go in for treatments to regrow my hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well I know if I shave it all off I’ll look like a cue ball so I go for the other option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NuNutrients luckily works after a few weeks (what a few weeks though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whew!) and I am glad I don’t have to shave my head and endure ridicule from my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I still don’t agree that we should place that much importance on hair but words hurt and for now I am happy.</li>
    <li> I am very excited to report to you guys that it seems to be working after about 7 and a half months of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife alerted me to the proceedings. I compared photos and my hairline definitely seems to be crawling back at a snail&#x27;s pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very elated to see this development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Will recommend this.</li>
    <li> Around two months ago I bought this product for my husband, who has been suffering with consistently thinning hair. I have to admit that we were both skeptical, however It worked exactly how the product description said that it would. In the short time that he has been using it, we have both been able to see noticeable hair growth. In fact, his thinning hair has thickened, possibly beyond what I remember, from before it began to loose thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ease of use is a big plus with my husband, and a main reason why I chose this product to begin with. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to say with certainty that he would have continued to use this NuNutrients Advanced Hair Growth Treatment, or any hair treatment if there were numerous steps to take. This hair treatment is as simple as spraying it on and rubbing it in. As such, he has been able to get back the hair of his youth with just an extra minute of hair care.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review after realizing that I have been scammed, with much thanks to the other one-star reviews for arousing my suspicions.    I was redirected to this product by the \\&quot;most helpful\\&quot; review for Rogaine, and I now realize that that review is also a fake.    After doing my research I&#x27;ve found that nearly all the reviews posted for this product are highly suspicious because they are:    1. 5-star reviews made by people who did not have a verified purchase, only have written one review, and claim to have used the product for months when it has only been available for a very limited time    2. Copied and pasted on multiple health and beauty sites all over the internet. Who would go out of their way to post the same reviews in multiple locations?    3. Have numbers in the hundreds of \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; votes, and next to no \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot; votes, whilst the 1-star reviews (presumably the only real reviews) have 0-12 \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot; votes.    All of these reviews getting high scores are from a bunch of \\&quot;slave\\&quot; accounts made by some deceitful entrepreneur out there.</li>
    <li> Most of the good reviews here are not legit I believe... Bought this and had to return item, burned terribly, no idea what is in it. Searched the web, and can&#x27;t find any information about this product, tread carefully consumers.</li>
    <li> Infinite Growth is almost like doing magic and the magic takes time. It took almost  a year to see some results.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth is almost like doing magic and the magic takes time. It took almost  a year to see some results.</li>
    <li> I Used it for two weeks and had to stop. I felt so tired, dizzy and short of breath. I used Rogaine for years without any problem.  There must be something wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> It took a little bit of time after that, two more months and I feel like I see more! Very exciting. I will keep using this product for sure, and although it’s torture to watch it work so slowly, it’s a good torture. My hair is returning. Great product.</li>
    <li> Thanks to scams like this one...the days of trusting reviews are long gone, if they ever existed. Do your homework, folks. I figured out the 5 star reviews were fake after looking at the dates and the fact that ALL of them only reviewed this one product. So moved by their new found follicles that they couldn&#x27;t help but post a 5-star review when they otherwise would not have?  Not buy it or this product.</li>
    <li> I love my beard but it’s very egregious when a man has a big bushy beard and a bald spot right on top. I had to do something about it so I started using this spray every night before logging in some hours playing games before bed. I massage it real good into the scalp and what do you know—a few weeks later and my bald spot is shrinking. So I can keep the beard and all that—it also tingles a little bit. Life is good.</li>
    <li> I like making jokes too it’s more like they pointed it out when before I was fine. A guy in the office pulled me aside recommended this product so I got it, not too much of an investment, not bad. Well here I am and while my coworkers can definitely make fun of me for tons of other things, my hairline has come back a little bit! Woo.</li>
    <li> I know from other hair growth brands that you have to wait it out a little bit—this stuff isn’t instant. So I planted it and waited and now I can see the barest of growth on my hairline. If only I had another ten years to help this grow. I see results and it speaks for itself. Will buy another</li>
    <li> I was freaking out when I found out because in order to notice it, it has to have been happening for a little bit of time already. I started to use hair growth products and this one stood out to me for results and price. I am back on track to having a full head of hair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> If this pays off after months of waiting, it will be worth it. I&#x27;ll be mad too because I saw it work on my own brother. Haha. I&#x27;m only four months in so I&#x27;ll update later with results.</li>
    <li> These is the hair that i really miss for sometime now. I think i have thick hair when i was in my mid 30&#x27;s but after im now in my mid 40&#x27;s im almost bald. Thanks to this product it really works.</li>
    <li> I have been using infinite growth for about three months now. I started using it on my temples and have had great results. I have recently started using it on the top of my scalp and my receding hairline.  What else can I say plain and simple other than... it works.</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair for awhile  wasn&#x27;t sure  what to use. I did my research on a few different things and the cost of each. The hair transplants costs are just out of control.This was the most affordable of many different  products I looked  plus the easiest to use.I took  pictures of my hair before hand so I can have something to  look at  in few months. I&#x27;ve been using this along with other items for about a month, My hair looks better for sure after a  few weeks. It feels better also. I can feel my scalp  tingling after using the product. I&#x27;m  looking forward to keep trying it the next few months  for sure.</li>
    <li> You will be happy you tried this product! Your hair not only grows back with NuNutrients, it grows thicker and fuller. I was skeptical at first. I have tried so many hair growth products without success, but NuNutrients will help you regrow hair quickly without the itchy side effects and messy applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a noticeable bald spot on the back of my head, but after one month of use, my hair has grown back as full as ever. Most of the men in my family had thinning hair by my age, but I won&#x27;t have that problem thanks to NuNutrients. You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this product!</li>
    <li> My co-worker swears by this stuff.  He is not one to write a reviews on products, so I told him I&#x27;d pass on the word, only fair since he based his decision on buying the stuff after reading numerous rave reviews.  He said at first he thought it was pricey, considering that there are other products out there that are half the cost, but decided to just go with it.  He has always been super self-conscious of his hair, it&#x27;s great to know that there is actually a product out there to give him that confidence again.    FYI  He has tried other products on the market, and wasted a lot of money doing so.  I&#x27;m just wondering now, if they make one for women!! :)</li>
    <li> My husband started losing some of his hair. He was truly upset and we had tried everything beside hair transplants. This is the only thing that seemed to work. He now has regrowth and he is so excited. The application process was very simple and it has definitely helped him. His self esteem is up and he had hair growing back in the place that it was missing. What an affordable alternative to hair transplants! I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend, and as a hairstylist myself, I know all about hair and hair loss. NuNutrients Advanced Hair Treatments is amazing. I ordered it as a preventative thing since I did notice some thinning. Far superior than Nioxin and Biotin. I would even recommend this to my clients in the salon, that&#x27;s how great it worked. The thinning my boyfriend had has stopped and new hair grew in it&#x27;s place. We couldn&#x27;t be happier. Total must have for anyone with hair loss or thinning!!!!</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I see no difference, don&#x27;t wait your money, have used for 4 months</li>
    <li> Fake review, stay away&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product based on the fabulous reviews. The product looks so crappy after I received it so I double checked the reviews and found all the reviews are blatantly fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product popped up from nowhere. It received over 40 five star reviews in one month. Really? In comparison, Rogaine, the best hair loss product, has less than 600 review after being on Amazon for 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you click &amp;#34;see all my review&amp;#34; to check out the reviews of each reviewer, you will see all the reviewer only reviewed this product. And most of them don&#x27;t have verified purchase, meaning they never used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is laughable to see a lot of reviews saying they have used the product for 5 months, 6 months, 17 months, while this product is not sold anywhere else but on Amazon, and the product is sold on Amazon only two months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is even more laughable to see the most helpful review for this product is &amp;#34;Works slowly in combination with Rogaine&amp;#34;. Of course it works with Rogaine. Even if you use water with Rogaine, I am sure it will work, because Rogaine works great by itself. Apparently the seller used his own accounts to vote this ridiculous review to be the most helpful one. What a great marketing gimmick?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snake oil full of fake reviews. Stay away</li>
    <li> Okay so first of all I am a woman reviewing this product for my boyfriend.  He&#x27;s only 28 but the men in his family, while they don&#x27;t have a tendency to go bald they do all have a history of extreme receding hairlines which has statted affecting my boyfriend himself over the past couple of years.  I myself still thought he looked great but he was getting uncomfortable with it and complaining about so often that I said hey then why don&#x27;t you do something about it so you are happy with yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some extensive research because I didn&#x27;t honestly buy into this whole thing about hair regrowth after you&#x27;ve gone bald in that area so I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money and his hopes I ordered this and just said give it a shot and if it works then awesome, you&#x27;ll feel better about yourself! I was surprised when it actually did after a few weeks and apparently I&#x27;m so grateful for how much confident he&#x27;s been and acted that I wanted to say that this really is a great product worth trying... whether you&#x27;re the guy or the woman on the receiving end of bald unhappiness!!  Thank you for this!!!</li>
    <li> Oil does not work in the hair you tried it for two months and does not work and urged to improve my hair any of this product is good</li>
    <li> This was a purchase I made for my boyfriend who has been struggling with hair loss for about six months. It hasn&#x27;t been terribly noticeable, but it definitely made him uncomfortable. He was embarrassed at the idea of going and buying a product in-store so I encouraged him to buy something off Amazon and we decided on this. Fantastic choice. Super easy to use, not messy and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Plus, the results were great. His hair/head looks so much better and he feels more confident, which is all I can ask for. He has nearly used up the three-month supply and he&#x27;s definitely going to keep up the regime.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted to try something for his thinning hair. After some research, I decided to order this product for him. You can honestly see a difference! He is very happy with it. Five stars. :)</li>
    <li> This hair regrowth treatment is something I bought because my hair started to recede many months, if not years ago. I found it easy to use but it was tough to sit and wait and hope for something to happen and have nothing happen. Easier to not apply anything and accept my hair fate. Well, my hairline is creeping back, I am happy to say. It’s not that much and it took a while, but it’s slowly coming back. I’m happy with what’s going on so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I started out using a generic store brand version of this about a year and a half ago when my bald spot had gotten to the point where people were saying (without being asked for their opinion!) just to shave my head. Some time went by and people started commenting that it looked like my hair was filling in again. Including my hair stylist. I didn&#x27;t really take her word for it though. I didn&#x27;t look at the bald spot since I started using this. I just wanted to believe it was working. Well today I decided it was time to pull out the mirror and see what has happened after all this time. It made a lot of that hair grow back. I am very pleased. It is still thinner than the surrounding area but it&#x27;s not obviously a bald spot now to people standing behind me whereas before it was totally bald. And it&#x27;s in the middle of summer now, when the heat and humidity always seems to make the hair thinnest yet it looks great. I prefer NuNutrients brand over the generic brand. It&#x27;s not as runny. As long as it goes on sale I&#x27;ll keep buying it. I apply at breakfast and again after dinner</li>
    <li> I am on week five and I will probably buy more here just to have a seamless transition so my hair will come back sooner. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day and after about five or six months I saw my hairline start to sprout little buds and I swear it grew back like half an inch already. Will update again after another 6 months.</li>
    <li> Saw no deference truly nothing didn&#x27;t make it fall out but after 2 months nothing didn&#x27;t make it itch or nothing did notice after a day or 2 of using white scaly looking stuff on scalp</li>
    <li> no diffrence in my hair. Wish i could get a refund</li>
    <li> I started getting thin hair and loosing hair when I was 25. It&#x27;s so embarrassing being so young and having people ask you where your hair all went. I wanted to look more youthful and happy and have a head full of hair for people to admire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is so easy to use, as long as you don&#x27;t forget to apply it twice daily for the best results. A few times I have forgotten and I think that is why it took a little longer than expected to see my results. I have encouraged my dad and good friends to get this stuff because it really does work.</li>
    <li> Got it for my significant other and I am glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;He was losing his hair on the crown of his head and had a very noticeable bald spot on the top of his crown,&lt;br /&gt; after using NuNutrients, his bald spot is almost gone .&lt;br /&gt;There is significant hair growth and I am so happy!!&lt;br /&gt;Definately a great product and I highly recommend it, I mean we had tried everything. onion juice , garlic,&lt;br /&gt;Nunutrient really addressed the issue and my significant other&#x27;s hair is a whole lot thicker.</li>
    <li> My husband was losing hair quickly and in desperation he has tried out many products for making the hair loss slower and regrowth but nothing yielded any significant results even after constant trying. Then he heard about NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment and thought of giving it a shot. Surprisingly he has started noticing a difference in his hair. He is actually regaining his hair and hair loss is much much slower then before. Of course you have to be patient to see the results as nothing works like a magic but in few months your will feel your hair getting thicker. My husband is absolutely thrilled and we both recommend NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment to all men who are losing hair</li>
    <li> Since using this product, I have regrown most the the hair I lost! Not only did my hair grow back, but it is much fuller, thicker, and healthier. This stuff actually works and you just spray it on twice a day, no real hassle, very simple to use. I just spray the area when I comb my hair and it is just that easy. The results have been encouraging! I have only been using NuNutrients for two months so far and I am truly amazed at the effectiveness of this product! The thickness of my hair is what I love the most!! I am very pleased with the results of this product. I will most definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my hair grow like crazy. Yes I already have long hair, but I was getting little bald spots, for no reason. Let&#x27;s just say this stuff completely took care of that. Thankful!</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad, as it is simple and easy to use. He is not really the kind of man to spans a bunch of time getting ready, but he will use this. He likes the product, and would recommend it. Maybe he just likes knowing he is he trying something. He is basically balding. It might be too late for him, but he keeps his hopes up, and we keep trying different products. This is one he has not discarded immediately, and would like to continue.</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning around the edges. I didn&#x27;t know what to do. It started to depress me. My wife suggested this product. We only buy American made products in our household. Plus the NuNutrients Advance Hair Regrowth Treatment fit right into my budget. I had to be a little patience but after two &amp; a half weeks we saw results. I must have driven my wife crazy by then. Constantly asking her does she see new growth. Lol</li>
    <li> My 75 year old grandpa just recently started to bald. I bought him a bottle of NuNutrients advanced hair regrowth treatment right away. I decided on this instead of rogaine because with rogaine if you stop using it you lose all progress. We dealt with his hair loss  quickly with a product that works and his hair is back to normal.</li>
    <li> My dad has natural thin hair and he is always looking for some type hair thickening/growth products. I bought this as a birthday gift for him and he loves it. He told me that this product is very easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. After a couple weeks he could see a bit result and it really improves his hair. Also this serum is not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your scalp.</li>
    <li> The NuNutrients treatment worked well for me. My hair had been thinning for years and that hairline was really getting noticeably further back. I tried a couple of things that didn&#x27;t work at all. This product, after going through a full cycle of it, thickened my hair back a bit. Any improvement is of course a fantastic development. Stopping the sad progression of baldness is something we all want to do, and this seems to be something that can do it with real success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to go through another cycle after waiting a few months. I want to get my hairline back down and this product gives me a real glimmer of hope after the success I had after the first cycle. I&#x27;ll probably update this after I do the second cycle to hopefully sing the praises of this product even more.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars rating for this! I really love it. I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere else this cheap and this high quality. I am totally recommending this product to everyone who is looking to buy this!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend who is starting to lose hair. The product has done miracles. His hair looks so much better. He looks ten years younger, which is great for me! He said it is really easy to use. He was skeptical before using it, but now he really likes it. I am pleased with the results, and will continue buying it for him. I recommend this for anyone starting to see hair loss, and wants to prevent it.</li>
    <li> so far so good... on my 3rd bottle..my barber says he notice my hair has significantly&lt;br /&gt;grown in..</li>
    <li> I am considering surgery even though it is scary and expensive. I applied it to the problem area, my hairline and the top of my head. Kept doing it for weeks, for many weeks. Twice a day, just don’t think about it. Well, my hair seems a little thicker there now.</li>
    <li> Update: So it may be the case that it&#x27;s perception rather then anything real. I&#x27;ve stopped using it because it&#x27;s expensive for what is truly supplied.  But nothing has changed with my hair too.  I&#x27;ve been also altering my diet, trying to eat healthier, more vitamins, juicing, etc. so the non-hair loss could be for other reasons too.  Difficult to determine without controlling all x factors. FYI.       **********************************    Unless your thinning bald spot is a quarter inch in size, or you have the head of a chihuahua, or you suffer from brainiac gianormous head-itus, one bottle will not last 3 months.  Not even close.  My bottle lasted 2-3 weeks.    I followed directions: Twice daily, massaged into scalp. Use as needed. For me: I sprayed one squirt each in spaced out locations of the crown, top, and front hairline (that&#x27;s most guys, right?).    Other than that one complaint (minus a star), it MAYBE working.    My wife noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t come off when she grabs onto it and pulls (yeah, she&#x27;s crazy like that during sex, hehe! And, of course, I&#x27;m a stud muffin.)    It&#x27;s my first bottle so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I used (2) bottles and nothing happened. I DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from hair loss for quite some time. I have tried so many different products, vitamins and medication to help my hair grow back but nothing has happened so far as to my satisfaction. I was then recommended Infinite Growth by my friend who had been using it for some time now. At first I was skeptical since nothing worked for me in the past so I decided to give it a try anyway since I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br /&gt;It is a miracle for sure. After 5 weeks of using it, I can see my hair being filled in in places I tried to cover before. I can pull my hair back in a ponytail and not worry about the receding hair line or the bald spots. This product is not only safe and effective, but very easy and clean to use. There&#x27;s virtually nothing to prep. I can put it on and go about my chores, and it&#x27;s very convenient since I am always in a time crunch. If you are in doubt, then don&#x27;t be because if this worked for me, I am sure it will for you. Overall, I am very pleased and glad I tried it and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my thin spot on top of my head. Just another wasted hair product for me</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been losing hair and I didn&#x27;t want to be bald so early in my life. My friend recommended this product for me and so far the results are satisfactory. My hair grew back thicker and faster than norms and it&#x27;s easy to use. Just spray!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I was looking at Rogaine but stumbled upon this and purchased it seeing the ratings. However, I should have done more research as the positive reviews are fake as mentioned. The first day I used the product, I used it before going to sleep. I woke up dizzy with a horrible headache. I used it again twice a day as recommended and my dizziness continued. I was about to see a doctor but I thought it might be caused by this product as I haven&#x27;t changed any habits. Stopped using it and two days later, I feel normal again. Now I won&#x27;t know if this product will work but I am not using it anymore because these headaches I get from using the product are pretty bad.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my fiancee because he was going bald. He&#x27;s only been using it for 1 month &amp; we can already see the difference in his hair. It grew 3 in &amp; is stronger, healthier, &amp; shinier than ever before. It also seems to be repairing some of the damage that is done to his hair. Now he&#x27;s looking more like the handsome stud with a head full of hair I knew when I first met him.</li>
    <li> by far the best hair product  that I try so far. It really does work.</li>
    <li> My father is sadly getting to that time in his life where he is starting to lose hair. He&#x27;s become progressively more sad as his hair falls out, so I set out to help him. Most products like this are extremely expensive, and out of my budget, but this product is not! I took the chance and have loved the effects! My dad is becoming happy again, and his smile makes me the happiest son alive!</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad for his birthday with the biotin and he is raving about it so far. His hair is coming back slowly and its even thicker and darker! The secret to eternal youth! who knew? He also uses it religiously so i recommend being very strict with the regimen. Definitely worth a try paired with the supplements~</li>
    <li> I have the problem of hair fall and with in no time my hair started thinning like anything .I am scared of getting bald head.After do much research I thought of trying this product .It has got all the essential key elements wich will stimulate hair growth ..I am glad that with in one week my haoir stopped falling ..Love this .and Will definetely suggest this to every one!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gag gift for my balding uncle&#x27;s 40th, &amp;#34;Over the hill&amp;#34; themed, birthday party. Was I surprised when he called me last night to tell me he had been using it and it was actually working for him. He called to thank me so much for the gift even if it was supposed to be a joke. No one&#x27;s gag gift was actually useful! Well I recommend it, not just for aging relatives gag gifts, but for regrowing your missing hair. I&#x27;ll be sure to help more men in my life with this treatment.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my elder brother and it giving good results, before this my brother has used so many other products for hair loss but no use. One of my friend recommended this to me then next day itself i purchased and given to my brother and now he is very happy with this product and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> As I age, so is my hair. I&#x27;m scared. I don&#x27;t want to lose my hair. It&#x27;s still black but my forehead is growing, lol. In comes NuNutrients. I&#x27;m trying it out, hoping the thinning slows.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients is a great product for hair growth regeneration. My hair started to lose its fullness and volume an became flat and thin. I started buying several hair regrowth treatments but none of them had any positive effect on my hairs quality. Then, I bought the NuNutrients Regrowth treatment and my hair has made a substantial improvement in quality and fullness. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs a little regeneration for their hair.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s father and my own father cursed me with my balding hair line, so I decided to search amazon for a solution, so I bought this. After using this product for a few weeks my hair is already thicker and darker.</li>
    <li> Execellent... wow i cant believe myself,this is working very nicely ,this product is amazing and it is working superbly,</li>
    <li> I used this product and it took a good while to get back  my hair.  I am really encouraged by what is going on because of this product. Use it daily now for more than 6 months.</li>
    <li> It’s taking months to sprout  hair growth to my head and it’s nothing like I was when I was in my teenage year. I am encouraged by the results and I hope it has good results for you too.</li>
    <li> In 3 months of using this product  I have a little bit of growth. I’m going to need a little more to be considered “not bald” but I will keep going with this.</li>
    <li> I accepted this product  and started to use it, it was for six months supply after i already use up all the bottles my hair is sprouting a little bit. By being patience for more than 6 months i have seen good results.</li>
    <li> No smell or stinky foam in this product. It&#x27;s an easy to use bottle that you can carry anywhere. I had no problem using this at work in the bathroom. Previously my hair foam would be all messy and a big deal. Everyone knew what I was doing and they constantly made fun of me. This is a little more discreet.</li>
    <li> I like this product and will keep using it because it is the best products that I&#x27;ve found to work. It doesn&#x27;t have the same smell as other hair products and I really see my hair thickening.</li>
    <li> I have seen lots of other products similar to this one and I would slap a bargain sticker on this one. This is a good price for a very good product, I have many relatives who have used it with much success. Myself, I just started a couple months ago and I am hoping I have similar results as my brethren. Will continue to use and update.</li>
    <li> Most of the comments are fake.. and not approved from FDA Now i realised that this product is fake.. i purchased it and i won&#x27;t use it.. Don&#x27;t lie</li>
    <li> If there is one piece of advice for this product it’s this: Get some patience. Hair doesn’t just grow on trees, it takes time for your body to react to the active chemicals. But for me at least, it worked out. So give it a shot and while it may take twice a day treatments for a few months, just give it a shot and maybe you’ll enjoy a little more hair on your head like me.</li>
    <li> Used it for a few weeks before I saw results but it’s amazing technology can regrow hair!</li>
    <li> I really dont&#x27; like the smell of minoxidil, I don&#x27;t know if most people can smell it but I can (maybe I have a sensitive nose). This stuff doesn&#x27;t have that same smell, and it goes on easy in a spray. I have stopped shedding as much in the shower. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting a lot of hair back, but more isn&#x27;t falling out constantly so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Don’t give up if you don’t see results! It varies for everyone I think the estimates on the packaging are averages. Everyone is different so for me it took about a month and a half. I’ve passed it around to my friends who need this sort of thing and for them it has also varied. I think everyone deserves a chance to have a nice head of hair so I’m giving fair warning here.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s fake, you might as well piss in your hair</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my results and my wife is happy that I’m happy. I guess Inf got the formula down because after years of trying to get my hair back some of it is coming back onto the top of my head.</li>
    <li> Over the past few years my husband has been feeling really insecure and unconfident in his appearance due to his.. He&#x27;s gone through so many hair products which promise great results however they fail him every time because they give poor results which normally last short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, to our rescue we found out about the Nunutrients Advanced hair regrowth treatment for Men. Obviously we didn&#x27;t get our hopes up because of past experiences, although in a matter of a short time, my husband started to see results. I mean great results! I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it worked so well and so efficiently with no side effects. I couldn&#x27;t be more proud we found this product and I recommend it to everyone dealing with this issue.</li>
    <li> Definitely seeing results in the first month! Maybe I was expecting more results quickly, but I can see small regrowth and less hair falling out.</li>
    <li> My husband has been looking for a hair growth product for his receding hair line. We look at all kinds of hair regrowth products and after a lot of research, settled on this one. We liked that there were a lot of natural products in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s very use-just spray some in your hand and rub onto the areas of balding on the scalp. My husband (and I) started to see hair growth after 3 months. The new hair looks very healthy! He also likes that it does not have a strong chemical smell, which makes him feel that it is a safer product to use. I am so glad he gave it a try. His father and brother are even interested in the product after seeing the results!</li>
    <li> The product hasn&#x27;t given any results to me. Not saying they it won&#x27;t work for anyone but maybe it&#x27;s not for me. Hopefully it hasn&#x27;t affected me negatively in ways I can&#x27;t see so I won&#x27;t rate this completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m starting to think that these 5* reviews are paid for. After looking at their profiles, it&#x27;s either this as the only product they have reviewed, a bunch of random products they give 5* to and their story keeps changing. Rudy for example wants to see his highschool sweet heart yet is married with kids. Also has been shredding 20 lbs here, 10 lbs there, another 10 there with all these weight loss products yet is still buying weight loss products. Interesting that he &amp;#34;feels like his old self&amp;#34; several months ago before being a ton more weight loss products. Very interesting.</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders. I got it for my father as an early Christmas present. He&#x27;s been going bald for awhile now and everyone is sad to see his wonderful hair go, so I was researching good ways to help it grow back. I stumbled upon this treatment. After doing some research on this particular treatment I found that everyone loves it. No one said any bad things about it and even a friend suggested I get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got it for him and he says its the best. I mean like, he said it didn&#x27;t smell bad like some other products do. Others have this rank, pungent odor to them that reminds me of hair-dye. This wasn&#x27;t the case. It didn&#x27;t take too long to see the effects of this product either! After using it my dad looks so much YOUNGER now. He isn&#x27;t bald anymore and he doesn&#x27;t need a hat to hide his bald spot. My father and I both would recommend this product to anyone who was is starting to go bald and just miss their hair. Wonderful product, totally worth it. Five stars.</li>
    <li> Now, I love my husband whether he has a lush full head of hair or not. But for him &amp;#34;going bold&amp;#34; is not on his list of things to do by 35.. So I looked up a solution, And I am so glad i found NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment. I surprised him with it, and he quickly ran to the bathroom and started using it. It&#x27;s been about a month and a half and I can see a difference, he&#x27;s hair in the front is starting to come back, and i love how the product is easy to use, no harsh chemicals or gels, just a simple spray. And the fact that 1 bottle is like a three months apply it was definitely worth the price. So now my husband can happily return to being a red head ad run his finger through his new grown luscious locks!</li>
    <li> Pays off sometimes. I have seen it work about 50-50 in my family, which is actually a great percentage. I will have to start using it soon as I am getting up in age and my hair will not stick around. Here&#x27;s to hoping.</li>
    <li> Feeling more confident in my exchanges. I have only been using it for two months, every day twice a day. I know I will not see results for a while but the act of doing something for myself makes me feel good and confident. All my actions are deliberate now.</li>
    <li> Guys, all these reviews here are fake! Do not buy this product. I am going to stop using mine immediately, who knows what&#x27;s in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am contacting Amazon customer service right away. This product shouldn&#x27;t even be on Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this company were to actually let real people do the reviewing, maybe I would buy it, but as it stands now, I am wondering why they are trying to market it so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work based on my experience, and I actually bought it.</li>
    <li> Only had it for a few weeks. Not sure what to say but 3 stars for now until I see results. Did notice that it says 3 month supply (maybe if you have no hair). When I spray it on I do notice that it fluffy up my hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make a difference.  I bought based on all the positive reviews.  Tried it out and it did not work for me.  I went back and looked at the reviewers and there sure are a lot of unverified 5 star reviews with only 1 review by that person.  If you go out to their site, they only sell on amazon.  I would expect most of the reviewers to have verified purchases, but there are not.  Look at all the other 1 star reviews.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work,period.</li>
    <li> Product may or may not work, but fake customer reviews make me suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product together with Minoxidil for 2 months, and I have not had any noticeable problems. I haven&#x27;t yet seen any significant gains, but then again, I wouldn&#x27;t expect much after only 2 months. I have noticed that after the Minoxidil shed, I have been losing significantly fewer hairs. Who knows whether NuNutrients has any effect or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why create so many fake customer reviews??? Either the population of balding men loves buying and reviewing a single Kindle e-book, or the marketing department at NuNutrients is duping us! Look at all the recent 5-star (of course...) reviews and notice every single one has reviewed only 2 items, which are both recent - one of a Kindle e-book and the other this product. In fact, several reviews have the same e-book (A Daughter&#x27;s Place)! I see this attempt to trick customers as deceptive and it makes me highly suspicious of their product. Maybe it does work...but their illegitimate campaign for an immaculate 5-star rating is insulting.</li>
    <li> If you are losing a bit of thickness in your hair or your hairline is receding a bit, give this a shot—it’ll probably work after a few weeks like it did for me. Just wait and let this product makes its magic.</li>
    <li> I have a little bit of balding spots on the top of my head, you can’t really tell unless you look closely, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;But I want to nip this in the bud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product and after maybe five or six months my bald spot is slowly closing up, or it looks like it’s thicker up there at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking very closely every single day so I should know. Anyway, I use it very religiously and I am glad I am seeing some progress.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my results and my wife is happy that I’m happy. I guess I got the formula down because after years of trying to get my hair back some of it is coming back onto the top of my head.</li>
    <li> happy with it, will buy again.</li>
    <li> GOOD, like it and got it shipped fast.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works!!</li>
    <li> I dont see how this company thinks, 1 small 2oz bottle can last 3 months.... I feel I was ripped off, my fault for not paying attn to detail... I have used it for 2 weeks now and bottle is half gone, and I have not used a lot...</li>
    <li> As with most men, losing my hair was not a small problem, especially since I am only in my early thirties. I have tried other hair loss products and while they seem to work they just didn&#x27;t work well enough for me. Reading through the reviews of NuNutrients I decided to give it a shot. With Amazon as usual I received it quickly started using it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit more at face value but the bottle is a three month supply. The pump is easy to use and makes it easy to apply. I prefer to spray it on my hands and apply it that way instead of just spraying it on my scalp. I also like the smell which has been a problem with a few other products. It didn&#x27;t take for me to start seeing results and am happy. I plan to keep a stock of this in my bathroom so i don&#x27;t have to worry about running out!</li>
    <li> I think NuNutrients is a AMAZING product and I have noticed my hair getting thicker over the months. The hair on my crown is much thicker and growing faster. I would say the best part about using this is that it&#x27;s pretty much effortless to apply and dries super fast. I think it smells good and I haven&#x27;t had any side-effects like skin rashes. Anyway, I don&#x27;t feel weird applying it everyday like I used to with Rogaine...As I said, really easy and fast to use - just like misting a cologne or hair spray, but grows hair :) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth it&#x27;s my secret weapon to getting my hair BACK Jack!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my SO. It took awhile and he almost stopped using it. But then to his disbelief it started working and his hair was regrowing. We are both excited</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff for my boyfriend and am surprised and excited to say -- it actually works! He&#x27;s been using it for about a month now and his hair is definitely thicker. He&#x27;s going to keep using it and see if it continues to get thicker still. I was skeptical about a spray, but this stuff is actually good.</li>
    <li> Most 5 Star reviews are FAKE.  Look at all of them and see what else these phonies behind a keyboard have reviewed and it&#x27;s either the ONE product or the same products all across the board. All the products are sold by Verified American...sound fishy? Yeah, it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shame a product can&#x27;t stand on it&#x27;s own and potential customers can&#x27;t come to Amazon and expect HONEST reviews by REAL customers: Shine White, TruFormula, NuNutrients,OmegaBoost, InfiniteGrowth.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised! My only suggestion would be that the bottle would be either larger or how long we can actually use the product. 2 oz for 3 months simply isn&#x27;t enough! However, I will say that the product definitely worked. Within a week or so, I noticed more growth, and there were no side effects. It&#x27;s a definite change from other products I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> 3.5 Stars overall is a pretty good rating.  I gave 4, because I feel like I haven&#x27;t lost any more hair in the widow&#x27;s peak area and it seems thicker (darker) than the direction it was going!&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited after about 2 months of usage, because I saw a lot of peach fuzz-like hair when I looked real close.  But now after 6 months of use I still see similar fuzz; so I need to find out if that very short blonde, fuzzy stuff is just another type of hair that won&#x27;t form into the luscious locks I&#x27;m hoping for...OR...will the DHT and testosterone battle it out and revive those dormant follicles!?!?&lt;br /&gt;I think my usage tapered off with my second bottle, the first bottle lasted 2 months, I used it morning and night, as directed.  The second bottle lasted 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying another bottle and will get back at it diligently.  Also, the price dropped from $60 to $50...bonus!&lt;br /&gt;If interested, I&#x27;ve supplemented my efforts with Pura D&#x27;or shampoo.  It&#x27;s lasting FOREVER and at $35...I figured that was reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe those reviews where they&#x27;ve seen results in 2-3 days!  That guy probably just saw the peach fuzz.</li>
    <li> I don’t want to wait around for another shipment at the end of three months when I have to use it twice a day because it is very effective. I would err on getting six months supply, two bottles. Can wait for another stock.</li>
    <li> DHT degrades hair, it keeps new hair from growing on your head. This product inhibits that chemical and it is an ingredient that are sometimes not included in other hair regrowth products. That way, this is a good alternative to other products. I recommend trying it out if others have failed.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This is a smaller investment than other products because of the lower price. I am hoping it will pay off but if it doesn&#x27;t I will have not wasted that much money like other products I have seen.</li>
    <li> does anyone know how to contact this company?  My hair has gotten thinner, rapidly, over the past 1.5 months.</li>
    <li> I started to use NuNutrients spray and my hair thickened back up. My confidence is sky high and I feel like I could break a car in half.</li>
    <li> It takes a bit to get started. I used it for a couple weeks with no results but I guess maybe you just can’t see it? It seems to work. I sprouted little hairs and gradually it’s getting thicker and thicker. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about three weeks now and I&#x27;m already noticing a considerable increase in overall hair thickness. It comes in a convenient spray bottle. All you have to do is spray on the balding part or put it in your hands and rub directly on the scalp. I have had a lot of regrowth! Definitely recommended purchase!</li>
    <li> This product worked absolutely flawlessly! i stared seeing improvement within the first couple weeks of use. I also love that it is so easy to apply! no hassle and no mess. All in all a great product. I have tried many other products on the market and none of them quite match up to this one. It&#x27;s simply amazing! I rate this product 10/10! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> My uncle wore a cap for years. Because he started balding in his early twenties. He was embarassed of his bald head and looked older. But with this spray on NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment.  His hair is growing back in!  He has only done 2 treatments so far. He is very happy this treatment.  The spray is very convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting older and I&#x27;ve notice some hair thining. One of my biggest fear was going bald so before it got to that point I started looking product to help thicking my hair. Let me say this product is amazing and I got fast results. My hair is full again like it was when I was in my 20&#x27;s!!!</li>
    <li> Spray bottle is convenient and not a hassle to use, like some foams that take minutes to dissolve into your head. Easy to use and dries in seconds. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Hairline was gone, now it’s back. Can’t explain it except I’ve been using this product. Speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> Without saying too much, I am going bald and this could potentially have professional repercussions on me. So I found this product and thanks to NuNutrients I have staved off that fear for now. Who knows how long it’ll last (I’m in my late 40s) but for now I am safe. Every trip to the restroom at work had five to ten minutes of me staring in the mirror and making sure everything was okay with my hair and scalp. Now I don’t have to worry. I apply it every morning before work and I’m good to go.</li>
    <li> I had to take a risk because to let it breathe I stopped wearing hats all the time to cover my bald spot. But now I’m exposed, so people are going to know me as the bald guy. Well less than a year, I have a little bit of growth. I’m going to need a little more to be considered “not bald” but I will keep going with this.Very excited what happends after more than a year using it.</li>
    <li> It’s not a miracle or anything, it’s not flowing, but it’s a small step toward feeling more confident. I actually do feel more confident and I’m able to feel good about things that previously I felt too self-conscious about.The results from this product are very promising. Very happy with this product and would buy more.</li>
    <li> I have been hesitant to use any hair regrowth product. And by hesitant, I mean my wife and I have had several arguments over the subject. I guess, in my younger years products like Rogaine just had a negative connotation in my head. After using NuNutrients I feel quite immature and foolish for not trying it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be tough to admit that it might be time to try a hair regrowth product, but once you get over the stigma its quite refreshing to know that it actually works. I can&#x27;t speak for all hair regrowth products but at least I got luck on my first try. It was easy to use and the result are tangible. Oh, and no more hair related arguments with the wifey. Win, win, win.</li>
    <li> I tried NuNutrients on my receding hairline and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed by the results.  Its easy to use spray application is not the only thing I find good about the product.  Clearly, NuNutrients helps hair regrowth and the results are apparent within a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it for people keen on reversing the effects of hair loss with a product whose results will not disappoint.  NuNutrients is a practical and effective product.</li>
    <li> Fake reviews beware. Most reviews posted here are fake ,  DO NOT TRUST them.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble for the past few years with my hair. Tried many different products that only kind of worked. But this actually did the job. I am young, so having a loss of hair plays a major roll in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is extremely easy to use. Just spray and go. No gels, creams, or other gunk going into your hair. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had been trying to deny that I was starting to loose my hair for a number of years now. It started with a receding hair line, and then began thinning from the crown. By the time I decided to do something about my problem I thought I had perhaps left it too late. I purchased another hair regrowth product and used that for a few months, unfortunately it did nothing to help my situation, and I was left disheartened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend from work recommended the NuNutrients product to me, saying he had seen first hand the great results it produces. I was skeptical at first, having already put my trust into a product before, but thought I&#x27;d give it a go. After one month worth of treatment I can say that I am extremely happy with the results! Already my hair has started to thicken, and the bald patches are beginning to grow over. If you are in a similar situation to what I was a month ago, I could not recommend this product highly enough!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this one because there are a lot of regrowth treatments out there, and I have been scammed before. My brother started losing his hair when he turned 28, he got it from my father. My father gave him the same treatment he himself was using, but I didn&#x27;t work well. (Not everything works for everybody!) Othat same website we got my fathers from, we found New Nutrients Advanced and he ordered it because it was the cheapest. He has been using it on the thinning middle for about 2 months now and I have to say, the stuff seems like a miracle! The thinning middle spot has just about disappeared, and his hair is shiny and healthy looking. I run my fingers through it, and it is so soft and full. He says he will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses NuNutrients and the difference is jaw-dropping. A lot of products he has tried did little-to-nothing for him, but this one has been amazing. I noticed some regrowth within 2 weeks of starting and we are now on week 3. It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> My good guy friend was really worried about his hair loss-appearance means a lot to him. I bought this for him for Christmas and he&#x27;s sent me picture updates every week. I can see the improvements! This stuff really works! He was excited when he got it for Christmas and is still excited about it! He tells me how easy and quick it is to use with real results! :)</li>
    <li> This treatment is amazing, I have used it in the past and it works great. It isn&#x27;t even much time consuming all you need to do is wait a few days and you see results right away. Good product and is safe to use, would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely great, I tried many products and NONE of them seemed to be working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I received it and BOOM! Gave it some time (because the reviews told me to) and I was amazed to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;Hair growing back!</li>
    <li> I’m not a scientist but I have exhausted all the other ways to stave off hair loss. The chemicals in this are different from other products I have given a shot. I am very hopeful for results.</li>
    <li> I started using NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth because after using this for at least  6 months my hair standing strong and looking good. Will continue to use this product until I achieved my goal.</li>
    <li> I am using it for a fourth month. No visible changes.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my father-in-law. He had tried many other products before this one. He was skeptical but he tried it and he loved it. He started seeing results in two weeks!! He has so much confidence now.this product works wonders he wasn&#x27;t completely bald but he had patches of hair missing. The product deffinitly started hair regrowth!</li>
    <li> Has anyone at all read the 5 star reviews? Some of the 5 star reviews are from people who haven&#x27;t even used the product yet.....really?  Look at this review:  5.0 out of 5 stars No Issues, August 6, 2014&lt;br /&gt;By Rich Leite - See all my reviewsThis review is from: NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment for Men - Easy-to-use Spray Bottle (One Bottle - 2 FL Oz) (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I can’t review this product really because I haven’t used it for that long. But so far I’ve had no issues with it. Box and bottle are exactly as described, a little smaller than I thought they would be. I’ll use it first then leave the rest of my review, but so far 5 out of 5 because it’s been easy to use, and I have no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can&#x27;t review this product because you haven&#x27;t used it that long but you did anyway?  Really?  Wow I haven&#x27;t seen so many bogus reviews in a long time. Just to let everyone know I have not purchased this product and you have to rate the procuct when giving a review or response so I only give it one star, however the product could be effective. I just had to post this because some of the reviews seem to be highly inaccurate.</li>
    <li> So there are a lot of great reviews for this product, and it appears that some were fake. I didn&#x27;t realize this when I bought the product 2 months ago, but I decided to try it anyway. I&#x27;ve been using it 1-2 times a day and even diluted the bottle to make it last longer. Amazingly I&#x27;m actually seeing new hair growth where there was none before and my hair looks thicker all around. There have been no side effects and it&#x27;s super easy just rub it in your hair and let it dry. I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and I&#x27;m so glad I have something to slow down or stop my hair loss. I have a receding hairline in the front and it&#x27;s working for me. Good luck if you decide to try it, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> TOO EXPENSIVE BUT DOES THE JOB VERY WELL!  I RECOMMEND THIS SERUM!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product, I purchased it last month and I must say I can already see results. The spray is very easy to use and most importantly it works. I have used products like this before but this one blows them out of the water.</li>
    <li> I just start using it ao can&#x27;t really give a good feedback about the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bald...I have been for YEARS...and I&#x27;ve been ok with it.  But now, as I get older, I have been wishing I could get my hair back...or at least some of it...if for nothing else, just for a new hairstyle!  Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and I can definitely see results.  NOTICEABLE results.  I actually have hair growing on my head at a much faster rate than before.  I&#x27;m pretty excited to see what my results will be in a few more months of using this.  If you want to regrow your hair...give this a try...it&#x27;s working for me!</li>
    <li> I bought NuNutrients for my husband. Problems with hair had started at age 25 with the dramatic appearance of gray hair. and soon the hair does not just fall out, but was started baldness. The result is magnificent. Hair fall stopped, shine, even thicker steel. in my opinion is very important for men easy-to-use of this thing, because men don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time on their appearance  usually</li>
    <li> Used for about 3 months. Saw absolutely no benefit. Then upon recommendation by one of my friends, I changed my diet to mostly raw and organic foods and vegetables.....saw HUGE changes after only 1 month....no more bald spots, much thicker/fuller hair, saw regrowth everywhere!  When they say, you are what you eat, they were right!  The ONLY way you&#x27;re going to get major changes to your hair quantity/quality is to makes changes to the INSIDE. No cream or magical spray is going to get you a full head of hair.....you have to change your lifestyle and more importantly, your diet!</li>
    <li> Age sucks...especially aging over time and losing hair..tried this product after my friend had told me he had used a previous product of theirs that restored thickness to his hair. I was a little skeptical at first of how fast I would see legitimate results but it has not disappointed me! My hair has looked much thicker than before and Has given me a more youthful appearance again!</li>
    <li> I used 5 stars to let you people know not to buy this. Look at all the 5 star reviews none of them purchased the product!</li>
    <li> While I still have most of my hair, I have been having a few troubled areas when it comes to a few noticeable, but tiny, bald spots. This has helped maintain some of the growth that covers those bald spots, and I&#x27;m very glad that I found this product, due to its affordability and its superb effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my father who was thinning on the top a bit (he doesn&#x27;t have a receding hair line). He used the product in accordance with the directions (which I had to read to him because the print was too small for him to see). The results are phenomenal and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for people who are attempting to stop premature (or not so premature) balding and want to regrow the hair they have already lost. The spray bottle is super easy to use and is small enough that it can be taken on trips as needed. Though the price is a bit high, my father&#x27;s happiness proves to me that it was worth every penny. His overall quality of life has improved now that he has the confidence that a full head of hair can bring.</li>
    <li> Came in original packaging, just what i wanted.</li>
    <li> This product works great and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than Bosley I got it for my brother and I&#x27;m so happy he can feel a lot better about his hair instead of constantly wearing hats all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed how good this is working for me. I was really skeptical at the beginning on buying it but I gave it a try and I&#x27;m happy I did buy it as it&#x27;s really doing a miracle on my hair. I just don&#x27;t have enough words for gratitude for this product but all I can say is that I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I got this for my old man, he really like this product because he improve his hair growth. In his bald spots, this product have nutrients that regrowth and act as treatment for that specific spot. My dad will continue to use this product because it has help his hair.</li>
    <li> As a growing man you start to lose hair unless your are lucky and keep it forever. With this product you can be! You just need to use it and bam! Your hair is starting to come back and now more confidence for you.</li>
    <li> I was noticing my hair getting thinner on the top of my head and I realized that I was losing my hair.  I was desperate to find a solution.  I am only 28 and didn&#x27;t want to be bald by 30 yrs old.  I come upon your product after a buddy mentioned this to me.  I quickly order the product and anxiously waited.  My order soon arrived and I was on my way to use it.  After reading the instructions, I applied the serum to my hair and took care to follow the instructions.  I did this daily and continued to use the serum.  I began to see new growth, in a matter of weeks, I was very pleased with my ending results.  The price of this product was worth every penny that I paid and I will be recommending to all of my friends.  Thanks for saving my youth.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s hair started thinning as soon as he turned 50 and he was so down about it. I ordered this product for him and after four weeks he has started to notice the thin spots filling in. He loves it and loves his hair. His hair is thicker and healthy looking now after just a few uses. I will definitely be ordering another box and I will be recommended this to my father. Great product.</li>
    <li> After doing extensive research both online and offline, I got this product for my husband. He has always been conscious of the declining hairline, but hardly gets time to do anything about it due to his erratic work schedules. I did some research for him and stumbled upon this amazing product. It comes in a handy container that my husband can carry on his trips without any mess. Its been over 2 months now that he has been using the product and I can already see some positive effects. He is happy with the results, and so do I... Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> this product is awesome it grows back the hair in no time , i have purchased it for a friend and he was so happy with the result , and this the third bottle that I have purchased  for my friend using to help him keep his hair and look younger . After using for about 3 months I can certainly tell that you that my friend is loosing less hair in the shower for sure. I even notice some growth of new hair on his hairline. he said he is gonna continue to use this product and even got one for his father .</li>
    <li> So my dad needed something quick, he says. I need to look younger he says, I said ok, but what product could fill in the blank and not break the bank. Then I was in the store and heard some guys talking, so I asked where can I get that from ? I was give the link and ordered and now may be on the 10th bottle for him. He has to have spares,lol. Live it just as if I were him.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my grandfather who hair is pretty much thin out. Nothing else seems  to works for him until I got him  this product .It really is making a difference .</li>
    <li> My hair grows back now. Im now not having problem with my hair because of this product NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth.</li>
    <li> ON MY FIRST BOTTLE AND HAVE NOT NOTICED ANYTHING YET</li>
    <li> Rip off!!!! All these other comments are fake!</li>
    <li> Today i feel younger, now because of my skin, not because of teet but because of hair. The hair that i have when i was younger.</li>
    <li> First this product is in a convenient spray bottle.  No need to shampoo the product in which could take time just spray it on and massage it in.  Second its made by natural ingredients, this is also important when choosing such a hair care product.  Yes, the price is a bit high but its worth the investment, in the fact that it will last awhile due to being in a spray bottle and its natural to use.  I can&#x27;t stress that part enough chemicals from hair care products can be absorbed from the pores in the scalp its always a good idea to use products that are natural, when ever possible.</li>
    <li> To early for any results. Most of these products usually take 2 or 3 months to see any results depending on the advanced state of your hair loss. However it is a very expensive product.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe this actually works! (not paid to write this lol) Bought this for someone else, and after the use of 1 bottle, they noticed thickening and less falling out of the hair.</li>
    <li> There is something called Biochanin A that inhibits the inhibitor. I’m not a scientist but I have exhausted all the other ways to stave off hair loss. The chemicals in this are different from other products I have given a shot. I am very hopeful for results and I will be back to report my progress. But for now, it’s easy to use and I am feeling great.</li>
    <li> Got the serum, works well so far it&#x27;s only been 5 months and I&#x27;m seeing that I have stopped losing hair. Waiting for more hair to grow back but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have seen lots of other products similar to this one and I would slap a bargain sticker on this one. This is a good price for a very good product, I have many relatives who have used it with much success. Myself, I just started a couple months ago and I am hoping I have similar results as my brethren. Will continue to use and update.</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail today however, after purchasing, read the one-star reviews and... yeah, went and read through the five-star reviews.  They&#x27;re all one shot raters that came out of the blue to rate this product. Coincidentally to give this product a five-star rating.  Anyways, the product is in hand.  Will use it, but, am skeptical and feel a bit a tad bit duped.  Anyways, I&#x27;ll get an education here in the next month or two.  If it works, great, and I&#x27;ll upgrade my review to reflect and sing its praises.  If it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll again, be upgrading my review to reflect followed by having maudlin regret over pissing away my hard earned tax-dollars on a sham product. Here&#x27;s to hoping it&#x27;s not.  Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;25-Sep-14 Updated&lt;br /&gt;Sorry folks, this product is a dud.  Read my comments below for further details.  Will re-emphasize one major point here though. TRUST BUT VERIFY, meaning, if you see a plethora of five star reviews.  Make sure the reviewers are real and not cookie-cut-accounts that the seller/distributers are creating to push their product.  Easiest form of verification is clicking on their purchase history.  If they have had the account for a significant amount of time and have a track record of purchases with reviews, the review/reviewer is probably real.  If the account is a day old with no history, then there is a 99% probability that it&#x27;s fake.  Cheers.</li>
    <li> First thing you will notice when you get this is that the NuNutrients Advanced Hair Growth Treatment is not like others that are offered out there. There aren&#x27;t to many that will give you a three month supply normally you either get a few weeks or a month.  I have used this for about a week now and I haven&#x27;t seen to much of a difference yet but I am going to give it the full three months to see what the results are. The results can take 4 months to 1 year to see a improvement but it depends on the severity of the hair loss.  This is very easy to put on and its noting that is to messy and it does not smell horribly bad. I will update after the full three months are up but I am happy with this so far and I am confident this will give me results I am hoping for .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I remember that was the time when I started to notice my dad&#x27;s hairline. I wanted to take preventative measures against going bald myself, so I decided to use NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth to keep losing hair. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Hard to say how much this product helped. I used in conjunction with  Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo. its been 4 months since ive been using both products and have seen a little improvement which is better than none. I&#x27;m suffering from the widow peak or frontal baldness. Im writing a review cause I cant say it hurt and am reordering for another 4 month trial. Going to try the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush | Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth this time also. I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product but believe in a multiple assault against hairloss</li>
    <li> Always read the one star reviews. I bought and used two bottles. No side effects and no effects at all. I use Rogaine foam, a laser comb and take Brewer&#x27;s Yeast daily. That limits the damage. That&#x27;s about all you can do.</li>
    <li> Packaged in a 2 ounce pump bottle, and I cannot smell it. I have read a lot says it smells good but I can smell nothing. I bought this for my son, he is only 25 and convinced he is going bald early. His hair line at temples is receding and is a touch thin on top. I admit and I can&#x27;t tell him this but he did have very thick hair, but he is correct, it is pretty thin up there now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has used this for 4 days now so we really can&#x27;t see a big difference yet of course. He has said, he isn&#x27;t finding the little short hairs all over his shoulders as much as he did. If it is helping not lose hair then maybe it is working. I will update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did study the ingredients pretty good and they seem to be quality and recommended for hair nutrition and regrowth, so I do think it will work. I am being brave, I got th bright idea if it worked for men&#x27;s hair, why wouldn&#x27;t it work on women&#x27;s eye brows? So.......... I got an old eye liner brush out and I am going to try it on brows, very lightly of course, dabbed on with a brush and them rubbed in but I really need it there. Will update that also in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. However your own opinion might vary. I received no monitory compensation and I am not required to give a good review. I am also not associated with the seller in any way. This disclosure is in accordance with Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising. If my review was helpful to you, would you please vote, yes. I try to do my reviews honest with the pros and cons I can see myself in a product, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
    <li> This product is very similar to Rogaine. I feel like the results are similar and the only thing different is the price, at least in my location. Also this comes in a spray and can be applied to be invisible on the head versus a foam which needs to dry completely before leaving the house or showing up at work or the store. The top of my head seems to be filling out a little bit and everything that is happening is very encouraging.</li>
    <li> Finally something has come along that actually does what it claims it can do. In the past, I&#x27;ve tried Rogaine and other similar regrowth hair products. None of them seemed to work. When a friend of mine recommended NuNutrients, I was a bit skeptical at first. Upon opening the product box, I noticed that the spray bottle was easily accessible. I also liked the fact that the smell of the spray was not overwhelmingly potent like the other products I used in the past. More importantly, when I applied the solution on my scalp, it did not irritate my scalp at all.     After using the spray as the instructions recommended, I started to notice that my hair was actually growing back. I was amazed because the new growth looked fuller and thicker than the hair that had been there all along. Hair thinning was always been something I have fully embarrassed by. Using NuNutrients has helped me to gain my confidence back. I can go out in public without feeling so self conscious now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third box of this and am happy with the results so far. My hair really does look and feel thicker. I&#x27;ve used many hair growth products in the past is this is one of the few that really work. Removing DHT is the only proven hair regrowth treatment that I&#x27;ve heard of actually working. I like how this product uses Red Clover extract instead of pharmaceutical chemicals, like the ones found in prescription alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is thinning, give this about two months and you&#x27;ll notice the process has slowed or stopped. Finally Something that works!</li>
    <li> I stayed true, I follow the recommendation and using NuNutrients Advanced Hair Regrowth product for 2 months and I started to see new hair growth. I noticed fine hair around my forehead and realized they were new hair growth. My wife definitely sees the difference and I don&#x27;t see as much of my scalp as I used to. I&#x27;ll be taking this product to use more. Great product to use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product personally, but my boyfriend says it is working. He has used it for a few months and has thicker hair and new hair growth too. He says it is taking a while but he will continue to use it for as long as it keeps showing results. I am glad he finally found something that worked after years of searching. He has renewed confidence that shows.</li>
    <li> This spray product definitely lives up to it&#x27;s claims. It takes some time for the solution to set in and get working. But after consistent use, you will notice new roots start growing in!</li>
    <li> What an awesome product! I am a traveling stylist that services seniors. I am always being asked by my clients husband&#x27;s what can help grow their hair. I found this product and tried it out , it was easy to apply and I noticed results in weeks. The hair was thicker, darker, and a little longer. I suggest this product to any man young and old.</li>
    <li> My fiance started using this product and just three months later, he has a full head of hair! I never usually buy into these kinds of products, but for the price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Boy am I glad I did! His head of hair looks like it did when we first met almost 15 years ago! I would recommend this to anyone. It is safe and easy to use! You just spray it onto the effected area and let it do its job! This product is worth every penny and then some!</li>
    <li> I used to have thinning hair. Which lead to a long span of my adulthood being awash in depression and low confidence. This was recommended to me by a friend and what do you know, it actually works! Within weeks I noticed a change in the length and thickness of my hair. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> NuNutrients is an affordable way for us to see regrowth in my husband&#x27;s hair. We have tried other products but this one seems to be the safest as well. We also like the easy way to apply by using a spray bottle....or if he chooses to spray it in his hands. We are seeing great results and love that it too is made here in the US!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;ve tried many, many similar products to no avail so needless to say, I was extremely skeptical.  But I was also desperate!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months now and I cannot say enough.  Simply stated, it works!!!  My hair is ACTUALLY growing back.  I have hair on my head in places that I&#x27;ve not had hair in for decades!</li>
    <li> Simple solution to hair loss. It&#x27;s not time consuming or hard to use. Results shows rather fast and this is inexpensive for what it does. Nunnutrients made growing hair back much easier than it needs to be. I&#x27;m much more confident going outside now.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you a story. When I was 11 years old, I got my first grey hair. By 16, I was already balding. I felt humiliated at school, I actually got clearance to wear a hat during class because I was so self conscious about my hair. As I got older (and balder), my hair seriously impacted my social life.. I was afraid to go out in public because I wasn&#x27;t confident in how I looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed immediate results. My hairline is coming back, and I don&#x27;t have to wear a hat everytime I go out in public anymore. If you&#x27;re like me, and want your hair back, USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve been getting older, I&#x27;ve been noticing that my hair has been thinning very quickly. This is something that has been passed down through my whole family. NuNutrients product has changed my life! Within days, I was able to notice a difference in the thickness of my hair. I&#x27;m now more comfortable with going out in public without a hat, and I look great!</li>
    <li> When my boyfriend first started seeing baldness he didn&#x27;t know what to do. He went to the doctor and they gave him treatment that didn&#x27;t help at all. So when he tried Nunutrient hair treatment he was so relieved at how much it has worked for him. Now he don&#x27;t have to worry bout his hair being thin anymore.</li>
    <li> MyAge is 25 years completed my graduation.Got good job in software.My parents strated searching for matches for me, as of now i have seen 7 matches but all are failed, this happend because of my bald head.Recently i started using NuNutrient Advanced Hair Growth Treatment, within short span of time hiar growth started on my head.This product is very economical and effective compared other hair growth products.</li>
    <li> My dad used this and he saw a major difference in his hair thinning. NuNtrients is saving his hair :)</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well... I could feel the difference within a couple of uses only... Hair stopped falling and new tiny hairs could be noticed coming up... It also leaves the hair smooth and clean... The quality of hair also improves... You can feel hair strands thickening ...</li>
    <li> i think this product is pretty good. i think it is worth the pay for this. At first I hesitated but it was definitely worth it. IF you are looking for a hair regrowth treatment this is a great choice!</li>
