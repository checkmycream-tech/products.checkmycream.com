      <li>Seller was fine though, product came in good tact and on time.</li>

      <li>I would&#x27;t go so far as to say you&#x27;ll get &amp;#34;epic volume&amp;#34; but its a very good mosturizing duo.</li>

      <li>but do not use all the time, change to a more moisturizing shampoo from wash to wash</li>

      <li>it felt more brittle.</li>
      <li>Works great for my thanks n hair</li>
      <li>I find that it works better than most volumizing shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

      <li>I noticed the top of my hair looked more \\&quot;lifted\\&quot; than before.</li>
      <li>I wanted to give this product a better rating at first because I LOVED the Superstar line, but I have a feeling this seller shipped me an expired product.</li>
      <li>it volumizes pretty good.</li>
      <li>At first I thought I was having a good hair day</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m happy with soft manageable hair any day.</li>
      <li>My hair always feels more full and healthy after use.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t even tangle anymore  even after backcombing I get the volume and the conditioner makes it easy to brush out at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>If you have curly hair I strongly recommend this product, I know that TIGI makes a curly hair shampoo</li>
      <li>This duo was a good deal and it makes my hair nice and such.</li>
      <li>Most of these products give me a head full of tangles.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use if you have a lot of fine strands and want volume in your roots.  </li>
      <li>Still my absolute favorite product!</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite shampoo/conditioner!</li>
      <li>It really does boost my hair up and gives it some nice volume.</li>
      <li>but unfortunately it&#x27;s filled with toxins....</li>
      <li>Also, this product is sulfate free</li>
      <li>I would suggest this product to anyone looking for a sulfate free volumizing shampoo.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain too much :P</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure of it.</li>
      <li>Just super fine.  </li>
      <li>first impressions are that the smell is lovely, it is strawberry and sweet, yet not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It smells fine, but I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair that sometimes frizzes, and I was looking for a shampoo that would give me some lift up top while defrizzing my hair</li>
      <li>AND I have manageable volume in my baby fine hair for the first time since EVER.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s five star shampoo in its own right, this stuff is like it says, EPIC.  </li>
      <li>Second, I love the smell of this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I like this shampoo and conditioner for my fine straight hair.  </li>
      <li>It is sulfate free and gentle on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Only benefit is that it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but I feel it is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>For my hair I better stick with the many other branches of bedhead I do like.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as great as the other bed head products but it does give me much cleaner and healthier hair.</li>
      <li>Luckily I still have the pumps from my first order.</li>
      <li>But it does the job right for my hair</li>
      <li>One large bottle lasts a full year.</li>
      <li>If you DO have dry hair I would suggest that any kind of volumizing shampoos are going have that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using epic volume for about 6 months, haven&#x27;t felt the need to color my brunette since! My hair is vibrant and shiny like never before. AND I have manageable volume in my baby fine hair for the first time since EVER. Love the scent. Price was great for the salon size bottles. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Dont think I will ever stray from this product after using it. My hair always feels more full and healthy after use. I am trying to grow it out and make it more healthy and when I use this product sometimes I dont even have to style. My hair has volume and falls nicely when I let it air dry. Plus the product smells great and the scent lasts for hours after</li>
    <li> I have never used Tigi products before and for some reason I decided to give it a try because I was tired of drugstore hair products. To my surprise, this product really add volume to your hair! I noticed the top of my hair looked more \\&quot;lifted\\&quot; than before. At first I thought I was having a good hair day but after one week of use I have to admit it was Tigi Bed Head Styleshots that did the trick. Also, this product is sulfate free and it smells so freaking delicious!</li>
    <li> Smooth and great scent</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this product a better rating at first because I LOVED the Superstar line, but I have a feeling this seller shipped me an expired product. The wrap around the bottles was not as pictured and was torn in half with a sticker over the original barcode. Also, only the conditioner was in a pump bottle, the shampoo was in a squeeze. It arrived on time and seems to be working okay but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with seller and the fact that it&#x27;s probably expired unnerves me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  And amazon is the place to buy it.  I used to get this 2 for 20.00 deal at a store...and I find it on amazon actually cheaper!  And the product works great and is amazing!  Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner off and on for years.  I would&#x27;t go so far as to say you&#x27;ll get &amp;#34;epic volume&amp;#34; but its a very good mosturizing duo. My husband loves the strawberry milkshake scent.</li>
    <li> I switch Tigi out with a few other brands of shampoo so it sees regular rotation with me.  I find that it works better than most volumizing shampoo and conditioner.  I have very fine hair, although a lot of it, so I am not sure it would work as well with somebody with less hair.  I definitely use it along with volumizing mouse and my hair holds body for almost the entire day.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair feeling dry and course. Great smell but not impressed, going back to the blue/green bottle.</li>
    <li> I have to give this a 5 star for the actual seller of this product.  Second, I love the smell of this stuff!  For volume, it gets 3 stars.  If you have lots of fine hair and just need your roots lifted with volume don&#x27;t get this because it&#x27;s kind of thick.  I am using the shampoo for luxury bubbles.  Even at that I can&#x27;t use it for my toddler because it stings his eyes.  For my hair I better stick with the many other branches of bedhead I do like.  Hope this helps!  Breakdown....don&#x27;t use if you have a lot of fine strands and want volume in your roots.  It will be harder to brush or style your hair, specifically if you&#x27;re used to using high end salon hair products.  This stuff is great on a budget because it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Ugh I wanted to love this, because it really made my hair look good, but it made me have the worst allergies ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So horrible. Made my face break out in a rash, and made my eyes so irritated. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Good but do not use all the time, change to a more moisturizing shampoo from wash to wash so your hair doesnt get STIFF.</li>
    <li> Very helpful!  Fast delivery!  I&#x27;ll be back :)</li>
    <li> Works great for my thanks n hair</li>
    <li> This is  the best volumizing shampoo I have tried to date. It does not weigh my hair down at all. The conditioner leaves my hair feeling silkuy... even after I volumize ( aka backcomb it within an inch of its life). My hair doesn&#x27;t even tangle anymore  even after backcombing I get the volume and the conditioner makes it easy to brush out at the end of the day.  Amazing shampoo and conditioner! :)</li>
    <li> Love it! It smells like strawberry cream pie!! This shampoo &amp; conditioner works wonders. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love bed head products but this was a real let down. My hair got really dry, I only used the conditioner at the ends and still after my hair drying it felt more brittle. Didn&#x27;t experience any boost in volume.Only benefit is that it smells amazing. Seller was fine though, product came in good tact and on time. The shampoo just wasn&#x27;t for me I guess.</li>
    <li> i love the smell, but it felt heavy and seemed to weigh my hair down quite a bit. I saw less volume instead of more.</li>
    <li> It is definitely the same stuff I buy at my local salon and have been using for years! Which after reading some of the reviews I read on here, made me a little skeptical to order at first; but I am sure glad I did. The smell is heavenly to say the least and it is the only shampoo/conditioner that actually gives my fine thin hair volume. However, the reason I only gave it 3 stars is because when I received it, there was only a pump on one of them. The picture is definitely deceiving, because I was expecting them to both have pumps.. luckily I had a spare from my other bottles of it.</li>
    <li> post partum alopecia is horrible.  i literally lost half of my hair.  this helps to pump it up.  I think it&#x27;s the fact that the shampoo gets your hair really clean, and I think the conditioner is the secret.  leaves hair really nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner!!! Packaging was horrible. All torn and barely together-and my favorite-a broken not working pump! Not bed heads fault-just the third party sellers fault!</li>
    <li> i used to only be able to use this volumizing hair shampoo and conditioner.... it&#x27;s the second time i&#x27;m ordering them but i feel it the volume dies faster than i first used it. however i LOVE the smell on my hair and it lasts awhile!</li>
    <li> I liked it but unfortunately it&#x27;s filled with toxins.... So I switched to a different non-toxic brand</li>
    <li> The products sent had been expired for months (9/2014). Not cool!!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner for my fine straight hair.  It smells great.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like some of the other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> The product was EXPIRED.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, and I have gotten it a salon for about 10 dollars cheaper. I thought they didn&#x27;t sell it anymore, but I guess it comes in twice a year. But you will love the smell and the way the products make your hair feel!</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoo/conditioner combos I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. It really does boost my hair up and gives it some nice volume. If I&#x27;m in a hurry I can use the shampoo without having a mess to deal with later in the day but the conditioner really gives my hair a nice shine and makes it really soft. I can&#x27;t help but petting it which is a rather embarrassing habit to pick up so late in life.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BOMB! Love it!  I used to use Catwalk Your Highness, and that stuff is really good too!  It&#x27;s five star shampoo in its own right, this stuff is like it says, EPIC.  I would give it 6 stars if I could.  I use a stay in and a detangler (waist length hair) my hair does not get dry, seems some others say it dries your hair, but in my case (everyone&#x27;s hair is different) it&#x27;s great.  Maybe if I had dry hair to start with, but I don&#x27;t.  Just super fine.  If you DO have dry hair I would suggest that any kind of volumizing shampoos are going have that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is heavenly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over two years now because it&#x27;s the first shampoo &amp; conditioner that actually makes my hair fuller without being frizzy.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner. They really do work for volume.  After I started using it I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epic volume for a few weeks now. I don&#x27;t really see volume with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It smell good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The shampoo is thick and a little hard to pump out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I have to use alot of shampoo to get a lather.&lt;br /&gt;When I do lather, it feels like I have glue or something on my head, making my hair feel stiff.&lt;br /&gt;After the shampoo, I have to use a lot of conditioner to then soften my hair.</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the deal.    I&#x27;m 27, she&#x27;s like.. umm. 24?    We live together.    I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m balding, but I&#x27;m such a skeptic it&#x27;s kinda ridiculous. I look in the mirror and try not to freak out. Dunno if this stuff works yet. Never tried it.    She looks good when she uses it. It smells like antibiotics (the one that&#x27;s like bubble gum and doesn&#x27;t do s*** for you anymore). Her hair was smoother and blacker..?? And had more volume. I&#x27;m pretty sure of it. You&#x27;ll get over the smell. Trust me.    -A</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo and conditioner because of the reviews I had read.  My hair has been damaged and I am trying to grow it out before it gets cut.  I got this shampoo and I am very happy with it.  It is sulfate free and gentle on my hair.  Good smell, too.  I would suggest this product to anyone looking for a sulfate free volumizing shampoo.</li>
    <li> Also getting hard to find in stores . Only shampoo that I don&#x27;t itch from . Did take a little longer to receive than expected.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that sometimes frizzes, and I was looking for a shampoo that would give me some lift up top while defrizzing my hair a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions are that the smell is lovely, it is strawberry and sweet, yet not overpowering. It has staying power, and all my friends love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Also, a little goes a long way with this stuff, about a nickel-to quarter sized amount of each will be more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a great job of defining my curls and defrizzing, even thought that&#x27;s not really what it&#x27;s meant for. My hair is softer and healthier than ever, although it sometimes makes my hair look a little greasy. On the volumizing front, to  be honest I didn&#x27;t see much change. There were slight differences, but there wasn&#x27;t much volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I love this stuff, and I definitely will be repurchasing. If you have curly hair I strongly recommend this product, I know that TIGI makes a curly hair shampoo but I&#x27;ve tried both and I actually like this way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. It works well on her hair, she can use it every day and it smells great (like strawberries).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as great as the other bed head products but it does give me much cleaner and healthier hair. Most of these products give me a head full of tangles. I was aggravated that I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. The only disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t really add volume to my hair, but I have naturally voluminous hair so it doesn&#x27;t phase me!</li>
    <li> Love this product for fine thin hair. Used it for years and highly recommend. Smells great too. One large bottle lasts a full year. Only need half a pump with every wash.</li>
    <li> I read some good reviews and thought this product might work well for my hair. I have very touchy hair and have to be cautious of which products I use as my hair gets oily. This set was alright for the first couple of days but then started weighing my hair down. I cannot use it now because when I do, my hair is an oily mess by end of day. It does, though, add volume as it says.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite shampoo/conditioner! Smells AMAZING! Shampoo has a rich lather and conditioner is thick and creamy but doesn&#x27;t leave my fine hair weighed down. Did I mention it smells AMAZING!!!?!! MmmmmMmmm Strawberries!</li>
    <li> this smells wonderful and works amazing. I have really just overall bad hair and this solves most of my issues. It makes my hair smooth, soft, adds volume, doesn&#x27;t make it greasy and makes my dead ends feel better. not to mention it smells orgasmic. The price on here is like 50% cheaper than you&#x27;d pay anywhere else too.</li>
    <li> I fully appreciate the volumizing effects of this set on my hair; I extremely dislike the intense, sugary sweet smell of the products.  Thankfully, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold the scent too strongly once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I felt the need to write one for this product. About a year ago my hair was falling out and became extremely thin and breaking off, i ended up having to cut it past my shoulders and i&#x27;ve been trying to grow it out now for just over a year. I used to always switch up my shampoos and conditioners because I have never used anything I actually liked. This stuff is amazing! My hair is so smooth, soft, smells great and really thick! This is a product I will be buying again. I never noticed a different in my hair until now :)</li>
    <li> Love it. Gives my hair volume, shine. Would recommend on any type hair.</li>
    <li> the smell of the shampoo is really very chemical strawberry but i don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s not staying for a long time. it volumizes pretty good.</li>
    <li> Still my absolute favorite product! Doesn&#x27;t leave residue on hair even with hard water in use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this duo of shampoo and conditioner.  I have been growing my hair for a few years now and it is fairly long.  I was sticking with my drug store shampoo and conditioners (Pantene and Herbal Essence) and I was continually coming out of the shower with knotted, ratty, frizzy looking hair.  I decided to try out Bed Head and I was immediately impressed by how smooth by hair was right out of the shower and how easily I was able to comb through.  It&#x27;s pricey, but I feel it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This duo was a good deal and it makes my hair nice and such. It smells like bubblegum though, which I can kinda get sick of, but it&#x27;s not that bad lol... But it does the job right for my hair so I can&#x27;t really complain too much :P</li>
    <li> this shampoo feels like the Ti-Gi superstar that I used before I really like the way it makes my hair feel soft and relaxed I don&#x27;t notice incredible body but I&#x27;m happy with soft manageable hair any day. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great smell.  Seems overpowering at first but it does last through the day.  As a volume product it works ok.  My style lasted longer than normal.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo.  I have short fine hair.  When I use this shampoo and conditioner, all I have to do is blow dry my hair--no product--and it looks lovely.  I am very happy with this shampoo and will order it again and again.</li>
    <li> Perfect, with the exception that the picture on the Ad shows pump tops for these products.  After they arrived, we realized that the bottles only had screw tops, and we had to get our old shampoo and conditioner out of the trash so we could get the pumps out of the old bottles.  We would have given a 5 star rating had the received product been exactly like the picture.</li>
    <li> I switched over from Brunette Goddess to this product because my stylist says it brings out more volume for my type of hair, thin and dull. I never had problems with TIGI products. They all work great.</li>
    <li> The smell is terrible and it left my hair in the worst condition.....I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all :(</li>
    <li> Like the strawberry scent that it gives, a lot of people comment on my hair smelling nice. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in volume but i think the green shampoo was better compared to this.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair look fantastic. I have ordered this product before and I although I love the shampoo and conditioner the picture posted is misleading. My first order came with the pumps ( I ordered this last year ), but my second order did not come with the pumps, just the bottles. Luckily I still have the pumps from my first order.</li>
    <li> My hair actually feels more flat. I have very fine hair and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with hair like mine. It smells fine, but I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the price.</li>
