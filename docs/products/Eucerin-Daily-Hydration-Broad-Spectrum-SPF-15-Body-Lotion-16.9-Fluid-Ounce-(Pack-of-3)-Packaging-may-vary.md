      <li>It is awesome</li>
      <li>Contains lactic acid which is a great exfoliator, plus</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a GREAT product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just as great of a consistency.</li>
      <li>Great Product</li>
      <li>This is great.  </li>
      <li>This is a GREAT lotion.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just as great of a consistency.</li>
      <li>Great value for the money.  </li>
      <li>This is a great lotion and the price was incredibly good.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I had heard good things about this Eucerin products from Dr. Oz and tried it.  </li>
      <li>Lotion provides good coverage along with sun protection (SPF15) but seems to leave a somewhat &#x27;greasy&#x27; layer rather than blending into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Good dailyl lotion</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Great Moisturizer Love the SPF for the summertime.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
      <li>I thought for sure, it couldn&#x27;t be this lotion because it&#x27;s made by Eucerin!  </li>
      <li>In our case, we&#x27;re feeding her this formulation of Eucerin because we&#x27;ve conscientiously tried the others and this really is the best product we&#x27;ve found out there.</li>
      <li>It really is the best sunscreen/moisturizer that I have found for my skin.</li>
      <li>Glides on smooth and easy, no scent, but great sun protection.</li>
      <li>great thing, even though it is not eczema lotion/cream, it actually worked very nicely on my eczema.</li>
      <li>Very importantly, this formulation contains SPF 15 sunscreen, something that most of us overlook as we go about our days.</li>
      <li>Then no matter if I end up in the sun or not, I&#x27;m protected from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, AND my skin is smooth and nice.</li>
      <li>Yet it really does moisturize and provide great SPF all day.  </li>
      <li>Use neutrogena lotion with sunscreen, that is much better.</li>
      <li>And the fact that it has an spf makes it better for him.</li>
      <li>In addition, most of these unverified &amp;quot;purchasers&amp;quot; have one review in their review history...</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this lotion, and the lack of fragrance.</li>
      <li>and I just feel it sitting on top of my skin (I use it on my arms and chest).</li>
      <li>I love that it has SPF15</li>
      <li>This is an awesome daily lotion.</li>
      <li>I get this for my husband; he seems to love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this smooth, luxurious feeling moisturizing lotion that also contains SPF 15 sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>It was bright red, warm to the touch and itchy.  </li>
      <li>this be a lesson to all of us to check the fine print, let our opinions be known to the companies we buy from, and SUN SAFELY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s just fine, except for one glaring problem...</li>
      <li>Like the creaminess of the product-- light- not sticky</li>
      <li>Only good for hands and arms.</li>
      <li>I have other lotions that do a great job of moisturizing without any residual layer of &#x27;lotion&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Came quickly, packaged well with all 3 bottle shrink-wrapped.</li>
      <li>I just have to apply them more frequently than the Lubriderm 30, which I and other reviewers greatly miss.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of like taking a vitamin; SPF 15 may not be enough for some of us</li>
      <li>And I rarely breakout.</li>
      <li>It also seems to make the skin on my arm more sensitive and easier to get</li>
      <li>I love this product - have been using it as facial moisturizer too since Elizabeth Arden discontinued their Velva Moisture Film</li>
      <li>(And is MUCH cheaper!)</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
      <li>I hope some more brands introduce similar products.</li>
      <li>My favorite daily moisturizer with SPF.  </li>
      <li>After a thoughtful talk with each of us about how our skin is such an important organ--the Largest organ of the body--he explained why he had been recommending this particular form of Eucerin to patients for years.</li>
      <li>Good heavy coverage on a dry skin especially with Diabetic.&lt;br /&gt;Apply after shower or wash while skin is moist to lighten the cream.&lt;br /&gt;The SPF with indirect sun light surely protected me for years.&lt;br /&gt;Shared</li>
      <li>and I love it so much that I use it every single day in my life at school.</li>
      <li>The Eucerin Daily Protection Fragrance Free is not oily at all</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s working really well.  </li>
      <li>and it seems to absorb into the skin readily.</li>
      <li>Thanks to our doctor, we&#x27;ve been exercising Eucerin &amp;#34;therapy&amp;#34; each day.</li>
      <li>It really does smell like sunscreen--</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen really works; I&#x27;ll go out on a sunny day without additional protection and come home with no burns.</li>
      <li>I was using this on my body and noticed that my skin was getting very tan</li>
      <li>Purchased this in store because they didn&#x27;t have the Lubriderm SPF lotion I normally get.</li>
      <li>Nice and thick with the benefit of SPF 15.</li>
      <li>When I spoke with a Eucurin product representative by phone today she stated that they briefly made it  UVA and UVB effective and due to complaints re product consistently they returned to UVA protective only.</li>
      <li>I also used it on my two young daughters who have sensitive skin &amp; frequent bouts of eczema and they reacted within the first couple of days of using.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try a new moisturizing lotion with sunscreen and decide to try Eucerin.</li>
      <li>The Fragrance Free aspect appeals to this Male &amp; Female team.</li>
      <li>More expensive but worth it!</li>
      <li>It is widely known that broad spectrum protection is the sunscreen standard and has been for many years.</li>
      <li>It started with intense itching on thighs and upper arms on day 1.</li>
      <li>Not only was it itchy but very tender and sore.  </li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin but had not previously had any issues with lotions.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Years ago, this formula was common, but most brands have infiltrated broad spectrum coverage into their products.</li>
      <li>They all seem to say the same exact thing, and they are written by people whose purchases are not verified (if you have actually bought the product &amp;quot;verified purchaser&amp;quot; will appear on your review.  </li>
      <li>this product is FINALLY broad spectrum!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also confusing, because I love their facial moisturizer which IS broad spectrum.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not contain broad spectrum</li>
      <li>I did not suspect it was the lotion and used it again on day 2 because I was going to be put in the sun all day and had no other sun protection.</li>
      <li>First time reviewing a product due to</li>
      <li>Very greasy, would not dry off, even after hours and wiping with a dry towel.  </li>
      <li>Took 2 weeks to clear up and left marks that dont seem to go away!  </li>
      <li>This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT skin cancer or early skin</li>
      <li>The rash appeared like a regular sunburn but it wouldn&#x27;t cover my entire arm and was sometimes up near by shoulders or armpit in an area that was never exposed to sun.  </li>
      <li>This product does not provide broad spectrum protection, only UVA.  </li>
      <li>some friends have complained they can smell it on me -- but I have to wear a sunscreen due to fair skin and previous skin cancers.  </li>
      <li>Im 36 year old male, never have had an allergic reaction to a single thing in my life.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had heard good things about this Eucerin products from Dr. Oz and tried it.  Aweful.  Very greasy, would not dry off, even after hours and wiping with a dry towel.  Never got in my eyes, but both my eyes and my wifes eyes were burning.  I do not recommend this product at all.  Use neutrogena lotion with sunscreen, that is much better.</li>
    <li> Purchased this in store because they didn&#x27;t have the Lubriderm SPF lotion I normally get. Will be returning it and ordering Lubriderm here on Amazon cause this has the gross sticky sunscreen feel to it. Not to mention, it doesn&#x27;t protect against skin cancer, only sunburn - shoulda read the back before buying it cause that&#x27;s a deal breaker from the get go. Bummer. Fix your stuff Eucerin!</li>
    <li> I guess Eucerin listened... this product is FINALLY broad spectrum! I just checked after a comment was left on this review. Woo hoo!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still only three stars, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to spread as well as the others, therefore I will use it quicker. And I might still be miffed at them from before (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the only product I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s comparable in price and availability is Lubriderm. I hope some more brands introduce similar products. Hear that, Vaseline, Keri, and St. Ives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let this be a lesson to all of us to check the fine print, let our opinions be known to the companies we buy from, and SUN SAFELY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed to purchase this product. As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s just fine, except for one glaring problem...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not contain broad spectrum protection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this mean? It means rather than protecting the skin from both UVA and UVB rays, it only protects you from one. What does THAT mean? It means that while it WILL keep you from getting sunburned, this lotion contains nothing that will protect you from premature aging or skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging itself is rather misleading. It makes no mention of this, except for a small excerpt on the back:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Warnings&lt;br /&gt;Skin/Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: ... This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT skin cancer or early skin aging.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be more dangerous than nothing at all, because it gives the wearer a false sense of security. If you begin to get a sunburn, at least you know it&#x27;s time to head to the shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just by chance that I researched this and I don&#x27;t want anyone else to be in the dark. It&#x27;s also confusing, because I love their facial moisturizer which IS broad spectrum.  Too bad there&#x27;s not more consistency within the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, this formula was common, but most brands have infiltrated broad spectrum coverage into their products. It&#x27;s expected to become law at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what&#x27;s the alternative? [[ASIN:B004X8KP9Q Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion SPF 15 Moisturizer with Sunscreen, 13.5  Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just as great of a consistency. While it too will keep you from getting a sunburn, it will also keep the wrinkles and cancer away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, Eucerin decides to follow suit.spectrum coverage into their products. It&#x27;s expected to become law at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what&#x27;s the alternative? [[ASIN:B004X8KP9Q Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion SPF 15 Moisturizer with Sunscreen, 13.5  Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just as great of a consistency. While it too will keep you from getting a sunburn, it will also keep the wrinkles and cancer away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, Eucerin decides to follow suit.</li>
    <li> Yet it really does moisturize and provide great SPF all day.  I don&#x27;t mind putting it on every morning. Great Product</li>
    <li> Only good for hands and arms. Causes breakouts on face, neck, and chest. And I rarely breakout. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product. with sun protect. Tx</li>
    <li> I get this for my husband; he seems to love it.  And the fact that it has an spf makes it better for him.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I just wanted a daily lotion which doubles as SPF protection so I can just put it on in the morning and go. It does get a little oily on the face after a while, but a small price to pay for fewer wrinkles. Came quickly, packaged well with all 3 bottle shrink-wrapped. One for home, one for work, and one for backup. This will last all summer.</li>
    <li> Thanks to our doctor, we&#x27;ve been exercising Eucerin &amp;#34;therapy&amp;#34; each day. After a thoughtful talk with each of us about how our skin is such an important organ--the Largest organ of the body--he explained why he had been recommending this particular form of Eucerin to patients for years. The Fragrance Free aspect appeals to this Male &amp; Female team. The Eucerin Daily Protection Fragrance Free is not oily at all and it seems to absorb into the skin readily. Very importantly, this formulation contains SPF 15 sunscreen, something that most of us overlook as we go about our days. It&#x27;s kind of like taking a vitamin; SPF 15 may not be enough for some of us but it&#x27;s better than nothing! Sunscreen relevance aside, your Skin is Thirsty; feed her! In our case, we&#x27;re feeding her this formulation of Eucerin because we&#x27;ve conscientiously tried the others and this really is the best product we&#x27;ve found out there.</li>
    <li> Love this smooth, luxurious feeling moisturizing lotion that also contains SPF 15 sunscreen.  I use it on my arms and legs every morning, with a stronger sunscreen on my face.  Then no matter if I end up in the sun or not, I&#x27;m protected from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, AND my skin is smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> It really does smell like sunscreen-- some friends have complained they can smell it on me -- but I have to wear a sunscreen due to fair skin and previous skin cancers.  I only bought this because Lubriderm SPF 30 is no longer made.  When this is empty I will try other brands -- the SPF 15 choices are plentiful.  I just have to apply them more frequently than the Lubriderm 30, which I and other reviewers greatly miss.  I like other Eucerin products, but not this one.</li>
    <li> I find this product to be extremely greasy. I have tried applying it in the morning before work for a month or so and I just feel it sitting on top of my skin (I use it on my arms and chest). I cannot wait to get home and shower it off. I give up on using it and am just going to give it away.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT lotion.  Contains lactic acid which is a great exfoliator, plus spf.  Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best kept secrets about lactic acid is that it helps with acne.  I use this on my face (as well as my body) as my spf, and it keeps my acne prone skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I wonder about some of the 1 star reviews.  They all seem to say the same exact thing, and they are written by people whose purchases are not verified (if you have actually bought the product &amp;quot;verified purchaser&amp;quot; will appear on your review.  In addition, most of these unverified &amp;quot;purchasers&amp;quot; have one review in their review history...this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a GREAT product.  Eucerin is one of the few products around that continually uses lactic acid or lactates in their products, and I will continue to purchase them!</li>
    <li> It is awesome and I love it so much that I use it every single day in my life at school.</li>
    <li> great thing, even though it is not eczema lotion/cream, it actually worked very nicely on my eczema. In fact I did not know I had an eczema before my dermatologist told me, but I already bought this so I just use it. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was using this on my body and noticed that my skin was getting very tan and I even developed a weird growth on my chest area. Look closely at the small print on the back of this lotion and you will see it states that it is NOT protecting against skin cancer and aging! I am not happy with this lotion from Eucerin.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion and the price was incredibly good.</li>
    <li> This lotion caused me to break out in the most painful rash I&#x27;ve ever had.  Not only was it itchy but very tender and sore.  It took me well over a week of using steroid creams to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> I used the product for about a week before breaking out in a red itchy rash on the areas I used it. I do have sensitive skin but had not previously had any issues with lotions. Obviously, I will not continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick with the benefit of SPF 15.</li>
    <li> I love this product - have been using it as facial moisturizer too since Elizabeth Arden discontinued their Velva Moisture Film and it&#x27;s working really well.  (And is MUCH cheaper!)</li>
    <li> This product does not provide broad spectrum protection, only UVA.  Only the burning rays will be screened, not UVB. UVB causes brown spots, skin wrinkling and aging. Feel this product does a disservice to consumers. It is widely known that broad spectrum protection is the sunscreen standard and has been for many years. When I spoke with a Eucurin product representative by phone today she stated that they briefly made it  UVA and UVB effective and due to complaints re product consistently they returned to UVA protective only.</li>
    <li> Although the picture is of the product I thought I was buying (and would have kept), I was sent (and returned) the &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; version which has an avobenzone base, rather than all natural zinc/titanium.  I refuse to use avobenzone, as it stains everything as it goes through laundry.</li>
    <li> Good heavy coverage on a dry skin especially with Diabetic.&lt;br /&gt;Apply after shower or wash while skin is moist to lighten the cream.&lt;br /&gt;The SPF with indirect sun light surely protected me for years.&lt;br /&gt;Shared this product to 3-4 decades friends.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I got an itchy, red rash from this lotion that spread all over the areas I used it. I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t know what is going on. Likes this product otherwise, but the rash is a no go!</li>
    <li> Great value for the money.  It just goes on a bit sticky for me.  I&#x27;ve always used Lubriderm and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I like it but I feel like I need to shower it off at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for the moisturizing with SPF but after a couple days of use I developed a horrible painful rash. It started with intense itching on thighs and upper arms on day 1. I did not suspect it was the lotion and used it again on day 2 because I was going to be put in the sun all day and had no other sun protection. More intense itching and by day 3 I had broken out in a painful red rash all over my legs and arms where I had applied the lotion. I have never had skin sensitivities before to any products.</li>
    <li> Like the creaminess of the product-- light- not sticky</li>
    <li> Living in the desert, I searched for a body lotion that I could use on a daily basis, all over.  This is IT!!  No more 2oz or 1.5 oz&lt;br /&gt;which were not designed? to use all over the body and cost a small fortune.. This is great.  During times which I do not need sunscreen, I use the regular Eucerin lotion.  Great product for this climate!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome daily lotion. It is thick and moisterizing, but not super heavy. I love that it has SPF15 in it to help me remember to protect my skin each day!</li>
    <li> HATE THIS PRODUCT!  Im 36 year old male, never have had an allergic reaction to a single thing in my life.  Red blisters all over the back of my neck, hands and arms!  Took 2 weeks to clear up and left marks that dont seem to go away!  Also caused me to break out on my chest and back.  First time reviewing a product due to how horrible it is.  Greasy, nasty...overall I had to give it one star because you can&#x27;t give zero stars or negative stars!!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a daily lotion with SPF so I tried this lotion a few months ago.  Within two weeks I had started to get a rash on my arms and couldn&#x27;t figure out what it could be from.  I thought for sure, it couldn&#x27;t be this lotion because it&#x27;s made by Eucerin!  Finally went to the doctor and they suggested to stop using this lotion as it could be the culprit.  So I did and the rash went away.  I tried it recently to give it another shot and the same thing happened again.  The rash appeared like a regular sunburn but it wouldn&#x27;t cover my entire arm and was sometimes up near by shoulders or armpit in an area that was never exposed to sun.  It was bright red, warm to the touch and itchy.  It also seems to make the skin on my arm more sensitive and easier to get scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had this reaction to any product EVER.  I&#x27;m switching back to Alba&#x27;s daily lotion with SPF.  More expensive but worth it!</li>
    <li> I used this moisturizer on my arms and legs for 4 days and then broke into an ugly, red, painful rash which spread, worsened and blistered over the next few days. I have never had a reaction to a moisturizer before.  My doctor has prescribed a medication to combat the problem. I&#x27;ll never use this product or company again.</li>
    <li> Like some other reviewers, I got an red rash from this lotion that spread on my hands and to a lesser extent my neck.  I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other skin lotion.  I stopped using it and the rash went away.  I wonder what ingredient causes this?</li>
    <li> makes my skin peel, not like regular Eucerin lotions</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer Love the SPF for the summertime.</li>
    <li> Lotion provides good coverage along with sun protection (SPF15) but seems to leave a somewhat &#x27;greasy&#x27; layer rather than blending into the skin.  I have other lotions that do a great job of moisturizing without any residual layer of &#x27;lotion&#x27;.  Possibly this is the SPF component, I don&#x27;t know.  Overall,  I like the lotion for the moisturizer and sun protection.  One star deduct for the lasting feel.</li>
    <li> I cannot use traditional sunscreens due my sensitive skin and PMLE. I started using this after a bit of investigating and it truly works. I&#x27;ve been using it both as a daily sunscreen and when at the beach and have not had any breakouts. It really is the best sunscreen/moisturizer that I have found for my skin.</li>
    <li> I also broke out in an itchy red rash from using this lotion although it took a couple months of using it for the rash to develop - I don&#x27;t know why. I also used it on my two young daughters who have sensitive skin &amp; frequent bouts of eczema and they reacted within the first couple of days of using. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a new moisturizing lotion with sunscreen and decide to try Eucerin. I started to get a rash on my lower legs, and within a month, the rash started to burn, sting and spread. As this had never happenned to me before, I went to urgent care. The doctor put me on steroids and claritan, saying I had an allergic reation to something. I finally figured out what was causing it, the Eucerin lotion! I guess I&#x27;ll have to go back to Lubriderm lotion.</li>
    <li> Good dailyl lotion but I prefer something heavier, richer for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> As others noted, this lotion gave me an itchy red rash.  I&#x27;ve never had that problem with any other lotion!</li>
    <li> Finally an affordable daily moisturizer with sunscreen! I love the feel of this lotion, and the lack of fragrance. The sunscreen really works; I&#x27;ll go out on a sunny day without additional protection and come home with no burns. I expect I&#x27;ll be buying this for a long time to come...</li>
    <li> A little bit greasy, but it does what I need it to do (moisturize my very dry skin, and protect it from UV).</li>
    <li> My favorite daily moisturizer with SPF.  Glides on smooth and easy, no scent, but great sun protection.</li>
    <li> cheaper to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. It has improved my skin softness.</li>
