      <li>Well it&#x27;s really amazing when I wear it</li>
      <li>NICE NOT TOO SWEET SMELLING PERFUME, KIND OF GRASSY AND CITRUS.</li>

      <li>So glad that I did.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased beyond words.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love Amazon, but will never again buy perfume/cosmetics online.</li>
      <li>I love the scent; however, the staying power of this fragrance is about two hours.</li>
      <li>With me it&#x27;s an al-emcompassing overwhelming</li>
      <li>I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>I truly think this is a worthwhile addition to the rotation of your 2 or 3 fragrance choices.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very good fragrance recommend it, excellent seller fast shipping would return as expected to recommend buying from this seller, thanks</li>
      <li>Thank amazon so so much that I could own such a lovely and wonderful scent with a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>light hours.</li>
      <li>I struggle with detecting the detailed notes that are referenced by savvy perfume reviewers.</li>
      <li>sweet scent stays all day</li>
      <li>This eau de toilette has a unique and fresh scent, not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I do enjoy the purity of their fragrances verses the chemical construct so popular these days; take the current abomination of Chanel No.5.</li>
      <li>My new favorite perfume - it smells</li>
      <li>feels like wandering through the forests after the rain and the fresh  air with  a grass-flower scent haunting around you .</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m kind&#x27;a wasting it or differently put -</li>
      <li>something very intriguing, very borderline over-ripe fruit.  </li>
      <li>get so much compliments from people!</li>
      <li>Pretty package as well.  </li>
      <li>Light, springtime feeling, not a heavy or perfume-y smell and</li>
      <li>I embalm myself daily to make the killing of time more enduring.  </li>
      <li>Something is either intriguing, powerful, captivating and wearable, or the first adjectives but too demanding (like the Amouage Memoir - which is a first love, but super pricey and a poor fit to my humble meanderings.</li>
      <li>It just disappears in an hour, unlike real Hermes perfumes.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to have found on Amazon this fragrance in a smaller bottle and at a lesser charge than Sephora.  </li>
      <li>The price here is better than other sites.</li>
      <li>Not a subtle scent.</li>
      <li>I fall in love with its scent since I smelled it few years ago.</li>
      <li>The scent is exactly as the original Hermes Sur Le Toit, but unlike the one I bought in a store the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>Not as expensive as some Hermes fragrances, but VERY nice.</li>
      <li>Those who know, appreciate it; those who have no idea, fuss over any type of scent and claim allergic reactions), have to just live with it while it lingers in the air.  </li>
      <li>Too many corporate offices where I work where people are freaked out about fragrance regardless of whether it&#x27;s good or bad.  </li>
      <li>Finishes soft feminine and floral.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh green grass and ripe apple with warmth.  </li>
      <li>Really often attract attention from other people.</li>
      <li>First it is green, herbaceous, citrusy and reminiscent of tropical fruit.</li>

<li> A very soft hint of roses also, along with the green scent and subtle florals.  </li>

<li> &lt;br /&gt;Recommend to all casual users..</li>
<li> Or bad</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like perfume its too overpowering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only scents I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chanel Camellia&lt;br /&gt;Chanel Beige&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and this by Hermes</li>
    <li> NICE NOT TOO SWEET SMELLING PERFUME, KIND OF GRASSY AND CITRUS.</li>
    <li> This eau de toilette has a unique and fresh scent, not overpowering.  However it does not last, but fades away within a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! Pretty package as well.  I had used the lotion in the past but wanted to try the perfume.  It does hold its scent all day and smells amazing!  Very happy!  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume!</li>
    <li> The scent is exactly as the original Hermes Sur Le Toit, but unlike the one I bought in a store the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. It just disappears in an hour, unlike real Hermes perfumes. Love Amazon, but will never again buy perfume/cosmetics online.</li>
    <li> I fall in love with its scent since I smelled it few years ago. But the price for it in store is not lovely. So when I saw it on sale on Amazon I bought it immediately! Just LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> sweet scent stays all day</li>
    <li> Not as expensive as some Hermes fragrances, but VERY nice. I love it and I&#x27;m not easy to please when it comes to &amp;#34;parfums&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s really amazing when I wear it and I&#x27;m even  deeply moved .It feels like wandering through the forests after the rain and the fresh  air with  a grass-flower scent haunting around you . This EDT brings me back to nature and big forests.Thank amazon so so much that I could own such a lovely and wonderful scent with a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am a blatant Hermes fan. I do enjoy the purity of their fragrances verses the chemical construct so popular these days; take the current abomination of Chanel No.5. I digress.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume is a sophisticated GRASS -range fragrance suited for the day. It will turn heads, the heads will ask questions. I truly think this is a worthwhile addition to the rotation of your 2 or 3 fragrance choices.&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, I think it would make a bigger impact in France than here. They have fragrances there that we never see here. This has that flavor~ a subtle, wafting that would turn heads.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t over-wear this. It&#x27;s not a &#x27;signature fragrance&#x27;. It can provide &#x27;interest&#x27; and &#x27;allure&#x27; if worn with care. A head~turning moment in day~light hours.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife as a present. Really often attract attention from other people.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th bottle I have ordered, absolutely love it !</li>
    <li> Very good fragrance recommend it, excellent seller fast shipping would return as expected to recommend buying from this seller, thanks</li>
    <li> Divine long lasting scent. First it is green, herbaceous, citrusy and reminiscent of tropical fruit. Finishes soft feminine and floral. Not a subtle scent.</li>
    <li> this is a lasting scent ..one that I will want to use from now on</li>
    <li> Oooooo, a beautiful scent.  A very soft hint of roses also, along with the green scent and subtle florals.  I never bought a scent unseen (unsmelled?) before, but decided to take a chance after reading a magazine report about it.  So glad that I did.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift.. It is a casual fragrance , long lasting,  garden type fragrance ..&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to all casual users..Not a nightime use unless you are in the South Pacific or Bermuda</li>
    <li> the packages looks bad, it doesnot look like real hermes products, the plastic wrap outside looks old and ripped.</li>
    <li> This is so amazing. I spry this whenever I need some change of mood.&lt;br /&gt;I get so much compliments from people!</li>
    <li> I think this is a wonderful, and exotic scent. Unlike other reviews, it does last through the day. The glass bottle is a beautiful design.</li>
    <li> I love the scent; however, the staying power of this fragrance is about two hours. I didn&#x27;t look if they had an Eau de Parfum but if they did, that&#x27;s what you should buy.</li>
    <li> My son picked up a \\&quot;sample\\&quot; card of Un Jardin Sur Le Toit and gave it to me.  I thought the fragrance on the card was delightful.  So I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased beyond words.  Light, springtime feeling, not a heavy or perfume-y smell and the scent clings for hours. My new favorite perfume - it smells happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m never certain how the fragrance smells to others when it is on the wearer, several people have commented favorably on it.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to have found on Amazon this fragrance in a smaller bottle and at a lesser charge than Sephora.  I stumbled upon it in a store, trying different scents and it stayed with me.  I struggle with detecting the detailed notes that are referenced by savvy perfume reviewers. With me it&#x27;s an al-emcompassing overwhelming yes or no.  Something is either intriguing, powerful, captivating and wearable, or the first adjectives but too demanding (like the Amouage Memoir - which is a first love, but super pricey and a poor fit to my humble meanderings. It should be worn in lavish places).  Or bad and then I don&#x27;t care about it.  Well - this one is wearable. Those who know, appreciate it; those who have no idea, fuss over any type of scent and claim allergic reactions), have to just live with it while it lingers in the air.  I tend to avoid those types alltogether, if it can be helped.  I don&#x27;t think perfumes are to be recommended - people should buy and wear what resonates with them.  This smells earthy to me, there&#x27;s a smell of potting soil in it.... something very intriguing, very borderline over-ripe fruit.  It evoques temptation and maybe some danger cautionary signal.  Hard to say.  Too many corporate offices where I work where people are freaked out about fragrance regardless of whether it&#x27;s good or bad.  So, I&#x27;m kind&#x27;a wasting it or differently put - I embalm myself daily to make the killing of time more enduring.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s very different from traditional perfume.  It&#x27;s fresh green grass and ripe apple with warmth.  I like that it&#x27;s different and never over powering.  The price here is better than other sites.</li>
