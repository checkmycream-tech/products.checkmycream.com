      <li>Every time I travel I worry about my perfume bottles breaking and taking too much space in my luggage, plus adding weight to it, but these bottles are the perfect solution.</li>

      <li>Great item but looks different than photos</li>
      <li>/&gt;Furthermore, I think the quality of the product is \\&quot;CHEAPLY</li>
      <li>Unsure why the original message was deleted since I did NOT use any fowl language or BASH the seller.</li>
      <li>original message:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>here is the original message again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does not have a way to extract the perfume from the original bottle.</li>

      <li>I have not tested each one for functionality, but the first two are so-far-so-good.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have the easy load as the AMERICAN made products.</li>
      <li>I give them very high marks.</li>
      <li>These are easily filled by spraying your perfume into the atomizer and then just tossing it into your purse for later use.</li>
      <li>I really recommend these bottles so you won&#x27;t have to go around with a glass bottle and break it.</li>
      <li>Just look for the ones that have a little whole at the bottom of the bottle to extract the perfume from the original bottle.</li>
      <li>The little window makes it easy to see when it is time to refill.</li>
      <li>but if I had to purchase again I would definetly find the atomizers that are easy pump fill (that attach directly to the perfume bottle) so as not to waste any product.</li>
      <li>The colour choice is fine because I match them to the big bottles and then put them next to the big bottle when not in use.  </li>
      <li>VERY DISAPPOINTED since this was supposed to be a Birthday Gift to my Best Friend in CA.&lt;br</li>

<li> really do NOT AGREE w/ a 1 STAR RATING...</li>
<li> Really disappointed, since my perfume (and most others) don&#x27;t pour.</li>
<li> If your specific cologne/perfume bottle is compression based &amp; does not open for pouring, this product will NOT work since it must have a valve to pump to cologne/perfume into the travel bottle; thus the \\&quot;ATOMIZER.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m quite frustrated since I have no use for this product</li>
<li> Needless to say, I waited a long time to receive this item &amp; now I&#x27;ve been waiting to get a response from BRANDBUY</li>
<li> least 1 or the review will not go through&#x27; @</li>
<li> least not for</li>
<li> From China and not good quality.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looked great at the beginning, but there&#x27;s no way to fill these unless from a pourable bottle.  The others I&#x27;ve bought have the edge on the bottom that fits over the pump of a perfume bottle, and the perfume pumps in.  Really disappointed, since my perfume (and most others) don&#x27;t pour.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay together</li>
    <li> Great item but looks different than photos</li>
    <li> The travel Atomizers work great --I use them for after shave and they hold enough to last 5 to six days each.&lt;br /&gt;I can also carry them in my carry-on when traveling by plane</li>
    <li> These are easily filled by spraying your perfume into the atomizer and then just tossing it into your purse for later use. The colour choice is fine because I match them to the big bottles and then put them next to the big bottle when not in use.  The little window makes it easy to see when it is time to refill.</li>
    <li> Love the product, it was so convenient.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling. Can put my favorite perfumes in each bottle. Love it!!  I really recommend these bottles so you won&#x27;t have to go around with a glass bottle and break it.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size atomizers for essential oil mixes or sample perfumes, etc. Easy to fill and work perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> I loved these!! They shipped as advertised.</li>
    <li> The product was precisely as advertised and Brandbuy is an outstanding vendor. They were extremely responsive to questions and got these handy spray bottles to me quickly and efficiently.  I give them very high marks.</li>
    <li> On June 10th, 2013, I submitted a comment regarding this specific product sold by BRANDBUY but it was deleted for some unknown reason. Unsure why the original message was deleted since I did NOT use any fowl language or BASH the seller. JUST STATING THE FACTS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller, \\&quot;BRANDBUY,\\&quot; HAS  NOT BEEN COOPERATIVE UP TO THIS POINT. Needless to say, I waited a long time to receive this item &amp; now I&#x27;ve been waiting to get a response from BRANDBUY SO I CAN TO RETURN &amp; be REFUNDED THE FULL PURCHASE PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT. I believe it was mis-represented in the seller profile so here is the original message again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original message:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return Reason: \\&quot;Different from what was ordered\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Comments: This product ONLY allows you to pour your cologne or perfume into the container. If your specific cologne/perfume bottle is compression based &amp; does not open for pouring, this product will NOT work since it must have a valve to pump to cologne/perfume into the travel bottle; thus the \\&quot;ATOMIZER.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m quite frustrated since I have no use for this product &amp; I still have no return resolution yet! VERY DISAPPOINTED since this was supposed to be a Birthday Gift to my Best Friend in CA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I think the quality of the product is \\&quot;CHEAPLY MADE\\&quot; especially since it&#x27;s only REFILLABLE; it does NOT come with the VALVE to pump the cologne/perfume into the travel bottle..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do NOT AGREE w/ a 1 STAR RATING... but in order to leave your comments, you have to rate @ least 1 or the review will not go through&#x27; @ least not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSZP46Q 5ML 6pcs Amazing Travel Perfume Atomizer Refillable Mini Perfume Bottle Spray Blue,Red,Gold,Pink,Silver,Purple]]</li>
    <li> These are as advertised. I have not tested each one for functionality, but the first two are so-far-so-good.</li>
    <li> Every time I travel I worry about my perfume bottles breaking and taking too much space in my luggage, plus adding weight to it, but these bottles are the perfect solution. I am really happy with this purchase and will buy more later on.</li>
    <li> But otherwise great for the price. Shipping was as stated. They colors are as shown. Cute and stylish. Does the job but if I had to purchase again I would definetly find the atomizers that are easy pump fill (that attach directly to the perfume bottle) so as not to waste any product.</li>
    <li> These are excellent for your purse. I am making my own perfume with essential oils and these will fit perfectly in the small purse I carry. Also allows me to give away as gifts. Would order again.</li>
    <li> they are not pump fill from the bottom and leak easily. I would not purchase these again. They are cheap china knockoffs</li>
    <li> NOT ONLY ARE THEY CUTE,  BUT COME IN HANDY. WILL FIT IN ANY PURSE. PULL TOP &amp;  BOTTOM OFF, UNSCREW MISTER,  POUR IN YOUR FAVORITE SCENT, PUT IT BACK TOGETHER. VERY SIMPLE TO USE.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to make perfume! These will make great gifts!</li>
    <li> This is a garbage. It does not have a way to extract the perfume from the original bottle. I emailed the seller and she wanted me to ship the items to china and expecting me to pay the shipping. Do not buy this. Just look for the ones that have a little whole at the bottom of the bottle to extract the perfume from the original bottle.</li>
    <li> Took way to long to get these in.  From China and not good quality.  Don&#x27;t have the easy load as the AMERICAN made products.</li>
