### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I received on time delivery and smells awesome for the price</li>
      <li>AWESOME!!!!  </li>
      <li>Still a very lovely fragrance!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a scent that will be best for Spring &amp; Summer imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a perfume I wore years ago and loved.  </li>
      <li>Loved this years ago did not disappoint even gave a bottle to my sister,she also loved it.</li>
      <li>Y is one gorgeous, glorious scent, just as all the reviews attest.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly easy-to-wear for a mid-1960s fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased I tried this perfume</li>
      <li>It was amazing to smell it again.</li>
      <li>I still receive compliments about how nice I smell when wearing it.</li>
      <li>It is also a kind of perfume that women of class and elegance will appreciate.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps Extravagance &amp; Haute Couture are best for modern tastes?</li>
      <li>I was definitely thrilled, once I opened it.  </li>
      <li>But it reminds my wife of the BEST perfume smell from her childhood, so I obviously bought this for her, not me.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and have been using it for decades.</li>
      <li>They were gladly accepted so I am not out of line to give them all of the stars.</li>
      <li>now, i feel it better than ever.</li>
      <li>Most of my purchases are for gifts, which were suggested to me.</li>
      <li>love the way it smells on me and the scent lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying Y by Yves Saint Laurent.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad that I can still get it on the internet.</li>
      <li>As it happens I have been asking many &#x27;why&amp;#34; questions to myself that day and when I saw &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; perfume, I could not help but think it was meant for me to try this perfume from the famous fashion designer.  </li>
      <li>When you find a scent you enjoy, it&#x27;s nice to be able to replenish your supply.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this eau de toilette.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!!</li>
      <li>Light scent,not  overpowering.</li>
      <li>It has full bodied fragrance and yet it can be worn during daytime.  </li>
      <li>Like &amp;#34;Paris&amp;#34; this perfume will not fade out quickly.  </li>
      <li>Tank you very much!</li>
      <li>Gold top with integrated spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y wears light on me and close to the skin, starting at about the 10 minute mark.</li>
      <li>Love it - not too strong - and costs much less.</li>
      <li>Just be aware.</li>
      <li>This definitely is not the original scent; it is much lighter and does not have that mysterious, sophisticated aspect that the original scent had.</li>
      <li>Guys - if you want to make your middle aged wives happy - buy this for them.  </li>
      <li>I love it, it&#x27;s my toilet water,exceed my excpectations ,packaging,fast delivery,everything.</li>
      <li>Undortunately, the price has increased by 50% since February of this year, when I last purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add that I shopped around and found this gragrance at a more reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>impression is that Y would be a good choice for someone who likes classic, full-bodied greens, yet dislikes heavy fragrances and strong aldehydes.</li>
      <li>However, as a scent that is often considered a reference green chypre, I was expecting a lot more.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume, but contrarily to Opium a few years ago, its sillage is not that strong and in my case Y does not remain on my skin for a long time; skins react differently, that is a fact.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m testing Y in EdT, new sealed box, new stock.</li>
      <li>About an hour out it changes, smelling a lot like the heart &amp; drydown of the new Chanel 19.</li>
      <li>Yet, I think Givenchy Extravagance &amp; Hanae Mori Haute Couture are among the best green scents in the current (non-vintage) mass market -- at least for me, that is.</li>
      <li>, please be aware that the fragrance should come properly packaged in cellophane and sealed with YSL logo.</li>
      <li>Y is softer than Ma Griffe, more wearable than Coriandre, and dries down similar to (new) No 19.</li>
      <li>It is a very feminine flagrance but as most perfumes designed by Jean Amic, it may be perceived as agressive at least in the first few minutes, so do not put too much on you.</li>
      <li>After a few seconds Y will reveal itself, and you will enjoy it.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of when I was a kid, of what I thought old ladies smelled like.</li>
      <li>Im pretty sure this was a fake.</li>

    <li> This is a perfume I wore years ago and loved.  When using it upon receipt, there was an immediate and scary allergic reaction where my lips burned, my tongue was coated and my breathing was shallow.    Over the years the recipe for this fragrance has been changed for the worse.    Be careful if you buy it.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s my toilet water,exceed my excpectations ,packaging,fast delivery,everything.I will not change a thing.  Thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> Y is one gorgeous, glorious scent, just as all the reviews attest. However, as a scent that is often considered a reference green chypre, I was expecting a lot more. Perhaps it&#x27;s been reformulated. I&#x27;m testing Y in EdT, new sealed box, new stock. Gold top with integrated spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y wears light on me and close to the skin, starting at about the 10 minute mark. About an hour out it changes, smelling a lot like the heart &amp; drydown of the new Chanel 19. It&#x27;s a scent that will be best for Spring &amp; Summer imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My impression is that Y would be a good choice for someone who likes classic, full-bodied greens, yet dislikes heavy fragrances and strong aldehydes. Surprisingly easy-to-wear for a mid-1960s fragrance. Y is softer than Ma Griffe, more wearable than Coriandre, and dries down similar to (new) No 19. Yet, I think Givenchy Extravagance &amp; Hanae Mori Haute Couture are among the best green scents in the current (non-vintage) mass market -- at least for me, that is. Perhaps Extravagance &amp; Haute Couture are best for modern tastes? I know I prefer each of those to Y.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite and I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I can&#x27;t find it in any store so I&#x27;m glad that I can still get it on the internet. I still receive compliments about how nice I smell when wearing it.</li>
    <li> i have used Y since i was fiteen (35 years ago). now, i feel it better than ever.Tank you very much!</li>
    <li> Im pretty sure this was a fake.</li>
    <li> Still a very lovely fragrance!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. I dont like it.  It reminds me of when I was a kid, of what I thought old ladies smelled like. But it reminds my wife of the BEST perfume smell from her childhood, so I obviously bought this for her, not me. Guys - if you want to make your middle aged wives happy - buy this for them.  Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted 1 star because I can&#x27;t pronounce it...</li>
    <li> Can no longer  find this perfume in the stores. Had to order it from England. Now I can order it through Amazon. Love it - not too strong - and costs much less.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;Paris&amp;#34; by YSL for a long time.  One day, I came across this perfume in the store.  As it happens I have been asking many &#x27;why&amp;#34; questions to myself that day and when I saw &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; perfume, I could not help but think it was meant for me to try this perfume from the famous fashion designer.  I was definitely thrilled, once I opened it.  It has full bodied fragrance and yet it can be worn during daytime.  It also can work for all seasons.  Like &amp;#34;Paris&amp;#34; this perfume will not fade out quickly.  It will stay on for a long time before you need to reapply it.  It is also a kind of perfume that women of class and elegance will appreciate.  It may be too heavy for young girls and I would not recommend this perfume for women under 30.  I am very pleased I tried this perfume and I can say it is definitely on my list of favorites.</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews... But I just had 2 comment on this fragrance....1 word....AWESOME!!!!  I received on time delivery and smells awesome for the price</li>
    <li> This definitely is not the original scent; it is much lighter and does not have that mysterious, sophisticated aspect that the original scent had. The other reviewers are correct when they say the formula has changed.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying Y by Yves Saint Laurent. A friend told me about it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells on me and the scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Most of my purchases are for gifts, which were suggested to me. They were gladly accepted so I am not out of line to give them all of the stars.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and have been using it for decades. Both men and women stop and ask me what fragrance I am wearing! Undortunately, the price has increased by 50% since February of this year, when I last purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add that I shopped around and found this gragrance at a more reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Also, please be aware that the fragrance should come properly packaged in cellophane and sealed with YSL logo. I had a bad experience with another vendor. Just be aware.</li>
    <li> Had just finished my previous bottle, and thought I would have trouble finding it again, but Amazon came through, as usual. When you find a scent you enjoy, it&#x27;s nice to be able to replenish your supply.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eau de toilette. i&#x27;ve been using it since 1970! It&#x27;s more difficult to find it in the stores today-but can always find one online v</li>
    <li> Loved this years ago did not disappoint even gave a bottle to my sister,she also loved it. Light scent,not  overpowering.</li>
    <li> For years I have been addicted to Opium until one profitable group changed the original version...and I have decided to go back into time when I was younger, when I would put on Y. It was amazing to smell it again. It was a trip back into time, people, atmospheres, youth...emotions. I love this perfume, but contrarily to Opium a few years ago, its sillage is not that strong and in my case Y does not remain on my skin for a long time; skins react differently, that is a fact. Gardenia, Jacynth and vetiver are among its notes. It is a very feminine flagrance but as most perfumes designed by Jean Amic, it may be perceived as agressive at least in the first few minutes, so do not put too much on you. After a few seconds Y will reveal itself, and you will enjoy it.</li>
