    <li> Bought it to use with my young living essential oil addiction!! Love the texture and that it comes with a pump! Would definitely buy it again!</li>

    <li> Awesome product! Like and trust this company. Use it to mix with essential oil products!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the product to use as a carrier oil for my essential oil mixes and have been pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> This almond oil is amazing and comes with a pump! I used it on my face, it absorbed quickly and left my skin glowing. The bottle is big and for the price you get a good deal by buying this product. I was given a coupon code to buy this and I would pay full price over and over. It is my new favorite oil :)</li>
    <li> This is my new fav oil for my  essential oils. Feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> Came with multiple tops which was very nice.  Absorbs quickly. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the first almond oil I have tried as a carrier oil for my essential oils. A little goes a long way.  Seemed to work great.  I will continue using it</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected - great product!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Perfect for skin and hair. Not too oily. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  It feels great on my face, and works great to dilute my essential oils.  I  use it in a coconut oil blend as a base for body butters and creams.  I highly recommend this oil.  And getting a pump along with it is like a special bonus!</li>
    <li> I have made several products with using Sweet Almond Oil as my carrier oil. It smells great and so far I love it.</li>
    <li> Good quality product at an excellent price.  I use it as a carrier oil for essential oils and it works great.  Also love that you get both a pump and a flip top cap.</li>
    <li> Great value for this bottle of Almond oil with pump. It is a must have for any beauty regimen or essential oil user</li>
    <li> I love the pump, squeeze cap and the oil.</li>
    <li> Great oil, perfect for mixing w/ essential oils.</li>
    <li> I normally use coconut oil as my moisturizer, but I will be replacing it with this for sure! It soaks in quick, and does not leave an oily feel afterwards. Absolutely LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is lovely oil! I use for massage and perfume blends!</li>
    <li> nice formulation, smooth scent</li>
    <li> Very good product to make rollers with my essential oils. The bottle was actually bigger than I anticipated so for the money it is a very good value.</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it to dilute my essential oils and it works great! Nice smell and it my skin thanks me by looking beautiful!</li>
    <li> Awesome deal! Great product with a nice pump!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of essential oils, and this sweet almond oil is great as a carrier for those oils. Great quality oil, good customer service and very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The pump included makes this oil super convenient to use. No more trying to close a bottle with oily hands!</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  The oil is easily absorbed into the skin with out leaving an oily film.  I like that it is cold pressed.  I use this directly on my skin, I use this for a carrier oil for my oil burner, and also as a base for other aromatherapy products.  I like that it is packaged with a pump and a flip top cap along with the regular cap that comes on the bottle.  It carries lot numbers and an expiration date along with the mfg date.  I will absolutely purchase this again.  Shipping was very quick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a carrier oil with my essential oils and it works great.  I love that it comes with a pump!  So much easier than pouring it out!  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great size! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast! Perfect oil to use in many DIY. I use in DIY hair moisturizer, essential oil blends, and body butters. Love that it came with a pump, as when cold winter weather comes my way I plan on using it straight out the shower for added moisture for my dry winter skin. I also have plans to use this in a hand scrub. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great products!  This is perfect for use with essential oils.</li>
    <li> The oil has a good smell and texture to the oil.  It was smooth to use as well.  I would buy this again to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oils.It is a great carrier oil for my E.O&#x27;s.I would highly recommend everyone to try this oil.You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Great oil that is well priced and of high quality.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  It came with a nice pour spout with a cap and also a pump!  I used it and it soaked right into my skin and wasn&#x27;t oily!  I can&#x27;t wait to use with my essential oils and the products that I make!</li>
    <li> Almond Oil absorbs a little faster than coconut oil, and has been an excellent essential oil carrier. I love the options to use the pump or pop lid. The oil has a nice, neutral smell.</li>
    <li> Loved the smooth and easy quality of the pump, made it so very easy to fill my essential oil rollerballs myself. No mess! As far as the oil itself, I loved it! It wasn&#x27;t too strongly &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; if that makes sense. Very natural and perfect. I would compare it to a very high quality olive oil, but much more suitable to use on your skin. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this sweet almond oil. I am forever a fan!! I use it as a moisturizer for my face mixed with some essential oils in the evening. After a shower I use it as a full body lotion that lasts all day. I also use it as a moisturizer on my kids. They love how it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; and it makes their skin so smooth and not sticky. I have also used it as a massage oil for aches and pains. I also really like that it comes with different tops, a pump style and a squeeze top. Makes the bottle very versatile. Product packaging was great too. Came in its own separate plastic bag so if it leaked it wouldn&#x27;t get all over the place.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil and will buy from you again!</li>
    <li> As a new essential oil user this carrier oil was perfect. It was not greasy, it was absorbed by my skin fine and is so nice that I use it on my children. The package was safe, it comes with 3 cap options so the consumer can pick freely. I personally like the pump, it is quick simple and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product. Looking forward to try more products from this company.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  It is great to use on my face and with my essential oils.  The pump makes it very handy.</li>
    <li> I truly love this oil. I&#x27;m new to essential oils and the many carrier oils available. I have coconut and immerse and really wanted to try almond for all it&#x27;s bragging rights in the health in DIY mixing market. I was not disappointed. Very smooth. And it was a huge bottle for the price. Although I knew what I was purchasing, I was still pleasantly surprised. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I like almond oil for my face. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> I really like this almond oil. I use oils for just about everything (skin moisturizers, ingredient in foods, ingredient in home made body products). This oil is a great base oil. It has a slightly sweet smell, but not overpowering. I was able to add an essential oil blend without the smell overpowering my EOs. This oil absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I advise rubbing it on while skin is still damp to better help with absorption. I am grateful to have found this oil and will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I like this almond oil.  It’s very light weight compared and absorbs quicker than another brand we are currently using.  I especially enjoy the pump that comes with it; makes a no spill fill of roller ball bottles very easy.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  Works great as a make-up remover and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used this as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  I loved how quickly it absorbed into my skin.  I also like that it came with a pump for easy dispensing.  I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Love this almond oil. I use a lot of oils for my body and face and this is becoming a favorite!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this oil.  It is basically odorless and quick absorbing.  I am using it as a base for my essential oils, but am looking forward to trying it as a make-up remover and for my hair as suggested.  Because it&#x27;s fast absorbing and non-greasy, it works great on my face.  The bottle is a 16oz container which means 2 full cups of oil which is a great value for your money and will last a long time as you don&#x27;t need to use much oil at a time.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for all my roller ball bottle recipes!!</li>
    <li> Received the sweet almond oil in a very timely manner, when promised.  It is a very nice oil, hydrating and wonderful on the skin.  You have the choice of a pump lid or one that opens up as well as the lid that comes on it; I like that a lot.  It is well worth the value.</li>
    <li> This is great almond oil. I use it as a carrier oil with my Young Living Essential Oils and for making up my own lotions and creams. I also love the pump dispenser it makes it so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Nice product-good value</li>
    <li> The almond oil arrived promptly and packaged well as to prevent damage and leaks.  I love that it comes with a pump for convenience.  I have used the oil to make a face moisturizer and I am pleased with the quality for what I paid.  I especially appreciate the manufacture and expiration date labelled on the bottle, which I have noticed some other vendors do not do.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this sweet almond oil! It smells wonderful. I think it is so great that it comes with a pump! It makes it easy to use with my Pure Acres Farm Roller Bottles and my Young Living Essential Oils! It&#x27;s a great carrier oil and makes my life 100% easier because I can use the Sweet Almond Oil and Roller Bottle to make different blends!</li>
    <li> This almond oil has a nice light aroma and feel and absorbs easily into skin.  I use a variety of oils in my home made body/beauty products and I would certainly purchase this one again.  My daughter is a massage therapist and likes it for her clients also.</li>
    <li> As with most Pure Acres Farm products this worked so well with my essential oils. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the options I a squirt top or a flip cap!! I&#x27;m going to have a lot of fun making roller bottles with this!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! My first time using Almond Oil. I love how smooth is feels when I rub it on my dry skin. It feels clean and not sticky or that gross greasy feeling. I definitely recommend this! Thank you Pure Acres Farm!</li>
    <li> I use Pure Almond oil on my face every day.  Sounds strange, but I have oily flaky skin and almond oil keeps it from looking too shiny and flaky.  This bottle came with a screw top, pump top and pour top.  I like the pour top the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil mixes well with EOs.</li>
    <li> Used this as a carrier oil for my essential oils to make roller bottles.  Light fragrance and love the price for the volume!</li>
    <li> Very light and soaks into skin easily .  Smell is fresh and almost non-existent so it blends well with essential oils:).</li>
    <li> Love this product! Was very impressed with shipping packaging! No leaks or oily mess! Perfect carrier for my essential oil blends!</li>
    <li> The oil is wonderful!! It arrived promptly and is high quality. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great to mix with essential oils</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous!  Arrived quickly and works great!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. Works very well on my skin and also a great hair conditioner. Seller is quick,fast and professional.</li>
    <li> I do love this oil for many things. It&#x27;s great as is for skin but I add some carrot seed essential oil for the added benefit of wrinkle reduction and control. It&#x27;s a great carrier oil for any essential oil you like. It&#x27;s fun to mix and match to personalize a scent that is perfect for you. I use roller bottles with carrier oil and essential oil to create a few different scents to keep in my purse.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love that it came with a pump for the bottle.  I made several roll-on bottles mixed with Young Living essential oils and have not had any issues.  The Oil goes on smooth!</li>
    <li> We like this almond oil. W</li>
    <li> It seems to be a good quality product.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent carrier oil for essential oils. I use this instead of lotion.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for a great product.  I use essential oils daily, and this gives me a great carrier oil to use with them.</li>
    <li> I use this oil as a carrier oil to use with my essential oils. Good quality oil at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Worth every penny. Bought 2.</li>
    <li> Excellent carrier oil for essential oils.  Very light on skin with non greasy feeling.  The extremely light almond oil scent allows aroma of essential oils allows them to be the aromatherapy you smell.</li>
    <li> Oh how I love almond oil! As a licensed massage therapist I use this a lot as my carrier oil for bodywork.  I appreciate that this bottle comes with a pump so I can just change from the cap to the pump and go right to work!  I also use this product (or fractionated coconut oil) when making my essential oil roller bottles.  I use this brand of almond oil often just on my skin after my bath or after shaving for moisture.  Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> Received the almond oil and will be using for sure. More like baby oil without a scent. Works great as a skin softener in the shower.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she really loves it.</li>
    <li> So nice for all of my DIY projects!  Shipped incredibly fast too!</li>
    <li> Good stuff not greasy</li>
    <li> Great product, I love it!</li>
    <li> Great consistency &amp; great product for essential oil DIY remedies!</li>
    <li> This is pretty great! My skin is sensitive to lots of stuff and I put this on my face and it is perfect. No breakouts. Not greasy. LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Loved the oil and found it to be a great compliment to my essential oils. I also used it on my skin after it was itching due to soap and found it to be soothing.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely oil.  I use sweet almond in many, many things--soaps, salves, solid perfumes and just by itself for beautiful hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Like that this came with a pour spout AND a pump so depending on how it could be used it has both options.  Liking this as a carrier for use with essential oils...Esp as a massage oil.  It helps me spread the essential oils without it rubbing in too quickly before I&#x27;ve had a chance to spread it over a large area of the body. Would give this 5 stars if certified organic or GMO free.</li>
    <li> Great oil to use as a carrier oil for my Young Living essential oil business! Will recommend it to my customers!</li>
    <li> Great product! I really love the pump. It is so much easier to use than just a squeeze top. High quality oil not greasy. It soaks right into my skin.</li>
    <li> I love my pure farm oils!</li>
    <li> I love it. Wonderful, silky oil soaks into your skin and leaves it incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> Great package&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy using it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I would if I actually got to use it. It arrived over the weekend. I left the unopened package on my side table for two hours while I ran an errand and my granddogs decided they would take it to the backyard and destroy it. It sure looked like a great value. I&#x27;ll probably be ordering more because I really do want to try it. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of essential oils so I need good vegetable oils to act as carrier. This one is really good and gentle. It comes with a pump for easy dispersion too.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Beautifully packaged and came with a cap, flip top and pump. I can decide the best way to dispense.  It is light and absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
    <li> Great as a carrier for essential oils. The pump makes it even more convenient.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to give this a try!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a carrier oil with my Young Living essential oils. Works great for that! I had been using the same company&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil as a carrier oil for a few months now which I love, and this almond oil is just as great!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Wife has been using it with essential oils for massages. Non sticky and left skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> Great product. Id buy again!</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my skin feel, and softens the eye area.  What a great deal.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product.  The pump is a really nice added feature. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This sweet almond oil is a fabulous carrier oil for my essential oil recipes.  It is very light, unscented, non-greasy and absorbs quickly without leaving any residue to stain clothing or fabric.  I love that it does not clog my pores and it is 100% pure!</li>
    <li> I received my Almond Oil on Thursday and began using it immediately.  I have used it on my hands and cuticles, on my face especially around my eyes and as a carrier oil for essential oils that I use as part of my daily regimen.  I love the lightness of the oil.  The only problem I have had is getting the pump to open so I just use the other lid that came with the oil.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  New favorite!!</li>
    <li> Great oil, light scent. Perfect carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Works great with my essential oils! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this almond oil!</li>
    <li> I just received my almond oil earlier this week. I love the smooth feel and especially love the pump! I made some foaming soap using this almond oil and it worked great and left my face feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> Great and love it comes with a pump</li>
    <li> Very nice  quick delivery</li>
    <li> I love my Sweet Almond Oil!  I use after my shower.  It absorbs really good!  Also, I use it to blend my essential oils and I use it with my oil applications!  Thank you for such a good product!</li>

    <li> I have been using this oil now for almost 2 weeks. It&#x27;s not greasy, it absorbs quickly and it leaves my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> i ordered the almond oil from pure acres farm and it came with a pump and a squeeze top and a solid top. :)  i have been using it for dilluting my esscential oils and making receipes and it is working great.  would buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved that it can with flip top and pump.  I have very sensitive skin and use this after shower.  Left skin smooth, soft, and no irritations. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already used almost the whole bottle to make salve, anti scar cream and various other things. Very light, dries quickly and odor free. Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It is not heavily scented and it&#x27;s very silky!</li>
    <li> Great product. Made body butter with it and it turned out awesome</li>
    <li> A great alternative to FCO.</li>
    <li> rich feeling and nice to have the pump</li>
    <li> Love the oil.  Makes my skin feel so nice.</li>
    <li> I love the sweet almond oil.  I use it with my essential oils and love the way it feels!</li>
    <li> This almond oil is so lovely.  It helps with my skin, hair, and is a great conductor for other oils as well. If you want beautiful skin, shiny hair without a greasy feeling; this will give you that.  I dropped lavender oil in it and put on the bottom of my feet, across my chest, under my nose, and on my wrists before going to sleep.  I was asleep within 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels when i apply it.  My skin stays so soft.  Glad I have it.</li>
    <li> I am loving this sweet almond oil. This is my go to oil for most of my blends. I love that the bottle came with a pump. It makes for less spill mess which equals less clean up!</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I am careful to watch for additives. You don&#x27;t list any others but you recommend it for the skin and external only. Our skin ingests everything and is in the bloodstream in a matter of seconds. I do hope there aren&#x27;t any chemicals... Thank you for the discounted bottle to try!</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  It completely absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling gummy or slippery.  I am just using it as a oil without mixing it with anything and it is Fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I used this product to make a sugar scrub for my feet using es&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this almond oil to make a sugar scrub for my feet using essential oils and it worked great! There is very little, if any smell. I applied a few drops mixed with essential oils to my hair. It wasn&#x27;t too heavy and didn&#x27;t make my hair super oily. I plan on making a massage oil also using essential oils for pain. I will continue to try this oil out in all my recipes for homemade items. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying his oil.  And I love that the bottle comes with a pump dispenser!</li>
    <li> I have used it with the essential oil, Frankencense, for my feet which tingle and burn all the time. I put it on my feet after my shower. I really like the smell of the sweet almond.</li>
    <li> Great product, love that is comes with the pump.</li>
    <li> Love my Sweet Almond Oil! It reminds me  of peaceful times.</li>
    <li> Fantastic almond oil!  I use it in the shower for shaving as well as at the end to keep my skin soft. I also use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Have used many times to mix with my essential oils and it works fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Very, very light smell.  But it&#x27;s barely noticeable, which I prefer.  Fantastic price and I also like that it comes with a flip top lid or a pump depending on your preference for dispensing. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> As a distributor for young living essential oils I use different carrier oils daily for essential oils I use for my family and for products I make others. The almond oil is a wonderful carrier oil with no scent to intefere with the essential oils aroma. I have made oil blends for 5 people now using the almond oil and everyone has commented on how it absorbs nicely into their skin without a greasy feeling. Another bonus is that a pump came with it making it super easy to use with no mess.</li>
    <li> Love the feel on my skin! Perfect addition to my essential oils to use as a carrier oil!! Great product.</li>
    <li> very pleased, loved that it arrived with a pump and flip top cap, absorbed nicely, pleasant smell, can&#x27;t wait to use it in some home care products</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing!  The oil takes a little while to be absorbed in before it is safe to get dressed, or into bed.</li>
    <li> Love that it came with a pump. It is so much easier to work with and not as messy. The sweet almind oil it self was good.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Definitely not oily feeling, but it does moisturize.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and just perfect for making my oil blends.</li>
    <li> I love the oil and the bottle is a nice size. I mix with various essential oils.</li>
    <li> Quality oil.  Feels nice on my skin and good base for essential oils.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! It comes with a pump which is super helpful! I&#x27;ve been using it in combination with vitamin E gel capsules, which I puncture to get the liquid out, on scars from a surgery I had in May 2015. It has really helped to improve the feel &amp; look of my scars! I also love how quickly it absorbs, but still leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; moisturized! I have used this on my hair as well &amp; again, it&#x27;s been great! It&#x27;s light enough to use even on humid days. I actually ordered 2 bottles &amp; will definitely be ordering more once I&#x27;m down to one bottle! I will also be recommending it to family &amp; friends! This is honestly the best Sweet Almond Oil I&#x27;ve EVER used!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this sweet almond oil.  I use in my essential oil rollers.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this for use as a carrier oil in my essential oil roller bottles and recipes!  It also comes with two lid options! Flip top and pump!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product. It has no smell, and a little goes a long way. It is much heavier and &#x27;oilier&#x27; than the coconut oil from the same company. I think this almond oil would be good to mix with ginger essential oil for use as a warming oil to massage and moisturize with in the cooler fall and winter months.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I use apply it daily as it is mixed in my body wash and young living essential oils! I just Love how it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> OMG I love this. I blend my oils and this is one of my favorites to blend with. thank you</li>
    <li> Very pleased! Using it as a carrier oil with EO. Thank you! Chiqui</li>
    <li> Very nice grade of Almond Oil!! Great for moisturizing! Makes your skin feel very soft and not greasy like some of the other oils out there.Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This almond Oil has so many uses.  I use it as a carrier for Essential Oil, and on my  Hair to moisturize.  I will continue to buy it again, I have already recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love that it came with a pump, pour top and regular.</li>
    <li> Was surprised when I received this. Didn&#x27;t realize it was a big bottle of oil and it came with a pump nozzle as well as a flip lid nozzle. That&#x27;s awesome. Great company to do business with!</li>
    <li> I put this oil on my face and lips right before bed.  It did feel greasy, I was a little unsure of it at first.  It took a while but it eventually absorbed into my skin.  The smell was light and pleasant.  I love that it comes with a pump.  When I work up this morning my skin felt very soft and smooth.  My lips felt great as well.  I really liked the softness and moisture it added to my dry lips.  I will continue to use this oil and mix it with some of my essential oils for skin care products.  I will post an update after I use the product for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I really like the sweet almond as a carrier oil. It is light weight and glides nicely on the skin. It worked great as a massage oil also. I have also used in roller bottles with a smooth roll. There is no scent to this oil, so the smell of the essential oils is not covered up. I have used this oil several times on my neck, chest, and shoulders and have not had any breakouts which typically happens with different oils. I would definitely buy this oil again.</li>
    <li> Using it with my essential oils! Great carrier oil.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!!! It was arapped so well and smells glorious. Love the feel of it also and it has so many uses. Will be purchasing again and again !</li>
    <li> Very nice product and even better price and quality!</li>
    <li> I received this quickly and packages well. I&#x27;m using it with my EOs and it&#x27;s a prefect, light, scent free option.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a squirt and pump top!</li>
    <li> Works great for my skin and in my roller bottles mixed with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Excellent almond oil! I highly recommend buying Pure Acres products!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing carrier oil to use with essential oils. The value for the amount that you get is great. Pure Acres Farms is a great company work with. Great products and very fast shipping speed.</li>
    <li> Love the deal on Almond Oil - works great in conjunction with essential oils when you need to dilute the strength.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good quality product. Using it to relieve achilles tendonititis.</li>
    <li> Great oil for a great value. The pump make it easy to apply and dispense. I use this oil for my homemade bath products as well as a carrier oil for my other homemade essential oil gifts. Great quality, highly recommend.</li>

    <li> Great oil...I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  Smooth and pure!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I have just started using it and it&#x27;s wonderful! I can&#x27;t wait to start trying some essential oil recipes! Thank you Pure Acres Farm!</li>
    <li> Nice oil no almond scent can easily be mixed with other oils</li>
    <li> Love that it comes with pump and a second cap option. Lovely smell.</li>
    <li> So silky!  Leaves my skin soft and isn&#x27;t greasy.  The pump is genius!</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil. I&#x27;ve been using this on my Skin and it is leaving it super soft. Not greasy at all. It comes with multiple lid options, so you can choose what&#x27;s best for you.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use as a base or &#x27;carrier oil&#x27; for essential oils. My only complaint isn&#x27;t really a complaint- I had hoped it would smell like almond but it&#x27;s basically odorless. Which is actually great for essential oils but I love almond smells ;)</li>
    <li> Awesome carrier oil! Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful wonderful oil!  Smells terrific, feels terrific.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! My skin has never felt so soft. I don&#x27;t have that greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different oils and creams for my massage business and this is by far my favorite. I do prefer to mix it with a little cream for deep tissue massage so I can get a better grip on the fascia, but overall this oil smells good and is a fantastic product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s very user friendly. My family has very sensitive skin so we tend to only use natural oils to moisturize. This product has nothing harmful in it. Just pure sweet almond oil. It came with a pump (as shown), a cap and also the little snap open cap. My five year old loves the pump because it really easy for him to use. It&#x27;s not super greasy (it absorbs into the skin really quickly). Will definitely continue to purchase this product from Pure Acres Farm.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for use with my essential oils. I love the pump!</li>
    <li> This product works perfect for my combination skin.  I used it right after my shower and didn&#x27;t have 1 dry or shine spot all day.  I also like it because it does not leave your skin feeling or looking greasy.  You can also keep your regular regimen because the oil is light and almost scent free.  Yes it is 100% natural so I am using it on my daughter also.</li>
    <li> This brand of sweet almond oil has a great light consistency and a sweet smell. It moisturizers your skin well and I also use it for a carrier oil for essential oil rollers. I liked that this brand included a convenient pump as well as a regular pour top and they shipped my order promptly.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome oil.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> With my minimalistic use of it so far, I like it for moisturization. Goes well with my essential oils. The easy to pur handle was very hard to open though. I thought it was bad, May be use slightly better quality or provide instructions to really push hard.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, light oil that is perfect for skin.  I put some in a small roller bottle and use it instead of chap stick when my lips are a little dry.  The roller bottle is also a convenient way to apply while I&#x27;m away from home and need a little extra moisturizing on my hands and such.  I also love that it comes with the pump which makes using it much easier and less messy!</li>
    <li> I love that it came with a pump and a flip top! Feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and will ordering again for sure!</li>

    <li> Love using this with essential oils!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice oil that is easily absorbed into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling slick. When I opened the bottle, I noticed a faint fragrance, but I did not note the fragrance in the oil itself. I was very pleased that it came with two types of dispensers, including a pump.</li>
    <li> Sweet almond oil is one of my favorite carrier oils. Great quality! I&#x27;m glad I found another brand to trust.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils. Love it!</li>

    <li> I received a bottle of this almond oil this week, and it has been a godsend. I spent the last six days at the pool with a friend visiting from out of town. This has left me with very parched skin on my body and a face that has begun peeling. I have been using the sweet almond oil daily and it has made a big difference in my skin. It is very emollient and my skin just drinks it up. It has helped the dry, cracking and peeling skin on my nose and above my lips. It has taken must of the associated pain away. It has even helped with the itching from several mosquito bites. In a pinch, I even used it as wood cleaner when I ran out of my own homemade wood polish. I&#x27;ve even used it in my hair! I intend to use it a a carrier oil in several facial and body preparations for my skin and face.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it. Great value!</li>
    <li> This oil feels so nice on my skin and nice in my hair.  Not greasy, no oder and absorbs nicely. It states it is cold pressed.</li>
    <li> I have used other carrier oils but am so pleased with this brand. I use it with my essential oils.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect as a carrier oil for all of my blends!</li>
    <li> I received my sweet almond oil the other day and have added it to my roller. I love the scent and the way the oil feels on my skin is great!  I will definitely buy this oil again.</li>
    <li> The oil has been working nicely on a few patches of skin. It&#x27;s a mildly scented and soothing. I am encouraged by the progress thus far and intend to continue using.</li>
    <li> Very happy with speed of delivery. The bottle was clean and pump works great. I love this oil. It was my first time using it and I love the smell and color. I started using with essential oils and it seems to be a great carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Love that it came with a pump thank you -</li>

    <li> I use a lot of almond oil to make homemade health and beauty products for my family.  The first thing I love about this product is it comes with a pump.  The pump is very handy, especially when utilizing smaller amounts of oil.  The product is very comparable to other almond oils I have used but at a better price.  The scent is light and not overpowering which is another reason I love it.  I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This oil was fantastic to mix with my lemon essential oil. I LOVE that it came with a pump! Great for mixing into small bottles for blends.</li>

    <li> Pleasant very light fragrance, absorbs quickly and leaves skin smooth and feeling soft.  I have been using coconut oil on my face, arms, legs an feet and this almond oil is a refreshing change.  It is a little oily at first but I don&#x27;t worry as much about leaving oil stains everywhere with this product.  I can take my socks off before bed.  I am not a fan of the pump however as there is not much control and a lot more than I need is dispensed.  But, I usually find places to put the extra!</li>
    <li> great oil, great price. i would buy this again</li>
    <li> I normally use Organic Almond Oil and was surprised to like this just as much. It left my skin supple and glowing. I loved the pump. This had a lovely naturally occurring scent. I could tell it was fresh. I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The oil feels great on my skin; I&#x27;ve been using it as a daily moisturizer and love it. I can&#x27;t wait to use it to make my beauty products. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Thanks you!  Love the pump!  Fresh!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now.  My skin is so soft.  Wonderful product!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This seems like great quality oil and I love the 2 included tops.  Nice, light scent.</li>
    <li> I was given a discount on my purchase of this oil in return for my review and I have used half the bottle already.  I don&#x27;t notice a scent, however for a carrier oil, I do not want a scent.  I want the scent of the essential oils I am using.  I have made roller bottles, beard oil, lip balm, makeup, and lotion and Pure Acres Farm Sweet Almond Oil worked perfectly.  I agree with other reviews that I also received the pump and the flip top lid.  I feel like that was an added bonus. It absorbs quickly with no greasy feel.  I think having a refill size at a reduced cost would be good for all the DIY&#x27;rs.  I will definately be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use as a carrier oil for essential oils. This is a great product. And I really like that it comes with a pump.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice non-greasy fast absorbent oil that is great for massages, conditioning etc.... I was expecting the wonderful smell of almond oil, but it has none at all. Not sure how this is done ? Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice big bottle and feels good to use.</li>
    <li> I chose to buy this pure almond skin or body care product because it was one of the highest rated by other customer reviews.  Thank you for sharing.  Also, I&#x27;m poor at it only costs I think approximately $12.00,  Happy with product so far...</li>
    <li> I really like the ease of the sweet almond oil pump. It makes it very easy to use while blending with my essential oils. The sweet almond oil is also very light and I do not feel like I have heavy oil on my hands.</li>
    <li> great oil.  I use it for personal use and when I do massages.&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely purchase this oil again.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and not a heavy oil</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful!! Shipped super fast, the pump works great and the oil absorbed into my skin very nicely! It&#x27;s practically odorless too so it&#x27;s a fantastic carrier oil for us essential oil junkies!&lt;br /&gt;:D</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. It came quickly and just as promised. I&#x27;ve been using it as a moisturizer for my elbows and within just a couple of days my skin is feeling so much softer and smoother. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in some do-it-yourself beauty products as well!</li>
    <li> I really love this!  Really helps softnen my skin</li>
    <li> Excellent product.great for skin and body massage</li>
    <li> High-quality oil, great for the entire family to use with our essential oils.</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it. I could not wait to get it in my hand. my little one spilled my last of carrier oil for. I had used this brand a while back. SOOOO glad it&#x27;s on amazon. I use it straight and as carrier oil with essential oils. My 4 year old has eczema. He loves when I use this on his skin. The pump makes it easy for filling small roller bottles for essential oil.</li>
    <li> Cam protected against leaks. Love the option of caps!! Has a plain cap, for shipping. A flip top or a pump. Very nice!! Oil has a nice feel and soaks in, without a slimey feel!!</li>
    <li> This came well packaged and did not leak.  It come will 2 different cap options, it has a pump or a pour cap. This oil absorbed well and left my skin feeling soft and not oily.  The first time i used it I put it on my legs, later on I rubbed my leg and thought to myself &amp;#34; wow why does my leg feel so soft&amp;#34;  and then I remembered I had used my new almond oil earlier.  I received this product at a reduced price for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for my skin!  Love it very much.</li>
    <li> Having a pump on the bottle is very convenient.  I use this oil as a carrier oil for essential oils.  It has a really neutral smell, which is perfect for mixing with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love this almond oil for many reasons. 1st it comes with a regular cap, squeeze bottle cap and a pump dispenser. I love the pump dispenser so my hands don&#x27;t get the bottle all oily. At first I was a little disappointed that this did not have a almond smell, but now I am glad it does not because I also use this with my essential oils and don&#x27;t want any scent to interfere with the oils. I filled one of my Pure Acres Aromatherapy blue glass roller bottles with this oil and use it to apply the Almond oil under my eyes.I also filled another roller bottle with Almond oil to neatly apply to my cuticles on my hands and feet which keeps my manicure and pedicure lasting longer. This oil absorbs into my skin like no other, leaving it silky soft but not oily to the touch. The pump dispenser makes it so easy to use. I remove my eye makeup using this oil. Pure Acres you have a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This Almond oil is great for my skin, I am changing my skin regimen and having sensitive skin I was afraid I would break out but so far I haven&#x27;t. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my skin either which I really do appreciate.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for moisturizing after a shower before you dry off. It also is good in DIY body products.</li>
    <li> Blends well with many essential oils! Love that it came with a pump!</li>
    <li> Great quality, great customer service!</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Great Service.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived quickly as expected. I use it with various oils &amp; to make sugar scrubs &amp; it works great!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of almond oil.</li>
    <li> The bottle came packaged very well.  It included a pump and a pop top to make it easier to use.  Which was awesome.  The almond oil feels so good and moisturizes very well.</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect for mixing with my essential oils.  It blends perfectly and is everything that the company said that it was.  Perfect for a massage oil also.  I love that it comes with a regular cover, a flip top cover, and a cover with a pump.</li>
    <li> Fantastic carrier oil to use with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I like that the bottle came with a cap, cap with pop top and pump. This oil is smooth and soaks in well however a little more oily than I am used to with fractionated coconut oil. Works well As a carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love that this oil came with a cap and a pump. The pump is a very useful feature, I wish all my carrier oils came this way! My first use of this oil was the base in a beard oil that I was making for my Fianc&amp;eacute;. He already loves it. I also smoothed it into hair before my shower and my skin after my shower and was quite please with the abortion. A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given a discount in exchange for a review, I can honestly say I would buy it full price if I ran out.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!! I was impressed that the bottle came with a pump!!</li>
    <li> Great product.… great carrier oil to use</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great product!</li>
    <li> Super light oil that absorbs fast.  Works great as a carrier oil!</li>
    <li> Love the almond oil.  Especially the pump that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I regularly use a carrier oil to mix with my essential oils. I had not tried this brand, but am so happy I did! It works beautifully and I&#x27;ve already used it for several blends. Definitely will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Used this as carrier oil in roller bottles for essential oils!</li>
    <li> The first night I had this I used it for eye makeup remover. Worked wonderfully! I also used it with Essential Oils to make a muscle rub and once again I was impressed with how well it worked! And love that this comes with a pump and a squeeze top. Will for sure buy again!</li>
    <li> I just received my sweet almond oil and I used in in some essential oil recipes that suggested almond oil.  The almond oil mixed well with the EO&#x27;s and it did not have an over powering smell to take over the EO.  I will repurchase my sweet almond oil from Pure Acre Farm when needed .  I also like that it is not a heavy oil.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I got this product at a deeply discounted price for a &amp;#34;5-star review&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t typically leave reviews unless the product is exceptionally bad or exceptionally good. But as it is part of my agreement to leave feedback I haven&#x27;t found any reasons to knock it down any stars. The oil is a little thicker than my fractionated coconut oil, but it&#x27;s not a problem. I use it with my essential oils and it rubs into my skin quite nicely and surprisingly has no odor to interfere with the aromatherapy component of the oils.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Smooth and smells great!</li>
    <li> I use essential oils on a daily basis and this almond oil is a GREAT carrier oil!  I have an outside job so by this time of the summer (mid-August) my skin looks dry from the sun and wind. I used the almond oil with a couple drops of lavender oil and it was like magic!  No lotion can moisturize like this oil can!  I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! My skin is super sensitive and tends to be red and blotchy. I needed something that would moisturize but not irritate my skin, and this works perfectly!</li>
    <li> My almond oil came in a few days and very good condition, so far is very well pleased with oil</li>
    <li> Came with pump, solid top and pour top depending on how you wish to use. Also the expiration date was clearly marked which was helpful.  I like it as an alternative to coconut oil as it is softer on the skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use as a carrier with my essential oils.  It works great and smells nice :)  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love Sweet Almond Oil--no greasy residue!</li>
    <li> This almond oil has a nice consistency and works well to dilute my essential oils. It always leaves my skin feeling nice and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great oil. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Received my awesome oil earlier than expected, and I can&#x27;t thank you enough.  Quality is incredible and I will absolutely be using it for my skin and hair, and because it is absorbed nicely, leaving no greasy film, I plan to use in a face moisturizer blend for day and night use.  I also use essential oils for a variety of issues and will be using my sweet almond oil as the carrier oil.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was hoping for. Perfect for mixing with my young living essential oils 😄</li>
    <li> I have not had my oil very long but am loving it.  A little goes a long way!  I have tried it on my face and my heels and love the way it feels.  Going to try it on my thinning hair.  I was afraid it would  have a strong smell  but it has just a slight smell.  Wonder oil to add EO to!</li>
    <li> This company obviously prides itself in quality and customer service. The shipping was lightening fast, and they contacted me to make sure I received the oil. I am new to making my own skin care products and wanted to try Almond oil after reading about all of its benefits. I made a foot scrub with this almond oil, because I was having issues with cracked heels (to the point of pain when walking). After one use of my scrub made with this oil I noticed a remarkable difference! I used this at night before I went to bed and was able to walk without pain in the morning! I highly recommend this almond oil!</li>
    <li> Awesome oil!!!  I love this.  I am using it as a &#x27;carrier&#x27; oil with my Young Living Oils as well as on it&#x27;s own.  Super quick shipping and great price!  Thanks</li>
    <li> This oil works perfectly as a carrier oil for my essential oils. Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Pure Acres Farm Almond Oil is perfect for using as a carrier oil, viscosity is smooth and light.  I also really like it right out of the shower with its almond scent this has now replaced my standard oil.  For an awesome hair treatment, I used about 2 TBS of the Pure Acres Farms oil with rosemary and clary sage essential oils applied to damp hair and still can&#x27;t believe how my hair and scalp feel afterwards, you gotta try this.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Love it for making salves and lotions</li>
    <li> Just received Pure Acres Farm almond oil in the mail today.  I love  that it has a pump in it.  Makes it so easy to use. A big plus for me.  I have only used it a few times , so far I am loving it.  I will add more  to my review as I use it more.</li>
    <li> Love Sweet Almond Oil. This is a perfect carrier oil for all essential oils. It is non greasy. Great for also using for making lotions and as a base for after sun care.&lt;br /&gt;This came fast and packaged and secured really well. This also came with the added bonus of a pump which is not included in other brands. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional price for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Good value for sweet almond oil. I use it a lot for essential oils and for skin moisturizer. It is not sticky and is absorbed by the skin fairly quickly. Also it comes with a screw top, a flip up top and a pump. The pump was a little tricky to get popped up, but once it was it worked great!</li>
    <li> This is amazing I love the hit of sweet that you get which makes things more appealing to the younger ones.  Works well to as it absorbs fairly fast</li>
    <li> Truly love this, many uses with my oils. Great price.</li>
    <li> ...love that it has the pump and also the reducer flip-top.</li>
    <li> This oil is of great quality for so little price!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It feels so nice on mine and my kid&#x27;s skin and I also use it as a carrier oil to my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when used as a make up remover. Also good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love the way with oil feels! It massages very nicely into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky. I am glad I purchased this oil!</li>
    <li> I used it the same day it came with my essential oils and the rollers turned out fine.  Also using it with frankincense on my face for dry skin.  I like this oil very much and will purchase more in the future.  Thank you, a great product.</li>
    <li> Worked Great with my essential oils!!!!! will buy again Thanks!!! Everything was perfect</li>
    <li> Love how this absorbed into my skin so I didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. I couldn&#x27;t smell any scent at all which is preferable. It comes with a choice of a flip top lid or a pump which is very nice to have options.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil! 160z and comes with a pump! Yaaaaaay!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It is a perfect carrier oil</li>
    <li> Got this oil alittle over a week ago and have been using it every day!&lt;br /&gt;I love it! My skin loves it too!</li>
    <li> Love this!  It is a great carrier oil for essential oils.  Comes with two different tops, one to pour and one pump.  Not much is needed to spread evenly and has a neutral odor.</li>
    <li> We make a lot of our own beauty products, so almond oil is a must and I really like Pure Acres Farm.</li>
    <li> Pure Acres Farm Almond oil is wonderful. I love that it come with two forms of dispensing (pump and squirt). I use almond oil in cleansing my face and I&#x27;m very pleased!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love Sweet Almond oil for my skin, it is a wonderful moisturizer, smells great, and absorbs easily.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the sweet almond oil!!!  It soaks into my skin quickly and feels so good going on!!!  I use the oil in place of lotions now.  Wish I had known about oils a long time ago!!  The added benefit of skin nutrition is wonderful.  Will definately buy more and I hightly recommend the product.</li>

    <li> Perfect oil for my heels, knees and elbows. Nice light, sweet scent. I use this for a deep conditioning on my face once a week. Not too heavy, and I haven&#x27;t notice any pore clogging.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this oil, I really love that it comes with a pump. As a soap maker, I use lots of oils and I plan to order more for the shampoo and facial bars I make. I am really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to use as a carrier oil for my Essential Oils. I love it, it is light weight and seems to work well on my itchy eczema skin.  Bottle is a good size, comes with a pump, flip top &amp; solid cap.</li>
    <li> Best sweet almond oil that I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use sweet almond oil in my skin preparations. But I decided to use this brand since I have other items from them that I have enjoyed.I love the fact that they have included a spout and a pump so I could choose which ever delivery that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is great and lightweight.It has no odor and it sinks right into my skin. I like to use oils to dilute my essential oils and this works great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Love the convenience ofnthe pump top.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Great asks carrier oil for my essential oils.  The dispenser was an added bonus.</li>

    <li> Great oil. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> huge bottle! So far so good. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but liked it. The bottle is so big, it will take me some time to use it all.</li>
    <li> I use oils, creams, gels and lotions in massage work and when I sampled this one, I was very impressed. It has a light feel and a smooth texture while still getting an amazing glide. It absorbs nicely into your skin so you wont walk around with a greasy feel or get residue on your clothes and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores either. I use coconut oil as a base for making homemade baby lotion and I think I just found a wonderful summer alternative! This Almond oil is indeed sweet.</li>
    <li> received my oil super quick!  I was using coconut oil as my carrier oil for my young living EO but the ease of this oil is much better!!  love having the pump option and not having to try and dig in the other container....its not greasy either....def a great new addition!!</li>
    <li> I really like the Sweet Almond Oil. I have only used it a few times so far but I really like it. I use it to make roller bottles using Essential Oils and I have used it to remove make-up. It makes my skin feel so soft. It has a great shelf life also.</li>
    <li> Great product as advertised!</li>
    <li> I bought this Pure Sweet Almond Oil to use as a carrier oil for my Young Living essential oils. I&#x27;ll order this brand of almond oil again! I really liked it!</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time today, Loved it!</li>
    <li> I love that this product comes with both a pump and a cap lid. We use so much more of this in the pump form for an easier application with less mess!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and quality product. Will be ordering some again soon!</li>
    <li> I ordered this almond oil because they made me such a good offer to give it a try. The oil arrived promptly in just 2 days. I use essential oils and make many of my own personal products such as body butters and deodorants. The oil blended well, has a nice light smell and feels good on the skin. I like that it has a pump dispenser along with a regular top. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love.  Absorbs amazingly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>

    <li> Awesome oil! Comes with a convenient pump, flip top cap or a regular cap. Works great with my essential oils!</li>

    <li> Love it. Not overwhelming smell, not greasy feeling works great when added to my essential oils or used alone as a moisturizer!</li>
    <li> very light oil and leaves skin nice and moist after washing off with warm cloth. Very fast shipping, a good company.</li>
    <li> Sweet almond oil is a great product! The fragrance is mild and very pleasant, but more importantly it makes my skin feel wonderful! It is also a good carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> A nice light oil that absorbs into the skin without any greasy leftovers.</li>
    <li> The oil came in a good sized bottle with pump for convenience. No overwhelming scent, and absorbs into the skin nicely. I use almond oil for essential oils,which mixes well with them. Even though I do favor coconut oil which is always my first choice, after trying this oil out I am going to give it a shot and start using it for other things besides just my essential oils.I am big into skin care and hair care so I will revisit this review after I have time to experiment with it more! But otherwise so far this is a great product to buy.</li>
    <li> This made a great carrier oil for essential oils. Came with a pump, a squirt top and a regular screw on top so it is really convenient.</li>
    <li> This came just as an order of my Essential oils came so the timing was perfect.  I made up the bottles with the oils and my clients just love their oils!!!</li>
    <li> Great to use with essential oils...nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this luscious sweet almond oil!  It absorbs into my skin so well, smells very nice, feels luxurious!  I am thrilled with the processing of it, that it is cold pressed!  I use many essential oils and this is an excellent vehicle to use, as it moisturizes my skin at the same time as receiving the benefits of the essential oil!  I will look for Pure Acres Farm on Amazon when ordering my next sweet almond oil!!  Thank you for the lovely chance to try your oil!!</li>
    <li> Great price and product!</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Good quality. Great sale!</li>
    <li> Nice smooth carrier oil.  The only somewhat disappointing thing was that there was no almond smell to it.  Otherwise I really like this product!</li>
    <li> Love this almond oil! Use as a carrier for my essential oils and also use on my elbows and heels for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> Lightly scented and works great.  I also like that it comes with a pump for easy use.</li>
    <li> My wife did the testing and here&#x27;s her review: The Sweet Almond Oil smell is real nice and very subtle as well as delicate on the skin. It felt like velvet and there wasn&#x27;t any oiliness on my skin or my face. I rubbed it into my feet but didn&#x27;t get to the hair, yet. Loved it! Thanks</li>
    <li> Love the Almond Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Using it every day, wish I had another bottle.</li>
    <li> The almond oils was great! It arrived in a timely manner and it was reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Totally great for use as an essential oil carrier. Neutral smell and light weight oil that absorbs well.</li>
    <li> will buy this almond oil again!!</li>
    <li> on time order good quality oil</li>
    <li> I love the sweet smell.  Mixes well with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s exactly what I needed for my face cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> Smooth, non-greasy oil! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I reviewed once before when I first received this almond oil. This is definitely something everyone must try. Not to crazy about putting it in my hair but on my face it works miracles. Love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect moisturizer for my super dry cracked skin. I wash my hands often and have extremely dry hands. This is the first product that has really moisturized my hands. I can&#x27;t wait to use it with essential oils. I love the container as well that it comes with a pump and a flip cap.</li>
    <li> I received this oil a few weeks ago. It has a light scent, which I appreciate, because it doesn&#x27;t overpower the essential oils I add to it occasionally. It absorbs well and it&#x27;s one of my preferred oils to use on my face and skin.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. It makes a great moisturizer for anywhere on your body &amp; does not leave a greasy or sticky feeling. I really like that it came w/ a pump too, makes it easy. I also use this as a carrier oil w/ my essential oils, the is no smell/odor, that I can tell anyways. I highly recommend this product &amp; seller.</li>
    <li> love it, received on time and have already used it with my EO&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Really good quality oil</li>
    <li> The oil came wrapped up in plastic, just in case it leaked. Great idea, though it wasn&#x27;t needed ;)  The oil also came with a pump, which is awesome!! I have been using bottles without pumps which is super messy.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly!  I cant wait to try it!</li>
    <li> I just received my almond oil today, and I love it! Its consistency is thin, I would definitely use this as a carrier oil for essential oils. I tried it directly on my skin and it soaked in quickly and left no greasy residue, just soft skin. I did not notice any type of scent to it either, it doesn&#x27;t mask the smell of my oils or add to the scent of my essential oils. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Great packaging! No leaks. The pump is awesome!</li>
    <li> Our Amazon account is under my husband&#x27;s name. I purchased this item and I love it! I used it on my face, around the high wrinkle areas, and it works better than my very expensive skin care products! I have extremely sensitive skin, and this oil is not causing a rash. Usually by bed time my skin once gain looks haggard, today i still look like i just finished my morning routine. Yay! After seeing the many uses for almond oil, I also patted a little bit into my curly hair, and for once my curls did not turn into a frizz ball in this terribly humid weather. Trust me, that is a first.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try it as a carrier oil with my new essential oils. I would definitely recommend trying this product!</li>
    <li> The almond oil was shipped very quickly. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it very much but the few times I have, it was great. Absorbed very quickly and felt very nice. I especially liked that the bottle was shipped with a pump and a disk lid so I can choose which to use. Great company to do business with.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It blends well with essential oils to make a wonderful massage oil. This oil absorbs into the skin without leaving a oily feel. This company also has great customer service and fast shipping. I will be buying this Sweet almond oil again.</li>
    <li> Very silky smooth, and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> Love this oil and the shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> i usually use cocnut oil for me essential oil blends, however, i really like the fell of this oil. I may be switching to this one as a go to for my rollers as the product is really great, and very mositurising</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils. Scent is very light so it works well as a mixer. I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Just received my Sweet Almond Oil.  I love it. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> When I went to order the oil, my coupon did not work. So I did not buy it</li>
    <li> fast shipping, BIG bottle!  I was pleasantly surprised.  Great oil!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this Almond oil.  The pump makes it so easy to use in my blends.  Thanks Pure Acre Farm!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of essential oil mixes, and this sweet almond oil is a great deal.  It has a great consistency, and feels wonderful on your skin ... without leaving it greasy.  They company throws in a pump, which makes it much easier to get just the right amount of oil. I have bought other oils that cost twice as much, not again!  I will be buying this oil again!</li>
    <li> This oil is high quality.  Smells great and I used it for an entire week to mix as a carrier with my essential Oils.  I will buy again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money and a little goes a long way. I use this as a body moisturizer with my essential oils. I really like that it absorbs easily on your skin compared to using other oils.  It came packaged well  and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! Came sealed with a secure lid, also included a pour-cap and a pump! I use essential oils and use this as a carrier oil and for recipes. Really smooth.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I really like this oil and the pump that came along with it.</li>
    <li> I used it as a carrier oil for my YL essential oils, and it works great! It&#x27;s not as heavy as coconut oil so I like to use it on my face. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent price for the size of bottle. Came packaged well without damage. Great carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, like that it comes with the pump bottle. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great oil!  Love the pump that came with the bottle.  Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> I love how quickly it is absorbed and that it isn&#x27;t greasy!</li>
    <li> Used it with my essential oils ! Loved it !</li>
    <li> This almond oil has a subtle scent. I&#x27;ve used this as a carrier oil for my essential oil concoctions and it absorbs nicely into the skin. Having the pump sure makes for easy dispensing.</li>
    <li> Almost all of my bathroom products are on the more natural end of the spectrum except for the lotion I use on my legs.  I have been wanting to find something better to use that wasn&#x27;t too costly and worked well.  This seems to be a good option.  My legs are well nourished and the oil easily seeps into the skin so I don&#x27;t have to wait long to get dressed.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Perfect as a carrier oil for essential oils. Absorbs quickly and is comfortable to wear (for the 2 minutes before it absorbs entirely!)</li>
    <li> I made myself a massage oil with this by adding a little of my favorite essential oil. It is so nice and light and absorbed nicely. My skin felt so smooth after using it. I also used it on my legs after shaving and loved the way it soothed my dry skin. I look forward to experimenting with other uses. Love this oil!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a facial moisturerizer and am liking it very much.  I like the way I get a slight almond scent ever once in awhile, it is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> My family loves the sweet almond oil!! So many uses!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil to use as a carrier for essential oils.  Good also for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I would love to write a review about the Sweet Almond Oil, but I was not ever able to order it.  I am so sorry it didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continued success.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Kathie Gerber</li>
    <li> Quick service, good value, good product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  Shouting from the rooftops.  My skin is totally rejuvanated since using this product for just 2 weeks.  I see a big difference in the fine lines around my mouth - not as distinct.  Also use it on my hair to add shine and bounce.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you tried the Sweet Almond Oil.  A+++++++++</li>
    <li> Love this oil!! It&#x27;s a great idea to provide a flip-top to pour and a pump. This makes the purchase even a better deal!</li>
    <li> Great quality fast shipping love getting products from this company. No issue ever.</li>
    <li> Have been using it daily and so far so good.  Been using it primarily on my face &amp; legs.  And have used it as a carrier oil with essential oils for a massage.  Does the trick!</li>
    <li> Large bottle, fast shipping, great product!</li>
    <li> Great almond oil, love getting the pump with this oil, very handy when I need just a little squirt to mix with my Essential Oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received the almond oil and I am using it. I Love It!</li>
    <li> Love!!! This makes a wonderful all around moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Will be using this with my EOs for sure. The pump bottle makes it so easy to fill roller bottles and this is a nice size bottle.</li>
    <li> Love it! have gotten the 2 coconut oil bottles now I love the almond !</li>
    <li> What an awesome surprise to find such a large bottle for the price! Love this almond oil for makeup removal as well as for a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Great for use with essential oils. Use it in my roller bottles!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this oil!!</li>
    <li> This oil is great! I am just getting into essential oils and this works great as a carrier oil with them. And it has a nice sweet but subtle scent.</li>
    <li> Love pure acres farm sweet almond oil! I use it along with essential oils as a moisturizer and love it! Great products always!!</li>
    <li> Love this oil and that it comes with 3 different caps!  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I love Pure Acres Farm products and the fact they are so generous with discounts on new products is wonderful!</li>
    <li> LOVED it! I used this to make a sugar scrub, hair mask and eye make up remover. Left my skin and hair so very soft! Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I really like this almond oil. I have been using it as a moisturizer. I just add a couple of essential oils.</li>
    <li> I like this Almond Oil, it has a mild scent and absorbs in my skin making it feel smooth.  A little bit goes a long way.  It comes with a pump for the bottle and on the bottle it has a Mfg. date and an expiration date and Lot #.</li>
    <li> Love how it soaks right in to my skin. Leaves no aroma except for any essential oil I have added to the product. Very luxurious!</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a makeup remover and it works wonderfully. It takes all of my makeup off and it and leaves my skin looking way better. I also use it as a massage oil it feels great on your skin. The sweet almond oil works great on your hair, it makes my hair feel so much healthier. I plan on to continue to use the oil and find even more uses for this great oil.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the value buy to use w my oils!</li>
    <li> That says it all. This moisturizes my scalp and makes it feel soo goood. You will like this product too.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations for quality and price.  Also learned that it works well on sunburned skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as a moisturizer for many years.....I keep it in the shower to use after towel drying! It soaks into the skin&lt;br /&gt;very quickly!</li>
    <li> Great quality carrier oil for use as a moisturizer, for diluting your essential oils or using in any of your DIY projects.</li>
    <li> I have used several different types of oil carriers and Almond is one of my favorites.  This is a great product and I recommend it to everyone!  :)</li>
    <li> Perfect.  The pump makes it so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Best yet!! Love how it blends with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Love my almond oil. I compared it to the organic brand that I use and it is slightly less thick but in a really good way. I tried not to use my other one as often because it was so thick. This absorbs beautifully and made great rollerballs with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Love using this Sweet Almond Oil for my recipes for facial moisturizer and beauty products.  It is great for my dry sensitive skin and the smell is less overpowering than some of the other carriers oils or butters.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Almond oil!</li>
    <li> I love this as a carrier oil for my essential oils and I love the way it feels on my skin as just a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It is a rich golden color with a very faint aroma. It goes on smooth and absorbs easily. I also like the 2 extra tops that were included. There was a flip top and a pump enclosed  with the oil.</li>
    <li> My wife got this  to mix with oils. She loves that it comes with a pump as well. She likes the oil it is soft on the skin.</li>
    <li> As an alternate to coconut oil this is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I will use it both for a carrier oil for mixing essential oils and also just as a skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is so great for skincare, essential oil use, etc. Great packaging. I was so happy to get the pump and the lid!! What a great feature. Love this stuff and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great almond Oil at a great price!  Love Pure Acres Farm products!</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils. Light and absorbs easily.</li>
    <li> I love it! Very sweet carrier oil!</li>
    <li> soft and smells nice, don&#x27;t mind using with other oils</li>
    <li> This is the best oil ever! I used it for making essential oil roller blends and it is great!  I love that it comes with a pump too.</li>
    <li> Great product and great value!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Sweet Almond Oil for use with essential oils.  However, after trying it on my skin, I may use it more as a moisturizer.  It feels so gentle and non-greasy!  Aside from the pureness of the oil, I must state that this bottle came without any leakage.  I have ordered similar items in the past that have leaked enough to wet the delivery box.  &amp;#34;Thank you&amp;#34; to Pure Acres Farm for proper packaging!</li>
    <li> Great product! Has a very light almond scent . Works great when mixing with essential oils or for body moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Great price.  Will work perfectly as a carrier for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful carrier oil for my essential oil recipes. I love their products!</li>
    <li> Awesome oil! Perfect for my needs!</li>
    <li> Really love the almond oil.  It came with this great pump and pour cap too to meet all of my needs.  Great for body and hair.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working great in my oil cleansing recipe:)</li>
    <li> This is great to use as a carrier oil with essential oils. The smell isn&#x27;t quite as sweet as I expected, but it leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this oil as a carrier for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great packaging!! Great product!!</li>
    <li> It arrived in wonderful condition and ready for use.  Just as expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great delivery~  I like the pump!</li>
    <li> Received my product in 2 days as promised.  Great oil.  I&#x27;m using it straight on my skin.  I will also use it as a carrier oil with my essential oils and for one of the ingredients in my Hand and Body Cream.  Thanks Pure Acres.</li>
    <li> 1) I love that it is NOT sweet!!!  2) I love how thick it is and how well it spreads!</li>
    <li> As an aromatherapist I use a lot of Almond Oil.  Pure Acres Farm offers a wonderful oil!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase their product</li>
    <li> Just got my Almond oil, very fast delivery and the oil comes with a nice pump! This oil is very nice!</li>
    <li> I brought this to use as a carrier oil for  my oils and I love how it feels!</li>
    <li> I just started using essential oils, so when I saw this for a low price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it.  I was very pleased with how fast it was shipped.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth &amp; a great carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
    <li> Really love this product, makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> Just received my almond oil it is fantastic!</li>
    <li> As soon as it arrived I used the oil to mix with my relax/sleep essential oils for both myself and son. The oil has a nice smell that is not over powering. Also used oil in hair and on body. Works great!</li>
    <li> Clean feel &amp; made fresh (manufactured within the last month). Perfect!</li>
    <li> This seems to be a good quality oil. I used it in a face lotion, and am currently using it as a carrier oil for my Young Living Essential Oils. I am impressed with the quality so far. I will continue to buy this brand.</li>
    <li> I like it ok. Seems like it will be great for my skin and for making bath products. Couldn&#x27;t  beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have only been using Sweet Almond Oil for a short time but I am really liking it so far. I have mainly used it as a lotion after shaving my legs and for softening cracked feet. A little goes a long way. You only need a drop or two to cover a good sized area. If you use more than that, you will feel &amp;#34;over oiled&amp;#34;. LOL  I look forward to using Sweet Almond Oil for a long time and discovering many more uses for it.</li>
    <li> I love this sweet almond oil! It comes with a pump cap and a squirt cap, which is pretty convenient. It&#x27;s almost completely scent-free, which is awesome if you&#x27;re like me and hate using scented oils in your hair (I love the smell of my shampoo too much, I hate covering it up!). For the body, I like a little scent, and it makes a lovely carrier for essential oils. I add a bit of my favorite EO of the moment, (Plant Therapy&#x27;s Tranquil Synergy) and I massage over damp skin - and now my skin is silky-smooth :). I find that it is best to use this, and any carrier oil over damp skin, or after a spritz of floral water/hydrosol. The almond oil really locks in the moisture, and sinks into the skin leaving you smooth and hydrated, and sweetly scented, if you added some EO. Best of all? It&#x27;s all natural! A HUGE plus for me, since I&#x27;ve been switching over to all-natural products, as of late :).&lt;br /&gt;Another thing this product is great for is oil-cleansing. Massage a bit, with or without essential oils (lavender and tea tree is a good place to start!) into the face. Run hot water over a washcloth, and wring it out. Lay it over your face, and the steam should remove any excess oil. Your skin is left clean and silky smooth! Give this a try, and you may give up on soaps and commercial cleansers for good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Not sticky or greasy and absorbs quickly! Happy that the purchase included a pump.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the oil and will be super for making lotions and lip balms.</li>
    <li> I am liking this almond oil. I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils. The pump is very handy for filling roller bottles - or just pumping some in my hand to use as a moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell at all which is also good because it doesn&#x27;t conflict with the essentil oils. The only thing that might make it better, was if it was organic. :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Highly recommended for use with essential oils!  A+</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an oil that moisturizes without leaving an oily residue! I have found it and it works wonders! I add it to my face and anywhere on my body that is dry. It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and is exactly what I need! Delivery was super quick and I love how they put an expiration date on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Product came with a pump and a flip top, convenient for use, especially with the large bottle. Unfortunately, my pump top would not open. The bottle shows the manufacturing date and expiration date (3 years). I have only had it for a couple days, but I like it so far. It&#x27;s light and virtually unscented. It&#x27;s great for taking off eye makeup. I&#x27;ve used it as a carrier oil with my essential oils and it absorbs quickly. I put it on my dry feet before running and it feels wonderful. I&#x27;ll recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this Sweet Almond Oil, I have been using with my Essential Oils as a carrier oil and Love it!!</li>
    <li> I really like that this came with extra lids so I can use a pump or a regular lid. Pump bottles are great, but they are a pain to take anywhere. I use this as a carrier oil and for homemade lotions and creams. It was also packaged well and shipped in a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> This Sweet Almond Oil was just what I didn&#x27;t realize I needed!  I had been using Fractionated Coconut Oil to dilute my essential oils.  But I found that to be difficult to work with as it is thin.  This oil is thicker, easier to work with &amp; no smell.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and is essentially unscented which I prefer.</li>
    <li> I like this better to use with my essential oils for my face than other oils I have found.</li>
    <li> I love this almond oil! I will be purchasing  it again!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect moisturizer, especially for those of us with sensitive skin. I can use it plain or add in essential oils. I also like that it is safe to use on my toddler. The pump top is a fantastic accessory. Thanks!</li>
    <li> We use it for a carrier oil for our essential oil. I&#x27;ll buy it again once I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Works great with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing carrier oil, great in combo with essential oils, used in many recipes. The pump makes it easy to add to roller ball bottles without needing a funnel.</li>
    <li> Works well when used to dilute essential oils. Pump is included which makes it much less messy!</li>
    <li> Love the size for the price! A very versatile product that I can use for all sorts of things.</li>
    <li> Love this almond oil! It&#x27;s a nice medium weight carrier oil with essential oils...especially for massage.</li>
    <li> This almond oil is a fantastic product and the pump dispenser makes a nice bonus, as you don&#x27;t have the mess of dripping oil on the exterior of the bottle. It&#x27;s rich and luxurious and makes a great base for adding to essential oils. It&#x27;s fabulous for massage too and I add a little wintergreen to it for sore muscles. This will be my go-to oil for body work, but I&#x27;m also using it as a body moisturizer. It&#x27;s a great all-around product that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorite oils for my essential oils. I&#x27;ve even use it on my skin straight from the bottle. I highly recommend this one</li>
    <li> love, love, love ! Light base, sweet smell...great product for price !</li>
    <li> Love it! High quality oil. I love the fact that you get a regular cap, flip top cap, and pump cap-so convenient!</li>
    <li> I added a drop of essential oil to two drops of the almond oil.  Used it as my night face moisturizer.  Love it!!  Also love using a few drops with my shampoo:)</li>
    <li> Pure Acres Almond Oil is wonderful! I use it on my arms and legs daily.  It takes care of all my moisturizing.  If you are looking for a great oil from a great company, this will fill the need!</li>
    <li> Great for use as a carrier oil for essential oils!</li>
    <li> Excellent carrier oil!</li>
    <li> I am really liking my Sweet Almond oil-it is nice and light and absorbs easily. Mixes well with essential oils and I love that it came with a pump as well as a pour cap.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Excellent carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
    <li> This Almond oil is great! It is smooth and works great diluting my oils! Works well in the roller bottles by the same company!!! Pure Acres does it again!!! This may be the only brand I buy!</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and nicely.  Nice sized bottle and love the pump for it.  Makes a great carrier for my essential oil DIY :)</li>
    <li> Have used it on my face, not my hair-yet, and very pleased with the results. Face feels smoother and softer and used it with the microderabrasion crystals.</li>
    <li> Great Oil, Great Company!  Will use again!</li>
    <li> Great product! Absorbs quick and not greasy!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this oil as a carrier oil!</li>
    <li> What a lovely almond oil. This is such a smooth oil.  I love how easy it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin.  It&#x27;s a perfect carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Works great as a carrier oil. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Very Nice!! I especially like the lid options...pump vs plain lid vs lid with squeeze opening.  Good quality oil.</li>
    <li> This is a great carrier oil for using with essential oils. It makes my skin feel great! It comes with a nice pump as well. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Great as a carrier oil, the pump is easy to use, and great as a moisturizer or carrier oil.</li>
    <li> This almond oil does not leave your skin feeling as greasy as if you used coconut oil &amp; it is basically odorless.</li>
    <li> I received my oil in the allotted time. It is light and I LOVE that it has a pump!  It is a great ingredient in my body butters and it is practically fragrance free.  I can use it for my hair and skin and it is not too greasy. I will definitely order this brand again.</li>
    <li> Pure Acres Farm is really exceeding my expectations of quality. The bottle even came with two different types of lids - a pump and a flip open top.</li>
    <li> Used it with my YLEO and LOVED IT!!!</li>
    <li> I love Pure Acres Farm Sweet Almond Oil. I live in hot sunny Nevada where it is really a challenge to keep skin moist. I have been using this wonderful oil on my body, face, and hair. It has such a smooth texture and rubs in so nicely. Mixing it with my favorite essential oils makes it so versatile as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Got this yesterday and already made my favorite body oil blend. Loving it!</li>
    <li> This Almond Oil is perfect to mix with essential oils.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for DIY recipes and as a carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Nice for mixing with essential oils for a massage or sugar scrub.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Great for mixing with EOs</li>
    <li> I love this sweet almond oil.  it is so nice in all of my cosmetics and leaves that smooth, silky feeling to my skin.  I love the pump!  It keeps the oil from running down the side and makes for an easier clean up.  Thanks for the great offer!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil nightly and love that is it not very greasy! I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I cannot wait to use my almond oil! It is an excellent value, and came in 2 days as promised. The bottle and nozzle seem to be very well made and not just cheap plastic. Seems to be exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars, but it&#x27;s not organic</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil, I wish it were certified organic but all in all this is a wonderful carrier oil</li>
    <li> Light oil that absords quickly without a greasy after feel. Love almond oil for all its many uses. Try it . . you won&#x27;t be disappointed !!!</li>
    <li> Great Quality. I love that this oil has little to no scent so that I can use it in my stretch mark blend without the worry of it interfering with the other oils. It has a nice, non-greasy feel. Excellent carrier oil to dilute essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great product! Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Very smooth; nice scent</li>
    <li> I love this sweet almond oil! The pump allows for easy filling of Essential Oil roller bottles, and this is an excellent carrier oil for essential oils. This oil feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying this almond oil. Use it daily for my face. Skin is silky smooth with it on.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil, pure,light. I will enjoy using it in my homemade creations. Thanks for the fast shipping and wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my skin so soft, and has no unpleasant odor. Perfect carrier oil for essential oils too!</li>
    <li> This product is debuting.... HIghly recommend.  High quality and service is fantastic.  I wish you luck in your future endeavors and you can count me in as one of your future clients!</li>
    <li> Nice scent, works as well as other sweet almond oils I&#x27;ve purchased. Follow up: The pump that was sent with the oil added up leaking and I lost more than half the bottle.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil.  I love it!  This is currently used as full body oil with added essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is working good! It is a little thicker than other sweet almond oils I have used in the past to dilute my essential oils, but I have no problems with it. I would purchase it again. I love the pump!</li>
    <li> This oil is great alone and in mixes. I make my own lotions and oil rollers and this almond oil has been great to use with the mixes I make!</li>
    <li> Love the oil, feels great on my skin thank you!</li>
    <li> I usually use coconut oil and was looking for a better substitute than the liquid coconut oil I had bought previously. I&#x27;m really liking this almond oil, I have been slathering it on after shower and with only a few uses I have noticed my skin is much softer.</li>
    <li> This almond oil is every bit as good as the other brands with a great price. I like that the oil came with a regular lid, a flip top lid and a pump. Make it great for different dispensing needs. The only &amp;#34;negative &amp;#34;, if you can say that, is I wish it would have more of an almond scent. But, I do realize that as a carrier oil, a base scent is not always desired.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Good quality and it even come with a pump for easy dispensing.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  I am presently using it for dry cracked heels.  I love that it is not greasy feeling.  5 Stars!!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Like the oil, but I think the bottle has a leak and can&#x27;t get the pumper to work.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil....would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This bottle of almond oil is such a nice size! Nice, clear oil and the handy pump was included, making it&#x27;s use even easier!</li>
    <li> Used this in a DIY Eye Makeup Remover and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It is less greasy than the other oils I was using and worked great!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works good for diluting essential oils.  Good value.  Just a little more greasy compared to other carrier oils.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be great quality. I love that it comes with a pump and a lid so you can choose how to dispense.</li>
    <li> I love this as a carrier oil for essential oils. It has no taste or smell to interfere and has a good amount of thickness.</li>
    <li> Received this new product offer at discounted pricing to try. However, my review is my own and this has not swayed my positive opinion of the offer received. This Sweet Almond Oil is great quality, quick shipping and no chemical after smell. Use with my essential oils as not only a carrier oil but also in essential oil home recipes including lip balm and body butter/lotion. Coming not only with a pump but also flip open cap to make it even easier to use. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the dispenser.  Other oils I&#x27;ve ordered from other companies do not have a pump action dispenser.  I am finding new uses for this oil every day.  I use it at times to simply clean my face and it gets dirt that I did not even know was on my face.  My skin feels a bit softer since using this oil.  I have also been using the oil after being out in the sun. My skin does not feel dry as it often did.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It came as expected, great price, and it goes on perfect. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a few days but my skin is so soft. It is a very light oil so it feels great,not greasy at all.Very very nice!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Smooth, and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Perfect for EO roller ball recipes doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent. Will definitely purchase this again when this bottle runs low!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff! It makes my skin feel so soft and amazing! There is no strong scent and it feels great! I started actually using it with a mix of pure argan oil on my legs to sooth and smooth razor bumps. You can honestly just use the sweet almond oil and it works amazingly, I just like to experiment. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face before I go to bed. A few drops go a long way, and when I wake up in he morning y face looks so smooth and naturally dewy, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> its really natural and I really enjoy using it on my face at night. you dont need to use lot of them at the time.</li>
    <li> The oi is great but the offer to receive this for $3.00 was not honored.</li>
    <li> This oil is light but very moisturizing. I am using it in my homemade salt scrubs.  It is PERFECT for my project and I could not be more pleased with this oil.  I also love the fact that a pump is included which makes it even easier to pour!  I would highly recommend this oil!!</li>
    <li> Very nice carrier oil for essential oils and to make your own blends, or simply as a moisturizer on its own. I expected a light scent, but it is scent-free, and is very light. I had an issue with the pump not working, but am not terribly bothered by that.</li>
    <li> Nice oil, I enjoy this brand!</li>
    <li> Have liked all the oils I&#x27;ve received from this company</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. Came with a pump and a flip top, which if very convenient for use. It also lists the manufacturing date and expiration date (3 years, which is a surprise. I didn&#x27;t think the shelf life was that long for Sweet Almond Oil.) This is also a good price for such a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil is a great oil. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and literally has no scent. It&#x27;s supposed to sooth dry skin and irritated areas. I have sensitive, allergic, reactive, rosacea skin. Have to be really careful what I use on it. Only use carrier oils to moisturize. The last week, or so, I&#x27;ve been having a lot of bumpy, rashy skin--especially on my cheeks. I thought I might be having an allergic reaction to some serums I&#x27;d made. (One drop of an essential oil blend in a teaspoon of carrier oil--a 1% dilution, which is appropriate for face.) I actually figured out that it&#x27;s not the essential oil blends, it&#x27;s another allergy season starting (I get this way with tree and grass pollen in the spring and ragweed in the fall.) I&#x27;ve used the Pure Acres Farm Sweet Almond Oil and so far, no problem. My skin stayed smooth and pink (good for me.) It also absorbed quickly--a plus for summer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way that I use carrier oils is to protect my skin in the winter. Before I go out in the elements, I always put a few drops of oil on my face. It also helps protect your skin from the dryness in the house when the heat is on. I use those few drops on my face several times a day--when I wake up, after my shower and any other time I think of it, or my face feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I want to do is make a herb oil infusion and make my own lip balm. For a lot of people, Sweet Almond Oil is the oil of choice for lip balm. I&#x27;ve just started to make herb infused oils (which are easy.) I&#x27;ve made salves for first aid and pain, so far. Next attempt will be lip balm. It&#x27;s just some infused oil, beeswax and essential oils to flavor (which is optional.) If it&#x27;s ofinterest, you can do a web search and come up with a lot of easy recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review.</li>
    <li> A great product!  Looking forward to using it in my homemade body products. Very fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice carrier oil. It absorbs into the skin readily and doesn&#x27;t have a distinct odor (allowing an essential oil&#x27;s smell to come through nicely). I like that it comes with both a pump top and a flip top. I would definitely purchase this again for use in preparations for myself and my family.</li>
    <li> Love the Sweet almond oil I received!</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands and I really like this one. I appreciate that it arrives with the option of a pump or a squirt bottle lid. Makes it convenient to use. The almond oil itself is wonderful. I have a skin condition on my hands that makes them rough and dry. As a baby my parents were told to use sand paper to sand down the rough skin on my hands. I have tried numerous different products as an adult. This almond oil leaves my hands silky soft and not overly oily.</li>
    <li> Added some lavender and peppermint essential oils for a natural sunburn remedy and was really pleased!  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This oil dose alot of things. I like the different caps you sent with the bottle.</li>
    <li> LOVE the Sweet Almond Oil for Skin, Hair and Face by Pure Acres Farm! It is the PERFECT addition to my shelf for my studies in aromatherapy and my Essential Oils Certification. The included pump and easy pour tops were a great feature! Thanks!</li>

    <li> I love the smell and the feel of this almond oil on my hands...makes my hands feel moist rather than so dry.</li>
    <li> Great product !! I am using for skin and hair !! Makes my skin feel amazing and I put some on the tips of my hair as a smoothing serum !!</li>
    <li> Nice oil.  Fresh and near odorless.  Really like that the bottle has some &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; to it so it&#x27;s easier to squeeze the bottle.  Really LOVE that it came with a pump as well as a flip cap.  If I had a complaint, it would be that the label looks too much like the label on the NOW brand, so when ordering I&#x27;ll have to be sure to pay close attention so that I get the correct brand.  Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Great product and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This was delivered on time and as described. It was packaged very nicely as to ensure no leakage! I enjoy the pump top - this makes it a lot easier to put in smaller jars. The almond oil is perfect!</li>

    <li> I LOVE adding a few drops of this almond oil and a few drops of lavender oil into my bath...nice light scent and moisturizing. I use this oil on my face as a nighttime moisturizer as well.

    <li> Love this almond oil. Works great with essential oils to make my face serum. Almond oil is wonderful for your skin ladies. Jackie O&#x27;s secret ingredient for eliminating wrinkles. You cannot go wrong when choosing almond oil. Use straight or with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Amazing oil!  Very pure and worth the money!  Highly Recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Almond Oil. I have dry skin and I love how my skin feels after using the Almond Oil, it feels great even on the days I don&#x27;t have the almond oil handy because I am traveling. I am very happy I bought it and plan on buying it again.</li>
    <li> Love this almond oil! Will be using it in all my oil recipes and sharing it with friends at make and take workshops. GREAT seller!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Smells delightful!</li>
    <li> Loved that it came with 3 different tops. With 3 girls going through lots of costly make up remover wipes, this is a much better option! Like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong almond scent so it works great with my essential oils :)</li>

    <li> Great carrier oil for essential oil use</li>

    <li> So far I am in love with this Almond oil.  Works great as a carrier for my essential oils, I like that it seems to absorb quicker than the fractionated oil that I normally use.

    <li> Works well with my essential oils and feels great on the skin!</li>
    <li> just okay. personally, i did not like the feel of it. Maybe because I am used to a more lotion feel. It really boils down to personal preference.</li>
    <li> Love the fact the pump comes with it!  It is nice and light and makes a great carrier oil for my essential oils.  Definitely will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This oil is high quality and has been a great addition to our routine. We use this as a carrier oil for our essential oils as well as for massage therapy and have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use essential oils everyday and this has been the perfect carrier oil. I especially love that it comes with a pump dispenser! It&#x27;s a must have in my house now!</li>
