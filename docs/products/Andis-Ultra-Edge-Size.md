      <li>This worked beautifully and left her with a nice puppy cut.  </li>

      <li>I ordered this to do quick skirt and chest summer cuts on my mini schnauzer&#x27;s so they can swim without fuss</li>

      <li>It didn&#x27;t give me a consistent trim on the legs, so I&#x27;m ordering a half inch blade for the legs, but it was easy to use and trimmed extremely smoothly on his body and neck.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very particular about my hair and hair length</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>But It really isn&#x27;t the blades fault</li>

      <li>After doing much research and reading all the online reviews, I decided to splurge some money on an Andis clipper and on this particular guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>better yet, the price here was WAY less than most other</li>
      <li>Away with the attachments and back to the blades, they have a nice clean cut, sharp, and my entire shop is now purchasing them!</li>

    <li> This is an excellent clipper. I wanted to get 4 good clippers of varying sizes so I could clip my poodle -- and easier than using clipper guides. It&#x27;s a clean cut and very well made. My sister has the same one and uses it on her Miniature Schnauzer and she loves it too. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This blade is perfect for a poodle body puppy cut. It didn&#x27;t give me a consistent trim on the legs, so I&#x27;m ordering a half inch blade for the legs, but it was easy to use and trimmed extremely smoothly on his body and neck.</li>
    <li> I just got my clipper blade and it is great!  Amazing quality just like I&#x27;ve come to expect from this brand.  Very heavy duty and had no problem cutting right through my thick haired cocker spaniel&#x27;s coat.  Very happy with the purchase.  If you&#x27;re not sure which blades fit your clippers, you can find out on the  andis.com website.  Just have the model number off of the back of the clipper.</li>
    <li> I was using the Oster blade that is supposed to work with my Andis dual speed clipper.  I don&#x27;t know why, but the Oster blade didn&#x27;t cut very nicely when the clipper was on high, so I bought the Andis blade.  I&#x27;m happy I decided to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I ordered and came in great condition.  Makes cutting my dogs soooo much easier that the add-ons!</li>
    <li> Much better than the plastic attachments!</li>
    <li> Appears to be of good quality and got it free with the savings from the dog clipper purchase. Will be very useful come Summer time again when my Collie Mix will need her coat trimmed</li>
    <li> Well described as to the height of the haircut. I used them on my Springer and got exactly the clip I hoped to get.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my Pomeranian&#x27;s hair and it won&#x27;t even got through her hair. Her hair is way to thick. But It really isn&#x27;t the blades fault I guess. I might use it on my Yorkie but I usually keep her in a long coat.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to do quick skirt and chest summer cuts on my mini schnauzer&#x27;s so they can swim without fuss</li>
    <li> Sharp, good cutting blade.  You must have your dog well combed to use it and if you have a dog with undercoat it also must be all combed out.  My dog doesn&#x27;t have the right type of hair to make it an easy job to use the blade but when I took the time to FULLY prepare the coat it worked great.  I will use it for a monthly touch up blade rather than wait until the hair is longer.</li>
    <li> This blade worked perfectly for my Cocker Spaniel.  I like to leave her a little longer during the cold Minnesota Winter.  This worked beautifully and left her with a nice puppy cut.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This blade leaves at least a  little fur on my dogs.  Shorter versions clipped them far too short.  It appears durable and easily snaps into and out of the Andis clipper.</li>
    <li> I have four yorkies.  This allows for a longer cut of fur but its&#x27; ease in use depends on the type of fur your dog has.  If the fur is medium thick, it will work great.</li>
    <li> Great quality product.  The fit to my razor and the sharpness of the blade are of the very best quality.  I would tell anyone interested in changeable blades that this is the product to go with.</li>
    <li> I was frustrated in getting just the right blade and cut for my dog...not a short to the skin, but not fluffy..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked 10 times better, easier and faster than a \\&quot;snap on plastic tooth guide\\&quot; that yu put over a short cutter head. Those bind and break and pop off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And better yet, the price here was WAY less than most other outlets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Being retired I gave up the daily shaving routine and grew a beard. I started using my collies electric trimmer but the blades cut way too short. This 3/4 inch blade is perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this blade because my hair is so unmanageable that about the only length that works for my hair is 3/4 of an inch all around.  I had been using Wahl clippers with the No 6. plastic guard.  However, I had found that the spacing of the teeth and the flimsiness of the plastic guard was allowing some scalp to pull up and it was giving me an uneven haircut.  After doing much research and reading all the online reviews, I decided to splurge some money on an Andis clipper and on this particular guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints as far as the clippers and the quality of the guard are concerned.  I am able to give myself a much more even hairdo AND in about half the time.  The only reason I rate this 4 out of 5 stars is BECAUSE this Blade doesn&#x27;t quite cut 3/4 of an inch.  In Numbers speak, this blade would actually cut about a 5 1/2 (or about 17.5 mm short).  TRUST me I&#x27;m very particular about my hair and hair length and I measured in different spots.  But I think this only applies to a handful of us here on the face of the planet.  For most of you, the blade should do a fine job on your K-9 i&#x27;m sure.  AND for most of you that will use the clipper for human hair, a difference of a couple of MM should NOT really make a difference ;)</li>
    <li> I tried cutting my maltese and shitzu mix dog with this attachment. His fur was clean, brushed with no knot, and 3 inches long. Cutting quality was awful. I clipped him with scissors instead. Very disappointed because I ordered this blade attachment specifically for him.</li>
    <li> I had ordered the plastic attachments but they would catch in the fur. This metal cutter is perfect for my grooming needs!</li>
    <li> I received the product and it was either dull,not sharpened or used. It didn not cut hair so I spent my money notonly on the blade;but the shipping and now I haveto sharpen it before its even been used.. if I would have k own I had to sharpen upon receiving I would have held off and purchasedsomething else that would have been ,ore useful to me</li>
    <li> I use this blade on my Labradoodle that  has combination hair.  He is curly on his upper body and not as curly on his hind quarters.  It is the best blade for all over his body.  I can use it one direction if I want to leave it longer and go the opposite direction to get it shorter for summer.  I do have to stop and clean the hair out often on the curly hair and re- oil to keep blades cutting easier.  The curly hair will clog blades easier than straighter hair..  Glad I found them. Leaves just the right amount of hair to keep his hair more manageable .  Love them!!!!♥️</li>
    <li> Good quality blade, does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Clips easily and securely into Andis clippers.</li>
    <li> I had the ceramic version which worked much better, it was everthing that was advertised, i would just recommend the ceramic version</li>
    <li> I absolutley love this blade. Away with the attachments and back to the blades, they have a nice clean cut, sharp, and my entire shop is now purchasing them!</li>
    <li> Works great, and was already well oiled before getting it. Read to use when opening. Great clippers. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have 5 Newfoundlands and it works great for their grooming!</li>
    <li> Good quality and the mailing service was fast</li>
    <li> Works well in our Andis clipper - helps groom our part poodle easier.</li>
    <li> Great blade for tangle free hair.  Make sure hair can be combed through first, just like with any clipper or attachment.</li>
    <li> Perfect length! Clean cut and smooth movement. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is the longest length blade I could find to purchase to trim my Goldendoodle, and it was just what I wanted! Yeah!</li>
    <li> Blade works for a short cut.</li>
    <li> It gets to the every tangle hair on my Maltese dog makes a final cut perfect and clean good product</li>
