      <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use these 2</li>
      <li>I will add another review after use. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>this is definitely one of the best color ink brands out there!</li>
      <li>plus people love them....</li>
      <li>and I was pleased to receive it.</li>
      <li>The color is bright and remains consistent.</li>
      <li>Great colors turn out bright with little rework..</li>
      <li>amazing ink... arrived the first day as shown.</li>
      <li>I love star bright ink it works well and is easy to apply, however my bitch is that the colors shown aren&#x27;t the same as what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Fortunately it was in my front office</li>
      <li>after reading the reviews i was really excited about getting this ink in and trying it...</li>
      <li>If you care about your clients, and doing clean tattoos, I recommend you don&#x27;t buy from this seller either.</li>
      <li>Be prepared to receive a gallon freezer bag full of ink.</li>
      <li>got it a day before very fast shipping everything was fine with the inks</li>
      <li>Was received quickly.</li>
      <li>I got them quick</li>
      <li>This is one of the best deals on ink, but it is poorly packaged.</li>
      <li>cant wait to use them thank you very much</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>they came in packed tight...and fast...</li>
      <li>For $100, I expected way more.</li>
      <li>I really like this brand</li>
      <li>the cheap prizm ink i bought to practice with (half the cost of this atleast) was packaged better and actually arrived worthy of putting in human skin...</li>
      <li>On top of that, as other buyers of this product have experienced, both of the black inks included had leaked all over the inside of the box and all over all the other inks.</li>
      <li>its nice to find small ½ ounce bottles for the price of starbrite ink.</li>
      <li>Compared to the pigment used previously this packs in so much better.</li>
      <li>Once again I paid top price and got half of what I wanted...</li>
      <li>Ive used more than half of the colors and all is well.</li>
      <li>and I really wanted my golden yellow.</li>
      <li>im trying to make a few extra bucks and work on a carrer trade and it is costing me more at the moment than what its worth...</li>
      <li>It has a wide range of useful colors,and,come on--</li>
      <li>When I opened the bag and examined all of the bottles, they were the only 2 opened the golden yellow and the deep violet.</li>
      <li>each bottle new to open.</li>
      <li>Apparently it did come on time.</li>
      <li>Most of the colours were intact, though two of the inks had broken seals and were leaking inside the caps.</li>
      <li>In keeping with sterile tattoo practices, I had to throw them away and individually clean every other ink and check to make sure other seals weren&#x27;t broken.</li>
      <li>order a different green your looking for bright its leaf green and a darker green both still usefull</li>
      <li>I PURCHASED NEW INK BECAUSE MY OTHER COLORS WERE STARTING TO HARDEN AT THE BOTTOM.</li>

<li> Though it could have been worse, perhaps the seller could use with better packaging techniques as I cannot tell if the products were mishandled or roughly transported.</li>
<li> Bottle of Japanese outline ink and don&#x27;t tattoo realistic shit piles so thanx for naddah.</li>
<li> I thought that it had gotten lost at first and contacted Fed Ex late Monday night (it was delivered of Friday) and they told me it was delivered to a totally different address</li>
<li> THESES APPEAR TO HAVE A FEW OLDER BOTTLES.</li>
<li> There is also less to no separation of the pigment and the binder in the ink caps which tends to happen with other brands I tried during large tattoos.</li>
<li> All of my inks were completely loose in the packing box, with only a sliver of crumpled brown paper to cover them.</li>
<li> one was open and made a mess.......</li>
<li> NOT SURE HOW OLD THE PRODUCT IS, BUT DOES SEAM TO HAVE A LITTLE AGE TO IT.</li>
<li> I then looked to see if there was an option to make a claim as it was with all my other orders from Amazon, but there was no claims option.</li>
<li> Other than that issue everything seems to be as it should.  </li>
<li> The Box that the inks came it was a little too big for the contents, and perhaps this is why two of the inks had broken seals (from rough handling)</li>
<li> I just wish reviews could include a photo so you can see what a mess the inside of the box was when I opened it.</li>
<li> a few days longeer than hoped but</li>
<li> they were open and leaking and very watered down horrible</li>
<li> I&#x27;m offended this seller would pack something that needs to remain sealed and sterile in such a careless way.</li>
<li> These are NOT Chinese watercolours which seem to be so common!!!</li>
<li> dissappointed is disgraceful to say the least...</li>
<li> A little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for.</li>
<li> Not sure if this is the manufacturer&#x27;s inconsistency or fake inks.</li>
<li> im not happy  at all</li>
<li> you guys ill be ordering from you guys from now on......</li>
<li> Starbrite inks are thick and luscious!!!</li>
<li> I am disappointed after all that, and I don&#x27;t have all the ink I ordered</li>
<li> worst purchase ever bought got them they came in a plastic bag ziplock freezer</li>

    <li> there is nothing I can say or words I can say to describe how great this product is.....my tattoos are always bright and looking good....plus people love them....I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the bottles....none came open, or damaged.....they came in packed tight...and fast...thanks you guys ill be ordering from you guys from now on......</li>
    <li> amazing ink... arrived the first day as shown. thank you</li>
    <li> got it a day before very fast shipping everything was fine with the inks</li>
    <li> A little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for. Ive used more than half of the colors and all is well. Arrived on time, packaged correctly. each bottle new to open. its nice to find small ½ ounce bottles for the price of starbrite ink. Great buy!</li>
    <li> recomendo starbrite , uma das melhores tintas para tatuagem que j&amp;aacute; usei , as tintas para tatuagem do meu pais são horr&amp;iacute;veis por isso compro tintas americanas , pra mim são as melhores.</li>
    <li> BEWARE OF THIS SELLER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller DOES NOT know how to properly pack liquid items. All of my inks were completely loose in the packing box, with only a sliver of crumpled brown paper to cover them. No plastic bag to protect them, bubble wrap, anything. On top of that, as other buyers of this product have experienced, both of the black inks included had leaked all over the inside of the box and all over all the other inks. In keeping with sterile tattoo practices, I had to throw them away and individually clean every other ink and check to make sure other seals weren&#x27;t broken. I wouldn&#x27;t trust this seller with any tattoo supplies, and will not be purchasing anything from them in the future. If you care about your clients, and doing clean tattoos, I recommend you don&#x27;t buy from this seller either. I just wish reviews could include a photo so you can see what a mess the inside of the box was when I opened it. For $100, I expected way more. I&#x27;m offended this seller would pack something that needs to remain sealed and sterile in such a careless way.</li>
    <li> Great colors turn out bright with little rework.. I would buy starbright again. order a different green your looking for bright its leaf green and a darker green both still usefull</li>
    <li> Compared to the pigment used previously this packs in so much better. The color is bright and remains consistent. There is also less to no separation of the pigment and the binder in the ink caps which tends to happen with other brands I tried during large tattoos. I have found my go to pigments.</li>
    <li> Most of the colours were intact, though two of the inks had broken seals and were leaking inside the caps. Though it could have been worse, perhaps the seller could use with better packaging techniques as I cannot tell if the products were mishandled or roughly transported. The Box that the inks came it was a little too big for the contents, and perhaps this is why two of the inks had broken seals (from rough handling)</li>
    <li> I really like this brand but they didn&#x27;t even try to package it. They just threw them into a bow and put some paper over them. So some of the inks got damaged.</li>
    <li> good ink eazy to get come a few days longeer than hoped but was in great shape take to skin very good and heals true</li>
    <li> This is one of the best deals on ink, but it is poorly packaged. Be prepared to receive a gallon freezer bag full of ink.</li>
    <li> I got them quick i like the colors i got cant wait to use them thank you very much have a nice weekend</li>
    <li> Very nice product!! My client loved!!</li>
    <li> inconsistent packaging led me to doubt sterility of the inks. Some came sealed with foil, while others had plugs, and some had no seal at all, as if some had been poured out. Not sure if this is the manufacturer&#x27;s inconsistency or fake inks.</li>
    <li> one was open and made a mess....... ....... ....... ....... ....... ........ ...... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . . . ..</li>
    <li> Love Starbrite,can&#x27;t beat the price or the 2 decades of reliability--do urself a favor and get this ink set! It has a wide range of useful colors,and,come on--IT&#x27;S STARBRITE!!</li>
    <li> Apparently it did come on time. Fed Ex never came to my door instead they took it to the front office, so I didn&#x27;t get until 3 days later. I thought that it had gotten lost at first and contacted Fed Ex late Monday night (it was delivered of Friday) and they told me it was delivered to a totally different address and it was left in the front office. I told them that I would check my front office in the morning to see if they have it but if not I would call back. I then looked to see if there was an option to make a claim as it was with all my other orders from Amazon, but there was no claims option. Fortunately it was in my front office and I was pleased to receive it. When I opened my box  and looked in the bag there was ink at the tip of 2 bottles. When I opened the bag and examined all of the bottles, they were the only 2 opened the golden yellow and the deep violet. I won&#x27;t be able to use these 2 so my 25 is now 23 and I really wanted my golden yellow. I am disappointed after all that, and I don&#x27;t have all the ink I ordered</li>
    <li> NOT SURE HOW OLD THE PRODUCT IS, BUT DOES SEAM TO HAVE A LITTLE AGE TO IT. I PURCHASED NEW INK BECAUSE MY OTHER COLORS WERE STARTING TO HARDEN AT THE BOTTOM. THESES APPEAR TO HAVE A FEW OLDER BOTTLES. HOWEVER I JUST STARTED USING AMAZON. THE SERVICE WAS GREAT AND THE SHIPPING WAS TIMELY AND I&#x27;LL BE SHOPPING HERE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews i was really excited about getting this ink in and trying it...however it came in today and i have to throw ALL of it away!!! how can you package something that is suppose to be sterile in a gallon size ziploc bag? dissappointed is disgraceful to say the least...im trying to make a few extra bucks and work on a carrer trade and it is costing me more at the moment than what its worth...the cheap prizm ink i bought to practice with (half the cost of this atleast) was packaged better and actually arrived worthy of putting in human skin...this? JUNK</li>
    <li> this is definitely one of the best color ink brands out there! Get this for great starter set!</li>
    <li> These are very good tattoo inks, vivid colours with lots of pigment!!! These are NOT Chinese watercolours which seem to be so common!!! Starbrite inks are thick and luscious!!!</li>
    <li> These colors work great, they&#x27;re vibrant and beautiful.  Would have given 5 stars but 3 colors were damaged and leaking when i got them. So i threw those away as a precautionary measure.</li>
    <li> I love star bright ink it works well and is easy to apply, however my bitch is that the colors shown aren&#x27;t the same as what I ordered. They used 2 oz. Bottles to show detail but the 1 oz. Come in slightly different shades, and y would anyone need 4 brown shades and 2 blacks.? I have a 8 oz. Bottle of Japanese outline ink and don&#x27;t tattoo realistic shit piles so thanx for naddah. Once again I paid top price and got half of what I wanted...</li>
    <li> This ink is awesome! The colors are bright and beautiful! I haven&#x27;;t used them yet but am very impressed by the colors I see..... I will add another review after use. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> love it, thank you, Patty</li>
    <li> I had to throw one color out, it had opened and leaked out all over. Other than that issue everything seems to be as it should.  Was received quickly.</li>
    <li> worst purchase ever bought got them they came in a plastic bag ziplock freezer may I add they all weighed diff weight regardless  of the bottle they were open and leaking and very watered down horrible im not happy  at all</li>
