      <li>It smells like cloves and cinnamon and taste good.</li>
      <li>but it is a good gloss</li>
      <li>The tube was cracked also but it does have a good feeling on the lips</li>
      <li>I honestly did not expect it to be so good.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, it smells amazing</li>
      <li>Nice cinnamon scent but</li>

      <li>Pout Pump smells and tastes delicious &amp; does not contain any of those yucky chemicals found in the majority of other lip glosses.  </li>
      <li>More like honey with a bit of heat and just the right amount of pepper !&lt;</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Diva Stuff for a great affordable product.&lt;br /&gt;Wendy</li>
      <li>and I enjoy the taste.</li>
      <li>There is a light cinnamon smell &amp; taste associated with it.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>And I know because Fireball is my favorite run to first drink and this smells identical to that.</li>
      <li>Love it - works great - hurts my stomach a little if i accidentally ingest any when I lick my lips.</li>
      <li>Received this product yesterday and I was very excited to try my first plumping gloss.</li>
      <li>It looks very nice and shiny on lips and lasts for a long time.</li>
      <li>jus two uses my lips are so much plumper and healthier, im so in love with this product.</li>
      <li>I like the smell of this lip gloss, and it gives good shine to your lips especially over lipstick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>Love that it leaves my lips soft in morning!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the product overall and would repurchase it for its attractive glossy look and pumpkin spice late smell :)</li>
      <li>It does add some plump to your lips and smells like fresh cinnamon</li>
      <li>The scent and flavor was nice but didn&#x27;t make up for the overall product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the red pepper powder floating in my lip gloss and the plumping effect was minimal at best.  </li>
      <li>I love it way more than ANY other plumping gloss I have tried.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t plump but is still okay for a regular lip gloss.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
      <li>If you DO however enjoy cloves and want an all natural lip gloss</li>
      <li>First of all, this lip gloss tastes like clove...</li>
      <li>The price is not bad though compared to many other lip plumping glosses.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice gloss but definitely not worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have tried several lip plumping glosses and this one works to make lips look fuller and isn&#x27;t sticky, easy to apply as opposed to the ones that you twist from the bottom and can&#x27;t control the amount.  </li>
      <li>It was chunky, with large bits of gelatinous fibrous goop.</li>
      <li>Really thought this would work because of all the positive reviews I read.</li>
      <li>&amp; it doesn&#x27;t do much to my lips.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
      <li>I really like this Conditioning Gloss,since using this</li>
      <li>Does not seem to do much ...</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t really like cinammon</li>
      <li>it gets one star for how fast it got here.</li>
      <li>but like I said it is very hydrating</li>
      <li>Not so much to say about this.  </li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
      <li>and this one doesn&#x27;t really do that.  </li>
      <li>Taste weird, but its good!</li>
      <li>and I find cinnamon to mild to actually work.</li>
      <li>; though, I am pleased with the plumping effect delivered by such a low priced plumping gloss...</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t work for me as far as plumping my lips, but it does make them very shiny.</li>
      <li>My skin is not sensitive so it might be too mild of a formula to cause visible changes.</li>
      <li>If you like cloves, and I mean you have to really like cloves, this might be your new favorite thing in the world.</li>
      <li>I definitely do feel a real tingle!  </li>
      <li>One word of advice, though...don&#x27;t wear this gloss when you are sitting near a hornet&#x27;s nest...</li>
      <li>But, it definitely does not affect my lips as much as I was hoping.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only change it really makes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really mind for how low the price was.</li>
      <li>However, I did not notice much plumping during the day even after I reapplied numerous times.</li>
      <li>That being said, I do believe this plumping gloss really does make my lips look a bit bigger....</li>
      <li>Has an odd taste but not bad.</li>
      <li>But, that being said, the high gloss of the product definitely gives the appearance of fuller lips.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely purchase this product again as well as recommend highly to my friends.</li>
      <li>They just dry out really fast.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the slight &amp;#34;irritation&amp;#34; it&#x27;s worth the plumping factor</li>
      <li>I noticed small changes this morning but nothing I would be excited about.</li>
      <li>ill be coming back to buy more thats for a fact!</li>
      <li>This was my very first &amp;#34;Diva Stuff&amp;#34; purchase &amp;, 8 products later, I can honestly say I am OBSESSED with their products!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great lip plumper! Has all the best ingredients to give you that nice plump!  Taste weird, but its good!</li>
    <li> Received this product yesterday and I was very excited to try my first plumping gloss. It looks very nice and shiny on lips and lasts for a long time. I like its cinnamon smell and it&#x27;s not sticky at all. However, I did not notice much plumping during the day even after I reapplied numerous times. I gently brushed my lips with a toothbrush and applied a layer over night. I noticed small changes this morning but nothing I would be excited about. My skin is not sensitive so it might be too mild of a formula to cause visible changes. I am satisfied with the product overall and would repurchase it for its attractive glossy look and pumpkin spice late smell :)</li>
    <li> It did not plump my lips! It didn&#x27;t do anything to &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; my lips. There is a light cinnamon smell &amp; taste associated with it. Other than that, I could have used any other lip gloss and gotten the same results!</li>
    <li> I really like this Conditioning Gloss,since using this i have not had chapped lips this keeps them moist i use all through the day.</li>
    <li> Really thought this would work because of all the positive reviews I read. It didn&#x27;t plump my lips whatsoever, but it does have a stronger moisturizing element, and will leave your lips somewhat softer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the red pepper powder floating in my lip gloss and the plumping effect was minimal at best.  The scent and flavor was nice but didn&#x27;t make up for the overall product.</li>
    <li> Yes, you feel a tingling sensation but no plumping effect. At all.</li>
    <li> smells and work well.</li>
    <li> This lip gloss is hydrating and I do notice plumping but WHAT A MESS!!  I&#x27;m not sure if this is typical of the company&#x27;s packaging but the gloss arrived leaking all over the place.  I should have probably returned it but I cleaned it off and tried it.  There must be a hole in the tube or something because it continues to make a mess.  I am not that crazy about the smell but like I said it is very hydrating and I can see some plumping from using the product.  I am undecided on whether I will repurchase because I don&#x27;t know if the mess and leaking of the packaging is typical and I would prefer a less noticeable smell.  The price is not bad though compared to many other lip plumping glosses.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me. Also, tube must be stored upright or it leaks.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t plump nothing !! It taste like Cinnamon and actually make my lips get dry ..</li>
    <li> Very thin formula....  smells very herby...  like clove a LOT.  Didn&#x27;t do any sort of plumping for me.  It&#x27;s so thin though, it just doesn&#x27;t stay put.  Not a fan....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything except make my lips look greasy.</li>
    <li> Smells like Fireball Whiskey. And I know because Fireball is my favorite run to first drink and this smells identical to that. But, it definitely does not affect my lips as much as I was hoping.  They just dry out really fast. That&#x27;s the only change it really makes.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this! but I just don&#x27;t like the smell its overpowering&lt;br /&gt;&amp; it doesn&#x27;t do much to my lips.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t make my lips any bigger but it is a good gloss and I enjoy the taste. so it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to but it&#x27;s alright. I don&#x27;t really mind for how low the price was.</li>
    <li> very good ,I buyed it for a friend and she is in love with this product ,I recommended..</li>
    <li> Tastes like cinnamon but doesn&#x27;t plump the lips! The tube was cracked also but it does have a good feeling on the lips so I still use it as gloss!</li>
    <li> tingled yes , but did it do anything , that would be .....NO ! ....... and after trying it a few times thinking well maybe this time I will see even a tiny plump ( still nothing )  when I closed it  , the tube cracked .. can def NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Does not pump up...actually leaves my lips dry.</li>
    <li> So clove-y that I had to throw it away. It just was all cloves, all the time. If you like cloves, and I mean you have to really like cloves, this might be your new favorite thing in the world.</li>
    <li> My wife bought it and says it has the worst smell and it tastes horrible on the lips &amp; dose not plump at all... it gets one star for how fast it got here.</li>
    <li> At best it hydrates your lips. You&#x27;ll feel a tingle but its lip gloss, it&#x27;s not going to transform you into Kylie. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Tingles and visibly plumps, smells like cinnamon. Has an odd taste but not bad. If you don&#x27;t mind the slight &amp;#34;irritation&amp;#34; it&#x27;s worth the plumping factor</li>
    <li> The ingredients make your lips tingle.  I have noticed that when I am not wearing it my lips have a fuller appearance to them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from another site&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really into lip gloss but I do want to have a fuller lips. So far so good. It did meet my expectation. It does sting a little bit . And I don&#x27;t really like cinammon but this one ain&#x27;t bad. I will try the tinted ones soon.</li>
    <li> jus two uses my lips are so much plumper and healthier, im so in love with this product. ill be coming back to buy more thats for a fact!</li>
    <li> It does add some plump to your lips and smells like fresh cinnamon</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  Happy</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with this product. It gives a subtle plump to your lips. It&#x27;s not sticky, it smells amazing &amp; I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love it - works great - hurts my stomach a little if i accidentally ingest any when I lick my lips.</li>
    <li> Tingles a little, but I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  Not a noticeable increase in lip plumpness.</li>
    <li> No lip plumping as described for this product...very dissapointed!!!...</li>
    <li> Great taste, smell and feel. Not only shines and plumps but draws out the natural pink color of ypur lips.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful way to plump up your lips !&lt;br /&gt;This is tasty and sticky without being uncomfortable.  More like honey with a bit of heat and just the right amount of pepper !&lt;br /&gt;It works ! I put my lipstick on over and I almost look like Mick Jagger&#x27;s younger sister !!! Well , second cousin , maybe ?? hahaha&lt;br /&gt;Try this ....&lt;br /&gt;Love this !!!</li>
    <li> First of all, this lip gloss tastes like clove...so just be sure you like the taste of clove before you order!  That being said, I do believe this plumping gloss really does make my lips look a bit bigger....I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to wear any color on my lips when I have it on.  I definitely do feel a real tingle!  One word of advice, though...don&#x27;t wear this gloss when you are sitting near a hornet&#x27;s nest...I think the clove smell attracts bees!  I had a hornet hovering around me on the deck after I applied, so...just FYI!  Other than the &amp;#34;bee problem&amp;#34; though, I am pleased with the plumping effect delivered by such a low priced plumping gloss...</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this lip gloss, and it gives good shine to your lips especially over lipstick</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing! It does plump lips slightly but more impressed with the moisture!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t plump but is still okay for a regular lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I have paid as much as $50 for a lip plumper at Sephora and this is just as good at a much better price. It smells like cloves and cinnamon and taste good. I would recommend this stuff to anyone who likes plump lips. I will definitely purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Diva Stuff for a great affordable product.&lt;br /&gt;Wendy Ball Tart</li>
    <li> Thus stuff is so great! I honestly did not expect it to be so good. I love the smell. I love it way more than ANY other plumping gloss I have tried. I have tried a ton and this beats them all.</li>
    <li> This was my very first &amp;#34;Diva Stuff&amp;#34; purchase &amp;, 8 products later, I can honestly say I am OBSESSED with their products!!  Pout Pump smells and tastes delicious &amp; does not contain any of those yucky chemicals found in the majority of other lip glosses.  While it does feel a tad tingly on the lips, I can&#x27;t attest to the fact that it truly &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; your lips. But, that being said, the high gloss of the product definitely gives the appearance of fuller lips.  I would definitely purchase this product again as well as recommend highly to my friends. Pout Pump was the beginning of a beautiful relationship with Diva Stuff.  I can honestly say that Diva Stuff is my new favorite beauty brand!</li>
    <li> Not so much to say about this.  I only use plumper gloss....and this one doesn&#x27;t really do that.  Now, Buxom Lips...that&#x27;s a lip plumper.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.  It seemed more like cinnamon lipgloss and was just so-so.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to do much ... Nice cinnamon scent but not t working for me as a plumper:(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad but I&#x27;m a veteran user of plumpers and I find cinnamon to mild to actually work.</li>
    <li> Terrible scent - similar to how liquid tooth filler prep stinks in the dental office! Didn&#x27;t plump my lips at all. It can be used as a lip gloss, but the stench gave me a headache, so couldn&#x27;t use it as a lip gloss either. Shocked at all other positive reviews, - definitely something fishy about them.</li>
    <li> The lip plump does the trick. I was reading up on other lip loss plumps and was worried, one not natural ingredients in them two others make the lips look swollen and unnatural that&#x27;s only after dealing with a uncomfortable sting. However this gloss gives the slight natural plump that I wanted. It has a warming sensation to it when you put it on but I wouldn&#x27;t say it burns or stings. Love that it leaves my lips soft in morning! Great products from diva stuff.</li>
    <li> I have tried several lip plumping glosses and this one works to make lips look fuller and isn&#x27;t sticky, easy to apply as opposed to the ones that you twist from the bottom and can&#x27;t control the amount.  Feels good on lips and can be used alone or over/under lipstick.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for me as far as plumping my lips, but it does make them very shiny.</li>
    <li> If I could give a zero, I would. The smell was noxious. It was chunky, with large bits of gelatinous fibrous goop. I tried to use it once and almost gagged. I cannot believe I wasted the money on this stuff that looks like it was made in someone&#x27;s basement.</li>
    <li> I love cinnamon and cloves so the taste is great. It doesn&#x27;t sting or anything, feels a bit minty. Does it pump my lips? No. For 14$ I&#x27;m a bit miffed. It&#x27;s a nice gloss but definitely not worth the price. If you DO however enjoy cloves and want an all natural lip gloss this is it!</li>
