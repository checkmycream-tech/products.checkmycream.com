    <li> It has been helping chronic sinus  and nose. It does not cure anything and it is not intended to, so I go to the doctor, take my prescriptions but while I am watching TV I leave it on and inhale the steam.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the oils</li>
    <li> I used this oil heavily in humidifier when my baby got cold. Used it in nights for almost a week. I definitely see the benefit with breathing.</li>
    <li> I bought this  oil cuz I heard it was good for many things including to help you breathe and stuff and I&#x27;m glad I bought it, I&#x27;m pleased with it. :)</li>
    <li> I use this to make my Epsom salts bath mix, wonderful!</li>
    <li> You know, I should have bought this oil 4.5 years ago ! My daughter who&#x27;s 4.5 years old catches cold at the drop of a hat . I now use it night after night in a vaporizer - the result is put magic ! No congestion - it opens the airways too. That apart I rub the oil on the tip of her nostrils after swim and before sleep . Concentrated and she loves it . Totally therapeutic .</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had read somewhere that this helped repel spiders and bugs.  I bought it and it indeed works.  The smell is very refreshing and I just love the fact that it is all natural.  I don&#x27;t like using harsh chemicals around my pets, but this doesn&#x27;t hurt them and it smells great.  It is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I use it in my morning showers and it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I like using this, it feels strong and seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product and thank you for the speedy delivery and how well you packed it.  Five STARS for you my friend!&lt;br /&gt;Madeline</li>
    <li> fast delivery. good product</li>
    <li> Great product.  Price is perfect. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Mix a few drops of this Eucalyptus in a carrier oil along with a few drops of Peppermint, a few drops of Wintergreen and a few drops of Spearmint oil and you will have one of the best oils ever for a stuffy nose, sinuses, and chest.  There are several ways to use it.  I love to rub it under and in my nose but that is too strong for most people.  You can rub a few drops on you chest before you go to bed or you can rub a few drops on the bottom of your feet and pull on a pair of socks before going to bed.  The oil will travel from your feet throughout your body in a few minutes (usually within twenty to thirty minutes).  The foot method is great for babies and young children that can&#x27;t take the other methods.  I have been buying NOW ESSENTIAL Oils for a long time now and have found them to be very good.  As with all essential oils, I find this one to be very beneficial.</li>
