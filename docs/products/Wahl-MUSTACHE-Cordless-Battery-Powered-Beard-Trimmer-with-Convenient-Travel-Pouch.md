      <li>One aa battery and fits easily in your carry on.</li>

      <li>This is perfect for trimming those hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>see the full guidelines for writing reviews on Amazon, go here.</li>
      <li>It trims very efficiently and so far the battery life is good.  </li>
      <li>Have not used attachments which appear adequate.  </li>
      <li>Liked it at first, however, the metal teeth on the trimmer break and the trimmer likes to glitch and not work even with a new battery inside.</li>
      <li>Its small size makes it great for travel, but not so good for regular use because after every 2 or 3 uses, I have to change the battery.  </li>
      <li>well worth the expense.  </li>
      <li>Price is Right.</li>
      <li>The length guide came apart in my hands right out of the box.</li>
      <li>Good powerful little travel trimmer.  </li>
      <li>Burns through batteries pretty quickly, as you might expect, but I&#x27;ve gotten several full-face trims off a single AA battery, so I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
      <li>It needs to be oiled at first use.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Quite pleased overall.</li>
      <li>The larger and longer walhs have been better.  </li>
      <li>Product exactly as described</li>
      <li>/&gt;It still has a touchy power switch that gets knocked off mid-stroke some times, but it works great for something that only takes a single AA battery.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it only worked twice before becoming a paper weight.</li>
      <li>Nice and sharp!  </li>
      <li>Nice little hair trimmer.  </li>
      <li>It is plastic, however the back side has a rubber grip and it doesn&#x27;t really feel that cheap.  </li>
      <li>but at this price I can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see these on store shelves very often anymore</li>
      <li>Cuts very well.  </li>
      <li>This works very well for that</li>
      <li>/&gt;•Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an improvement over that model, and includes a few nice attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Practical and powerful enough to use as a full facial trimmer</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I use more professional devices for other locations.</li>
      <li>Love this little device.</li>
      <li>The unit is sturdy, works well, and is tiny enough to fit into my compact shave kit.</li>
      <li>I love this little guy!</li>
      <li>It has exactly the same blade as my super-duper fancy-shmancy Wahl professional beard trimmer.</li>
      <li>issue I had with my first one is that it tended to kill batteries quicker than you would expect, but I fixed this by simply using rechargeable AA&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>It has survived a few drops and is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>Using a rotary vise, I can hold the clipper steady and turn the lure into the clipper and wind up with a round clean body centered on the hook.</li>
      <li>use for sensitive areas</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the loud side, but it rocks.</li>
      <li>The more expensive ones I bought have not been as powerful as this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;•Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;•Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just as powerful as any other trimmer in its class, and can take care of just about anything you throw at</li>
      <li>so I bought a second one for when my first one finally gives up.  </li>
      <li>Seemed to be a decent trimmer, but very fragile.  </li>
      <li>broken easily!</li>
      <li>back for now, Will update the review after recieve a new one.</li>
      <li>All the accessories are cheap plastic that do not fit onto the trimmer properly.</li>
      <li>This little trimmer is completely capable of doing my sideburns and neckline which is remarkable when you consider its extremely (or at least comparably) small size.  </li>
      <li>I have owned WAHL products in the past and have been reasonably satisfied but this item is not worth the money.</li>
      <li>It eats batteries so fast, you can hear it slowing down the moment you start using it.  </li>
      <li>Its small but powerful enough for my use.</li>
      <li>Although very portable, not very reliable on how long it will last you.</li>
      <li>the 3 single length attachments were just right but not fit the mustache trimmer</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for minimalists or travel as there is no extra charger to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to throw mine away, as it was delivering very low and inconsistent power, but I decided to take it apart instead. I figured out that the device works 300% better if you loosen the two screws near the top. The trimmers are mounted on springs and if you have it on while unscrewing, you&#x27;ll actually hear it get faster with each rotation.</li>
    <li> Ive bought more expensive trimmers but I keep coming back to this one. Its simple and it gets the job done. Its small but powerful enough for my use. When the time comes, I will buy it again. The more expensive ones I bought have not been as powerful as this one.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a few uses</li>
    <li> Small and sharp, cuts fast.  Perfect for travel but not recommeded for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Burns through batteries pretty quickly, as you might expect, but I&#x27;ve gotten several full-face trims off a single AA battery, so I&#x27;m more than satisfied. The unit is sturdy, works well, and is tiny enough to fit into my compact shave kit.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. The length guide came apart in my hands right out of the box. Never went back together properly after that. All the accessories are cheap plastic that do not fit onto the trimmer properly. After one use the battery compartment door would not close properly. I have owned WAHL products in the past and have been reasonably satisfied but this item is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This machine would not turn on at all two months after I bought it.  I used it as per manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.  I checked that the batteries worked.  This item \\&quot;feels cheaply\\&quot; manufactured and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I ended up returning it to the manufacturer for credit towards a more expensive model that charges with a cord, and have been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> I love this little guy! It was exactly what I was looking for. The slim design fits my hand perfectly, the power button stays on when I depress it, and the blades cut pretty well. This is a good buy for women with short hair, and certainly better than buying the overpriced Wahl trimmers marketed to women!</li>

    <li> I do not care for this shaver and I&#x27;ve had several from Walh; I replace them every 1-1.5 yrs.  I travel most of my life so battery operated is critical.  The larger and longer walhs have been better.  I&#x27;d avoid this one.</li>
    <li> Love this little device. I go through phases where I shave my face or sometimes go with the &#x27;rugged&#x27; look where I go with a permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and &#x27;mangroom&#x27;. This works very well for that and I like the fact that it is cordless since I use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been recently using rechargeable batteries where I can probably get around 15 uses before I have to recharge. I wish it had a battery indicator of some sort but at this price I can&#x27;t complain much. I suppose if you oiled the blades it would last longer but I have not experienced much wear on my blades and have used it for almost two years now. If they do go bad I will purchase another one. Wahl knows hair products and trust them as a brand.</li>
    <li> This is the absolutely best mustache trimmer for removing machine embroidery errors. I won&#x27;t be without one and I always recommend it to students.  Ellen Anne Eddy</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. small and portable&lt;br /&gt;2. uses 1 AA batteries so you can use rechargeables&lt;br /&gt;3. Practical and powerful enough to use as a full facial trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Just like most other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned ($10-$30)little things start to go wrong after about 6month or 1 year of use.  This is not a trimmer you will give your kid :)&lt;br /&gt;The power button on this unit has started to short.  I now have to manually push and hold the power button as it will not stay on by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word of advice: if you buy this or any other small consumer trimmers, hold on to your receipt and warranty stuff. You will use it for sure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent. I own at least two dozen beard/mustache/hair clipper/trimmer devices and this is the best among the lower priced items. Great for shaping my mustache just where it meets my upper lip. I use more professional devices for other locations. I recommend it highly. There is nothing to add.    NOTE. It has exactly the same blade as my super-duper fancy-shmancy Wahl professional beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer for the price, lines up your neck line nicely.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work right out of the package! Very disappointed with this product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Nice little hair trimmer.  The size is perfect for traveling and works well. I recommend this product to everyone.  Price is Right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before and it lasted for years! This one seems to be doing an equally good job. Quite pleased overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for about 6 years now.  It has survived a few drops and is still going strong.  Frankly, this little thing is a tank.  It is plastic, however the back side has a rubber grip and it doesn&#x27;t really feel that cheap.  The kicker?  It runs on a single AA battery (which lasts quite a while I might add...) and they are SUBSTANTIALLY stronger than little ordinary micro trimmers.  I don&#x27;t see these on store shelves very often anymore so I bought a second one for when my first one finally gives up.  I simply like this little unit too much.  This little trimmer is completely capable of doing my sideburns and neckline which is remarkable when you consider its extremely (or at least comparably) small size.  Can&#x27;t go wrong and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping a beard trimmed.  Small and never needs charging (just remember to keep a spare battery on hand!).&lt;br /&gt;My last one lasted a couple of years, with minimal use, and then suddenly stopped and needed replacement.  Even with&lt;br /&gt;an unreliable lifetime I rate it five stars for the convenience and performance during its lifetime.</li>
    <li> Does the job...but a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> I have a set of these I use in my beauty shop..I LOVE it...it uses one AA battery and lasts quite awhile..I use it for trimming neck lines, ears and eyebrows. I purchased another for my husband for Christmas...</li>
    <li> just as I expected and I like it totally on time I recommend this seller five star A+ if you want it get it</li>
    <li> love this thing. its small/handy. the battery will last a long time. use for sensitive areas and im a lady...works great! bought one for my son too:)</li>
    <li> I will rather buy some expensive over the ear trimmers. Like Peanuts or something else. Just OK for over the ear and earline trimming. Not cloese to skin trimming.</li>
    <li> The unit worked great out of the box. It needs to be oiled at first use. the 3 single length attachments were just right but not fit the mustache trimmer 9916-817  which was a disappointment. This is perfect for trimming those hard to reach places. My wife even used it to shave my head and it was easy for her to use.</li>
    <li> This trimmer gets it done. It&#x27;s a bit on the loud side, but it rocks. One AA battery and trim all day.</li>
    <li> This is like a disposible razor. It works great for about 2months and then it will just STOP. Ive replaced this item several times thinking it was user error but it&#x27;s just poorly made.</li>
    <li> It does the job and fits the hand well. The only draw back is the guard is hard to put on.</li>
    <li> Such a low cost too!  I&#x27;m very hard to please, and at first, I was disappointed at this product. I thought (incorrectly) that I had to push down the button to get it to keep trimming - but in fact - if you push down hard, it stays on.  Which means I can trim the nasty hair around my ear - so I don&#x27;t look like Frodo, and I can pro-long a haircut for longer than it takes me to type this review.  This is *&amp;%$ing awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for a long term backpacking trip.  Unfortunately, it only worked twice before becoming a paper weight. Tried changing the batteries; I guess something came loose inside.</li>
    <li> So my husband is going to traveling and he needed battery operated trimmer and he wanted to try it out before he packed it in his suitcase and it did not work well at all, but we already threw all the packaging away.</li>
    <li> Clever little unit and well worth the expense.  I will be using it for travel and since I travel light it is perfect for what I will be using it for.  It trims very efficiently and so far the battery life is good.  Have not used attachments which appear adequate.  Good value for money.</li>
    <li> Seemed to be a decent trimmer, but very fragile.  The second time I used it, the tips of the blade chipped while sliding the cover off and that rendered it painful and useless.  Replacement blades cost as much as the whole trimmer. :(</li>
    <li> Great travel trimmer. One aa battery and fits easily in your carry on.</li>
    <li> broken easily! I just use it 3 times before it break down. I think you can imagine how I feel when it broke with half of my hair unshapen......</li>
    <li> Good powerful little travel trimmer.  I like how it requires you to hold the button depressed in order to work - this stops the trimmer accidentally turning on when in my toiletries case / luggage.</li>
    <li> Took it out of the box, put the battery in, didnt switched on.  Tried a different battery still didnt work.&lt;br /&gt;Sending back for now, Will update the review after recieve a new one.</li>
    <li> This device works fine if it is turned on and operating.  The power switch is quirky.  Sometimes it turns the device on and sometimes not. I just keep trying and sooner or later it has come on.  I think that it will eventually die.</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars for quality of the trimmer itself but the attachments are ridiculously difficult to get on and off (but nobody should really be buying this things expecting to change them constantly anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one of these for about 3 years and used it with no attachments about twice a week, and had almost no problems with it - I actually preferred it when the blades dulled a bit as this seemed to give it a smoother cut.  Like someone else mentioned I eventually had the on/button fail, but again this was after 3 years of moderate use.  Didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy a second one because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found to use both at home and on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its small size it&#x27;s just as powerful as any other trimmer in its class, and can take care of just about anything you throw at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I had with my first one is that it tended to kill batteries quicker than you would expect, but I fixed this by simply using rechargeable AA&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Liked it at first, however, the metal teeth on the trimmer break and the trimmer likes to glitch and not work even with a new battery inside. Although very portable, not very reliable on how long it will last you. Mine lasted me about a year or less, but started having problems with it at least half a year before I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace an older version of the same model that had a few busted teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an improvement over that model, and includes a few nice attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still has a touchy power switch that gets knocked off mid-stroke some times, but it works great for something that only takes a single AA battery.</li>
    <li> I make Deer Hair Bass Bugs and use this to trim the packed and stacked deer hair. Using a rotary vise, I can hold the clipper steady and turn the lure into the clipper and wind up with a round clean body centered on the hook. Much better than free hand 8-)</li>
    <li> My husband was pleased with this trimmer&#x27;s performance!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM GETTING IT TO TURN ON</li>
    <li> Cuts very well.  Nice and sharp!  Its small size makes it great for travel, but not so good for regular use because after every 2 or 3 uses, I have to change the battery.  It eats batteries so fast, you can hear it slowing down the moment you start using it.  You&#x27;ll do much better to get a rechargeable one.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described</li>
    <li> Battery killer and sucks at its job</li>
