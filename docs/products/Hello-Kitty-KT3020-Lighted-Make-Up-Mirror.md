      <li>My grandaughter simply loved the mirror for her B&#x27;day.</li>
      <li>I love it perfect size for my vanity, I just wish the lights were a bit more brighter.</li>
      <li>While very cute, it was DOA.  </li>

      <li>nice job</li>
      <li>/&gt;She loved it, and it&#x27;s still in her room, sitting on top of her dresser.  </li>
      <li>so I bought her her own.  </li>
      <li>I honestly think any girl at any age would like it.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, however, it states that it does not come with 4 AA batteries, which is okay.  </li>
      <li>With the light feature on or off, it&#x27;s a really nice surface mirror!</li>
      <li>I was in great need of  a standing light up mirror, but wanted something fun.</li>

      <li>I love how lightweight and sleek it is.</li>

      <li>They love this gift.</li>
      <li>At $35 it&#x27;s pricy, but it sure is exceptionally cute.</li>

      <li>Cute and beautiful little toy.</li>
      <li>and I love it very much.</li>
      <li>Fun mirror for my daughter!  </li>
      <li>It is far better than I expected, it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
      <li>when you put the batteries in, the light is so bright you can do your make up in the dark.</li>
      <li>I ordered this mirror thinking I would be able to really use it for MY make-up, but the light is way too dim.</li>
      <li>Creates a contagious  smile.</li>
      <li>It was very fun for me to give my wife such a fun and light hearted Christmas gift.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old woman and on a functional level this definitely works its bright</li>
      <li>Love the mirror - have purchased same before.  </li>
      <li>Totally a must have and my clients love it.</li>
      <li>and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
      <li>i will be coming back to by more.</li>
      <li>it came fast and not broken what so ever</li>
      <li>Other then that it&#x27;s a most have for every hellokitty lover.</li>
      <li>It is more for little girls to play dress-up and things of that sort, not so much for adults or professional make-up artist.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t give off as much light as I expected</li>
      <li>My 6 yr old grandneice is into makeup!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pure white color, too.</li>
      <li>It shipped and delivered in less time than they had originally said.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for my 8 year old granddaughter&#x27;s birthday.</li>
      <li>far too dimmer for use</li>
      <li>I have twin 5 year old daughters.</li>
      <li>i am a 26 years old with a shameless hello kitty obsession.lol.</li>
      <li>My 5 year old loves putting on her makeup, especially with her Hello Kitty</li>
      <li>It has a soft all around glow with a two-sided mirror for regular and close up.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean, but one and only warning I give you is that it is plastic and heavy duty but heavy handling could be a problem for a little girl.</li>

<li> Unfortunately the lights do not appear to be working properly....</li>
<li> I was looking for this everywhere for my secret santa and had no luck.  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t give off as much light as I expected but it&#x27;s a great product and I love it very much. It adds more cuteness to my hair and makeup station. Totally a must have and my clients love it. Creates a contagious  smile.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror thinking I would be able to really use it for MY make-up, but the light is way too dim. It is more for little girls to play dress-up and things of that sort, not so much for adults or professional make-up artist. As a toy I give it a 4 star, but I reccomend you NOT buy it if you are needing a lighted mirror for yourself.</li>
    <li> darling makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> I was in great need of  a standing light up mirror, but wanted something fun. When i came across this Hello kitty mirror i fell in love with it. So i decided to order it, when i got it in the mail I fell in even more love with it it sooo cute. Mind you i am a 26 years old with a shameless hello kitty obsession.lol. its great when you put the batteries in, the light is so bright you can do your make up in the dark. if your into hello kitty like i am you&#x27;ll love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> i love it it came fast and not broken what so ever and it lights up so bright. i love it and everyone comes in my house says it&#x27;s so cute. nice job i will be coming back to by more. Awesome seller</li>
    <li> This was a great gift for my granddaughter.  Easy on and off switch for her. I would have liked it to be a bit heavier, but it was a good deal for the price.  It shipped and delivered in less time than they had originally said.  Really pleased.</li>
    <li> While very cute, it was DOA.  The lights did not work with batteries or an AC adapter.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old woman and on a functional level this definitely works its bright and it doesn&#x27;t make your pupils to dialate on a painful level when you turn on the light. One side is a regular mirror the other is magnified. I would say 5x magnification. Also it isn&#x27;t bulky or heavy. It uses 4 AA batteries and you can buy a 6 Volt AC adaptor separately. It doesn&#x27;t come with it. It stands 11 1/2 inches, 8&amp;#34; inches diameter with the led lights at the widest and the mirror itself is 5 1/2&amp;#34; in diameter (That&#x27;s bigger than a DVD or CD or blu ray). It works great for me. Whether I&#x27;m tweezing my eyebrows, applying makeup, or fixing my hair it works for me. Oh if you&#x27;re looking for a little girl to use this; no heat comes from the lights. NOW on a girly level this thing is freaking adorable.  Yes its pink but not the neon pink so its easy on the eyes. I honestly think any girl at any age would like it. Especially if she likes hello kitty. Easy to clean, but one and only warning I give you is that it is plastic and heavy duty but heavy handling could be a problem for a little girl. Remember it is still a mirror and not made up with a foil to look like one.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, however, it states that it does not come with 4 AA batteries, which is okay.  It states a 120v AC adapter can be used but also does not come with it.</li>
    <li> Cute and beautiful little toy.</li>
    <li> Fun mirror for my daughter!  She loves playing with my make-up so I bought her her own.  Lights up nicely and is so cute!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loved it, and it&#x27;s still in her room, sitting on top of her dresser.  She hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it, so I think that counts as a good purchase!</li>
    <li> My daughter had one for a while. It did its thing and was done working. She loves the light feature as it is her nightlight. The plug is key . . . saves $ on batteries.</li>
    <li> I have twin 5 year old daughters. They love this gift. Money well spent. They play with it on a daily basis. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 8 year old granddaughter&#x27;s birthday. She loves it and I can see why. It has a soft all around glow with a two-sided mirror for regular and close up. It is far better than I expected, it&#x27;s beautiful. Her younger sister age 7 has already asked for it as a Christmas present upon seeing it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. At $35 it&#x27;s pricy, but it sure is exceptionally cute.</li>
    <li> Love the mirror - have purchased same before.  Unfortunately the lights do not appear to be working properly....far too dimmer for use so I am going to have to return it😦</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.  My 5 year old loves putting on her makeup, especially with her Hello Kitty light up mirror!</li>
    <li> I was looking for this everywhere for my secret santa and had no luck.  Till someone had mentioned to look on-line and low and behold there it was.</li>
    <li> My 6 yr old grandneice is into makeup! She freaked out over this. We put the batteries in it for her and also gave her some little girl cosmetics with it.</li>
    <li> My grandaughter simply loved the mirror for her B&#x27;day.</li>
    <li> I love it perfect size for my vanity, I just wish the lights were a bit more brighter. Other then that it&#x27;s a most have for every hellokitty lover.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my daughter. She loves Hello Kitty, so this was perfect for her. Can&#x27;t wait to give it to her.</li>
    <li> Thank you just want she wanted  She had had one for years but it had broke  so very happy girl</li>
    <li> Super cute. Niece loves it.  Great mirror too, her mother uses it for her eyebrows.  Not cheap at all</li>
    <li> It was very fun for me to give my wife such a fun and light hearted Christmas gift.  I don&#x27;t even mind that she has it on her vanity in the master bedroom</li>
    <li> With the light feature on or off, it&#x27;s a really nice surface mirror! I love how lightweight and sleek it is. The light feature is AWESOME though- so bright. It&#x27;s a pure white color, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece&#x27;s 7th birthday and she absolutely loves it!  Put in some batteries and it really lights up nicely.  Only thing I wish for this price is that it would come with an adapter; great gift though for any age!</li>
