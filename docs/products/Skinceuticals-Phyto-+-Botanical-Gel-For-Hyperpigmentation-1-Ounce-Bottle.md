      <li>Works better used twice a day, in the morning</li>
      <li>but it is not anything magical.</li>

      <li>Enjoy this product while it is still produced. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It was delivered in perfect shape and on time as expected.  </li>
      <li>Having said that, the product is nice to put on and has a fresh smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more costly than drugstore brands but worth it!  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s amazing either.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I really haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin</li>
      <li>since I enjoy being out in the sun.</li>
      <li>so far so good.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy and quick to use -</li>
      <li>I do not see any significant improvement in my skin</li>
      <li>I have significantly lightened (though not removed) the pigmentation for years.  </li>
      <li>I guess that’s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>I have yellow undertones and I&#x27;m not even fair skinned</li>
      <li>First off, if you are considering buying this..please read this description and if you are hell bent on getting it, look no further as Amazon is BY far the best way to go on this.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my mild rosacea under control too, soothing.</li>
      <li>I have brown spots on my face from when I was pregnant and nursing.</li>
      <li>Nothing was making it lighter, but this has improved it tremendously.</li>
      <li>and I have a decent amount more, so</li>
      <li>After checking with Amazon, I was happy to see that this product cost less.</li>
      <li>as I&#x27;m finding out now great for the uneven pigment that comes as a result of aging &amp; sun exposure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
      <li>I looked closely in the mirror, and most definitely its true..while being youngish..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of perfumed cosmetics, but this one I liked.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money it lasts longer then you think.</li>
      <li>+ I felt compelled to purchase right away)</li>
      <li>At first you wont see immediate results but as you use it religiously you will get amazing results.</li>
      <li>The green color isn&#x27;t pleasant either and can get on clothing and towels.</li>
      <li>she only gives the best advice, any time I rush to purchase something she ALWAYS throws me a sample first because she doesnt want me to waste money...for some reason, with the PHYTO</li>
      <li>Skinceuticals products are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, very much.</li>
      <li>though I dont believe this could work on anyone, I do realize that products and the effects of certain ingredients differ sometimes greatly from one individual to the next.  </li>
      <li>My favorite facial guy(who</li>
      <li>You just need to be consistent and patient with it.  </li>
      <li>I can sadly no longer afford)recommended this to me</li>
      <li>, so I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You need to use it consistently to see results.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and will definitely order again!</li>
      <li>and I began to see a noticeable difference within the first month.</li>
      <li>The area broke out within 24 hours of the first application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for the last year and my skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>For melasma, it is a good product to use twice a day because it is gentle; however, for sun spots or melasma, you will need to use this in combination with a stronger product (try PCA pHaze 13 Pigment Gel, HQ Free, which can&#x27;t be used everyday) to completely lighten the hyperpigmentation.  </li>
      <li>thank you so much.  </li>
      <li>Over about three to four weeks the spot has gotten much lighter.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Not so much with age spots, but it did seem to even out my complexion.  </li>
      <li>am REALLY REALLY thorough about my regimen, in that I almost never miss my morning and night skin care steps.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost through a whole bottle</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really see putting it on twice a day or any time</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m like Beyonce or Halle Berry&#x27;s skin tone) and it still shows up really green.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can pass with the \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; but every year from here on out..they will increasingly appear more like aged spots..</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>completly work is my number 3 purchase I see help so much after peeling</li>
      <li>After about 2 weeks of that, my skin tolerated the new product pretty well.</li>
      <li>and I have definitely seen significant improvements.  </li>
      <li>Funny enough I bought same product several years back, and I did see great results then.</li>
      <li>I do feel that my skin seems more radiant and dewy after the one month of use, but it hasn&#x27;t done its job in removing any of the dark pigments on my face.</li>
      <li>I have used this product every day and night w/ sunscreen for light melasma, and am almost complete with my bottle months later and have not seen any results!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally need the benzoyl peroxide pretreatment</li>
      <li>I mix about 3 drops in with my daily facial moisturizer and it&#x27;s that easy.</li>
      <li>And I live in teh sun.   </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and it hasn&#x27;t budged any of the sunspots on my face. The product&#x27;s consistency is quite thin, so I don&#x27;t quite understand the instructions when it says put a drop on the affected area. When you squeeze out a drop, its enough to put on your entire cheek. Two or three drops, and you can cover your face, so I can&#x27;t see how you can use the product to target the isolated dark marks.     Having said that, the product is nice to put on and has a fresh smell. I&#x27;m not a big fan of perfumed cosmetics, but this one I liked. I do feel that my skin seems more radiant and dewy after the one month of use, but it hasn&#x27;t done its job in removing any of the dark pigments on my face.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as expected and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product every day and night w/ sunscreen for light melasma, and am almost complete with my bottle months later and have not seen any results! NOTHING.....looks the same as when I started.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time, and it does improve my skin condition and it makes my face glow!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, I purchased it from my doctors office, at that time the product worked well. This product is nothing like the one I purchased before, which makes me think that the product was very old or fake.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial guy(who I can sadly no longer afford)recommended this to me about 7yrs ago after a facial one day for the acne I couldn&#x27;t help but pick at. My scarring is not severe but I have very light skin &amp; I swear thinking about picking my face used to cause a scar. I use this product once in the morning, before any other topicals &amp; allow it to dry which takes a minute or so, then proceed with putting on the rest of my face. I still use this product 2-3 times a week because I stopped using it a couple years ago and while the old scars did not return I began to notice uneven pigmentation on my nose &amp; cheeks which were minimized once I began using it again a couple times a week. Long story short it&#x27;s perfect for acne scarring and as I&#x27;m finding out now great for the uneven pigment that comes as a result of aging &amp; sun exposure.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work - don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;Botanical\\&quot; this is derived from, but I developed an itchy, red rash within a week or two of use. Not at all what I expected from such an expensive product. The green color isn&#x27;t pleasant either and can get on clothing and towels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that follow instructions to the T.  So for the past 6 weeks, I&#x27;ve applied this product every morning and night (without fail) to the hyperpigmentation that developed around my eyes during my pregnancy.  The result?  Nothing.  No reduction of pigmentation.  AT ALL.  None.      Don&#x27;t waste your money, gals.  Go to a dermatologist and get a prescription lightening cream.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a definite improvement in the age spots. They are not nearly as noticable especially on my face.</li>
    <li> I have some dark spots on my face and was recommended this product by my beautician. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for just about a year now and I began to see a noticeable difference within the first month. Over the months, the small specs and scars have gradually faded and the \\&quot;problem spots\\&quot; are also slowly fading. It&#x27;s no magic potion but it does what it says - which is more than I can say about most products on the market. I mix about 3 drops in with my daily facial moisturizer and it&#x27;s that easy. No sticky residue, no odor, no stinging/burning. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I used this product 4 years ago, and the other month I remembered how effective it is for hydrating skin and keeping redness down. Enjoy this product while it is still produced. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over the years.  My hair is brown and I tan very easily.  I have brown spots on my face from when I was pregnant and nursing. And I live in teh sun.   This tiny bottle will last you 2-3 years.  It does lighten the spot to your natural skin color, stick with it, and put directly on the spots 1-2 times a day.  I&#x27;d reccomend it!!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist gave a sample that didn&#x27;t seem to work on pigmentation. On a follow-up visit I mentioned that I was not seeing any lightening of age/sun spots. She said that this product is very natural and gentle so it would take longer than usual harsher methods of skin lightening. So, I purchased a 1-oz bottle from her office at a cost of $80.00. After checking with Amazon, I was happy to see that this product cost less. I agree that it does take a lot longer to get results and finally see some pigmentation lightening. I&#x27;m glad I continued using with this product. As a suggestion, perhaps the vendor can extend a discount for multiple orders at one time.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> for better results BUT, maybe I need to be patient.  I do see an improvement though -- it does work -- just wish it worked faster.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  I tried it first when it was recommended after a facial.  I am hispanic and have a few sun spots (dark spots), on my face and as I age (I am in my mid 40&#x27;s), I am seeing more discoloration appear.  I noticed within a couple weeks, that some dark areas were fading, and some went away altogether.  After the first bottle I didn&#x27;t buy another one and the dark areas came back.  So I bought it again and have been using it each night.  Once again, I can see the spots fading so I am sold on this.  It&#x27;s easy and quick to use - so why not?</li>
    <li> This product have lighten my age spot and I&#x27;m only half way through the bottle. Totally recommend this and it&#x27;s natural too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Lightening up the age spots after only two weeks.  Product is green, so be careful if you are very light skinned.  Can actually make your skin green tinged.  Skinceuticals is a wonderful line.</li>
    <li> I wanted the ingredients to work so badly and I was well informed on the botanical and chemical ingredients. Unfortunatly, there were no results-not even minimal ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the last year and my skin has never looked better. 1 bottle usually lasts 3-4 months with everyday/ everynight use. It&#x27;s more costly than drugstore brands but worth it!  Fades acne scars and brown spots caused by birthcontrol and hormones. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this together with a peel. This has diminish my brown patches in my face. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I can tell that it works a little bit but it is not anything magical. I am not sure if I&#x27;d spend $50 to replace it when it&#x27;s out.</li>
    <li> I ve been using phyto for a year and half now and it really has lightened my pigmentations! It also brightened and even out my skin tones. I use it twice or three times a day after I cleanse and apply cerave am with spf in the morning and cerave pm at night. On weekends when I m home I would apply three times a day followed by cerave am. This phyto really works as long as you stick to your routine religiously. At first you wont see immediate results but as you use it religiously you will get amazing results. Be patient, give it time and ALWAYS apply sun block after and wear a hat visor when in the sun. I am now on my second bottle and one bottle 32 fl. oz last awhile. Thank you SkinCeutical for a GREAT product that really does work!</li>
    <li> moisturize well, but did not see much difference on my skin, does feel a little bit brighter, but my dark spots are still not going anywhere. not really worth the money</li>
    <li> I use a variety of Skinceuticals products.  This product&lt;br /&gt;is among them.  Skinceuticals products are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, very much.</li>
    <li> My friend told me this worked for her brown age spots.  Not for me.  Used the entire bottle twice a day everyday with sunscreen and saw no difference in my spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product  for months now and I have definitely seen significant improvements.  My hyper pigmentations have faded.  You just need to be consistent and patient with it.  It&#x27;s now part of my daily skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it on an approximately 3/8-inch spot that&#x27;s not very dark. It has lightened some, but here are a few things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The area broke out within 24 hours of the first application. I let it calm down for a couple days, then started applying a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream about 5 minutes before Skinceuticals. After about 2 weeks of that, my skin tolerated the new product pretty well. I don&#x27;t normally need the benzoyl peroxide pretreatment now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I read a research article that suggested excessive application of arbutin (this product&#x27;s main active ingredient) could worsen hyperpigmentation (though others claim it doesn&#x27;t). Since then I&#x27;ve used it sparingly, and the results seem better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It takes time for your skin to turn over, so don&#x27;t expect results in a few days or weeks: think months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Hyperpigmentation is difficult to treat. Elimination is probably an unrealistic expectation for any over-the-counter option.</li>
    <li> For my skin this product worked better than Mela D from La Roche Posay! I have spots on my face that now became more lighter.</li>
    <li> Love Skinceuticals products.  This is a great product for hyperpigmentation and redness.  Keeps my mild rosacea under control too, soothing.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and find it works for my dark areas on my face.  Takes time.  But if you make it part of your daily regime, over time they fade away.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician recommended this after my last facial.  This stuff works!  Almost instantly I began to see lightening of my dark spots.  They gradually disappear more each day.  I even used it on dark spots over my body in addition to my face, so far so good.  I will definitely use this instead of my old bleaching creams.</li>
    <li> completly work is my number 3 purchase I see help so much after peeling but I think are great if they send some samples for make more happy they already happy costumers , great product , come on time too</li>
    <li> I started taking my skin seriously about a year ago. This Phyto gel for hypermigmentation has just about taken all my freckles away. My hands had freckles too. My hands are undercontrol and the spots are barely noticeable. I always check the hands on the suspected face lift people, the hands comfirm the age. I am so glad I found Phyto!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years. I don&#x27;t know if it works. I feel my brown spots have lightened.It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
    <li> So I have a wonderful pharmacy that I like to support as the lady that works in the skin care department us so helpful is guiding me on products, they carry skinceuticals..and though I already had used the serum, toner and retinol .5, and 1.0..I always like to see what else I may need.  First off, if you are considering buying this..please read this description and if you are hell bent on getting it, look no further as Amazon is BY far the best way to go on this.  I spent 80.00 on my bottle.  Some stats, I am 32 years old, take incredible care of my skin and my skin looks better then girls under 23..I am half korean, so the asian gene helps, but I am obsessive about exfoliation, both chemical and manual and moisturizing, I have more dry skin then oily..but its closer to normal, my skin is not sensitive, though for unknown reasons there are some products that burn on occasion, using over the counter products contributes to this problem more.  skinceuticals is extremely well made...you get what you pay for, that is my experience... So about PHYTO +:&lt;br /&gt;I waited to consult with the skinceuticals expert and asked, \\&quot;what else could I do to boost my regimen?\\&quot;  She responded swiftly and explained how my freckles are actually age spots and because I am still in my 30s, I should work on removing them while my skin still naturally regenerates itself.  I looked closely in the mirror, and most definitely its true..while being youngish..I can pass with the \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; but every year from here on out..they will increasingly appear more like aged spots..so I asked what to do....She explained that she had an awful age spot on the part of her nose which sticks the most out..she explained her age spot size (by the way, I know her quite well..she only gives the best advice, any time I rush to purchase something she ALWAYS throws me a sample first because she doesnt want me to waste money...for some reason, with the PHYTO + I felt compelled to purchase right away) and I saw, it was practically invisible.  When she pointed it out, I could even tell that it maybe once was a darker spot, but I would have never noticed it unless she pointed it out..She explained that it did take two years of repeated two times daily usage to receive the benefits of permanent lightening, but that she swore by it.  She did remind me that I have to be patient, which of course I am happy to be patient for something that may eventually work.&lt;br /&gt;I am REALLY REALLY thorough about my regimen, in that I almost never miss my morning and night skin care steps.  Since I first purchased this, I have missed a total of four applications..its been about 4 months, if not 5 months.  There is no excuse for why this has ZERO hyperpigmentation effects on me.  After I purchased this, I checked online reviews and assumed the negative reviews came from folks that dont actually wash, tone, correct, and moisturize every day twice a day, and I can tell you honestly that the negative reviews come from it simply not having any lightening effects at all.  I used this like a spot treatment and to ensure that I actually see results I photographed some age spots on my face pre use, and checked out my photograph today.  ZERO ZERO nada nada.  I will continue to spot treat a few spots, because why not..I did get the recommendation that it would take a couple years and I have a decent amount more, so if anything changes, I will update this review..I can tell you that I feel like it probably wont.  THere should be the slightest color change even if its 10 percent lighter..considering my trusty skinceuticals stated clearly that it took her two years, I am nearly a quarter of the way there, and well I think I said enough.&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave this 3 start instead of zero stars is because it actually is good, well, REALLY GOOD for something else.  I had read a review about this product stating that it is great for post popping of zits.  It takes the red out.  I will go further and say that I noticed that around where I have this hormonal zits, my pore size decreased.  I get a few zits once a month and always in the same area.  This actually improved the affected area.&lt;br /&gt;I am now on the hunt to try something else out..I do want to add that though I dont believe this could work on anyone, I do realize that products and the effects of certain ingredients differ sometimes greatly from one individual to the next.  To be safe though I recommend to keep looking on.</li>
    <li> I bought tons of products to get rid of sun damage. It will take tons of patience and consistency to see some results. I used the whole bottle on small areas and unfortunately I do not see much change. Funny enough I bought same product several years back, and I did see great results then. What happened ?</li>
    <li> To be honest, I really haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s horrible because it doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse. I do not see any significant improvement in my skin so I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s amazing either. Just neutral.. :\</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the greatest product I use the whole line. It&#x27;s worth the money it lasts longer then you think. Buy</li>
    <li> I love the texture and consistency of this serum and saw a DRAMATIC improvement in my acne scars.  Not so much with age spots, but it did seem to even out my complexion.  It was delivered in perfect shape and on time as expected.  I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best skin product I have ever used. Lite on the skin. Soaks in immediately, does not leave skin oily. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it only for a week or so and the melasma mustache I&#x27;ve been sporting since the end of my pregnancy is now about 1/2 gone, so I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside so far is that this stuff is green tinted.  I only apply it to the upper lip, so it gives me a green mustache.  I can&#x27;t really see putting it on twice a day or any time you might later be out in public.  I&#x27;m thinking I will have to switch to applying it only at night.  I have yellow undertones and I&#x27;m not even fair skinned (I&#x27;m like Beyonce or Halle Berry&#x27;s skin tone) and it still shows up really green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll keep using it - I prefer having a green &#x27;stache part-time to a pigment &#x27;stache full-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 12/12/13:  I stopped using this for a month or two, maybe out of laziness, maybe just thinking the melasma went away on its own -- then the dark upper lip came back.  I starting re-applying for about a week and the dark upper light has lightened up again.  Thank goodness!!  I still wish the stuff wasn&#x27;t green, but I only use it at night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals  Phyto + Botanical Gel For Hyperpigmentation is great.  I use it with my face sun block to minimize the sun rays since I enjoy being out in the sun.</li>
    <li> not sure it does anything . . .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great I really recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost through a whole bottle and I use it morning and night, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done anything to any of my spots on my fair skin. I may go back to hydroquinone</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on hyperpigmentation.  You need to use it consistently to see results.  Love this product and will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I have had a sunspot on my cheek for a while. Nothing was making it lighter, but this has improved it tremendously. Works better used twice a day, in the morning I rub it in so I don&#x27;t look green, the put a dab of sunblock over it.  At night i just use the dropper and let it soak in.  Over about three to four weeks the spot has gotten much lighter. I was skeptical at first but am glad I tried it.  It totally eliminated spots two friends of mine had on their faces so I hope it keeps working.</li>
    <li> Gave this to mom and she seems pretty happy about it, so I guess that’s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> i will continue looking for great deals.  Price was great.  thank you so much.  You will see me again. thanks</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin with freckling and moderate melasma.  I have significantly lightened (though not removed) the pigmentation for years.  It is an ongoing maintenance process; not something you do once and then never have to do again.  This product claims to \\&quot;break up hyperpigmentation\\&quot;, and it does just that.  For melasma, it is a good product to use twice a day because it is gentle; however, for sun spots or melasma, you will need to use this in combination with a stronger product (try PCA pHaze 13 Pigment Gel, HQ Free, which can&#x27;t be used everyday) to completely lighten the hyperpigmentation.  This product will break up the pigmentation into smaller, lighter spots, and then you can use another product one week a month or so to lighten the spots.  Of course, be sure to use at least SPF30 sunscreen EVERY DAY because even 15 minutes of sun can bring the pigmentation back right away when you have these conditions.</li>
    <li> Excellent product which keeps skin hydrated and covers redness.</li>
    <li> it doesnt smell good. but this stuff works!</li>
    <li> I just recently started to use this product, I apply it twice a day as recommended and have not seen any changes. I will continue to use it until I run out. It applies nice, no smells and absorbs nice into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;No recommendations yet....</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic effect so far but haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  Non-drying with antiseptic properties.  Time will tell.</li>
