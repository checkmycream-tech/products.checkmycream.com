<li> They do not last long enough in your mouth!</li>

<li> These lozenges do what they&#x27;re supposed to do; they last long while you&#x27;re sleeping, too.  </li>
<li> They do the job, but do not last long after gone!</li>

<li> Very dry mouth.</li>
<li> When I started having dry mouth due to all the medications I was taking, I saw the Act ad and went looking for the rinse and tooth paste.</li>

    <li> The lozenges are too small. They do not last long enough in your mouth!</li>
    <li> I take meds that make me extremely dry, these help me alot.  Never leave the house without some in my purse.  Helps that dry tickle in my throat, especially if I have no water.  My second time ordering them</li>
    <li> These are the best when you suffer from dry mouth. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them !!</li>
    <li> Absolutely solved my &amp;#34;dry mouth at night&amp;#34; problem.  I just keep them on the bed-stand dresser, and suck on one when I wake up during the night.  Now, I don&#x27;t wake BECASUE of a dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Keeps mouth moistened all night.</li>
    <li> Great! But don&#x27;t eat too many!&lt;br /&gt;🐘💨💨</li>
    <li> Truly helps the dry mouth!</li>
    <li> Dry mouth is an issue for many people due to the medications they are taking.  About ten months ago, I encountered this problem when my doctor prescribed a medicine with dry mouth listed as one of the side effects.  It isn&#x27;t a major problem by any means, but it is annoying since I feel like a could spit cotton plus it leaves a bad taste in my mouth which I assume also leads to bad breath.  My doctor suggested lemon drops or taking lots of sips of water, but I wasn&#x27;t particularly thrilled with either of those options.  I saw these on the store shelf (located with the mouth washes) and thought I might as well give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find these did make a difference.  The taste is pleasant and not terribly strong plus my mouth seems to be less dry after using this.  I will say that sometimes I end up using two or three before I notice a lot of relief but then the problem seems to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are having issues with dry mouth, I would recommend these.  I did try another brand which is less expensive and they worked fairly well but these were still the better alternative.</li>
    <li> BEST LOZENGES FOR &amp;#34;MEDICATION-INDUCED DRY MOUTH!!&amp;#34; I finally hit the jackpot when I discovered these lozenges! Love them. They taste good too! These are perfection if you have a severely dry mouth from medications.  I take pain meds and my mouth is so dry that I had to brush my teeth to frequently and drink water every few minutes due to a painfully dry mouth. Of course it is important to drink water, but not the amount of water I consumed! I used to drink so much water that I wound up with a dangerous condition caused &amp;#34;hyponatremia&amp;#34; meaning low salt in my blood due to the abundance of water I used to consume for my dry mouth. I am not making medical claims, but just stating what happened to me. My plethora of anti-cholinergic drugs for pain led to a dry moth theta was intolerable until I discovered these dry mouth drops. I tried others in the past (such as &amp;#34;Biotene&amp;#34; or Xylitol&amp;#34;) which my father who is a dentist had given me;but I did not care for those two brands.THEN I DISCOVERED THESE  BY ACT WHICH WORK WELL &amp; TASTE GREAT!  I also added the ACT dry mouth tooth paste and mouth wash to go with my regimen to treat medication -induced dry mouth- and the dryness has greatly improved!! Yes, the toothpaste is expensive, but it is worth it to help treat this problem.  A dry mouth causes cavities indirectly since lack of saliva in the mouth leads to increased bacteria, which can lead to tooth decay. LASTLY: I noticed a couple of reviewers stated they &amp;#34;SLEEP&amp;#34; with these in the mouth. Although I would love to do so as well to prevent such mouth dryness that wakes me from sleep, it is UNSAFE to sleep with a lozenge in the mouth- in case it slips down and blocks the airway! Please try these!! BUT do not purposely sleep with them for safety reasons. FOR THOSE WITH A MODERATE TO SEVRE DRY MOUTH, PLEASE TRY THESE!!</li>
    <li> I love these! They are a good size but not too big so they don&#x27;t dissolve too fast. I keep a strip in my pocket and/or purse at all time, handy for the first sign of dry mouth. I pop one in my mouth as I am getting comfortable in bed at night and generally wake up in the morning with my mouth closed and not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great in combination with the tooth paste and mouth rinse in the Act product line! That dry mouth problem is bad for your teeth so I make sure I follow the directions to the tee. My dentist recommended Act as the best mouth rinse way back. (He ok&#x27;d the toothpaste as it had the right level of fluoride.) When I started having dry mouth due to all the medications I was taking, I saw the Act ad and went looking for the rinse and tooth paste. (I&#x27;d tried another brand that had no effect.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lozenges, like the Act rinse, are minty but not overly strong. The lozenges my husband found in the grocery store are about half the size but stronger and ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t give up. Like I almost did. Try Act&#x27;s trio and see if by the end of a week your problem, like mine, isn&#x27;t resolved!</li>
    <li> This is the only non-prescription med that takes care of my husband&#x27;s dry mouth!  He takes Clonidine and ACT takes care of him!</li>
    <li> These lozenges do what they&#x27;re supposed to do; they last long while you&#x27;re sleeping, too.  I&#x27;ve tried similar products, but these are the best.  Yes, they&#x27;re pricey, but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these in bulk at least 3 times through Amazon. I can&#x27;t find them in any store yet. I mostly need them at night (medications I take give me terrible dry mouth). I love that they have Xylitol and not sugar or other weird sugar substitute. These taste great and do the trick (even better than Biotene!)</li>
    <li> I have dry mouth, this is what I use at night to keep my mouth moist.  I purchase it often.</li>
    <li> I see no better results from these lozenges than Altoids or any much cheaper lozenge.  I will not waste my money on another purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> I am a sleeper who finds himself sleeping with his mouth open each night, resulting in a very dry mouth during the night.  So much so, I am awakened due to this problem.  The only Dry Mouth Lozenges I enjoy!  I have tried others, but the taste is not as good as this product.  Does not have a chemical or medicine after taste.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Xylimelts as the best Lozenge for dry mouth until I tried these.  They are, of course, more expensive!  They are larger in size.  I still use  Xylimelts during the daytime as they&#x27;re small enough to be discreet.  The Act Dry Mouth Lozenges are large, which is actually beneficial while sleeping.  It lasts longer, keeps the inside of my mouth moist, but not sticky.  I liked these so much, I purchased a dozen packages (two 6-packs of 18 lozenges per pack).  I&#x27;m inclined to purchase more as they&#x27;re not easy to find anywhere else but online.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dentist to do more to alleviate my dry mouth in order to prevent tooth decay. Many dry mouth products are either gross (oramoist) or horrid (therabreath). These have a pleasant flavor, last a good while, and have no after taste!</li>
    <li> I have had an exxtremely dry mouth - so bad that it gets very sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have litteraly tried everything and nothing has worked better than Act Dry Mouth lozenges.  If you have a dry mouth, try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen P.  AZ</li>
    <li> best dry mouth lozenge I have found</li>
    <li> These are so much better than a competitor who shall remain nameless.  They are bigger, smoother and the taste is much better too.</li>
    <li> Good, helps with dryness.</li>
    <li> Good price for same product you would get in the drugstore, will buy them again.  Gene</li>
    <li> They do the job, but do not last long after gone!</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with these dentist &amp;#34;vetted&amp;#34; lozenges.  I already have ordered the next batch!</li>
    <li> I have to use up to five or six in one night .  Very dry mouth.</li>
    <li> My mother swears by these!  They really work!</li>
    <li> I use this for dry mouth especially with a CPAP.  It seems to help but is far from perfect.  Still is the best I have found for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I usually use them when I got to bed. I like them very much</li>
    <li> I stick one under my tongue and go to sleep.  It lasts an entire night and works to keep my mouth from drying out.</li>
    <li> All my meds leave my mouth totally without saliva...this stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> I am generally satisfied but I had requested that the &amp;#34;Act&amp;#34; total care item be shipped to my U.S. Address not to the Puerto Rico address as were the dolls.</li>
    <li> Helps with dry mouth, due to medication.</li>
    <li> My mouth was very dry because of allergy pills during this awful allergy season.  I saw these, tried them and they work enough to get me trough lectures I have to give and classes I have to teach! Great flavor also!</li>
    <li> TRIED MANY THINGS FOR MY DRY MOUTH,  THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST.</li>
    <li> These are the best for night-time dry mouth. My dentist introduced us to these and they work for both my husband and myself.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dentist. I&#x27;m a senior citizen living on a &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; income and Amazon price beat Wal-Marts price.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist who suffers from dry mouth, I love the taste and it really works well! I always recommend these to my patients. They also contain xylitol which kill cavity causing bacteria that dry mouths are very susceptible to. We see a lot of root cavities in those with dry mouths that use losenges that contain sugar, very bad combo but this one is the perfect combo.</li>
