    <li> Product does not stand upright as shown in picture and as a result, its hard to find things inside when the product is in my purse. I wouldn&#x27;t order it again, it&#x27;s ok, not great.</li>
    <li> Bought this to keep a &amp;#34;baby go pack&amp;#34; ready to throw in my purse.  I stock it with a couple of diapers, wipes. snacks, drink, small toy, etc and grab it if I&#x27;m going out with the baby and don&#x27;t want to carry a full/separate diaper bag.  I refill it when we&#x27;re back home so it&#x27;s ready to go for the next time.  Love not toting all of those things around in my purse when I don&#x27;t need them.</li>
    <li> Too flimsy and will not stand up in my purse.</li>
    <li> Good size for me, really helps me find my various stuff organized into the pockets. One of the side zippers stuck badly when I first got it, but have worked it back and forth and now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to be bigger, to use for a large diaper bag. will use it, but not as intended.</li>
    <li> I like this thing a lot. Lots of compartments and you fit everything you could find a woman&#x27;s purse all in one place. Definitely keeps you organized.</li>
    <li> Zippered pockets are padded.  Handle was not sewn on properly and I had to resew, no biggie.</li>
    <li> I plan to use this for two functions- cosmetic travelling bag and large purse organizer.  Lots of nucks and crannies to put stuff.</li>
    <li> bought for a sister.  she is in love with this item.  Uses it ALL the time in every purse.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> bThis did meet my expectations and has really helped organize my summer tote bag. I like the handles which allows me to pull the entire bag out to go into a differerent tote.  The only reason for 4 stars is I would have liked the handles to be a bright pink or yellow for visibility and I would like the middle section to have solid sides. The flexibility makes papers, note books, calendars etc., bend and lose shape.  It is very well made and a good size for the price.</li>
    <li> great number and size of pockets.  deducted a star because the zippers seem cheap and are hard to use -- I just keep them open and use the pockets open.</li>
    <li> Great product and price!  However material/stitching is on the thin side.  But otherwise it does the job!</li>
    <li> Arrive on time,I got this organizer for a purse that has a soft bottom, best job keeping me organized I would definitely recommend ,excellent price and the color goes with any of my black and light color purses very happy with it.</li>
    <li> A great gift for any lady with a handbag bigger than a small clutch.</li>
    <li> Its a little too thick, but still works well.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, roomy, convenient. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Fabric isn&#x27;t too sturdy. Strap broke on second day. Won&#x27;t stand up on its own. Not good for a thirtyone tote. It&#x27;s getting the job done until I can find one that&#x27;s up for the job.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this bag! I use it as a travel bag for makeup and not as a purse insert. I purchased it for makeup because of how many pockets it has. It&#x27;s really roomy. The main pocket in the middle doesn&#x27;t have a zipper (because this is made to fit in your purse) and I wish it did, but everything else is great and it&#x27;s plenty of room for everything I need! There are two zipper pockets on either side of the middle, and then multiple pockets on the outsides.</li>
    <li> ugly colors, drab, for my beautiful Brahmin Hobo bag. Small pockets that you have to pull the ugly thing out just to see where you put things.  Not thrilled at all</li>
    <li> Perfect size with just the right amount of pockets.</li>
    <li> This holds quite a few items. The material does not hold up well.</li>
    <li> Zipper separated from pouch first day.</li>
    <li> very small and does not fit in a bag that is separated by a middle divider</li>
