### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t, however, follow the directions for the best results and blow-dry my hair to heat it before I washed it out.</li>
      <li>...it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is just incredible.</li>
      <li>My decision to purchase this was based on the great reviews here.  </li>
      <li>but use at your own risk!</li>
      <li>Well worth the effort!!!!</li>
      <li>Good ingredients include panthenol and any variation of that word.</li>
      <li>After using the product, I was very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I continue to use good salon products sometimes, but I&#x27;m always on the hunt for options which are more affordable while delivering good performance.     </li>
      <li>It showed me an excellent result from the first time I used.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, an I love the way it smells!</li>
      <li>Thanks for reading and good luck!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair (but a lot of it!)</li>
      <li>It is very cheap for a weekly treatment for the hair.</li>
      <li>the heating part is VERY important as it helps it to bond to the hair.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>and this is the best deep conditioner I have found yet.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>so just follow the entire directions and you, two, can be as happy as I!</li>
      <li>My latest find is the sulfate-free EverPure line by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>you might need to purchase more than one.</li>
      <li>And even if you try this and aren&#x27;t completely satisfied, the smell alone was luxurious</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
      <li>I took most of it but not all on the rinsing process.</li>
      <li>I showered before I applied it, and I put on a plastic cap and heated it for 10 minutes and sat for 10 more minutes.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s the best remedy for my frizzy and dry hair out of everything I used before.   </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle product, but it&#x27;s pretty damn good for $1.50 at Walgreens.</li>
      <li>but, like I said, so worth the price!!</li>
      <li>Some others that have good ingredients are some of the more intense pantene pro-v leave in conditioners and the Suave keratin serum.</li>
      <li>I was very please with this product and even now cannot help but run my fingers through my hair and sniff in the amazing smells of this fabulous hair product!   </li>
      <li>However, at 2-4$ a treatment (depending on where you buy it), it gets fairly pricey pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend it to anyone with my hair type (fine, color-treated).</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit overpowering, but it&#x27;s fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Look out for dimethicone, that&#x27;s a signal that the product is cheaply formulated.</li>
      <li>I had used the Henna/Placenta pack several years ago and it was great, so i decided to try it for this problem.</li>
      <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t been this lush and gorgeous since I was a teenager.</li>
      <li>You really do need to use the entire package for the best results</li>
      <li>This stuff is AMAZING - makes your hair soft &amp; oh-so-shiny!!</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this product.  </li>
      <li>It was like my hands were sliding right off of it!  </li>
      <li>It smells sickly sweet, though.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is not a bad product, but I did not notice any differences in my hair after using it.</li>
      <li>I had heard so many great things, and I was really excited to find a product that was all natural, using wholesome ingredients like placenta and henna instead of all those chemicals in other conditioners.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Results: My hair looks pretty much exactly the same as before, but it feels really nice!</li>
      <li>Now that I have natural hair, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see what it does.</li>
      <li>The package was very large, and it could probably be used twice.</li>
      <li>The more I use it, the better my hair gets - it even seems to be growing faster, though it may just be breaking less.  </li>
      <li>My hair has been through the ringer (bleached, dyed, dyed, dyed), and is now much smoother and far more manageable than it has been for months.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>Glad I went back to this!!!!</li>
      <li>Henna, aside from it&#x27;s dying qualities, is known to strengthen hair, because it \\&quot;fills in the gaps\\&quot; between hair&#x27;s protein; so I&#x27;m hoping it will do just as great of a job with natural, afro-textured, tightly coiled hair.</li>
      <li>Buy a few and use them for those special occasions when you really want your hair to look amazing.</li>
      <li>I am considering putting the product in my hair while it is dry and flat-ironing it to see if that makes my hair absorb even more of the product - let me know if you have tried this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair feels not only clean and light, but incredibly soft and luxurious.    </li>
      <li>The price was reasonable at my local drugstore, so I thought I&#x27;d try this out as a special treat for my hair, which is in good condition but has a few split ends.     </li>
      <li>Unfortunately I am very dissappointed in this product.  </li>
      <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t want to use the entire contents of the packet as my hair is medium length  and thought it would be too much, but I ended up using the entire package anyway and was happy enough...</li>
      <li>I bought this very inexpensively at Wal-Mart.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, very frizzy hair</li>
      <li>This was a problem for me the whole rest of the day.  </li>
      <li>Just noticed that the color of dyed hair fades much faster.</li>
      <li>really obsessed with hair product ingredients which is how I found this product - I heard proteins work and wanted to find the most effective product.</li>
      <li>FIXED me right up.</li>
      <li>if you have long hair (I&#x27;m a guy, so one packet is more than enough)</li>
      <li>- I take a long soak in the bath &amp; read a magazine while it&#x27;s on my hair - good excuse for a quiet half-hour of \\&quot;me\\&quot; time.</li>
      <li>I can feel it when my hair needs to be treated, it gets sort of angry at me and tangles more easily.</li>
      <li>The day after, it&#x27;s more manageable and tame.  </li>
      <li>But still, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a healthy looking hair.</li>
      <li>I have very long 2c curls with fine strawberry blonde hair.</li>
      <li>I had my doubts at first; my hair is so thick it seemed like one package wouldn&#x27;t cut it, and it didn&#x27;t feel particularly smooth as I was rinsing it.</li>
      <li>Over the last year, I&#x27;ve been using their original body-building shampoos &amp; conditioners, which help my red hair color last longer and really give my locks shine and body.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a million different hair products, and this product has been the only thing that&#x27;s been able to salvage my dry (chemically-damaged) hair.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions on the packet, applying the entire thing to my head after I shampooed it (with my regular store-bought shampoo) and toweled it dry, and massaged it in, then used a blow dryer to warm it for several minutes.</li>
      <li>You really should use the entire packet as well - which</li>
      <li>I used a heat pad over my head in order to boost the conditioning action.</li>
      <li>I tried washing it out with a regular shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t really do the trick.  </li>
      <li>I used a shampoo that destroyed my hair and left my scalp dry and full of sores.</li>
      <li>My hair feels better to touch after using this product, and it lasts for several washes (unlike other deep conditioners which only last one wash).</li>
      <li>I would recommend this treatment for frizzy, lifeless, and dry hair in particular.</li>
      <li>When I tried to wash it out, I could barely even touch my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a few other products and read the ingredients carefully on a lot of their products and this particular version seems to have the most proteins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little damaged, and using this just once left my hair extremely silky and it feels extremely healthy.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes after reading reviews for this product, but it did not live up to my expectations.</li>
      <li>I should mention that I&#x27;ve been lucky to always have healthy hair, so depending on how badly damaged yours is (or if you use a lot of styling products/curling irons/etc) your mileage may vary.</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and full of body when I use this, unlike other conditioners that leave it weighed down or oily.</li>
      <li>Living in Florida&#x27;s heat and humidity with extremely long and thick wavy hair, I am forever on a crusade to find an affordable solution for smooth, soft hair.</li>
      <li>Results were disappointing; I used the Placenta treatment twice in the last couple of weeks and it rendered my fine and somewhat thick hair noticeably duller, thinner, flyaway, and more lifeless when compared to the results of my normal wash and condition routine.      </li>
      <li>But I used my blow dryer to dry it afterwards and was genuinely surprised at the results.</li>

<li> I couldn&#x27;t dry my hair with a towel because it kept sliding off.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Fourth, i highly recommend buying a thick durable shower cap to trap the heat in while the conditioner is working on your hair.</li>
<li> , so consider that using this on your hair is about the dollar equivalent of using half an entire bottle of, say, Pantene conditioner on your hair in one go.</li>
<li> Finally, after a few days my hair started to be manageable again.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Third, you only need to use this every few months.</li>
<li> My hair is naturally curly/wavy, and it&#x27;s a few inches past my shoulders.</li>

    <li> Living in Florida&#x27;s heat and humidity with extremely long and thick wavy hair, I am forever on a crusade to find an affordable solution for smooth, soft hair. Don&#x27;t let the name for this product scare you off; it&#x27;s just a soft, white liquid that feels (and smells) quite a bit like watered down generic lotion. I followed the directions on the packet, applying the entire thing to my head after I shampooed it (with my regular store-bought shampoo) and toweled it dry, and massaged it in, then used a blow dryer to warm it for several minutes. Then I hopped back into the shower to rinse it off. I had my doubts at first; my hair is so thick it seemed like one package wouldn&#x27;t cut it, and it didn&#x27;t feel particularly smooth as I was rinsing it. But I used my blow dryer to dry it afterwards and was genuinely surprised at the results. My hair feels not only clean and light, but incredibly soft and luxurious.    I should mention that I&#x27;ve been lucky to always have healthy hair, so depending on how badly damaged yours is (or if you use a lot of styling products/curling irons/etc) your mileage may vary. If you have seriously damaged hair, don&#x27;t expect miracles with this. There are some things that only a professional hair treatment can cure, and it would be unfair to expect this little product to bring zombified strands back from the dead.    However, at 2-4$ a treatment (depending on where you buy it), it gets fairly pricey pretty quickly. You really do need to use the entire package for the best results, so consider that using this on your hair is about the dollar equivalent of using half an entire bottle of, say, Pantene conditioner on your hair in one go. I&#x27;m not saying not to buy them, but if you plan on using them every time you wash your hair, you&#x27;re going to lose a lot of cash in the long run. My advice? Buy a few and use them for those special occasions when you really want your hair to look amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s the best remedy for my frizzy and dry hair out of everything I used before.   Just noticed that the color of dyed hair fades much faster. But still, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a healthy looking hair.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product.  I had heard so many great things, and I was really excited to find a product that was all natural, using wholesome ingredients like placenta and henna instead of all those chemicals in other conditioners.  I tried it after using some placenta shampoo and let the conditioner sit in my hair for five minutes.  When I tried to wash it out, I could barely even touch my hair.  It was like my hands were sliding right off of it!  So I just stood under the shower for another 10 minutes and got out.    This was a problem for me the whole rest of the day.  I couldn&#x27;t dry my hair with a towel because it kept sliding off.  I tried to put my hair up but I couldn&#x27;t even grip it with my hands.  My hair was like wriggly worms made out of silk.  It kept hitting me in the face and sliding all around my face!   Even when I tried to go to bed, I kept sliding off of my pillow.  It was really frustrating.  I finally just hung my head off the side of the bed.    I tried washing it out with a regular shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t really do the trick.  I think it might have just slid off my head too.  Finally, after a few days my hair started to be manageable again.  I&#x27;ll never use this product again! It works- but use at your own risk!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I am very dissappointed in this product.  My decision to purchase this was based on the great reviews here.  I have fine hair (but a lot of it!) and this made it feel like straw!  My regular conditioner makes my  hair shiny and silky - this product is awful! I would not recommend it to anyone with my hair type (fine, color-treated).</li>
    <li> I would recommend this treatment for frizzy, lifeless, and dry hair in particular. It showed me an excellent result from the first time I used. I used a blowdryer to dry the product on my hair before rinsing. I took most of it but not all on the rinsing process. I&#x27;ve air dried my hair after treatment.     I have medium tight curls with breakage so I know that this product did well on my hair. It is very cheap for a weekly treatment for the hair.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feeling silky and looking shinny. It left my hair smelling like cotton candy! I have heat and color damaged hair, and this product softed my split ends. It left my hair looking fuller, too. I want to buy the larger bottle now!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have very curly, very frizzy hair and this is the best deep conditioner I have found yet.  One treatment of this and my hair felt stronger, almost like each strand was thicker, but not weighed down.  The more I use it, the better my hair gets - it even seems to be growing faster, though it may just be breaking less.  I try to use it once a week - I take a long soak in the bath &amp; read a magazine while it&#x27;s on my hair - good excuse for a quiet half-hour of \\&quot;me\\&quot; time. :)  My hair is less frizzy, softer, tangles less and looks neater than before I started using it.</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable at my local drugstore, so I thought I&#x27;d try this out as a special treat for my hair, which is in good condition but has a few split ends.     Results were disappointing; I used the Placenta treatment twice in the last couple of weeks and it rendered my fine and somewhat thick hair noticeably duller, thinner, flyaway, and more lifeless when compared to the results of my normal wash and condition routine.      I continue to use good salon products sometimes, but I&#x27;m always on the hunt for options which are more affordable while delivering good performance.     My latest find is the sulfate-free EverPure line by L&#x27;Oreal. Over the last year, I&#x27;ve been using their original body-building shampoos &amp; conditioners, which help my red hair color last longer and really give my locks shine and body. (Guess it makes sense to try their deep conditioner, now!)</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that tends to be on the frizzy/poofy side the day i take my shower.The day after, it&#x27;s more manageable and tame.  After using the product, I was very pleased with the results. I didn&#x27;t, however, follow the directions for the best results and blow-dry my hair to heat it before I washed it out. I plan on trying that next time. Yes, I will definitely be using this again! Once a week (if that) is plenty use enough. And even if you try this and aren&#x27;t completely satisfied, the smell alone was luxurious a smelled like an expensive salon product. As stated in another customer review, do not let the name of the product and the origin of it&#x27;s ingredients dissuade you. I was very please with this product and even now cannot help but run my fingers through my hair and sniff in the amazing smells of this fabulous hair product!   Also, I didn&#x27;t want to use the entire contents of the packet as my hair is medium length  and thought it would be too much, but I ended up using the entire package anyway and was happy enough...so just follow the entire directions and you, two, can be as happy as I!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle product, but it&#x27;s pretty damn good for $1.50 at Walgreens. My hair has been through the ringer (bleached, dyed, dyed, dyed), and is now much smoother and far more manageable than it has been for months. It&#x27;s texture is so visibly different, it almost seems like a wig! My hair feels lighter. Not 100% silk like I hoped, but, like I said, so worth the price!!</li>
    <li> ...it&#x27;s awesome!! I just found this at my local beauty store for only 2 dollars. The package was very large, and it could probably be used twice. The consistency is a little weird, and it has a nice smell despite people saying it&#x27;s a little strange. Yes, &amp;#34;placenta&amp;#34; on the front seemed a little nasty to me, but I decided to go for it and I&#x27;m glad I did (you wouldn&#x27;t even have known it was in there).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 15 year old girl who has dyed her hair a few times, and I straighten my hair every other day or so. It&#x27;s a little damaged, and using this just once left my hair extremely silky and it feels extremely healthy. My hair is naturally curly/wavy, and it&#x27;s a few inches past my shoulders. I showered before I applied it, and I put on a plastic cap and heated it for 10 minutes and sat for 10 more minutes. I would highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million different hair products, and this product has been the only thing that&#x27;s been able to salvage my dry (chemically-damaged) hair. I managed to snag one of the packets at Walmart for less than a $1. The smell is a bit overpowering, but it&#x27;s fantastic product. You really should use the entire packet as well - which if you have long hair (I&#x27;m a guy, so one packet is more than enough) you might need to purchase more than one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, an I love the way it smells! My hair is so soft and full of body when I use this, unlike other conditioners that leave it weighed down or oily. The only problem with ordering it online, is that you can get it in the hair color/ hair accessories isle over by ethnic hair care for 98 cents!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is listed all over the site on different pages, unfortunately. But hopefully people will see my review here. I have tried a few other products and read the ingredients carefully on a lot of their products and this particular version seems to have the most proteins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all: this is the same as those expensive keratin products. It&#x27;s using a different form of protein but it is essentially a deep conditioning treatment for people without enough proteins in their hair. This may not include you!! Please research your hair type and see if it is a protein-deficient type. Some frizz is caused by excess proteins, not a lack of proteins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, i feel like the reason i use this product is primarily psychological. My hair feels better to touch after using this product, and it lasts for several washes (unlike other deep conditioners which only last one wash). That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s actually healing your hair, not just putting a synthetic layer on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, you only need to use this every few months. I can feel it when my hair needs to be treated, it gets sort of angry at me and tangles more easily. I have very long 2c curls with fine strawberry blonde hair. i get a sort of \\&quot;halo effect\\&quot; in the summer which is another cue to do this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, i highly recommend buying a thick durable shower cap to trap the heat in while the conditioner is working on your hair. I am considering putting the product in my hair while it is dry and flat-ironing it to see if that makes my hair absorb even more of the product - let me know if you have tried this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really obsessed with hair product ingredients which is how I found this product - I heard proteins work and wanted to find the most effective product. Some others that have good ingredients are some of the more intense pantene pro-v leave in conditioners and the Suave keratin serum. Look out for dimethicone, that&#x27;s a signal that the product is cheaply formulated. Good ingredients include panthenol and any variation of that word. Thanks for reading and good luck!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this as a joke to show a friend (it was 99 cents) because of the name but I needed a conditioning treatment so I decided to go ahead and use it. I was actually pretty nervous about putting it on my head because I was afraid it would look or smell weird. There was no need; it&#x27;s white like regular conditioner. It smells sickly sweet, though. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it again just because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: My hair looks pretty much exactly the same as before, but it feels really nice!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING - makes your hair soft &amp; oh-so-shiny!! And it only cost .98 cents a pack at Walmart!</li>
    <li> When I had a relaxer, this was my go-to deep treatment. My hair felt, thicker, stronger, and it did not alter the color of my jet-black rinse. Now that I have natural hair, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see what it does. Henna, aside from it&#x27;s dying qualities, is known to strengthen hair, because it \\&quot;fills in the gaps\\&quot; between hair&#x27;s protein; so I&#x27;m hoping it will do just as great of a job with natural, afro-textured, tightly coiled hair. BTW, you can purchase this from Walmart, Sally&#x27;s, or a local drug store for no more than $1.50. Amazon went off the deep end with their prices.</li>
    <li> I used a shampoo that destroyed my hair and left my scalp dry and full of sores. I had used the Henna/Placenta pack several years ago and it was great, so i decided to try it for this problem. FIXED me right up. the heating part is VERY important as it helps it to bond to the hair. I get mine at Wal-Mart for .98 a pack. Glad I went back to this!!!! Will use nothing else from now on. Well worth the effort!!!!</li>
    <li> With the humidity here and harsh sun&amp;#34;s rays this product helps hair retain moisture. I use it once a week to avoid having brittle hair again.</li>
    <li> Finally, a conditioner that actually works! I&#x27;m a 23 year old man who has thin, brittle hair (not balding yet), and this just perked it right up. I actually bought a pack at my local drug store, but I came online just to write this review. This stuff is just incredible. My hair hasn&#x27;t been this lush and gorgeous since I was a teenager. I WILL be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this very inexpensively at Wal-Mart. I had high hopes after reading reviews for this product, but it did not live up to my expectations. I left it in my hair for 1 hour while wearing a plastic shower cap. I used a heat pad over my head in order to boost the conditioning action. All in all, this is not a bad product, but I did not notice any differences in my hair after using it. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
