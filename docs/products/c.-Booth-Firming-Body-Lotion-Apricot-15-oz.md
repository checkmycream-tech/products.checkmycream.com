    <li> Bottle appears to have been used.  I have purchased Booth&#x27;s Apricot Lotion before and this bottle is a different color and has a terrible scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; part of the lotion - but it IS very emollient and makes your skin super soft! Also the scent is fresh and light...</li>
    <li> Good product. What I expected</li>
    <li> Though I wish the apricot scent were a little stronger, overall I really enjoy this lotion. It&#x27;s rich without being too heavy or oily once it absorbs into your skin.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like apricots at all. I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all. My husband didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> When I got this lotion the top was broken it had been used it had a price sticker from Ross and that explains why it was broken and it was used.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed and I give it 1 star because I have to otherwise it won&#x27;t take my comment...</li>
    <li> Really thick like too old but still works</li>
    <li> A good body lotion, not as advertised.  No better than lotions in stores. I will not pay extra money to buy again</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing and is thick enough to feel like a cream. I love the C Booth products and will continue to buy this one too!</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s no miracle cure for stretch marks and I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose, it&#x27;s helped fade them a little bit. The smell is very light and pleasant. I&#x27;m constantly trying new lotions and products--this is the first one in a LONG time that I&#x27;ve almost completely used up.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, but not as thick as the almond lotion</li>
    <li> This is really great lotion... IT PUTS THE LOTION IN THE AMAZON BASKET!!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, both the scent and feel. I bought it years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it. Happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Sure hope this product isn&#x27;t discontinued...I love it.  It&#x27;s one of the few body lotions on the market that contains oil so is really great for the skin.</li>
    <li> love the C. Booth products</li>
    <li> This lotion is great.  It has helped my chronically dry itchy skin.  I gave it to both my Mother and Sister and they both love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing for the quality of this lotion.  The smell is a light citrusy non offensive smell.  My Mother is usually allergic to everything and she loves this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one lotion I buy time and time again.  All the rest of my lotions just sit in the cosmetic closet, because I like this one the best.</li>
    <li> I love the moisture and smell of this lotion. I am not sure about firming part. It &#x27; a good lotion. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion...hard to find in my area.  I would have rated higher but the pump doesn&#x27;t work which gets a little frustrating so I don&#x27;t use as much as I normally would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and always liked it. I purchased 2 bottles and they were watery and smelled funky. Not the usual apricot scent I have become  accustomed to.</li>
    <li> Smells great, generous amount for a great price too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the firming aspect of it but was very disappointed.  I have used this for 5-6 months and there&#x27;s been no firming at all.  If anything I&#x27;ve lost more firmness in my skin (legs &amp; arms) since using it.  It smells nice and feels good going on but my skin looks dry and getting wrinkles on arms AND legs.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion a lot it leaves a lasting Apricot scent and it is very moisturing to me.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever used. Leaves your body feeling wonderful, glowing and vibrant.</li>
    <li> Smells good, goes on smooth but don&#x27;t see any firming in my skin but it does hydrate well.</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
