      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite perfume which I have used for 33 years by now.</li>
      <li>It is more alcohol than parfum.  </li>
      <li>The price is right compared to stores and smells good.</li>
      <li>But it is still very nice and very feminine.</li>
      <li>So glad to have a full bottle of this perfume again!</li>
      <li>Great for Women who wants a strong perfume but sweet and confortable at a time.</li>
      <li>but this is really a strong scent</li>
      <li>Hope it is available for decades to come.  </li>
      <li>maybe it&#x27;s very old and has lost the fragrance thinking of returning it !!!!!</li>
      <li>It is not too &#x27;flowery&#x27; or too sweet it has a sophisticated just right fragrence.</li>
      <li>did not remotely resemble the Diva I know and loved.</li>
      <li>Diva is not too sweet, or too flowery, woody, or fruity.  </li>
      <li>It is incredibly rich, deep, elegant and clean.  </li>
      <li>bought this several months ago and tried several times to appreciate the smell since all the reviews were great</li>
      <li>Product is exactly like product description, shiping, packing...</li>
      <li>price was better than my local stores</li>
      <li>Very nice, but... just a single tiny spritz on your wrists.</li>
      <li>In addition, the fact that now Amazon sells it directly to you not through a second vendor is one more reason to get it here and quick with Prime.  </li>
      <li>I personally didn&#x27;t like the scent when I smell it on a man it smelled good but for a woman the scent is very strong not good at all</li>
      <li>so many memories brought forward with a single scent, and this was it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I absolutely do.</li>
      <li>So for years I paid for this scent, no matter how much it cost.  </li>
      <li>I still had some in my last bottle, this product was nothing like the original.  </li>
      <li>down to my last &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34; but I will buy more and continue to wear Diva to my grave.  </li>
      <li>I would like my money back or the real article shipped to me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a matter of natural body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>Too strong for me up by my neck where I usually place my  perfume.</li>
      <li>The smell of the perfume is a little dry but nothing that irritates, it is a strong perfume but classy.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for my wife who will use no other fragrance.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is much lower than all the other sites I&#x27;ve searched.  </li>

<li> Long lasting yet not overpowering.  </li>
<li> So I stayed with Diva, even buying several bottles and the body lotion in the duty-free shop in London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport after the scent became harder find in the States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> A little goes a long way and lasts a long time...</li>
<li> I treated myself to a $100 bottle of eau de cologne by Badgley-Mischka for my birthday last year and a friend gave me Opium cologne a few months ago.  </li>
<li> It is worth the money and you cannot go wrong</li>
<li> I bought it as a present for my mother, who is a fanatic of this perfume.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money-it was a shock to spray the Diva Parfum.</li>
<li> Plus at about $100 a bottle, I didn&#x27;t want it to be wasted.  </li>
<li> FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS.</li>
<li> my wife has used this for years, it was hard to find.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores and she will will not change.</li>
<li> It is a perfume that would be hard to where at work.</li>
<li> Needless to say I have wasted my money because i won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
<li> I can remember walking behind another woman in Neiman&#x27;s and noticing her perfume.  </li>
<li> Sorry...</li>
<li> This type of fragrance is almost impossible to find.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s a very annoying smell!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money-it was a shock to spray the Diva Parfum. It is more alcohol than parfum.  Put your money toward the Diva Lotion as it is what it is-perfumed lotion.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly like product description, shiping, packing... all was exellent&lt;br /&gt;I recomended this.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is so personal, that one person&#x27;s review is just that. This is a warm, sensual, bury your nose into your clothes, yet not overpowering.  i bought two already so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Have Used Diva for years.  The product fragrance  I was sent did not remotely resemble the Diva I know and loved.</li>
    <li> This product was great</li>
    <li> I have been using diva since it came out this scent is not the same maybe it&#x27;s very old and has lost the fragrance thinking of returning it !!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased to have found Diva, my Eau De Perfume for many, many years in Amazon.  I tried many times before to find it in dept. stores with no luck.  In addition, the fact that now Amazon sells it directly to you not through a second vendor is one more reason to get it here and quick with Prime.  I am a happy deliciously (Diva)perfumed customer!

    <li> I was introduced to this perfume in 1985 and have loved it.  I get constant compliments on the fragrance.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who will use no other fragrance. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores and she will will not change.</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance for over 10 years. Every time I wear it, someone asks what it is.  One of the reasons I do like it is because you don&#x27;t smell it on someone every time you turn around!  It lasts all day and never changes!  Simply divine!</li>
    <li> I love it... A little goes a long way and lasts a long time... so don&#x27;t &amp;#34; take a bath with the bottle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was better than my local stores so I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for years after I first smelled it on a beautiful model.  I asked her what fragrance she was wearing and she told me it was Diva.  I truly love this fragrance!  It arrived in perfect shape and was packaged very good.  I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB</li>
    <li> I was given a bottle of this perfume as a gift in 1985.  I&#x27;d gone through a kazillion perfumes in the 15 years prior and none suited me.  I loved this scent immediately.  Plus at about $100 a bottle, I didn&#x27;t want it to be wasted.  At that time, Diva could only be bought at stores like Neiman-Marcus and Saks 5th Avenue.  So for years I paid for this scent, no matter how much it cost.  I can remember walking behind another woman in Neiman&#x27;s and noticing her perfume.  I&#x27;d been wearing Diva exclusively by that time for 5 years and thought is was time for a change.  I asked the woman for the name of her perfume and she replied &amp;#34;Ungaro&#x27;s Diva&amp;#34;1. It smelled completely different on her than I perceived it did on me. So I stayed with Diva, even buying several bottles and the body lotion in the duty-free shop in London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport after the scent became harder find in the States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m down to my last &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34; but I will buy more and continue to wear Diva to my grave.  I treated myself to a $100 bottle of eau de cologne by Badgley-Mischka for my birthday last year and a friend gave me Opium cologne a few months ago.  But I keep going back to my Diva!  What works well on one woman is not favorable on another.  It&#x27;s a matter of natural body chemistry.  As for me, if ain&#x27;t broke......etc!  Plus I can&#x27;t see myself wearing a scent carrying another woman&#x27;s name or statement (Jennifer Lopez. Jessica Simpson, Mariah Carey).  &amp;#34;DIVA&amp;#34;......well, I can work with that!  If I ever get the opportunity to create a personal scent, I would call it &amp;#34;Diva by Linda Lou&amp;#34;! 😎👍❤️</li>
    <li> my wife has used this for years, it was hard to find. Only could get at Neiman Marcus or Macys. Found on Amazon for about $30 cheaper.</li>
    <li> IT HAS BEENA FAVORITE OF MINE FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for years...</li>
    <li> it did not even smell like Diva perfume.  I always get complimented on how great my perfume smells, and with this order I kept getting asked if i was wearing the men&#x27;s perfume Aramis.  Needless to say I have wasted my money because i won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Diva for over 10 years.  This product that was sent was not the Eau de Parfum that I use.  I still had some in my last bottle, this product was nothing like the original.  I would like my money back or the real article shipped to me.</li>
    <li> The price is right compared to stores and smells good. It is worth the money and you cannot go wrong</li>
    <li> My sister loved this fragrance and recommended it to me. I&#x27;ve always worn Cartier Parfum or Chanel No. 5. This scent did not smell good on me. Great value for the money for the right woman tho.</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like the scent when I smell it on a man it smelled good but for a woman the scent is very strong not good at all it&#x27;s a very annoying smell!</li>
    <li> Haunting, bewitching, bewildering and seductive...so many memories brought forward with a single scent, and this was it. The years peel away in an instant.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a present for my mother, who is a fanatic of this perfume.  She is very happy with it.  The smell of the perfume is a little dry but nothing that irritates, it is a strong perfume but classy.  Great for Women who wants a strong perfume but sweet and confortable at a time.</li>
    <li> Too strong! Not my scent! It gives me headache.---I bought this several months ago and tried several times to appreciate the smell since all the reviews were great but this is really a strong scent and I can&#x27;t take it. Sorry...</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Diva by Ungaro for many years and have always received many compliments...I love this perfume and am delighted with this purchase, delivered in the time promised with a nice note from the store. So glad to have a full bottle of this perfume again!</li>
    <li> Have been wearing this scent for years and love it.  Hope it is available for decades to come.  Every time I wear it someone compliments it.</li>
    <li> Favorite perfume for over 30 years!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years and I always receive comments on it wheh I wear it. It is not too &#x27;flowery&#x27; or too sweet it has a sophisticated just right fragrence.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Product good and shipment handled well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for years.  I receive compliments on a daily basis from men and women alike!!!</li>
    <li> This scent is very nice. It is a perfume that would be hard to where at work. That is why I&#x27;m giving it a 4. But it is still very nice and very feminine.Thank-you</li>
    <li> This type of fragrance is almost impossible to find.  It is incredibly rich, deep, elegant and clean.  Long lasting yet not overpowering.  When I wear Diva, people want to hug me, or come closer,  smile, offer to help me, and tell me how wonderful I smell.  It is heavenly,  and lifts my spirit, and my mood.  Amazon&#x27;s price is much lower than all the other sites I&#x27;ve searched.  Diva is not too sweet, or too flowery, woody, or fruity.  It&#x27;s in a class all it&#x27;s own.  If you like Youth Dew, Poem, Kari, White  Shoulders, Sung, Decoltee, or Elixer, {while not smelling like any of these} you will adore Diva.  I absolutely do.</li>
    <li> I breezed by a woman in the airport and had to ask her what she was wearing. Very nice, but... just a single tiny spritz on your wrists. Too strong for me up by my neck where I usually place my  perfume. Have had lots of compliments from both genders and inquiries as to name of pefume.</li>
    <li> Regalo realizado a mi madre, perfume descontinuado en gran parte de sudamerica, de gran prestigio. Perdura la fragancia. Recomendada a los qeu conocen dicha marca de perfume</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume which I have used for 33 years by now.</li>
