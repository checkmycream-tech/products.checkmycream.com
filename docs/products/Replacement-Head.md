### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The website indicated that this part number was a change but the application was perfect.</li>
      <li>These replacement blades were an excellent choice for my razor.</li>
      <li>Fits with no problems, works great</li>
      <li>The price for these was great and saved me a good amount of money.</li>
      <li>But they fit perfectly and work great.</li>
      <li>Replacements work good</li>
      <li>these fit my Norelco 715RL perfectly.</li>
      <li>Good quality, easy to install, works like a charm, and a welcome refresh of the aging heads that I had been using.</li>
      <li>Fit like they should and at a great price you cant find anywhere else and best of all, exactly when I needed them.</li>
      <li>Would still have liked receiving</li>
      <li>I ordered these replacement heads and found out after much deliberation and emails that these are now called HQ56 and they worked perfectly!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Quite happy with the product and it arrived quickly too.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a pretty good investment!</li>
      <li>Replacement blades work GREAT and priced right.</li>
      <li>but many reviews said these would work.  </li>
      <li>Have had a Norelco shaver for many years.</li>
      <li>what could  be better?</li>
      <li>Arrived well on time and easy to install..</li>
      <li>Now, after replacing the heads (including the blades), it works good as new.</li>
      <li>but it worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>Works great, I replaced the old shaver heads with these and now the shaver works like when I first got it!</li>
      <li>I was all set- ordered 2packs of the HQ4&#x27;s (from seller &#x27;Goodmans&#x27; @ $28.99), but instead received 2 packs of  the HQ55&#x27;s, citing the packing slip&#x27;s description of \\&quot;HQ4 no longer available, upgrade to HQ55\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I bought these to replace the original blades on my norelco razor.  </li>
      <li>Arrived much quicker than expected and they work great!</li>
      <li>Since it only has two heads I purchased two packs of these (good for three changes).</li>
      <li>the universal replacements was a good thing and slapped those puppies in there.  </li>
      <li>my new norelco shaver was a pos, so i replaced the blades in my old one and get great shaves.</li>
      <li>Exact fit.  </li>
      <li>have had a Norelco for many years and these new heads renew the razor every time &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Seems like it is worth a try.</li>
      <li>Arrived as scheduled and in good condition, worked as expected.</li>
      <li>Perhaps, but the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close or as smooth as the 15 year old blades on the original shaver.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I should order more of these blades for the next time.</li>
      <li>Be advised that the HQ4 doesn&#x27;t really exist anymore, they have been re-numbered it to HQ-56, which explains why I could never find it in the stores!</li>
      <li>Be sure to get the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; and cut heads, not just cut, as I mistakenly did for my second shaver.  </li>
      <li>It never occurred to me until recently that the famous floating shaver heads for a Norelco electric razor could be replaced.</li>
      <li>Upon recent closer inspection comparing these blades to the original blades that I kept, it is obvious that these are a cheap knockoff!!  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t get exact match on replacement number</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>The new lift and cut heads are a great improvement - faster cutting and much more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t a marked difference in the quality of the shave, but I&#x27;m still glad I bought the new shaver heads.</li>
      <li>I replaced these junk blades with the old blades that I still have that are more then 15 years old</li>
      <li>These are exact replacements and they are working very well.  </li>
      <li>They still worked ok, but just took double the passes  to get a decent shave.     </li>
      <li>Funny how often new blades fall to the bottom of the todo list when its  an electric (try saying that about a disposable!).</li>
      <li>Be sure to compare symbols on center.</li>
      <li>I expected more from Norelco.</li>
      <li>Installing replacement heads didn&#x27;t give my shaver as much newness as the originals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen HQ55 replacement heads readily available on the shelf at Meijer/Target/Kmart/etc for  about the same price.)    </li>
      <li>They worked and my father, and his skin, is much happier.</li>
      <li>The re-charge function has long since stopped working, but it works just fine plugged in.</li>
      <li>I was a bit worried ordering them online since they aren&#x27;t supposed to be for my particular Norelco, an 815RX.</li>
      <li>I ordered a set of these from Amazon (Goodmans)last August and when I first put them in my shaver they seemed to cut well (a little better than my 15 year old blades), but their performance degraded rapidly.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend them for anyone looking to return their razor to \\&quot;like new\\&quot; form.</li>
      <li>Shaves like new and much cheaper than a new shaver.</li>
      <li>They were certainly sharper than the old blades that I had.  </li>
      <li>-beats buying a new one</li>

    <li> Every wife&#x27;s dream.  Shaves like new and much cheaper than a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Have an rather old Norelco (3405LC, corded) that I can&#x27;t seem to let go of, but was long overdue (3yrs?)  for a new set of blades. Funny how often new blades fall to the bottom of the todo list when its  an electric (try saying that about a disposable!). They still worked ok, but just took double the passes  to get a decent shave.     After some -ridiculous- amount of confirmation on what the original heads are (HQ4 3\\&quot;cutters\\&quot; &amp; 3\\&quot;combs\\&quot; set),  checked around and found these HQ4&#x27;s @ Amazon. These stuck out based on the product picture that matched  my current worn out heads inscribed with \\&quot;\\ lift and cut \\ micro+\\&quot;. Some of the others had different inscriptions,  &amp; I wasn&#x27;t taking chances with something that might not be the real deal.    I was all set- ordered 2packs of the HQ4&#x27;s (from seller &#x27;Goodmans&#x27; @ $28.99), but instead received 2 packs of  the HQ55&#x27;s, citing the packing slip&#x27;s description of \\&quot;HQ4 no longer available, upgrade to HQ55\\&quot;.  Don&#x27;t know why &#x27;in stock&#x27; HQ4&#x27;s are... apparentlyNOT (do they still exist?), but I took it that the &#x27;upgrade&#x27; to  the universal replacements was a good thing and slapped those puppies in there.  (sidenote: I&#x27;ve seen HQ55 replacement heads readily available on the shelf at Meijer/Target/Kmart/etc for  about the same price.)    Been shaving 4-6x a week with the new HQ55&#x27;s for nearly a month now &amp; they feel fantastic (no doubt due in part  to my last set being worn-in). Still, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Would still have liked receiving the HQ4&#x27;s I actually ordered,  but these work great (if not better) for a shaver unit way past its prime.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades were an excellent choice for my razor. They are very sharp and hold up use after use. I highly recommend them for anyone looking to return their razor to \\&quot;like new\\&quot; form.</li>
    <li> It never occurred to me until recently that the famous floating shaver heads for a Norelco electric razor could be replaced. I was about to throw my trusty old Norelco in the trash because it had become useless. Now, after replacing the heads (including the blades), it works good as new.</li>
    <li> Replacement blades work GREAT and priced right. Arrived well on time and easy to install.. what could  be better?</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried ordering them online since they aren&#x27;t supposed to be for my particular Norelco, an 815RX. But they fit perfectly and work great.</li>
    <li> Work just like the original cutting heads.&lt;br /&gt;Some electric razors work differently on different parts of the beard.  I alternate between my Norelco and my Remington microscreen razors, both of which are good products and have been using them for 10 to 20 years with only having to replace the cutting heads (twice) and battery (once) on the Norelco, and the cutter (twice) and screen (thrice) on the Remington.  The Remington is older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;d buy them again if and when I need to.</li>
    <li> Arrived much quicker than expected and they work great!</li>
    <li> Have had a Norelco shaver for many years. Decided to replace the blades. First tried a substitue alternate source. Waste of money. Then back to Norelco, for the real thing. Ordered HQ4&#x27;s, got HQ55, which the box says replaces the HQ4. New and Improved. Perhaps, but the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close or as smooth as the 15 year old blades on the original shaver. Perhaps they will improve with time. I expected more from Norelco.</li>
    <li> This product did as it stated. You get what you py for. Ther cheaper replacement heads do not last very long.</li>
    <li> After 30 years of use I knew I needed new shaver heads, because they were starting to pull painfully if the growth was more than three days long.  The new lift and cut heads are a great improvement - faster cutting and much more comfortable.  I should have replaced them years ago!  Be sure to get the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; and cut heads, not just cut, as I mistakenly did for my second shaver.  Without the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; they are not nearly as fast shaving.</li>
    <li> Cleaning old shaver heads only helps so much.  Eventually they need to be replaced with sharp heads and these fit my Norelco 715RL perfectly.</li>
    <li> These are exact replacements and they are working very well.  Be sure to compare symbols on center.</li>
    <li> My Norelco 950RX just won&#x27;t die. I must have had it for 35 years, I&#x27;ve replaced the blades 3 times and the batteries twice over that time and it&#x27;s like new afterwards. That&#x27;s a pretty good investment! The blades and heads go in without any tools so it&#x27;s a piece of cake.</li>
    <li> Every time I buy a new set of these they are duller and lighter than the ones before. Ignore the &amp;#34;gotta have it now&amp;#34; shareholders and bring back quality products!</li>
    <li> i bought these for my 15 year old norelco shaver.  my new norelco shaver was a pos, so i replaced the blades in my old one and get great shaves.</li>
    <li> I ordered the HQ4s as a replacement part for another head.  They sent a different part number but it worked just fine.  They were certainly sharper than the old blades that I had.  If I had it to do over again, I might have ordered the generics for half the price.  Seems like it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the original blades on my norelco razor.  I noticed that shaving was taking longer to do so I thought about buying a new razor.  The price for these was great and saved me a good amount of money.</li>
    <li> Fits with no problems, works great</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old blades were. It has been quite a while since I changed them. These blades made such a large difference in the quality of my shave. The only problem is that my electric shaver is several years old. Perhaps I should order more of these blades for the next time. My Noreclco keeps going and going.</li>
    <li> Long story short:  I got screwed.  The details are long and complicated, and boring.  These people are dishonest.  Don&#x27;t do business with them.</li>
    <li> The HQ4 is not the product you need. I ordered these replacement heads and found out after much deliberation and emails that these are now called HQ56 and they worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Replacements work good</li>
    <li> Caught in the flood and never got them !!!</li>
    <li> Installing replacement heads didn&#x27;t give my shaver as much newness as the originals.</li>
    <li> this product did not seem to hold a sharp edge. Soon after installing in my razor they were dull. I would not reorder.</li>
    <li> Fit like they should and at a great price you cant find anywhere else and best of all, exactly when I needed them.</li>
    <li> Good quality, easy to install, works like a charm, and a welcome refresh of the aging heads that I had been using.</li>
    <li> This product was just as advertised. I have a Philips razor with only two heads, so I didn&#x27;t really need the third, but they only sell them in threes . .. There wasn&#x27;t a marked difference in the quality of the shave, but I&#x27;m still glad I bought the new shaver heads.</li>
    <li> New electric shaver heads purchased as a replacement for an old Norelco shaver.  Couldn&#x27;t get exact match on replacement number but many reviews said these would work.  They were lift and cut.  Ordered with fingers crossed.  They worked and my father, and his skin, is much happier.</li>
    <li> These razor heads seem to be functioning well. I have an old Norelco SX 300 double header almost 20 years old now. The re-charge function has long since stopped working, but it works just fine plugged in. Since it only has two heads I purchased two packs of these (good for three changes). Be advised that the HQ4 doesn&#x27;t really exist anymore, they have been re-numbered it to HQ-56, which explains why I could never find it in the stores! This product does have the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; moniker that the old numbered product has. I don&#x27;t believe this phrase is used on todays razors, especially now that Phillips and Norelco have merged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite happy with the product and it arrived quickly too.</li>
    <li> Works great, I replaced the old shaver heads with these and now the shaver works like when I first got it!</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled and in good condition, worked as expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of these from Amazon (Goodmans)last August and when I first put them in my shaver they seemed to cut well (a little better than my 15 year old blades), but their performance degraded rapidly.  Upon recent closer inspection comparing these blades to the original blades that I kept, it is obvious that these are a cheap knockoff!!  The whole lift &amp; Cut blade system is missing where each blade is supposed to have a second blade that performs the lifting cut.  Anyway, less then a year later these blades hardly cut anymore (SERIOUSLY, they hardly cut!!).  I replaced these junk blades with the old blades that I still have that are more then 15 years old (Boy what an improvement).  First and Last items that I ever buy from Goodman&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> Exact fit.  Exactly as advertised. The website indicated that this part number was a change but the application was perfect.</li>
    <li> have had a Norelco for many years and these new heads renew the razor every time &#x3D;-beats buying a new one</li>
