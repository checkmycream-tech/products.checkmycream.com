      <li>I figured there had to be something better.</li>

      <li>I have owned Conaire lather machine for many years.</li>
      <li>so I save a bunch of money not buying more costly gels...........by the way</li>
      <li>The Conair Hot Lather Machine works well, the cans load easily, and the \\&quot;machine\\&quot; is reasonably attractive.  </li>
      <li>It works better than my original one!</li>
      <li>The setup is easy.</li>
      <li>it is easy to use and my hubby loves it...</li>
      <li>i was expecting it to be nice and hot.</li>
      <li>you are not going to get the barber&#x27;s nice hot lather.</li>
      <li>Most of us have had either a full shave or a neck shave from a barber shop</li>
      <li>Glad that I was still able to locate one of these hot lather machines.</li>
      <li>Therefore when I get back home,I am a happy camper.</li>
      <li>I do enjoy the heated lather.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy using it</li>
      <li>Why do they continue to attempt to sell a model number which is no longer available????</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to store this machine until winter, when it might prove more useful.  </li>
      <li>This product initially worked great, but after about a year it no longer heats up.  </li>
      <li>It is better than straight from the can, and I am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I had an old model 10 years ago and loved it.</li>
      <li>This conair hot lather machine is a God sent!!</li>
      <li>Christmas 06,The price is good but the lather is only luke warm, not even close to hot.</li>
      <li>: Easy to use, easy to clean, cheap, cheap to refill, reliable, hot foam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>My first Conair machine lasted many years so when it quit it was time for a replacement.</li>
      <li>Great Christmas present and at a very reasonable price too!</li>
      <li>If you want hot lather, you&#x27;d be better off setting your money on fire.  </li>
      <li>lather makes a shave more comfy, this is easier than messing with hot towels-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very quick to get hot and works like a dream!</li>
      <li>I need to try to clean out the unit and to shake it before use.</li>
      <li>the trick too a really nice hot shave is to plug this machine in  a good 5 to 10 minutes before you shave and wet you face.</li>
      <li>Many comment that it doesn&#x27;t heat to a warm enough temperature and that the cream cools off too quickly.  </li>
      <li>but the price was right!</li>
      <li>A few years ago, I received a Conair hot lather machine as a gift, and it has been wonderful!</li>
      <li>The Conair hot lather machine works fairly easily.  </li>
      <li>It is something he would never buy for himself but will enjoy it each time he shaves with the hot lather.  </li>
      <li>The price also was the lowest I was able to find for a brand new product.</li>
      <li>The HLM10 by Conair filled the bill, though the reviews were not all that positive.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get consistant heat out of it, but more often than not it is hot enough to more than make a difference.  </li>
      <li>and it makes me feel special ;)....</li>
      <li>Otherwise the shaving cream won&#x27;t be useful.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the inexpensive price to pamper yourself, and it lasts forever.</li>
      <li>This machine is superior to similar ones on the market because it has heating coils that heat the entire can of shaving cream rather than just the top.  </li>
      <li>It also helps to keep my face warm and I suppose my pores open.</li>
      <li>Simple yet highly effective shaving cream warmer.  </li>
      <li>This hot lather machine worked good and lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s worth the $20.</li>
      <li>I am having issues now with having only luke warm lather.</li>
      <li>Hlm10.Its worth the price,sad it was discontinued.</li>
      <li>I read the other reviews and thought I had a good shot at him liking the lather machine</li>
      <li>Take a standard can of shaving cream, pop off the top and the dispensor cap, and insert and secure it into the hot lather machine.  </li>
      <li>Plus you have to get the right size can for it.</li>
      <li>Sure beats the old method of running hot water over the can in the sink.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Didn&#x27;t work very well. Plus you have to get the right size can for it. The whole thing just a waste. My husband used it once, then it sat under the sink for a year. I finally gave it to goodwill.</li>
    <li> Ordered the HLM10 Hot Lather Machine, but received a different model number which was worthless.  Turns out that The HLM10 was a good machine but is no longer manufactured.  Why do they continue to attempt to sell a model number which is no longer available????</li>
    <li> This brings back the closeness of the hot barber shop shave. This is far better than the previous model they once sold.</li>
    <li> Works great but found it for much better price at a store. Tisk Tisk</li>
    <li> Have purchased two of these in the past 3 years. Each runs as advertised, but each one has had electrical problems. I think this stems from the fact that when I am finished shaving, I wrap the cord around the base for storage. After time (about 1 1/2 years in each case), the electrical connection from wire to the guts inside gets faulty resulting in the machine not turning on. But, because the price is good, I will run out and buy another.</li>
    <li> Was glad it got here then i plug it in and wait a till the next day to use it, to be sure its realy hot. But then it olny sputters out a few drops of foam ( yes I did shake the can) and the rest of it is luke warm.    DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS A WAIST OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I WOULDENT EVEN GIVE IT A STAR BYT THIS SITE MAKES U.</li>
    <li> I had an old model 10 years ago and loved it. I bought this new one and had to take it back because it did not heat up. The one I exchanged it for had the same problem. I called Conair and they told me that people complained that the older ones were too hot. Now they make them so that they don&#x27;t heat up as much. This is a total waste of time. I took this one back also. This new version is worthless!</li>
    <li> These have become very hard to find on retail shelves, impossible in my area.  Get the closest shave ever!  Hot lather, hot water, soft beard from already being in the shower.  I&#x27;ve using these about 10 years and they last about 4 years each.    You will need to get a shower mirror.  NOTE:  The kind that just hang on the shower wall claiming to be fog-free aren&#x27;t.  The only true fog-free mirrors must be attached to the shower pipe behind the shower head.  It&#x27;s not hard to do.  Just unscrew the head, screw on the mirror (there will be a flexible pipe with the mirror) and replace the head. Hot water flows through it keeping it fog-free.</li>
    <li> I confess I had my own motives for buying this for my husband - I wanted the sink back. For all our married life he has warmed his shaving cream in hot water in the sink. I figured there had to be something better. I read the other reviews and thought I had a good shot at him liking the lather machine and he LOVES it! He has raved and raved about how wonderful it is. The shaving cream is warmer than he ever could get it in the sink - AND I have the sink back!! Great Christmas present and at a very reasonable price too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for several years and purchased one for myself for Christmas 06,The price is good but the lather is only luke warm, not even close to hot.Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The setup is easy. The premise is great. The lather is not that hot. This is my only complaint, but for $15, do you expect the full barbershop experience? It is better than straight from the can, and I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I had one before purchasing this one.   Worked great for many years!!  Great product and Amazon has great service.</li>
    <li> I had bought a conair shaving can heater 30 yrs ago and it just wore out.  So I bought another and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a similar machine from con-aire a while back.  It worked, but did not last.    The heater is this machine seems to work, but one has to &#x27;shake&#x27; the machine to get thicker lather to come out of it.  If it is not shaken, the lather is runny.  I would recommend the machine for the money it cost.  I do enjoy the heated lather.  djk</li>
    <li> My husband got this for xmas last year and used it once and it has been sitting in the cabinet now for one year.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a great accessory for the man who likes an old fashioned warm lather shave.  I turn it on before showering and it is ready when I get out.  It can accomodate both the short and tall cans of shaving cream by adapting the base.  I am on my second machine which lasts for years.  It is also great for those of us who shave our heads.  It really prepared the scalp for a safer cleaner shave.  You still should use a good blade, like the Fusion for your scalp shaving and for safety.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and one for my father.  I enjoy using it and it makes me feel special ;)....no, on a serious note I do like using it and believe I get a closer shave, however I thought the shaving cream would get warmer than it does.  Most of us have had either a full shave or a neck shave from a barber shop and I can tell you that the shaving cream is warmer there than it is from this machine, but hey it&#x27;s $15 and the ones the barbers use are around $150, so I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the money, not to mention I now use Barbasol, which is $1.00 a can so I save a bunch of money not buying more costly gels...........by the way, my Dad shares the same feelings.</li>
    <li> No it doesn&#x27;t produce lather as hot as you get in a barber shop, but its also doesn&#x27;t cost $250. I don&#x27;t get consistant heat out of it, but more often than not it is hot enough to more than make a difference.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IMO, it is worth the money spent. Shaving doesn&#x27;t take as long now because I don&#x27;t have to heat the water then hold a hot face cloth against my face and get water all over my shirt and make a mess of the sink. Now I splash a little bit of hot water on my face then add some warm/hot later from this little machice and away I shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> I have had very little problem with this unit. Now &amp; then, when trying to get the lather to come out slowly, you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It&#x27;s not comfortable, but doesn&#x27;t really burn. The lather, itself, comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not, I have no idea; I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face.</li>
    <li> This machine works great! Anything that makes my husband want to shave more often is great!  It&#x27;s also nice for those cold Iowa mornings!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on hot lather machines and saw several high ratings for this product. I tried it and it never made the shaving cream hot enough. But it also never heated to the point that the green light came on (just a yellow light). So I got another machine and the same thing happened. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> not what i had hoped for. it delivers luke warm lather. i was expecting it to be nice and hot. paid ridiculous amount of money. i think i will go back to my old style brush and soap dish.</li>
    <li> This is my second one... The first one died after approx. six years of use. I killed it by forgetting to turn it off many times and I think it eventually weakened the plastic inside. I immediately purchased another one which I&#x27;m using daily.</li>
    <li> I shave with a straight razor and have always wanted a hot foam dispencer, so voil&amp;agrave;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use, easy to clean, cheap, cheap to refill, reliable, hot foam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A small one, but you have to warm it up (duh)...it only takes a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you want a hot lathery shave at a VERY affordable price, then look no further. This is it!</li>
    <li> If you want hot lather, you&#x27;d be better off setting your money on fire.  This product initially worked great, but after about a year it no longer heats up.  For the price, I expected better quality.</li>
    <li> My first Conair machine lasted many years so when it quit it was time for a replacement. Sure beats the old method of running hot water over the can in the sink. A difficult item to find in the stores, so it&#x27;s Amazon to the rescue again.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the foam to be a lot hotter when I use it, right now it&#x27;s just above lukewarm. Sometimes the steam that shoots out is practically scalding, while the foam doesn&#x27;t come out anywhere close to that temperature. My barber has an older model Conair that seems to produce hotter foam, not sure why. But I will say that it does make for a better shave than using cold cream right out of the can.</li>
    <li> I still go to an old-fashioned barber, and my favorite part of the experience is the warm lather in the barber shop. I had looked around for a hot lather machine for a while, but unsuccessfully. A few years ago, I received a Conair hot lather machine as a gift, and it has been wonderful! It warms nicely, and it has a thermostat to keep your lather from getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;This machine has been great to me. Just remember to read and follow the instructions - if you don&#x27;t shake the unit before turning it on, the lather will come out all watery and hot. If you&#x27;re even just thinking about getting a hot lather machine, buy it. It&#x27;s worth the inexpensive price to pamper yourself, and it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he positively loves it. It&#x27;s very quick to get hot and works like a dream!</li>
    <li> Have used these machines for years. Only reason I hate to travel is I can&#x27;t bring my shave machine with me. Therefore when I get back home,I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It&#x27;s a great experience to shave with hot shaving cream, especially on cold mornings. The price also was the lowest I was able to find for a brand new product.</li>
    <li> We gave this to my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  He uses it every morning and loves it.  It heats the shaving cream right up for a warm, pleasant shave.  I should try it on my legs.</li>
    <li> I never bought this online, because the sellers want an arm and a leg for one... even those that are used!  However, I did purchase a new one from Walgreens and Walmart about 25 years ago for about $24.99 plus tax.  To make a long story short, they do work and heat up the lather; however, they could have been engineered  to work better and last longer.  That hot lather works well to soften those wiry whiskers.  This HLM10 is no longer made by Conair, which is too bad.  I think the Conair company is &amp;#34;missing the boat&amp;#34; by not reintroducing this item.  It would be great seller.  However, if the Conair company were to utilize some practical business sense and reintroduce this item, they should improve on the old HLM10 model by upgrading the quality and workmanship.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANOR AND AS OF NOW IT HAS CONTINUOUSLY WORKED WELL</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this product but cannot find a can of shaving cream without a warning to not use for warm later or near heat. Can anyone recommend a brand of shaving cream that is safe to use with this machine?</li>
    <li> For someone who started shaving at 13 and hates to shave, I had my doubts about this unit. in fact it sat on my shelf for two months before I gave last years xmass gift a chance. Simple to use and the lather was steaming hot. I actually started to shave  2x a week just to use it. I am having issues now with having only luke warm lather. I had to shave on the road last week, and had to use lather straight from the can. I hated it. I need to try to clean out the unit and to shake it before use. If that doesn&#x27;t work, I will go buy another unit. It helps make a annoying routine rather pleasureable.</li>
    <li> My model is HLM10C.  Not sure if there&#x27;s a difference; it looks the same as the HLM10R, has the same functions, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t list an HLM10C.     I&#x27;m pretty happy with this device.  You do have to remember to shake the can each time.  Otherwise the shaving cream won&#x27;t be useful.  But as long as you remember, it comes out plenty warm for a nice comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> The Conair hot lather machine works fairly easily.  Take a standard can of shaving cream, pop off the top and the dispensor cap, and insert and secure it into the hot lather machine.  After you plug it the red light will turn on, and when the lather is &#x27;hot&#x27; you&#x27;ll see it switch over to green, which only takes a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather does dispense comfortably hot in your hand, but it very rapidly loses its heat.  Its no exaggeration to say that by the time you put your hand to your face the lather has become tepid, and once you&#x27;re ready to shave the lather is no warmer than it would have been had you dispensed it from the can directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to store this machine until winter, when it might prove more useful.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the trouble right now with spring and summer coming up.</li>
    <li> This is a very good machine.  I have never enjoyed a better shave since buying this product.</li>
    <li> All conairs hot lather machines are a scam. be ware you are not going to get the barber&#x27;s nice hot lather. You will get luke warm lather very thin in nature. The machine will fail in very short amount of time</li>
    <li> As I age, I recall the oddest things.  I remember the hot lather the barber would use to trim my sideburns when I was a kid and went to barber shops.  I started dunking my shave-cream can in a basin of hot water to recreate that experience, but that&#x27;s dangerous, so when I saw this product, I didn&#x27;t think much about it, just ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully!  It only takes about 1 minute for the lather to heat up, and does it feel great on my face!  I think I&#x27;m getting closer shaves also.  It is terrific on winter days.  Wives, if you get one of these for your husband, he will love it, I guarantee it!  It is something he would never buy for himself but will enjoy it each time he shaves with the hot lather.  He will remember your thoughtfulness each day!  Thank you for coming up with the product.</li>
    <li> A little more than 5 years ago, received a similar model as a Father&#x27;s Day Gift.  It died.  Searched brick and mortar stores for more than a month and could not find one.  Was told it was a \\&quot;speciality\\&quot; item -- carried only around Christmas &amp; Father&#x27;s Day.  Ordered this online.  Shipped promptly and works great.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s hot lather machine just died one day and I immediately went to Amazon to see what they had.  The HLM10 by Conair filled the bill, though the reviews were not all that positive.  I beg to differ.  Given those not so positive reveiws, I warned my husband that it might squirt in all directions - though when he tried it the first time his comment was &amp;#34; Just like my 18 year old hot lather machine!!!&amp;#34;  He was thrilled as it has been using it daily now for a month and probably for another 18 years!!!!  It is a simple machine, but it makes a shave such a pleasant experience.  Thank you amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with hot lather machine.</li>
    <li> Just received my machine. The box was wrapped in a Goodwill bag and an affixed label indicated $4.99.  Could have been a return or a donation, but I don&#x27;t have confidence that it was new. If I&#x27;d known the markup was from $4.99 to over $149.00, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this item.</li>
    <li> This hot lather machine worked good and lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot lather makes a shave more comfy, this is easier than messing with hot towels-</li>
    <li> Glad that I was still able to locate one of these hot lather machines. It works better than my original one!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it.  I was concerned from some of the other reviews but it does everything it promised.</li>
    <li> 1) So difficult to get the can inside and lined up to the hole&lt;br /&gt;2) Even if you get the can connected, it falls out all the time&lt;br /&gt;3) the foam is either always cold or searing hot&lt;br /&gt;4) no way to control the temp of the lather&lt;br /&gt;5) horrible</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t shut off the first time he used it; a brandnew can of shaving cream came out everywhere.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 84 year old father who has been using this product, well, forever it seems.  The last one lasted over 15 years and he&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t be happier with this one.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This machine does not provide HOT LATHER. It serves only as a dispenser for the shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Conair Hot Lather Machine for about seven or eight years and I really enjoy using it. Personally I still apply a hot wet towel to my face before lathering up but the warm lather feels really nice on your face. It also helps to keep my face warm and I suppose my pores open. I&#x27;ve only ever used Barbasol and Gillete lathers but they both work well. It takes about 90 seconds to heat up which is just enough time for me to use my hot towel and wet my razor.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The product still works great after all these years. I&#x27;m happy with the temperature of the lather but I wouldn&#x27;t mind it if it got hotter. Definitely a product that the man in your life will appreciate. Hot lather is a luxury and not a necessity but it makes a daily routine that most men hate a little more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> The Conair Hot Lather Machine works well, the cans load easily, and the \\&quot;machine\\&quot; is reasonably attractive.  The 2 things I would change are:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It takes too long to heat up (a couple of minutes.)&lt;br /&gt;2.  When it does finally heat up, it&#x27;s not hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing the machine is set so that no one could possibly burn themselves, but it&#x27;s at the expense of the product.  All in all, it&#x27;s worth the $20.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a regular store first and then thought maybe I could find it cheaper on line. I was able to buy two for the price I payed at the regular store. These were gifts and I havn&#x27;t asked how they worked but the price was right!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the comments left by others and in the end took a chance on this.  I can say I haven&#x27;t had any trouble loading the cans of shave cream and it does heat the cream or gel to a very pleasent temp.  Many comment that it doesn&#x27;t heat to a warm enough temperature and that the cream cools off too quickly.  I can only say that I find the temperature comfortable and can&#x27;t blame the machine for how quicly the heated cream cools, my babrber&#x27;s cools off too.</li>
    <li> This conair hot lather machine is a God sent!! it is easy to use and my hubby loves it...I use it for when I shave my legs and I feel I get a closer smoother shave with the hot lather...Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have had one of these for several years now.  It has consistantly given me hot shaving lather everyday.  The one I have is starting to fail and I wanted to get a replacement and the only place I could find one is Amazon.  If you want hot shaving lather day after day I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what went on with the increase in price but I purchasesed this same exact \\&quot;conair hot lather machine\\&quot; about 3 years ago at my local \\&quot;Sears\\&quot; for $39.00. Now  this machine is going for over $150.00 bucks. I wanted to purchases one for my son but for that price I&#x27;ll take a pass. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the machine works great but the trick too a really nice hot shave is to plug this machine in  a good 5 to 10 minutes before you shave and wet you face. Again the new price is crazy... \\&quot;pel815@verizon, net \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bougth this because if I like to have warm lather.  The one I had for a long time failed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t own this product, and won&#x27;t.  The description (or comments) says it has a red pilot light that turns green when it&#x27;s ready to dispense hot lather.  I am red/green color blind.  I really hate when product makers discriminate against people like me.</li>
    <li> I have owned Conaire lather machine for many years. I purchased th replace a broken unit 7 years old. I can not&lt;br /&gt;Do without this lather machine. Very well made. Lather comes out hot, just like the barber shop</li>
    <li> Hlm10.Its worth the price,sad it was discontinued. Had mine for 4 yrs still works like a charm. Tried the new version it was horible product.</li>
    <li> I bought this gift for my dad, and he is one hard person to shop for. He loved it! I would recomend this to anyone who has a male who is hard to shop for. Men hate shaving, and this simple, yet pratical machine makes it a little easier on them. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> We bought 2 of these. Their life span seems to be 4-6 months. I would like to find one that would last a year or more.</li>
    <li> My husband had been commenting how &#x60;cold&#x27; his shaving lather is in the Winter mornings and not getting a good, close shave.  Well, with my usual investigation, I did all my homework for pricing, ease of use, reliability and a known name brand. I ordered through Amazon, but of course, the Conair HLM10R Hot Lather Machine.  Wrapped it for one of his Christmas gifts and since opening, I hear raves every day.  This hot lather dispenser will be used in spite of the cold months. Fits nice on the bathroom counter and takes up little space.  The only suggestion I can offer is to &#x27;Completely&#x27; remove the entire dispenser cap on top of the can of shaving cream -as the instructions indicate.  Hubby did not read the instructions and ended up with shave cream all over. Very good price under $15.00. Plus free shipping since I bought more things! Five stars for sure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is the second time I got this for my hubby.  The last one lasted 10 years and was still working but getting a bit grungy and the cord looked like it had better times. &lt;br /&gt;He loves this and uses it every morning and if in another 10 years he needs another, I am sure I will get it.   &lt;br /&gt;One thing, it only uses certain size cans.. so be sure that it takes the shaving cream can that you use.</li>
    <li> Thought my dad might like this, but sent him something else. My hubby is too rigid in how he does stuff to even try it. I may try it someday. So, unless a person who wants to use it themselves orders this, it&#x27;ll just be in the back of the cabinet.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely manner and is a great lather machine. The only improvements I would suggest is placing the On/Off switch on the top of the lid and not on the power cord and change the color of the Ready light from orange to green for better visibility.</li>
    <li> The web site documentation is not explicit, but the box clearly states it.</li>
    <li> I like it because it worked very well for a long time.</li>
    <li> this is a good source</li>
    <li> Beware, this product is HIGHLY OVERPRICED. You can get in any store for about $19.95. Even at that price, it&#x27;s a mediocre product.</li>
    <li> Simple yet highly effective shaving cream warmer.  This is the second Conair HLM10 I&#x27;ve had.  The first one lasted twelve years and I only got rid of it after opening it to clean it and couldn&#x27;t get it back together properly.  This machine is superior to similar ones on the market because it has heating coils that heat the entire can of shaving cream rather than just the top.  Shake it up, turn it on, and you are ready for a great shave in about two minutes.  I look forward to using this one for the next fifteen years.</li>
