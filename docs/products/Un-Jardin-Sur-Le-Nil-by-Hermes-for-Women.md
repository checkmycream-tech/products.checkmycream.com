      <li>It was a present for a very special friend, with exquisite taste, so I wanted to get something</li>

      <li>Smells more sweet with still a grass scent and being in the rain.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how it actually smells in person, except to say that it is a unique and beautiful scent.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to smell it in a store first!</li>
      <li>My All time favorite scent, Lasts a while and smells fresh and woodsy all wrapped in one.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, back to the perfume ... its fresh and clean but nuanced and sophisticated, perfect for someone my age (36) who wants to keep the mood light, but still multi-faceted.</li>
      <li>I love ordering things from Amazon, AND I discovered that I could get this perfume for less money than the department store, which was kind of amazing to me -</li>
      <li>I was looking for a nice fragrance that had high quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>At first, I was overwhelmed by the strength of the top note, but once it settled in, I was truly smitten.</li>
      <li>stars for smell - so unique.</li>
      <li>I first smelled in in a department store and fell in love.</li>
      <li>I had sampled this perfume at a department store, so I knew I would love it, but the store had been out of stock for months, and I was starting to lose hope of getting my hands on my own bottle of Un Jardin Sur Le Nil.</li>
      <li>I thought perfume was, like Kerastase products, always full price.</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean scent.</li>
      <li>It starts out with a lot of citrus fruit, which fades quickly.</li>
      <li>I like fresh scents for summer, but they can sometimes be too soapy, too sweet, or smell cliche&#x27;d.</li>
      <li>I am on my 4the bottle and will keep coming back for more!  </li>
      <li>unusual, classy, sexy.</li>
      <li>Very different and refreshing yet calm.</li>
      <li>I laughed out loud to that last bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>On time and perfect..perfect I recommend it very much.</li>
      <li>and it seems to last longer than most.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m waiting for hot weather this summer to find out.</li>
      <li>I love fragrance, I use a different one each day, rotating between 5 or 6 different scents, but this is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is very light and fresh, citrus-y and green.</li>
      <li>A real education in what a quality fragrance should smell like in all its stages.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This scent is so sophisticated and sharp.</li>
      <li>And the other one is Apres la Mousson being the most feminine of the 4.</li>
      <li>I could easily see myself using only this one fragrance &amp; being completely content.</li>
      <li>The notes are so natural and fresh that it won&#x27;t draw attention to itself, so it&#x27;s great for casual events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is the gift to my older cousin.</li>
      <li>It was designed by Hermes as a unisex collection with all 4 containing grass scent being the main note but each one adds something to the main note.</li>
      <li>Since I live in redneck-ville there are no stores to sample this perfume.</li>
      <li>I have had same btl for 3-4 years and it still smells like the first day</li>
      <li>Dept. store prices are much higher for the same value.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is simple but looks good, especially the green glow at the bottom.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little like fruit loops at first, but the dry down is very nice.</li>
      <li>It had a nice crisp smell that had me obsessed to buy this must have smell.  </li>
      <li>The smell is quite different - not too flowery, not too green but very light and airy and alluring.</li>
      <li>This is great for summer because it&#x27;s not the least bit heavy.</li>
      <li>It really is a gorgeous, complicated perfume, so I hope it works well for me.</li>
      <li>Other perfumes I like include Missoni Acqua, D&amp;G Light Blue, Chance by Chanel.</li>
      <li>Scent of mango at first, settles (on me at least) into a nice green, rivery scent.</li>
      <li>I think this perfume is a breath of fresh air in comparison to all of the other overpowering scents out there.</li>
      <li>This is the real perfume, but note: while the picture shows the larger bottle, this is the smaller 1.6oz bottle</li>
      <li>I offered my arm up to my husband&#x27;s nose for inspection &amp; he said it smells amazing &amp; expensive.</li>
      <li>I received mine much sooner than I had expected.</li>
      <li>It fades a little too quickly, but that&#x27;s the only downside.</li>
      <li>I notice the Lotus Flower &amp; Green Mango the most, but as the day progresses the scent mellows a little adding a woodsy note to the mix.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This fragrance is very light and fresh, citrus-y and green. It fades a little too quickly, but that&#x27;s the only downside.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance after reading the book The Perfect Scent by Chandler Burr. It is so wonderful and elegant. A real education in what a quality fragrance should smell like in all its stages. Buy it you will not be disappointed. Read the book to learn more about perfumes. a great read!</li>
    <li> Am sorry but it evaporate in minutes and it is too costly for this amount.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. Very different and refreshing yet calm. I get so many men and woman asking what am I wearing because it smells nice. There is 4 fragrances in this Garden Inspired Collection. This one &amp; \\&quot;Sur la Toit\\&quot;. Mediterannee one is the least feminine with grass being the strongest scent almost like if you smell like you were working in the gardin with plants, leaves and soil. And the other one is Apres la Mousson being the most feminine of the 4. Smells more sweet with still a grass scent and being in the rain. Would like to correct many that this Un Jardin collection is NOT just for women. It was designed by Hermes as a unisex collection with all 4 containing grass scent being the main note but each one adds something to the main note.</li>
    <li> I bought this based solely on the reviews; I had never actually experienced this or any other Hermes fragrance. I received the 1.6 oz eau de toilette spray in approximately 5 days &amp; I immediately sprayed it on my arm. At first, I was overwhelmed by the strength of the top note, but once it settled in, I was truly smitten. I offered my arm up to my husband&#x27;s nose for inspection &amp; he said it smells amazing &amp; expensive. I laughed out loud to that last bit.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy woodsy floral fragrances the most; this fits into that category for me. I notice the Lotus Flower &amp; Green Mango the most, but as the day progresses the scent mellows a little adding a woodsy note to the mix. I love fragrance, I use a different one each day, rotating between 5 or 6 different scents, but this is my new favorite.

    <li> My All time favorite scent, Lasts a while and smells fresh and woodsy all wrapped in one.  I am on my 4the bottle and will keep coming back for more!  Excellent Perfume!! Get lots of compliments too.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. I have had same btl for 3-4 years and it still smells like the first day I opened the bottle.</li>
    <li> I had sampled this perfume at a department store, so I knew I would love it, but the store had been out of stock for months, and I was starting to lose hope of getting my hands on my own bottle of Un Jardin Sur Le Nil. Finally a friend finally suggested I try Amazon. I love ordering things from Amazon, AND I discovered that I could get this perfume for less money than the department store, which was kind of amazing to me - I thought perfume was, like Kerastase products, always full price. From now on, I&#x27;m going to research perfume on Amazon now before buying in a department store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to the perfume ... its fresh and clean but nuanced and sophisticated, perfect for someone my age (36) who wants to keep the mood light, but still multi-faceted. Other perfumes I like include Missoni Acqua, D&amp;G Light Blue, Chance by Chanel.</li>
    <li> This scent is so sophisticated and sharp. I first smelled in in a department store and fell in love. But I&#x27;m still not certain it mixes well with my body chemistry. I&#x27;m waiting for hot weather this summer to find out. It really is a gorgeous, complicated perfume, so I hope it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Would buy it again.  Dept. store prices are much higher for the same value.  Great fragrance with lots of citrus in it. Highly recommended would not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> On time and perfect..perfect I recommend it very much. In deed it was a very good purchase. I am very happy. Thanks</li>
    <li> heavenly scent, great for summer</li>
    <li> I got this perfume after reading a lot of reviews, and did a lot of research. It was a present for a very special friend, with exquisite taste, so I wanted to get something unusual, classy, sexy. She loves it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like fresh scents for summer, but they can sometimes be too soapy, too sweet, or smell cliche&#x27;d. This is completely different. It starts out with a lot of citrus fruit, which fades quickly. The middle smells green, like plants after rain. The end is a dry incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The notes are perfectly balanced. The citrus is never too sharp, the middle is never too grassy, and the incense at the end is never too smoky. This is great for summer because it&#x27;s not the least bit heavy. The notes are so natural and fresh that it won&#x27;t draw attention to itself, so it&#x27;s great for casual events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend ordering this from Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper than you will find it anywhere else. I received mine much sooner than I had expected. Make sure to smell it in a store first!</li>
    <li> Fresh and clean scent. Discovered it while checking out some fragrances in a department store recently. Normally I get turned by the dry down but not this time. It was lovely. I kept smelling my wrist where I sprayed some of this wonderfully light and delicious scent. It had a nice crisp smell that had me obsessed to buy this must have smell.  I bought it and am happy I did. It&#x27;s one of those scents that makes you happy every time you catch a whif of the fragrance on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I read the book The Perfect Scent which highlighted this perfume and always wanted to try it. Since I live in redneck-ville there are no stores to sample this perfume. So I bought it scent un-smelled. It&#x27;s a little like fruit loops at first, but the dry down is very nice.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t open the bottle. I hope everything is great. this is the gift to my older cousin. It is good.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance,love it</li>
    <li> AMAZING fragrance&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for smell - so unique. nothing like it&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for staying power tho...so expensive considering it is not long wearing</li>
    <li> Scent of mango at first, settles (on me at least) into a nice green, rivery scent. Light and spring-y, beautiful. I have been wearing it for a year and a half and am still smitten.</li>
    <li> It just did not appeal to me.  Reminded me of a past furniture polish.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. It feels like summer time. The bottle is simple but looks good, especially the green glow at the bottom.</li>
    <li> This is the real perfume, but note: while the picture shows the larger bottle, this is the smaller 1.6oz bottle</li>
    <li> Hola! este perfume e uns dos meu preferido!&lt;br /&gt;Sua fragrância me atrai, me sinto mais feminina, sexy..quando uso este perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Um abraço perfumado&lt;br /&gt;Marilene Pontes</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice fragrance that had high quality ingredients. This is it!  The smell is quite different - not too flowery, not too green but very light and airy and alluring. Perfect for warm climates and it seems to last longer than most. I get many compliments from both men and women when I wear it either for day or night. It is not overpowering or offensive. Perfect!!</li>
    <li> Always love its smell for summer.</li>
</ol>
