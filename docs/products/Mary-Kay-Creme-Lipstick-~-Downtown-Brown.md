    <li> This stuff is the best.  A terrific warm winter color that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; on your lips. Fast delivery.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I wear this lipstick all the time!! Great product!! Love it and love the color. Would recommend to anyone.  THanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a Mary Kay consultant, but in the meantime I needed my favorite lipstick and that is Downtown Brown.  Was glad to find it on Amazon and the price was reasonable.  I got it in a timely fashion and am enjoying wearing it.  This is the only lipstick that doesn&#x27;t contribute to my lips being chapped.</li>
    <li> Nice price and new as promised</li>

    <li> This has been my go to lipstick for years. Glad I can find it here instead of having to find a Mary Kay consultant!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really care for this color, extremely dark for fair skin.  I was looking for something different, this color is.</li>
    <li> Its nice, I was just hoping it was more brown, it has more of a rust look.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for me. I use this over clear Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm to give it a bit of shine. I use all lipsticks this way. It&#x27;s less sticky than a gloss and less matte and intense than lipstick. This shade is perfect right out of the tube. I apply lightly over balm and it&#x27;s the perfect, neutral shade. It can go darker if you don&#x27;t use the balm underneath. I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and the 2 Mary Kay lipsticks I ordered do not bother my lips....Yay !!! I use this with the silver lid Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s lipbalm for ultra sensitive lips. I sometimes apply a lighter shade on top for a more nude lip. If you&#x27;re fragrance sensitive, this is recommended !</li>
    <li> Timely and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is amazing. My mom uses it everyday but she was running out so I quickly got on Amazon and found it... I never told her so when I got it I said this is for you but I can&#x27;t tell you what it is. So she opened it and was so.happy!!! Thank you Amazon you help me get the perfect gift and had cheap prices too!!! The Mary Kay constants are useless and rip you off you spend $10 on Amazon and $20 with real Mary Kay people!!!</li>
