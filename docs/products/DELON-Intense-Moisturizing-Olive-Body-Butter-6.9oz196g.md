      <li>This body butter is the best by far!!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a very light scent, and doesn&#x27;t smell anything like olives to me.  </li>
      <li>I was specting something more creamy.</li>
      <li>It really smooths your skin and works great on feet, elbows, knees and my hands.  </li>
      <li>My favorite of the Delon scents.</li>
      <li>Just love it!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>She has used it before and wanted more.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the Olive, but the fruits and florals have a light scent that is not at all overpowering.</li>
      <li>Costco turned out to sell this in a pack of 6 at a very good price so that&#x27;s the place to go if you wanna save money specially if you use this daily.</li>
      <li>This one is still my absolute favorite!  </li>
      <li>Really enjoy this product and so do all the gals to whom I gave it as a gift.</li>
      <li>Overall is a great product, No animal cruelty, dermathologist tested, and contains dimethicone.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh, woodsy-type fragrance, but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>They are rich and creamy, without being too thick, They spread nicely, feel great, leaving my skin soft and supple, and the scent&#x27;s are all pleasant without being overbearing.</li>
      <li>I say definitely give it a try, because I&#x27;ve never met anyone who hasn&#x27;t liked this!</li>
      <li>I have migraines and asthma and cannot wear a lot of perfumes or body sprays because the smell is too powerful and strong.</li>
      <li>This is rich and thick body butter and it smells wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Olive is the best smell out of all the body butter because it is subtle and feel cools to touch when applied on the skin.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased this many times and LOVE the smell; however this recent order was defective.  </li>
      <li>Since I started using body butter every morning and most nights the condition has completely disappeared!</li>
      <li>It is non-greasy and soaks right in.</li>
      <li>(so far Olive is my favorite, however, I enjoy the Coconut and Vanilla as well), feels soft and luxurious and feels like I am pampering my skin.</li>
      <li>I use this specially when I am deployed in the Middle East because the weather there really dries out the skin on top of the dust and desert sun.  </li>
      <li>I hope that the body butter never gets discontinued, because it&#x27;s the only of Delon+&#x27;s that I absolutely LOVE.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a scent you love that doesn&#x27;t smell like cocoa butter, I would definitely choose this.</li>
      <li>(altitude).&lt;br /&gt;I tried other scents such as coconut and mango, olive scent is far the best.</li>
      <li>Love it, arrived quickly, sooner than expected!</li>
      <li>The scent is something that I can&#x27;t really describe.  </li>
      <li>Really soften and nourish the skin but is not greasy&lt;</li>
      <li>Received the product as a gift, really liked it, but found that it was not locally available.  </li>
      <li>Got it as a white elephant at Bunco originally</li>
      <li>This left my skin feeling smooth and soft without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brand.</li>
      <li>The other scents in the pack: vanilla, coconut, and mango weren&#x27;t nearly as heavily scented or as pleasant of a scent.</li>
      <li>The smell is subtle so that people who are sensitive to smells should be able to tolerate this well.</li>
      <li>It has really helped my dry skin.</li>
      <li>I generally don&#x27;t like perfumed creams</li>
      <li>The Delon butter is even more scented than the Victoria&#x27;s Secret and at a fraction of the price.</li>

    <li> Fantastic body lotion, incredible texture and sent. Just love it!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets very dry from swimming and spending time in the mountains (altitude).&lt;br /&gt;I tried other scents such as coconut and mango, olive scent is far the best.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this product and so do all the gals to whom I gave it as a gift. I have tried several fragrances and like them all. It has really helped my dry skin. Got it as a white elephant at Bunco originally and I love it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this many times and LOVE the smell; however this recent order was defective.  It smelled TERRIBLE, old and rancid and disgusting.  I returned it immediately and received a refund but probably wont try again because of the hassle.</li>
    <li> I work at Bath and Body Works, so needless to say, I&#x27;m exposed to so many different fragrances every day.  This one is still my absolute favorite!  It was given to me as a gift several years ago and since then, I keep buying it online because it&#x27;s not available in any stores near me.  I was scared for a bit because I was afraid that it was going away since it was harder to find.  I hope that the body butter never gets discontinued, because it&#x27;s the only of Delon+&#x27;s that I absolutely LOVE.  The online prices are very good!  If you bought Bath and Body Work&#x27;s Body Butter, it would be $15 a container... $10 is an amazingly good deal!  The scent is something that I can&#x27;t really describe.  The Body Shop has an olive body butter out as well, but it doesn&#x27;t come close to this.  It&#x27;s a very fresh, woodsy-type fragrance, but not overpowering.  But don&#x27;t worry to those who don&#x27;t like fragrances that smell like food; this one doesn&#x27;t!  I say definitely give it a try, because I&#x27;ve never met anyone who hasn&#x27;t liked this!</li>
    <li> I was specting something more creamy. Overall is a great product, No animal cruelty, dermathologist tested, and contains dimethicone.&lt;br /&gt;******************************* 3 months later&lt;br /&gt;Works wonder, I gave it a 4 stars now I will change it to 5 stars,&lt;br /&gt;last all day, and moistures.</li>
    <li> Olive is the best smell out of all the body butter because it is subtle and feel cools to touch when applied on the skin.  It really smooths your skin and works great on feet, elbows, knees and my hands.  I use this specially when I am deployed in the Middle East because the weather there really dries out the skin on top of the dust and desert sun.  I gave some to my friends who were deployed with me and after a week they were ordering this on the net for themselves.  Costco turned out to sell this in a pack of 6 at a very good price so that&#x27;s the place to go if you wanna save money specially if you use this daily.</li>
    <li> Really soften and nourish the skin but is not greasy&lt;br /&gt;It is almost neutral when it comes to smell, fragrance. I generally don&#x27;t like perfumed creams</li>
    <li> I adore this product; it&#x27;s been a few years since I ordered it; thank you for reminding me about it. It arrived quickly and the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> I was worried about how this olive butter would smell, but it&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s a very light scent, and doesn&#x27;t smell anything like olives to me.  This is the best body butter that I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s so moisturizing and never leaves me feeling greasy.  Great product for the price!</li>

    <li> This body butter is the best by far!! Nothing compares to it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, but the cost is somewhat expensive for the rate at which I used it. Since this is the only place where I could find the Olive scent, I decided to order it from here. It IS very good quality though. If you are looking for a scent you love that doesn&#x27;t smell like cocoa butter, I would definitely choose this.</li>
    <li> Received the product as a gift, really liked it, but found that it was not locally available.  Being able to order the exact product from Amazon, at an affordable price, made me very happy!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good.... not perfumey.....</li>
    <li> My boyfriend scalded his hands on a kettle from the stream they immediately blistered. Using only this olive body butter they healed the burn in four days!!</li>
    <li> this is just the best body butter Delon makes the best this one smell s so good and feels good too  Thank you for a Great product</li>
    <li> It is good stuff - gift for wife! She has used it before and wanted more. Price was fair, too.</li>
    <li> This is rich and thick body butter and it smells wonderful.  My favorite of the Delon scents.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this body butter I purchased the variety-5 pack to give away as gifts. I ended up keeping the olive butter because it smelled so good and I figured no one else would want it. As soon as I smelled it I KNEW I had smelled this smell before, then it hit me. It is a DEAD RINGER for Victoria&#x27;s Secret perfume \\&quot;Dream Angels Heavenly\\&quot;. I happen to own this perfume so I compared the Dream Angels Heavenly lotion with the Delon Olive Body Butter and they were practically indistinguishable. The Delon butter is even more scented than the Victoria&#x27;s Secret and at a fraction of the price. The other scents in the pack: vanilla, coconut, and mango weren&#x27;t nearly as heavily scented or as pleasant of a scent. I recommend this body butter in Olive 100%. It is non-greasy and soaks right in. It has a great smell which requires no perfume because you will smell so lovely all day from this!</li>
    <li> The Delon+ body butter is wonderful. This feels luxurious without having an overpowering fragrance and the smell is soft and delicate. This left my skin feeling smooth and soft without feeling greasy. The smell is subtle so that people who are sensitive to smells should be able to tolerate this well. I have migraines and asthma and cannot wear a lot of perfumes or body sprays because the smell is too powerful and strong. Delon Body Butter Olive smells great (so far Olive is my favorite, however, I enjoy the Coconut and Vanilla as well), feels soft and luxurious and feels like I am pampering my skin. I highly recommend this brand. I have tried the Vanilla and the Coconut too and have just ordered the Olive Body Butter.</li>
    <li> Love it, arrived quickly, sooner than expected! Great for skin, will order again, soon! Loved the gift that was included!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing - expensive for such a small amount, but keeps your skin moisturized for a long time</li>
