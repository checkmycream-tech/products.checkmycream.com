      <li>Very good magnification, but reflections blur when mirror is angled.</li>
      <li>The 10X mirror is great.  </li>
      <li>Instated of this company should give good adjustable stand so we can set it height as we need....</li>
      <li>The adjustable stand is also a good thing.</li>
      <li>It is a really good design for a portable make up mirror.  </li>
      <li>I am happy and satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The 10x magnification is amazing.</li>
      <li>The mirror swivels nice.</li>
      <li>It fits nicely on my dressing area at home.</li>
      <li>The light is as bright as a firefly however.</li>
      <li>The lights are okay, but I would have liked to see more of them.  </li>
      <li>i love this mirror and wish i could still find them</li>
      <li>I have used this mirror for the last 10 years and it is excellent.  </li>
      <li>i adore being able to see skin problems as well as out of place eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>this is sort of a love/hate realtionship - ladies over 50 will understand this - glad</li>
      <li>The optical quality is very good especially for this price range.  </li>
      <li>But, overall it is a very good value for the price.</li>
      <li>It packs easily for trips.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, easy to work with, but plastic stand not adjustable and</li>
      <li>mirror is light-weight and fits easily in under the sink cabinet when not in use.  </li>
      <li>The stand is convenient for free hand zit popping.</li>
      <li>up mirror rotates so the light can be used on both magnifications</li>
      <li>However the light is so week that I never use it.  </li>
      <li>Regardless and overall, it is a good mirror.</li>
      <li>After Christmas, I went to Amazon.com to see if I could find one at a more reasonable price than I have seen in retail.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product for those of us over 40 who need a little help seeing our imperfections.</li>
      <li>If you owned one of these in the past, be advised that the newer one, altho it appears identical, has light bulbs that are not as bright as the older ones.</li>
      <li>I ordered another one for her and tried to return the first.</li>
      <li>I thought the first mirror was defective; I just returned the replacement mirror and hope to get my refund soon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>first I hesitated to order of 10X</li>
      <li>This is a good mirror and the base is great.  </li>
      <li>They could have left the light out and reduced the price.</li>
      <li>After much prodding, she admitted that she couldn&#x27;t see with the mirror, the lights didn&#x27;t shine on the viewing area.</li>
      <li>For the 10x side to work, you have to bring it real close to your face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a functional mirror, that&#x27;s about the only purpose it serves, I wanted a mirror with a light</li>
      <li>Not only does the light stink, but it died within weeks of purchasing it.  </li>
      <li>I discovered something even better -  a hand mirror with 10X magnification at less than 20% of the price of a standing one.  </li>
      <li>Decent mirror.</li>
      <li>Zadro replaced the first mirror I bought -- I thought one of bands would light up but the only light is from 2 small buttons on the front of the unit.  </li>
      <li>and it is so easy to swivel from one side to the other.</li>
      <li>The next time I visited, I checked the mirror and sure enough, the lights were dim.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>The light does not really help much however I use it occasionally.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I would have a problem with is that the light is not very bright or powerful.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase this mirror - best money I have ever spent.</li>
      <li>I have problem to see clear while shaving.</li>
      <li>The light was so dim that it hardly made a difference in a dimly lit bathroom with CFLs.  </li>
      <li>I suppose if you needed to illuminate AND magnify something deep in a dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and only had this mirror with batteries installed, you may actually have praise for the light feature.</li>
      <li>It might allow you to see a little better if you were trying to use the mirror in pitch dark but it hardly adds any noticeable light in normal to low lighting.  </li>
      <li>The light provided is just two small lights that really do not provide any benefit</li>
      <li>The light provides only limited illumination to a small area and could be improved in future products.  </li>
      <li>-  only lights up the very bottom of mirror and unable to utilize the full mirror.  </li>

<li> -  only lights up the very bottom of mirror and unable to utilize the full mirror.  </li>

<li> However, it&#x27;s just a couple small LED lights that put out little light.</li>

<li> no luck, it never got wet.  </li>

<li> This product is not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
<li> The mirror is heavy due to the lighting feature and the batteries.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s been difficult to find 10X mirrors and their costs have been too high for me to justify the purchase.  </li>
<li> Lights are not worth putting buying the batteries for!</li>
<li> the only problem i encountered was the flap for the battery insert was tough to remove and replace.  </li>
<li> , don&#x27;t waste your money on this, it&#x27;s a glorified hand mirror.</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; portion is to small lights where the handle connects to the mirror.  </li>
<li> Even in the dark!!!</li>
<li> but it is not handy.</li>
<li> I am not happy with it&#x27;s Led Light,it is useless.</li>
<li> angle is difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> When it arrived, I was very disappointed in its function.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The lighting on product is unsatisfactory  -  only lights up the very bottom of mirror and unable to utilize the full mirror.  Would like to return so please advise in what way to send back and be reimbursed.</li>
    <li> It packs easily for trips. It fits nicely on my dressing area at home. Magnification is just right without being scary.</li>
    <li> Decent mirror. I don&#x27;t use the stand since the angle doesn&#x27;t work for my bathroom. For the 10x side to work, you have to bring it real close to your face. I just end up using it as a basic hand mirror with the 1x side. And yeah, those lights are tiny, so don&#x27;t think of them as a factor when deciding whether to buy this or not.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this mirror from Brookstone at the mall.  I have used this mirror for the last 10 years and it is excellent.  The battery life on the mirror also lasts quite a long time.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase this mirror - best money I have ever spent.</li>
    <li> This is a good mirror and the base is great.  Alows you to use both hands without holding the mirror.  However the light is so week that I never use it.  They could have left the light out and reduced the price.</li>
    <li> i love this mirror and wish i could still find them</li>
    <li> If you owned one of these in the past, be advised that the newer one, altho it appears identical, has light bulbs that are not as bright as the older ones.</li>
    <li> The optical quality is very good especially for this price range.  The light provides only limited illumination to a small area and could be improved in future products.  But, overall it is a very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> The 10X mirror is great.  It is a definite plus that it runs on batteries.  This makes it convenient for travel.  The lights are okay, but I would have liked to see more of them.  It is a really good design for a portable make up mirror.  The adjustable stand is also a good thing.</li>
    <li> Very good magnification, but reflections blur when mirror is angled. The stand is convenient for free hand zit popping. The light is as bright as a firefly however. I suppose if you needed to illuminate AND magnify something deep in a dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and only had this mirror with batteries installed, you may actually have praise for the light feature. Of course, if you happened to be lost in that deep dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and wanted the light of the mirror to actually help you illuminate anything other than your nose, you would be as disappointed with the light as at almost any other time. Save your batteries. Regardless and overall, it is a good mirror.</li>
    <li> I have been pricing mirrors on stands that provide lighting and magnification.  It&#x27;s been difficult to find 10X mirrors and their costs have been too high for me to justify the purchase.  After Christmas, I went to Amazon.com to see if I could find one at a more reasonable price than I have seen in retail.  I discovered something even better -  a hand mirror with 10X magnification at less than 20% of the price of a standing one.  I only require magnification that high for a few jobs, so a handheld was a terrific option.  Amazon expanded my shopping choices from the comfort of my home.</li>
    <li> I have problem to see clear while shaving. I use 7X but it is not handy. I found this product on amazon.com first I hesitated to order of 10X but when I received the product, my hesitation gone. I am happy and satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I like it feature:&lt;br /&gt;Make-up mirror rotates so the light can be used on both magnifications&lt;br /&gt;Vanity stand to be used on on a counter top&lt;br /&gt;Use as a hand held mirror&lt;br /&gt;Optical quality glass&lt;br /&gt;Patented design allows for mirror to swivel 360 degrees&lt;br /&gt;8\\&quot; x 14\\&quot; x 2 1/2\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;But I am not happy with it&#x27;s Led Light,it is useless. Instated of this company should give good adjustable stand so we can set it height as we need....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a functional mirror, that&#x27;s about the only purpose it serves, I wanted a mirror with a light so I could see the back of my hair while styling, this product (even when it was working) couldn&#x27;t even do that.  The light was so dim that it hardly made a difference in a dimly lit bathroom with CFLs.  Not only does the light stink, but it died within weeks of purchasing it.  Replaced the batteries and cleaned the contacts no luck, it never got wet.  I&#x27;m a tech so I know how to treat electronics, don&#x27;t waste your money on this, it&#x27;s a glorified hand mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those of us over 40 who need a little help seeing our imperfections. I use it daily and it is so easy to swivel from one side to the other. The light does not really help much however I use it occasionally. This is a great product for the money, I even bought one for my mother and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these mirrors for my mom and one for me. After much prodding, she admitted that she couldn&#x27;t see with the mirror, the lights didn&#x27;t shine on the viewing area. The next time I visited, I checked the mirror and sure enough, the lights were dim. I ordered another one for her and tried to return the first. The price had gone up $5 and there is a return fee. I just ordered another one, it didn&#x27;t work either. Out of three mirrors, one worked sporadically. I boxed up the other two and sent them back with a letter. I was never reimbursed, didn&#x27;t get the mirrors back and didn&#x27;t hear from the company.     Crappy mirrors, crappy service.</li>
    <li> I use this hand held to apply make-up and tweeze eyebrows.  The 10x side is perfect for tweezing and applying mascara.  Lights are not worth putting buying the batteries for!</li>
    <li> this mirror is wonderful!  i adore being able to see skin problems as well as out of place eyebrows.  this is sort of a love/hate realtionship - ladies over 50 will understand this - glad i can see the problems but wish they did not exist!  mirror is light-weight and fits easily in under the sink cabinet when not in use.  the only problem i encountered was the flap for the battery insert was tough to remove and replace.  i recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror is heavy due to the lighting feature and the batteries. The light provided is just two small lights that really do not provide any benefit</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a lighted handheld mirror for my mom.  When it arrived, I was very disappointed in its function.  The &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; portion is to small lights where the handle connects to the mirror.  It might allow you to see a little better if you were trying to use the mirror in pitch dark but it hardly adds any noticeable light in normal to low lighting.  This product is not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because of the lighted feature.  However, it&#x27;s just a couple small LED lights that put out little light.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to work with, but plastic stand not adjustable and angle is difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appears that Zadro is discontinuing this mirror and they should not as it is the only mirror with this design.</li>
    <li> I can see myself!!!!! Even in the dark!!! And if I turn it over, Parts of me look bigger. Wow!</li>
    <li> The mirror swivels nice. The 10x magnification is amazing. The only thing that I would have a problem with is that the light is not very bright or powerful.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS MIRROR!  Zadro replaced the first mirror I bought -- I thought one of bands would light up but the only light is from 2 small buttons on the front of the unit.  I thought the first mirror was defective; I just returned the replacement mirror and hope to get my refund soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen C.</li>
