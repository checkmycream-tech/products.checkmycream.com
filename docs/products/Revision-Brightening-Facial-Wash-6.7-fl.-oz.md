<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks &amp; I have not seen any results! I&#x27;ve tried using it as a rub-on with my fingertips,  as well as with my rotating scrub pads. Unless there&#x27;s a 4-week acclimation period, this is the most ineffective solution ever. My dark spots are still present, I am the same skin shade as before, there is no evidence of clarity, fading, lightning, smoothing, revitalization....NOTHING! I&#x27;  not sure if there&#x27;s a money back guarantee....but...it wasn&#x27;t worth any money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the great user reviews.  I have been using Sisley and Obaji face wash products and found them a bit dry (although I am not unhappy with them).  On a search on Amazon.com, this product popped up as a 5-star face wash.  I thought I would give it a shot.  The first day when I used it, I was so happy with it.  It cleaned well, smelled good and did not leave my face dry.  And then I used for a few more days and it started to feel a bit dry after wash.  And strange allergic-like reaction happened that I had little bumps and redness on my face.  I stop using it immediately and luckily, my face returned back to normal after a few days.  I was just curious so I read the ingredients: there&#x27;s a 2% Salicylic acid which is great for younger/acne skin but, I guess, not for sensitive skin.  My skin is sensitive and also recently on Retin-A.  I maybe react to other ingredients but I am not equipped to understand all the long-name chemicals in this product.  I am writing this review because on Amazon.com, there&#x27;s no product info, other than:  &amp;#34;Brand new in a sealed box. Full size 7 oz. Buy now and it ships now. Enjoy Better Skin, an authorized medical dealer!&amp;#34;  I hope this will be helpful to those who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> mild gentle, non greasy</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it is soft and gentle on my skin, and seems to just lighten up some of the sun damage in the summer.</li>
    <li> Use this product in the morning and evening. Has brightened the appearance of my complexion. It lasts a long time as only a dime size amount is needed.</li>
    <li> First time using this and very happy with this cleanser. I am a fan of all the Revision products, especially the Intellishade moisturizing tinted sunscreen, and highly recommend them all.</li>
    <li> My skin is clear - love this facial wash!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after I got a sample by my skin professional. I have a Combination skin. Product dont leave me with dry skin, and after using it for three months my skin is brighter. The bottle has enough product for a few months</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product, and stated that she had been on the same bottle for over a year. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a week but I love that you only need about a dime/nickel size to wash your face thoroughly. The fragrance is not over powering. My face isn&#x27;t overly dry and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to slather on moisturizer afterwards. I notice that my skin does seem to be brighter. (however I am using another new retinol product that may contribute to this, but I like the results either way)</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year after my best friend (who works for a dermatologist) gave it to me to clear up my skin.  After I turned 30, my skin just started exploding and I couldn&#x27;t find ANYTHING to clear it up - it was like \\&quot;mid-life acne\\&quot;!  A year later, my skin is perfectly clear and you couldn&#x27;t pay me to try something different!  I also use the tinted moisturizer and nectifirm - also great products!  You will love this stuff!</li>
    <li> my wife loves it, thank you!</li>
    <li> smells great&lt;br /&gt;cleans very well&lt;br /&gt;perfect for normal to oily skin</li>
    <li> I had used this about a year ago as I use other Revision products that work well on my skin and with my complexion.  Not sure why I stopped using this as it is very gentle, smells great, lathers well and makes my skin feel and look great.  Brighter as they say.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my esthetician because I have dry skin, and because I want a face wash that will help boost cellular turnover. I would only like it better if this were safe for removing eye make up but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because it contains glycolic acid. Otherwise, the scent is nice, the texture is nice, etc etc.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial wash on the market hands down. makes my skin really soft and lightens my complexion a bit</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by the person who I get facials from, and it works wonders.  Far better and more reasonably priced than most products out there.</li>
    <li> I had been using md forte glycolic face wash for about 10 years &amp; was horrified they discontinued it. My dermatologist recommended it for my adult acne &amp; it worked great, so feared I&#x27;d never find such an effective cleanser that didn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin. She researched other products &amp; recommended this - I&#x27;ve been using it for a month &amp; love it. It keeps my acne away &amp; leaves a healthy clean glow without stripping my face dry. But I know not to combine this with retin a products. I only use it at night &amp;I Definitely wear sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is powerful stuff!  I am very happy with it, but I must use it only 3 days a week.  My skin is very delicate.  I broke out for a few days while this facial wash deep cleaned my pours.  This is a great product as are all the Revision products I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser that is not at all drying. I love the way my skin feels after I use it. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was terrible! I immediately broke out in a bloody rash all over my face! My face was ruined for about a week and had to go to the dermatologist for help!</li>
    <li> Wow! I can&#x27;t believe how fast I received item -- great delivery and great product!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks --</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my complextion it nutralizes the oils in my face, it makes my face real clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I had been given a sample of this cleanser from a skin care clinic.  I was very happy to find out that I could buy it online for a better price.  It is great smelling and makes my skin feel very clean.</li>
    <li> I love the way my face feels after using it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now. My face always feels better at the end of the day after my brightening wash. HUGE fan!</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle at my dermatologist for adult acne and glad I can purchase through Amazon as well. This cleanser may be a little drying for some but works well for me. My face feels refreshed and toned after using. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I immediately noticed the difference in this product, my co-workers noticed my face was more radiant without me saying anything about the product. I am very pleased</li>
    <li> A small pump for dispensing would be nice.  It has changed the texture of my skin to very smooth.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Just have to stay committed to using it daily and keep the face away from the sun at all cost.</li>
    <li> While I never made the purchase because I chose some other revision products over this because of $$ and I already had a decent face wash at home.  My dermatologist gave me 4 samples of this to try and by the second bottle I could tell a difference in the brightening appearance in my face and the reduction of rosacea on my cheeks.  When I need face wash again, this will be my go to brand.</li>
    <li> I have used up 2 sample bottles and am now ready to buy the full size. My personal issue has always been mascara removal. Every makeup remover is either oily or it just doesn&#x27;t work. I wear contacts and maybe that&#x27;s why but I always feel that they leave a film and the mascara still needs to be completely wiped off with tissue or cotton balls. Years ago, I even stayed at a darling motel owned by a gay couple and there were signs everywhere, \\&quot;No makeup on towels, it&#x27;s impossible for us to get out\\&quot;. Since then, I&#x27;ve actually traveled with my own washcloth. Anyway, this product is AMAZING! You only use a drop (seriously, a drop of shampoo-like consistency) and then wash and rinse your face. No scrubbing. No wiping. Just dry and admire your skin. Every person has their top 10 highest value/most loved items list and this is now on mine.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I keep this in the shower and have encouraged my husband to use it. He has oily skin but with the daily use of this product, I see fewer whiteheads on his face. For me, my skin feels soft and clean! The fragrance is a light orange and it only takes a dab for each use. Love this products.</li>
    <li> Not only does my skin feel extra clean, but this brightening wp wash really is lightening up some of my hyper-pigmentation. Great product!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed they discontinued making their alpha cleanser and tried this because they said it was the same, feels harsh on skin, and didn&#x27;t work well with my super sensitive skin. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I bought the revision for my teenage daughter.  It definitely cleared up her acne but one side effect is that it also faded away her freckles.  Unexpected, but she doesn&#x27;t mind a bit!</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash, because I like to use a facial wash that has suds and isn&#x27;t drying.  This product provides both for me.  I&#x27;m not sure if my face is &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;, but I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful, but after a few washes it really dried out my skin.  I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I have had acne for 18 years. I took Accutane twice.  I always have clogged pores at work from my dental mask.&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this face wash and each facial I get, I am informed my pores have shrunk and are not nearly as clogged as the time before or the time before that.&lt;br /&gt;It is very expensive but it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Normally I use a facial wash that also takes off make up. Revision does the same thing but with added benefits to my skin. It&#x27;s about 3 weeks in use and yes I will order it again. I like the fresh look it gives my face after washing with this brightening product.</li>
    <li> Medspa is AMAZING to order from, and this facial wash is absolutely fabulous.  I hit my mid 30&#x27;s and developed acne though I NEVER had it before!!!  This face wash with CeraVe facial lotion and a clarisonic brush have done WONDERS!!!  You don&#x27;t use a lot- just a dimes amount is all that is needed- so the price is not extravagant as this bottle will last a while.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the feel and scent of the face-wash my aesthetician uses on me when I have had a treatment.  Found out that it is Revision Brightening Facial Wash so looked it up on Amazon and found it for much less than at the spa.  Not one bit of dryness after washing and I have very dry skin.  No residue either - just fresh, clean skin ready for the next step.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist and it truely does brighten my face.  A very mild cleanser and makes my skin feel clean and smooth while lightening some darker age spots.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product really does brighten my skin.  It has a pleasant scent and is a bit thicker than most liquid cleansers which makes it easier to use because it doesn&#x27;t just roll off your skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favourite cleansers , gentle yet it does what it says in its title - brightens the face. I mix it with Eminence strawberry rhubarb dermafoliant to make what I think is the best cleanser and exfolialtor  for my skin- older, sensitive and fine pores. I have tried many many products and I am very heavy on good result. That is what I look for. After all  that is what it is all about -the result and the products I give 5 stars to get results , they do what they say they will do.</li>
    <li> I should have read the entire description which stated that it was not for dry or sensitive skin..my mistake..it might be good for oily skin</li>
    <li> This is and always will be a repurchase for me.  It cleanses the face and does brighten as well.  Free shipping with prime, so you can&#x27;t find it cheaper elsewhere.  Pleasant citrus scent as well!</li>
    <li> Recommended by friend! I love how it makes my face feel and look. Takes care of all my redness and dull areas.</li>
    <li> This product has kept my skin free and clear of post baby acne. I like to use this with my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> My skin too sensitive. I can only use this 2x wk</li>
    <li> Well I guess I&#x27;m kind of picky when it comes to facial cleansers and this product exceeded my expectations.  I will be ordering it again and I probably will even try some of the company&#x27;s other products.  I do feel like my complexion is brighter, my skin is smoother and I love the smell.  I didn&#x27;t get to use the company&#x27;s previous product that this replaced so I can&#x27;t compare it like some of the other reviewers are able to but I really do like it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with product.  My skin felt great for the first 2 weeks but upon further use, I would wake up to wrinkled skin around my eyes.  I stopped using it for a while then resumed and unfortantely the wrinkles came back.  I also attempted to avoid the eye area without any luck.</li>
    <li> the whole line is great and very fairly priced. Instant results on the wash.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a friend who works at a salon and my face feels so clean when I use it. Lots of bubbles and smells phenominal I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change, though t be fair I am not very routine about using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**note** The lid cracked all the way across the top when I screwed it on once.</li>
    <li> I have used many facial washes through the years......yes I&#x27;m over 50 years old. This is by far the best. It removes facial makeup as well as mascara better than any other that I have used.</li>
    <li> fast shipment , arrived as described</li>
    <li> Love love love this facial wash...smells wonderful and really does a great job at removing my makeup and leaves my face feeling great.</li>
    <li> Was paying more for this product at my Dermatologists office and had to fight traffic for 20 minutes one way just to get it. I like the way it cleans my skin gently and my skin tone does seem clearer after continued use with other products from this line.</li>
    <li> Love this. does not dry skin and removes makeup.</li>
    <li> the name of this product is exactly what it does. It&#x27;s brightening effect is very noticeable after the first use. The most important thing in my on personal opinion is that I believe that anyone can use this facial wash. I do  try other facial cleansers but I keep reaching for the Revision. It cleans without stripping the natural oils on your face. one bottle last a long time because a little is all you need. It&#x27;s an all in one a great makeup remover and cleanser in one.</li>
    <li> This is a great night cleanser for dry skin because it leaves my skin smooth and softer.  It takes makeup off and is not a problem even removing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I use many of their products and this is the only one that has made my dry skin break out:(</li>
    <li> Great productive. Have been using for 3 yrs. now. Definitely helps my face glow!!</li>
    <li> Received product very quickly. Everything was great!</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I love the texture.  Originally purchased this product from my dermatologist.  She has since created her own brand of facial cleanser which is crazy overpriced.  Too bad this product is no longer available.  ANYWHERE!!!!  Sucks.</li>
    <li> I believe in this brand - I decided to try this facial wash and so far I have no complaints. I have Rosacea so its very hard to find something my skin wont be irritated with. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin softer.. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I haven&#x27;t been able to use it&lt;br /&gt;since my dermatologist quit carrying a year ago. My face hasn&#x27;t been happy so I looked on Amazon and voila! Received it 2 days ago and&lt;br /&gt;my complexion is already improved!</li>
    <li> I love this facial wash. It&#x27;s a mild soap, gentle on my skin and removes makeup well.  It has a mild citrus smell which is  pleasant.  I have combination skin and am over 55.  I do feel my skin is brighter, cleaner and doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  Helps reduce excess oil around T zone area. I mostly use it with my Clarisonic brush. I will purchase it again. Best I&#x27;ve found in a long time.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this product. I do believe it lightened freckles and areas showing age. I was given a tester at an event and each time I used it I thought I saw results. I decided I wanted a full bottle. I think the scent is nice and the texture is nice. My skin feels very clean with it.  Your skin will feel a little dry so follow up with a moisturizer.  I later started mixing it with an exfoliator followed by RetinA and cream. Together it&#x27;s a great regiment.</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my slightly oily, clog prone but sensitive skin and works nicely!  Not sure how much &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; my skin is but it cleans well, doesn&#x27;t sting the sensitive skin or clog pores.  No noticeable smell either which I prefer.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser only takes a small amount to make my face clean and fresh.  Takes off all my make up without over stripping it. Face is not taunt. ..just fresh and beautifully clean.  Lovin &#x27; this cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST face wash I have ever used.  I use it every morning and at night (with my clarisonic).  I have never had a breakout since I started using it.  I tend to have oily skin that is sensitive and this product has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Really great facial wash, it really does make your skin brighter. I started noticing the difference after just 1 week. Only little tiny bit is required. It worth the money because of how great your skin looks and feels after using it.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It keeps my skin clear and bright and does not dry it out.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works really well for my sensitive skin and smells good. Revision keeps my face clear with a natural glow bonus!</li>
    <li> I am using the entire Revision system after seeing in my dermatologist office.  I use the recommendations for anti aging and after 1 month I am very pleased. The Brightening Facial Wash makes my face feel really clean and it does look brighter - especially around  my eyes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feels less oily and doesn&#x27;t cause breakout.</li>
    <li> I love  the  fragrance  and the  tingling  feel.Wonderful  line  of  products.</li>
    <li> Smells so clean, and it feels so good on my skin, cant wait to see the long term results.</li>
    <li> Have not yet used 50% of the bottle, however, am extremely pleased so far.</li>
    <li> Best face wash ever! I love this face wash! I&#x27;ve been using it for years! I used to buy it at my dermatologists office, but it&#x27;s a lot cheaper on here!</li>
    <li> Am a little confused by all of the great reviews for this product. I have been using it for several months now in the morning and it is alright, however I can&#x27;t tell any kind of difference between this and any other face wash that I have used (which have all been much less expensive.) I was willing to spend more for a quality wash that brightened as advertised, but I did not find that this brightened my skin at all. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this my face responded right away. While it doesn&#x27;t clear my face up as well anymore, I still feel like it gives the best clean out of any face wash I have tried without drying out my skin a lot.</li>
    <li> Great cleansing product, you feel clean and not coated. The eye make up comes off complely. It is not harsh or drying. A small amount goes a long way. They used this line at my doctors office.</li>
    <li> Loveeee this wash , it&#x27;s nice and creamy and it stretches so a little goes a long way ! Only con is it makes my skin a bit dry so I might have to buy a moisturizer but so far so good</li>
    <li> I really like the cleanser!  It smells really great and your face feels really good when your done. not dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. However, I&#x27;m allergic to it! so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested to me by my dermatologist.  After using it, I would suggest it to anyone who wants a brightening soap.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash that I&#x27;ve ever used! It keeps my skin bright by exfoliating away dull skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling too dry. It keeps potential acne at bay and gets rid of all my makeup at the end of the day. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This face wash is awesome. I first used it as a sample that my dermatologist gave to me and loved it. I was so excited to see it available on Amazon, I didn&#x27;t want to go to my doctor to purchase it every time and it was much more expensive there. My skin has not had any breakouts in months and no drying out the skin in the process. My daughters now use it too and their skin has never looked better. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it brightens, but it is a nice cleanser. Not meant for cleaning eye makeup.</li>
    <li> It is okay as a cleanser.  I have used other brighteners that I thought worked better.</li>
    <li> I am 50 year old female and it was suggested by my dermatologist to wash my face at night with this Brightening face wash about 3 years ago.  It has worked well in helping my skin look more vibrate and has faded some of my sun spots from much sun exposure over the years.  I normally would have to go to my derm&#x27;s office to get replenishment but I found it here on Amazon and am so glad it saves me a  trip.  Not very harsh and leaves skin feeling refreshed!  Love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any skin problem but in summer it gets terrible and my skin starts breaking out. Ever since I started using this soap I didn&#x27;t have to worry about summer acne and I also exfoliate my skin twice a week to keep it clean and healthy. I also noticed that it made my skin brighter.</li>
    <li> face is clear now and I have sensitive skin but this does not irritate it. Love love love it!!! May I have some more please!!</li>
    <li> Great cleanser I use every other day to refresh.  You only need alittle so this goes a long way</li>
    <li> Really does make my skin look brighter</li>
    <li> Excellent face wash.  I received a sample at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and when it was empty couldn&#x27;t wait to buy full size.  It has a very fresh fragrance, takes make-up off and leaves my skin feeling wonderful!  I have dry skin, am 55+ years young and this is one product I will never be without!</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on your skin, it makes you feel soft and refreshed. I would recommend this to all my friends. I already have!!!!</li>
    <li> As a long time user of Revision Alpha Cleanser, it was one of the most amazing facial cleansers.  I used it for years without a single breakout.  My skin looked great.  In the last year, Revision has changed the formulation and packaging of this product.  It&#x27;s totally different.  I&#x27;m writing this for anyone who once used the original formulation that came in a white bottle.  This product may work for some, but the new version has made my skin breakout, dry and blotchy.  I would shop around or try and find a tester before buying this product.</li>
    <li> I love this facial wash! And the price:)</li>
    <li> I have been using the revision line for some time now this is the best face wash I have found and is sold at Neiman Marcus at a higher cost I love that it comes strait to my door and is always perfect quality without the higher price</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old and it works great on my skin</li>
    <li> Love this face wash - quality product.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my skin feel and look!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the texture, and love this product so much. We sold Revision products at one of my Medical Spa&#x27;s and I  loved this the most out of all the product line. Its just over all and excellent face wash. I do wish the bottle was larger, or they sold a larger bottle! You could use it as a body wash! :)</li>
    <li> Good iteam...Thank you</li>
    <li> Skin feels clean and soft without the oil</li>
    <li> Very Gentle on your face and it is squeaky clean.  You only have to use about a dime shape in your hand and apply it to a wet face.&lt;br /&gt;Also very reasonable for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this product line on my face, It has a nice sent and is gentle on my face. I can&#x27;t say if it brightens or not because my face doesn&#x27;t have any dark spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.. My skin is clear and fresh. I use it twice daily.. People keep asking what I use :)</li>
    <li> Though Revision Brightening Facial Wash sometimes dries out my skin, this is really the best face wash I&#x27;ve used in a while. I suffer from breakouts, especially on my chin, and find that this is the only stuff that actually clears it up! Not to mention it helps my skin look a lot brighter. I used to NEVER leave the house without makeup, but since I&#x27;ve started using this my skin has improved so much that I feel as though I&#x27;m a lot more confident in my own skin (no pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a lot of scaring and dark marks from pimples past, and this stuff has even helped to lighten those. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin has never looked better</li>
    <li> still feel hydrated on my face after using it. definitely will be a long-term buyer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of cleansers that contained salicylic acid and this one is BY FAR the most drying. After just two uses I saw that my already bad looking acne scared face got a lot worse, which is sad because I was pumped from reading the reviews. Also, I don&#x27;t like the texture of this cleanser when applying to my face, feels like it&#x27;s stripping my skin of all of it&#x27;s moisture. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have very sensitive, dry skin. Anyways, If you have very sensitive skin consider this possibility</li>
    <li> I love the Revision line I have use the skin brightening wash, Intelishade for years and will never give it up</li>
    <li> I am African-American with extremely oily skin. I was introduced to this product about two years ago while getting a facial. I instantly noticed amazing results. I have been using it ever since. Certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item as described</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my skin feel and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the texture of it. Less breakouts.</li>
    <li> it cleans deeply my facial skin!. I&#x27;m so glad i found it by internet (Amazon) Thanks! Great results in my skin, I could not get it from any other product!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday.  I pair it with Gentle Buffing Creme and Vitamin C, all from the Revision line.  My face is smooth and clear, without redness.  It is an excellent product that makes you feel younger!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing to brighten my complexion!!</li>
    <li> I first bought this at my dermatologists office to help with sun spots. I can say that it has naked a difference! Just make sure you use it twice a day and wear sunscreen of course! It is a gel formulation. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and I use it with my Clarisonic. I do not know if it brightens or lightens my facial skin but my skin feels clean after use.</li>
    <li> Cleans gentle love it..</li>
    <li> REALLY cleans! Make sure to moisturize afterwards. For cystic acne my aesthetician recommended washing only at night with this to remove makeup etc with a gauze pad to exfoliate, then a moisturizer that CONTAINS oils (NO OIL FREE). Seemed counter intuitive at the time but has been the first time in my life that my skin has been great (I&#x27;m 40+). No washing in the morning, only a rinse and moisturizer or a sulphur based soap wash, then moisturize and then apply your makeup if you wear it.</li>
    <li> This is a non-drying facial cleaner.  Cleans well and leaves my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  First discovered it thru my dermatologist. Really works fantastic! I&#x27;m hooked!:-)</li>
    <li> I love this face wash!  It makes your face feel squeaky clean without feeling dried out. I would definitely repurchase this item!</li>
