      <li>In love with this skincare line</li>
      <li>and it works for me! :)</li>
      <li>Image really puts out a great product and it&#x27;s affordable.  </li>
      <li>Love the Image products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a lovely product; however, ended up being allergic to something in it.  </li>
      <li>My eyes look much better.  </li>
      <li>please how many words I have type</li>
      <li>but after the peel the fabulous skin appeared!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, great price and product</li>
      <li>Instead I opened the top &amp;&lt;br /&gt;put</li>
      <li>The seller was easy to work with and delivered the package quickly and in good shape.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m SUPER pleased!</li>
      <li>This is worth the money!!  </li>

      <li>So far so good, it is very smooth, I like the smell.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, the cream is just the right consistency and it seems to smooth the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Great for fresh feel &amp; lift around eye area; though, not recommended for sensitive skin types, as rash can develop.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen a significant difference</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 49 years old and have tried many, many products.</li>
      <li>and i will continue using because this Image cream is true to it&#x27;s words</li>
      <li>It really is the better eye cream for my skin type I have ever used before.</li>
      <li>This is a great product - helps smooth out the little lines and helps prevent sagging and bagging under the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I sincerely believe the Image products have lessened the wrinkles, particularly around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Packed in factory seal &amp; received quickly.</li>
      <li>Found it on Amazon at a more reasonable price as I use to purchase from a salon at a much higher price.  </li>
      <li>I have tried two different eye products from image, and absolutely love this one!  </li>
      <li>Love their products but the eye cream makes my eyes tear even placed no where near where it can get in my eyes</li>
      <li>I have also purchased many other Image products and they are ALL fantastic.</li>
      <li>I first tried them from a spa and like the esthetician at the spa</li>
      <li>I have used this eye cream before and this is the first time this has happened.</li>
      <li>Thanks Image!</li>
      <li>I just recieved this eye cream so far seems good, but im curious</li>
      <li>I am 43 and have crepey skin below my eyes and while it seems futile to attempt to erase them or completely eradicate them with topical creams or products as opposed to having plastic surgery of some kind</li>
      <li>My doctor recomended this line to me and I have slowly started to use more and more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found my new favorite, Total Eye Lift Creme.  </li>
      <li>so for my aging skin, I feel it really helps with hydration.</li>
      <li>Fiance ordered this and says it works very well and is much cheaper than others available at local retail stores.</li>
      <li>I was really hopping</li>
      <li>It is gentle and it works.  </li>
      <li>When applying it lightly apply it in the direction you want your eyes to lift (on the upper lid)..</li>
      <li>This really does &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the eye.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t need to much.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your assistance.</li>
      <li>Amazon is so much easier.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the availability of product</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
      <li>are they not the real thing?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not usually easily convinced about skin care products but this really seems to be effective.</li>
      <li>Seems like a high quality product.</li>
      <li>I apply it upwards and out under my brow and then straight out lightly in the middle of the upper eye.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products from SUPER expensive to not expensive....</li>
      <li>This product is great for the price and does make my eyes look better after applying but is it making dramatic results that have friends and family asking what have I done to look so youthful lately?</li>
      <li>The dark circles under my eyes are fading and this cream has reduced the appearance of fine lines</li>
      <li>did not do any better than other similar products I have tried.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought several Image products and I&#x27;m just blown away that they really work!  </li>
      <li>This eye cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, including all the very expensive French brands out there.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Image really puts out a great product and it&#x27;s affordable.  I am fair skinned and hike a lot.  I got sun burned on the eyelids and bought this stuff to see if it would help.  My eyelids are tons better and the wrinkles around my eyes from squinting while I hike are diminished.  Thanks Image!</li>
    <li> I love this product, the cream is just the right consistency and it seems to smooth the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over a month with no visible results. I will use up the tube and try another product. At least for my skin, I see no difference.</li>
    <li> I have tried two different eye products from image, and absolutely love this one!  It is a bit heavier than others, so for my aging skin, I feel it really helps with hydration. The real benefit has been in reduced lines, and much reduced dark circles. I am very pleased and ordering another tube.  Really loving their products.</li>
    <li> GREAT product line.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an Image fan since my early 20s, but had not needed an eye cream until I hit 29. WOW! Literally made made a difference to my tired eyes within a few a</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for around two months and haven&#x27;t seen any results. It was kind of disappointing considering the price that it is.</li>
    <li> This product has not worked for me.  Also it burns the eyes.  Any eye cream that burns cannot be good for you.  I dumped it and will not recommend.</li>
    <li> Same answer as all other three items.  Found it on Amazon at a more reasonable price as I use to purchase from a salon at a much higher price.  Will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> It is okay seems to make under eye area smoother looking.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e tried several products for the little crows feet/smile lines coming in with age and this product works very well! Could see noticeable results after only one week of use! If you&#x27;re looking to rid those little annoying lines that come in with age, then this product is for you! Not sure if it&#x27;s for women only, but I use it and it works for me! :)</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I like this or not.  Not sure if I am expecting too much.  I do know I&#x27;m not going to put on my lids again or too close to my eyes.  They started to water &amp; then burn.  Packed in factory seal &amp; received quickly.</li>
    <li> Fiance ordered this and says it works very well and is much cheaper than others available at local retail stores.</li>
    <li> Love their products but the eye cream makes my eyes tear even placed no where near where it can get in my eyes</li>
    <li> Beautiful creamy product that absorbs well and does what it says it does. I&#x27;m not usually easily convinced about skin care products but this really seems to be effective. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I just opened this a week ago and the eye cream is separated from runny oil. I have used this eye cream before and this is the first time this has happened. Disappointed for how much I paid for product.</li>
    <li> I like the product. If smooths the lines. I&#x27;m used to Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder creams firming creams. I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> These eye cremes are truly amazing!  If you need a lift for a special event this product is for you!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, feels nice.  Not sure I notice any difference in eye area.</li>
    <li> My doctor recomended this line to me and I have slowly started to use more and more.  I am not sure I saw a significant difference in my skin because of the Eye Cream or if I saw a difference from another product on this line.  I can say that I feel like the lines around my eyes are less noticable, even the deep wrinkle between my eyebrows seem to have improved.  I never had issues with dark circles so I can not say if it is helping or not - it&#x27;s not giving me dark circles, so I guess that&#x27;s a good thing!  I use this in the AM &amp; PM and have had no issues at all.  A little goes a long way, so I belive this product will last quite a while.  I am very happy with the product line and this item in particular.  I would certainly purchase this item again and recomened this line &amp; product to anyone my age (40) and above.</li>
    <li> I used this eye cream and I thought it was very good--I am not convinced it was the best I have ever used.  Still looking for one that I won&#x27;t switch from--I do recommend for others to try this though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Image Skincare basics for years and recently started adding to my basic collection.  I&#x27;ve found my new favorite, Total Eye Lift Creme.  Not only does it firm up my eyelid skin it has literally erased the lines under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve also noticed the black tired spots are GONE!!  My hats off to Image for all of their great affordable premium skincare products.  I will use nothing else!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it in the evening. Lines have diminished.</li>
    <li> Instant youger looking. In love with this skincare line</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  It helps reduce the lines and dark circles.  I use it every morning.  At first you feel a little tingling where you apply it but within a few days that goes away.  I also use this around my lips to help reduce the lines above my lip.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great price and product</li>
    <li> i think it&#x27;s a good product but is not packaged well. I was going to send it back because&lt;br /&gt;I was having trouble getting it out of the tube. Instead I opened the top &amp;&lt;br /&gt;put the cream into a small covered container. I&#x27;m sure I can find another product that is as&lt;br /&gt;good &amp; packaged better. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like this Image Total Eye Lift Cream i have been using this for a few weeks now and already i can see a difference.The dark circles under my eyes are fading and this cream has reduced the appearance of fine lines ,This is like a miracle in a little .5floz tube every thing it says it does has been true.I use this before bed every night and i will continue using because this Image cream is true to it&#x27;s words,This tube will go along way you don&#x27;t need to much.</li>
    <li> So far so good, it is very smooth, I like the smell.  I will buy again , please how many words I have type so I can submit</li>
    <li> My eye circles are non existant while using this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several Image products and I&#x27;m just blown away that they really work!  I&#x27;m 49 years old and have tried many, many products. My eyes look much better.  What I really like about the Total Eye Lift is that I can use it on my eyelids which is where I need the help. I&#x27;ve seen a significant difference and I&#x27;m SUPER pleased!</li>
    <li> I use &amp;#34;IMAGE&amp;#34; products because the Professional Skin Therapist I go to recommends these.  She uses these on her clients and also sells these products in her shop.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the order &amp; shipment experience going thru AMAZON.COM for these purchases.</li>
    <li> This is worth the money!!  I will purchase this again. I love image products and this one did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with Image Vital C Hydrating Anti Aging Serum.  I definitely see smoothing of the crepe-y lines around  my eyes.  It is gentle and it works.  It also helps the puffiness but the smoothing of fine lines is truly remarkable. Don&#x27;t waste your money on TNS.</li>
    <li> I am 43 and have crepey skin below my eyes and while it seems futile to attempt to erase them or completely eradicate them with topical creams or products as opposed to having plastic surgery of some kind this is the best I can do for now.  This product is great for the price and does make my eyes look better after applying but is it making dramatic results that have friends and family asking what have I done to look so youthful lately? Absolutely not.  I don&#x27;t believe any cream can do that even with long term use, only having something more evasive done to your face or skin will show dramatic results worth bragging about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 69 and people are always saying I don&#x27;t look my age.  I get carded when I want to use a senior discount.  This wasn&#x27;t always the case.  I sincerely believe the Image products have lessened the wrinkles, particularly around my eyes.  I am apprehensive about the freshness of product bought online, but it&#x27;s so convenient I do it anyway...can&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
    <li> did not do any better than other similar products I have tried. Ovder the counter eye creams work just as well&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> I saw improvements in the wrinkles around my eyes and the dark circles.  I think it&#x27;s like Botax in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve been using Image Ageless Total Eye Life Creme for a few years and have great results with it - no better eye creme!</li>
    <li> The image ageless total eye lift cream is a great quality product shippped promptly for a more than fair price. Thanks for your assistance.</li>
    <li> This was an okay eye cream. I was really hopping this would be a great buy, but it is just okay. I will finish the tube, but stick to Clinique all about eyes.</li>
    <li> It is a nice moisturizer. I would not say it lifted anything, But I would use it as an under eye moisturizer rather than an eye lift creme.</li>
    <li> I love this image product too, it makes the area around your eyes feel awesome!! It is a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a lovely product; however, ended up being allergic to something in it.  My eyes puffed up like golf balls, and I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I use all of the image skin care line of products, and find it to be one of the best on the market. Great to see it on Amazon! The seller was easy to work with and delivered the package quickly and in good shape.</li>
    <li> I went in for a facial few weeks ago, and the lady said &amp;#34;whatever you are putting around your eyes, keep using it, &#x27;cause your skin there looks great.&amp;#34; Enoug said :)</li>
    <li> I really love this eye cream but it can burn if I put it on out of the shower. I have to let my eyes dry and cool and then use very little so it wont burn, which kind of makes me worry about the ingredients....but it does make my puffy eyes go down, so I have kept using it!</li>
    <li> This really does &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the eye. When applying it lightly apply it in the direction you want your eyes to lift (on the upper lid)..I apply it upwards and out under my brow and then straight out lightly in the middle of the upper eye. Then I pat it underneath my eye not getting it too close to my lashes and blend it out toward my cheekbone. It really is the better eye cream for my skin type I have ever used before. I have tried MANY.... It is wayyy better, in my opinion, than the Obagi eye cream and even Epicuren. Also, I have tons of allergies and this one doesn&#x27;t irritate or bother me. The Image Vital C eye cream however makes my eyes water and I am allergic to it, plus it didn&#x27;t give me the lift to my upper lid as this one does... Give this a try!</li>
    <li> Ok cream but absolutely hate the tube and will likely not waste time with this product again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy in a salon...Amazon is so much easier.  This eye cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, including all the very expensive French brands out there.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed...  Skin feels smooth, silky and few years younger.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this eye cream so far seems good, but im curious why do i keep hearing that these products are not sold online when i bought this off of amazon?? are they not the real thing?</li>
    <li> I have been using this product - usually bought at my esthetician&#x27;s - for a couple of years now, and I am a big fan.  When I was not able to get to the esthetician&#x27;s office, I ordered it online.  It is the same produce for a little less than what I would pay.  So - good deal for me!  This is a great product - helps smooth out the little lines and helps prevent sagging and bagging under the eyes.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great for fresh feel &amp; lift around eye area; though, not recommended for sensitive skin types, as rash can develop.</li>
    <li> Its okay but I found a better product by Dermadoctor which can be purchased at any Ulta Beauty Store.</li>
    <li> Well, I love it, but... I&#x27;m allergic to something in it. :( Very sad because it&#x27;s a great product for my skin, but it makes me want to scratch out my eyeballs.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products from SUPER expensive to not expensive....this product is by far the first to deliver what is promised (seriously)! I am 48 yrs of age and have constantly looked for a resonable priced products that actually work (especially for those awful crows feet) and after YEARS of trying and wasting money my search is OVER!!! YAY!! I have also purchased many other Image products and they are ALL fantastic. I first tried them from a spa and like the esthetician at the spa said they are very active products in the agless regimen so at first my skin did peel but after the peel the fabulous skin appeared! NO JOKE!!!</li>
    <li> Works for me as it had been described on the site. Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin or eyes. Does tighten the area around the eyes. Seems like a high quality product.</li>
    <li> Love the Image products.  Am hoping this will help.  Know it will take some time.  Thanks for the availability of product</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. i used 2x a day and i see no change whatsoever. ill stick to my l&#x27;oreal i guess.</li>
