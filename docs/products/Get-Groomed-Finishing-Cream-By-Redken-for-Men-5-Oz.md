      <li>I really like this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Its ok but I like the Redken Dishevel WAY better!  Redken is a great company though and this is a decent product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I don&#x27;t use it so much to style my hair. It&#x27;s fairly short right now(about an inch) but as it grows and right now, when I get out of the shower it gets crazy fluffy. This works great to tone down my hair and keep it soft. I thought I had read something about the fragrance. It&#x27;s got a slight fragrance, smells good to me. So no big deal there.</li>
    <li> Has slimy feel you can&#x27;t wash off your hands. Smell is overwhelming, and it doesn&#x27;t even hold.</li>
    <li> Very good. It&#x27;s more like a cream instead of gel, but it&#x27;s still very good.</li>
    <li> I like the product OK, but apparently my scalp has an allergic reaction and itches like crazy. Had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Made my husband&#x27;s hair look good, but it also changed the way he smelled.  Not a bad smell, just different from normal, so I asked him to stop using it.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> smells great!  Not a very strong hold, but good.</li>
    <li> Great hair CREAM. Notice I said cream, not gel. This product gives your hair that styled look while also looking like you may not have put any product in it to begin with; unlike gel, which hardens in your hair. The smooth hair look is what I was going for and this product delivered. Also helps to tame stubborn cowlicks.</li>
    <li> Great hair cream.  Light enough so you can&#x27;t tell there&#x27;s product in your hair, but holds hair in place.  Smells great.  This product is pricey, but worth it.  I can&#x27;t find it locally in stores or hair salons.</li>
    <li> Lets sum this up: 1. It smells awesome, girls love. 2. My hair feels lush and soft with it but is still controllable 3. It looks good, it gives you control that makes your hair look naturally moist in the direction you want it.</li>
    <li> Great product for price. Not greasy or oily. Lasts a long time</li>
    <li> great &amp; as advertised!!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a long lasting, non greasy grooming product for your hair, this is the one. Its a great and healthy alternative to hair damaging gels, this in fact leaves your hair feeling clean and looking shiny. I definetely recomend it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for your hair&lt;br /&gt;After you wash your hair&lt;br /&gt; Towel dry it a little leave a little wetness in your hair&lt;br /&gt;Then put a dime size amount of product on the palm&lt;br /&gt;Work it in real good but don&#x27;t overwork your hair&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will look great&lt;br /&gt;It will have a shine and a very masculine Smell&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about this product&lt;br /&gt;It is not sticky&lt;br /&gt;You cannot tell you have it in your hair</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick wavy/curly hair. I bought this to help cut down on the frizz, which it seems to do pretty well. I apply the product while my hair is still slightly damp after showering. I apply about a quarter-sized amount. The smell is fairly strong, but I like the scent. Definitely does not look or feel like gel. If you&#x27;re wanting a stronger hold I&#x27;d go with a paste.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely light hold, as I was expecting.  I can&#x27;t quite explain it, but my hair seems more greasy by the end of the day when I use this.  I doubt I would be again.</li>
    <li> This product give a nice natural finish to my hair.  I am not fru-fru, and I don&#x27;t want to feel like I have cement in my hair.  I just need something to tone it down a little, and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I use this after every shower and it works great, not greasy. Keeps hair manageable and smells good also, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and would not change.  It has kept my hair well nourished and in place.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this grooming cream. It feels like a light, non-greasy lotion with just a little stickiness. Thick putties never worked for my hair. Gel is too wet and sticky. But this is just right. It only takes a very little bit to keep my frizzy hairs in place. When I run my hands through my hair it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything in there at all.</li>
    <li> This product works well even on dry hair and holds pretty good. Also, the fragrance is very nice and suitably masculine.</li>
    <li> I use this product along with the grip tight and it not only keeps my hair looking natural, and keeps it from sticky up, my girl friend loves its subtle aroma.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product and I ordered it as a cost saving measure.  It is well priced on Amazon---a big improvement over the salon where my husband normally buys it.</li>
    <li> Not real happy with the hold, but they do mention that.</li>
    <li> I can compare this item most closely to [[ASIN:B000PB04G4 Bumble and Bumble Grooming Unisex Creme, 2 Ounce]] in terms of performance. It is not meant for hairstyles that require a lot of hold. However, I did find it useful in softening my hair to make it more manageable, then using hair spray to get the hold I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is a bit heavy on the characteristic \\&quot;man\\&quot; scent.</li>
    <li> Great, east to use hair product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for short hair!</li>
    <li> You would be just as we&#x27;ll off using water in your hair. This provides no hold or control at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and lasts a long time.  It smells great too.  It&#x27;s expensive to constantly try new stuff and disappointing when it doesn&#x27;t work well.  I probably wont switch to anything else.</li>
    <li> like it because it is not sticky</li>
    <li> Light feeling, not greasy.  Hair smells good.  Don&#x27;t need large portion so lasts a while. Same price as in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Finishing Cream everyday for maybe 8 or more years now&lt;br /&gt;and would recommend it to anyone who has hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff gives you a hold that looks natural, and if the ladies run their fingers through it they won&#x27;t get gunky hands.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. Light hold, non-greasy. Says his hair still &#x27;feels like hair&#x27; but holds it in place.</li>
    <li> Although its kinda pricey, its very worth it. Its not greasy, its just like a lotion for your hair that keeps it manageable and natural. Buy it !</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. I usually keep my hair in the shorter side and this product is perfect while it is growing until it needs to be cut again. I love how it keeps my hair together so it can be styled, yet it is light and looks and feels like there is nothing in your hair. It has just enough stick to get the messy look ( which is my style preference). I am a big fan of redken products.</li>
    <li> Not sticky, not hard, not gross.  Smells good and won&#x27;t make your face break out.  It is a bit pricey but well worth it.  Come on - give up the gel from high school and get manly hair.</li>
    <li> This product has a pleasing  but subtle scent. The hold is light, nothing like a wax type of gel. I get a very minimal shine, almost like not havng any cream in at all. I would consider this to be an excellent way to tame humidity or fly away hair. You will need to use a bit more than you may be used to if you use a gel or wax. There is no comparison really to any gel (at least the ones I have tried) and it is not greasy. After I work it in I don&#x27;t really need to wash my hands, since there is not a feeling of residue.</li>
    <li> Been using/testing different type of gel/creams/wax/mousse etc for 20 years from all brands. Theres nothing better than this! Leaves the hair soft without any residue and without making it greasy. Smells real good!</li>
    <li> It feels too oily, unlike other Redken product I am used to.</li>
    <li> Great product. No odor and great for fine thinning hair. Holds my hair in place without feeling greasy of heavy</li>
    <li> I love Redken products because they don&#x27;t leave nasty white residue and they just feel clean. I typically use a small amount of Stand Tough gel right when I get out of the shower. Then after my hairs almost completely dry, i&#x27;ll run a little of this stuff through. It seems to give it a more casual semi-messy style than gel alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this stuff. Just know that you likely will need something put in before or after because without gel, it seems to just create a flat mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also only takes a tiny dollop so this bottle lasts literally forever. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very Good Product..Work greats..&lt;br /&gt;Have tried many different Men&#x27;s Grooming Products this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;This is clean not messy and keeps my hair in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;Good Product..&lt;br /&gt;Hudson River Ron</li>
    <li> I have short hair - and it&#x27;s getting shorter every year as I&#x27;m losing it! I&#x27;ve used this for years since American Crew stopped making my former favorite. This product smells nice, leaves hair soft (not shiny or greasy) and most importantly, gets rid of any frizz. It will provide only minimal correction/control, and for me it is just enough to flatten a bit when my hair is longer and starting to get bushy. One commenter complained that this has no control. That&#x27;s basically right - and this product is not meant for that. If you want to style your brohawk, look for something else. My only complaint is that its pricey and hard to find.</li>
