      <li>it&#x27;s fluoride free also.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d originally provided the review (below) because of a delivery glitch.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it all natural, but it tastes great too!!  </li>
      <li>I use water and peroxide as a mouthwash after brushing and my mouth feels so fresh and clean.</li>

      <li>Tate&#x27;s has a fresh taste but does not irritate my mouth.  </li>
      <li>Just search the Better Business Bureau&#x27;s website for &amp;#34;Tate&#x27;s the Natural Miracle</li>
      <li>In the past I have made my own or used Earthpaste, but Tate&#x27;s is so much better.</li>
      <li>I ordered another tube directly from Tates, and it is fine.  </li>
      <li>They were astounded that it had been 4 yrs, and replied that, whatever it was I was doing, to continue doing exactly that.</li>
      <li>(in Ohio to be more specific)!</li>
      <li>The most upsetting part is our natural family avoids fluoride and sodium lauryth sulfate like the plague and it is clearly in this formula.</li>
      <li>It is a real plus that I can pronounce all the ingredients which is what attracted me to Tate&#x27;s in the first place.</li>
      <li>For a family of 6 it takes us more than a month to empty the tube.</li>
      <li>so you get a really thorough cleaning.</li>
      <li>After I described the problem, it was identified as likely the gel and that was confirmed by the tube size -</li>
      <li>No heavy residue, leaves hair smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>My family loves this toothpaste not only due to the fact that it&#x27;s fluoride free and better for your health</li>
      <li>They also have over 47 complaints with the Better Buisiness Bureau due to their deceptive practices.</li>
      <li>the gel comes in a smaller, narrower version than what  I was familiar with.  </li>
      <li>and ask a company (they seem to like chiropractors) if they&#x27;d like a free sample&lt;br /&gt;-Once company agrees, Tate&#x27;s sends them a box of the product, along with an invoice for a small amount ($40 or less)&lt;br /&gt;-Company refuses to pay, asserting they were offered a free sample</li>
      <li>As I got older my teeth became sensitive, and it was only aggravated by most natural toothpastes.</li>
      <li>My conclusion is the prior employee is likely telling the truth and this toothpaste is nothing more than dollar store brand being repackaged as natural when it is nothing of the sort.</li>

    <li> Tate&#x27;s is fine.  I&#x27;d originally provided the review (below) because of a delivery glitch.  After calling Tate&#x27;s and talking to an actual person, it turns out that the product that I got  (not directly from Tate&#x27;s) was the gel version that had been mislabeled.  After I described the problem, it was identified as likely the gel and that was confirmed by the tube size - the gel comes in a smaller, narrower version than what  I was familiar with.  It had the wrong label on it and that is what I&#x27;d been sent. So, truth is, my disappointment stemmed from not getting what I&#x27;d ordered. . I ordered another tube directly from Tates, and it is fine.  I&#x27;m back to five stars.  Good stuff.  (Bless Amazon; but I think that stemmed from a problem with whoever fulfilled this) ************** I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and the toothpaste in the tube has always been white and creamy. The toothpaste in the tube I just received is a gel, or something similar, and despite the same label and list of ingredients as on previous tubes, I&#x27;m now not sure what I&#x27;m getting. Has Tate&#x27;s changed the formula for the toothpaste recently? Also, the size of the tube was smaller than that of previous tubes. Unless these questions can be answered, I won&#x27;t be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Tates doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive mouth sore like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpastes do.</li>
    <li> Tastes great and teeth feel very clean.  This is my 2nd tube and will continue to use it.  Like that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride or other harmful ingredients found i commercial toothpastes.</li>
    <li> My mouth is very sensitive to the ingredients in other toothpastes.  Tate&#x27;s has a fresh taste but does not irritate my mouth.  Liking it!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of food intolerances and floride is bad for you.  This tothpaste taste great works great love it love it love it.  great price on Amazon thank you</li>
    <li> awesome toothpaste! I will use this as long as it&#x27;s this awesome! (and available!)</li>
    <li> When my husband insisted we use all natural toothpaste I reluctantly agreed. I would have rather spent $2 on the cheap stuff, and never give it a second thought. So I tried every toothpaste I could get my hands on. Most were grainy or left a strange taste in your mouth. This toothpaste seemed too expensive to try, so it came near last. I can safely tell you that my mouth never felt so clean. After 4 yrs of avoiding the dentist, I went in for a cleaning. They asked how long it had been, after spending only moments on my teeth. They were astounded that it had been 4 yrs, and replied that, whatever it was I was doing, to continue doing exactly that. I don&#x27;t have a history of perfect teeth. As I got older my teeth became sensitive, and it was only aggravated by most natural toothpastes. This stuff solved that problem too. My kids love it, my dog loves it. Every time our health food store gets it in, it is sold out almost immediately. I dread when they run out. Did I mention how long a tube can last? For a family of 6 it takes us more than a month to empty the tube. Long story short, I hope Tate&#x27;s makes this stuff for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> No heavy residue, leaves hair smooth and soft. I have been using for 4 years and I would not change to anything else. The shampoo is also amazing. It is a real plus that I can pronounce all the ingredients which is what attracted me to Tate&#x27;s in the first place.</li>
    <li> I love all of Tate&#x27;s  products.  this is so worth the $$$$$ it leaves your teeth feeling nice and clean.</li>
    <li> The ingredients have changed, not what they have listed here and they are questionable !! Not what I originally used and it also foams unlike the first time I used it. Felt like the regular tooth paste.</li>
    <li> This may be an all-natural toothpaste but the taste is amazing! It cleanses and deodorizes well and my teeth are even looking a bit brighter. I use water and peroxide as a mouthwash after brushing and my mouth feels so fresh and clean. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is fabulous!  Not only is it all natural, but it tastes great too!!  And the best part is it is made in the USA!!!  (in Ohio to be more specific)!</li>
    <li> My family loves this toothpaste not only due to the fact that it&#x27;s fluoride free and better for your health but it tastes great too! Unfortunately the ones that they sell at local stores don&#x27;t taste that great. This is really great!</li>
    <li> Most Excellent toothpaste.  Works great on my sensitive teeth.  The best one yet anywhere!</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste all the time which i ususally buy from a physician.  I saw it online and figure i would buy it instead of waiting for another dr. appt.  When i opened it, it was a gel and not paste.  I&#x27;ve never seen it as a gel, so i thought maybe it was expired.  there is no expiration date on the bottle.  it is the same exact tube as the one i get from the dr.  i threw it away.</li>
    <li> Just search the Better Business Bureau&#x27;s website for &amp;#34;Tate&#x27;s the Natural Miracle Conditioner.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;They have an F rating.&lt;br /&gt;There are 47 complaints lodged against them.&lt;br /&gt;They give an Ohio address, which the BBB confirms is fake; their actual location is somewhere in Massachusetts.&lt;br /&gt;They label certain products as &amp;#34;organic,&amp;#34; without having been certified as such. This is illegal.&lt;br /&gt;They list their ingredients in no particular order and with no particular sense of honesty. This is illegal.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the consumer complaints, their standard procedure is this:&lt;br /&gt;-Call and ask a company (they seem to like chiropractors) if they&#x27;d like a free sample&lt;br /&gt;-Once company agrees, Tate&#x27;s sends them a box of the product, along with an invoice for a small amount ($40 or less)&lt;br /&gt;-Company refuses to pay, asserting they were offered a free sample&lt;br /&gt;-Tate&#x27;s ignores company&#x27;s protests, repeatedly sends duplicate invoices&lt;br /&gt;-Company tries to deal via email (to have things in writing)&lt;br /&gt;-Tate&#x27;s repeatedly attempts to conduct business over the phone (to only conduct things verbally with no paper trail)&lt;br /&gt;-Company gets fed up, files complaint with Better Business Bureau&lt;br /&gt;-Tate&#x27;s finally responds to the BBB, claims &amp;#34;we&#x27;re a small family company,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;we keep paper records, not computerized ones,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;we&#x27;re so sorry for the miscommunication, we took them off our mailing list.&amp;#34; Those would be viable excuses, except that it&#x27;s happened FOUR DOZEN TIMES in the past three years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, you may not have any problem purchasing products from an sham business with unscrupulous practices, but I personally find it ridiculous. There are plenty of wonderful natural toothpastes available on Amazon that trump this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your research before you buy, kids.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of all natural toothpastes. In the past I have made my own or used Earthpaste, but Tate&#x27;s is so much better. It foams (naturally, not from a foaming agent), so you get a really thorough cleaning. It also tastes great and has the benefit of a natural whitening effect. I&#x27;m continuously impressed by the products from Tate&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it was once the best toothpaste I had ever used for effectiveness as well as ingredient integrity. Somewhere along the line they changed their recipe and it&#x27;s now just as bad as every other faux-healthy toothpaste on the market. Very disappointing. I also tried contacting them to get my money back as guaranteed on the package, and they&#x27;ve yet to answer a phone call or respond to an email.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE! There is countless info across the internet from a former employee of Tates claiming that they purchase toothpaste from the dollar store (such as pepsodent) and then fill the Tates Miracle tubes to sell to the unsuspecting public. As someone who has only purchased natural toothpastes for years the first thing that stuck out as odd to me about this toothpaste was the CRAZY AMOUNT OF FOAM! This toothpaste looks like you are foaming at the mouth. When I turned it over and read the label I realized it did not contain any ingredients whatsoever related to &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34;. The ingredients are basically water, calcium carbonate (which does not foam- we tested using calcium carbonate and water and it does NOT foam at all) and herbal extracts/essential oils. The viscosity of this product is also very thick which does not make sense with the calcium carbonate alone. My conclusion is the prior employee is likely telling the truth and this toothpaste is nothing more than dollar store brand being repackaged as natural when it is nothing of the sort. The most upsetting part is our natural family avoids fluoride and sodium lauryth sulfate like the plague and it is clearly in this formula. This company is deceptive and is putting your family&#x27;s health in jeopardy. They also have over 47 complaints with the Better Buisiness Bureau due to their deceptive practices. Please be aware before using any of these products and do your own research!</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used,  I know it&#x27;s just toothpaste however it is so great tasting and it keeps your teeth bright and clean,  it&#x27;s fluoride free also.  It&#x27;s not cheap but I hope to use it forever.  Try it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Best healthy toothpaste I&#x27;ve tasted! It feels like Colgate</li>
