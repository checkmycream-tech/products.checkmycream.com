      <li>Does not do a very good job.</li>
      <li>Great for travel.</li>
      <li>Great idea, just doesn&#x27;t execute.</li>
      <li>Great for traveling.</li>
      <li>Not the best but better than nothing I suppose.</li>
      <li>It could heat better and more evenly, but over all a great cordless product!</li>
      <li>worked fine, ideal portable unit for travel, which is the reason we bought again.</li>
      <li>Nice Travel iron in spite of that.</li>
      <li>It is also a great idea to have it in your car and make a quick fix to your hair while you are stuck in traffic.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly and does a good job.</li>
      <li>GOOD VALUE, QUICK SHIPMENT</li>
      <li>Patients were not allowed to have any corded appliances, and this filled in nicely.</li>
      <li>Love the probability though.  </li>
      <li>I love the product</li>
      <li>This thing isn&#x27;t going to flatten or smooth any hair!  </li>
      <li>But for camping it is the best option you have, especially when you are out there without electricity.</li>
      <li>Helps smooth hair more than straighten it.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions to the T but could not get it to light.</li>
      <li>You should use your primary corded straintener at home and then pack this in your purse for touchups.</li>
      <li>Gets hot quick and does the job well!</li>
      <li>This thing barely gets warm.  </li>
      <li>I was able to hold the plates with my bare hands!</li>
      <li>I have had other items that use a therma-cell that work pretty good</li>
      <li>like this very much because its cordless.</li>
      <li>I can lay my hand on it &amp; it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  </li>
      <li>but It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the electric ones.  </li>
      <li>I would return it but can&#x27;t due to butane being a hazardous material.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m baffled by the reviews that are positive at all.  </li>
      <li>the problem I have with this particular one is the on -off button doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
      <li>Not bad for what it offers.  </li>
      <li>but I have fine hair and it does not get hot enough to really straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect too much to begin</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t use much fuel though, and</li>
      <li>Not hardly!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how effective this would be for supper curly hair.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Ultra high heat 419°F&amp;#34;???  </li>
      <li>It works alright but does not get hot enough to be really effective for thick hair.</li>
      <li>It just isn&#x27;t hot enough to do anything to my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s barely hot enough to do anything.</li>
      <li>Seemed light enough to carry long distances and the butane made not having electricity at times, no problem.  </li>
      <li>we needed again and had no idea where the old one went when we lived on a boat</li>
      <li>though only real option when there is no electricity.</li>
      <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten the hair.  </li>
      <li>I have to play with it to turn it off, but other than that I like it very much.</li>
      <li>cheap, small enough for travel, and convenient.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and straightens hair, a small amount at a time.</li>

    <li> I followed the directions to the T but could not get it to light. This is a completely worthless product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Ultra high heat 419°F&amp;#34;???  Not hardly!  This thing barely gets warm.  I can lay my hand on it &amp; it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  Unless, I just got a lemon... I&#x27;d say save your money!  This thing isn&#x27;t going to flatten or smooth any hair!  I&#x27;m baffled by the reviews that are positive at all.  Did I just get a bad one?</li>
    <li> Great for travel. Heats up quickly and does a good job.</li>
    <li> worked fine, ideal portable unit for travel, which is the reason we bought again. we needed again and had no idea where the old one went when we lived on a boat</li>
    <li> I bought this for my camping, and it did what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing too fancy and it&#x27;s for traveling, so I didn&#x27;t expect too much to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, small enough for travel, and convenient.</li>
    <li> Not bad for what it offers.  It heats up quickly and straightens hair, a small amount at a time.</li>
    <li> I would rather use this if I&#x27;m not traveling to the airport.  Less hassle.  It is convenient though.  If only they had the 1.5 cordless one cheeper.</li>
    <li> This did not work whatsoever. I left it on for over 5 minutes, and it was cold to touch. It kept using the butane lighter fluid, yet not heating it up. Never started working and never used it for the reasons I bought it as to travel internationally</li>
    <li> Using this for a backpacking trip/wedding I am going on and it&#x27;s lightweight and works well. Great price!</li>
    <li> like this very much because its cordless. the problem I have with this particular one is the on -off button doesn&#x27;t work right. I have to play with it to turn it off, but other than that I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Perfect for overseas travel!</li>
    <li> It just isn&#x27;t hot enough to do anything to my hair. I will use it for travel but not at home.</li>
    <li> Helps smooth hair more than straighten it. As you pull the straightener towards your ends it feels like it&#x27;s ripping out you hair. I went over a section of hair like 5 times and it still looked wavy. Not the best but better than nothing I suppose.</li>
    <li> It works alright but does not get hot enough to be really effective for thick hair. Also the plates are narrow so it takes a long time to straighten all of hair.</li>
    <li> This straitener is meant to be used for touchups.  This is not a vacation straitener. You should use your primary corded straintener at home and then pack this in your purse for touchups. I keep this at work to touch up the upper and front layers of my hair on humid days or if I need to get rid of ponytail dents.&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that has waves or slight curls. I&#x27;m not sure how effective this would be for supper curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have had other items that use a therma-cell that work pretty good but this item is worthless. I turned it on as instructed and clicked on the ignite several times. It got lukewarm. I was able to hold the plates with my bare hands! I suggest no one buy this product!</li>
    <li> This flat iron doesn&#x27;t stay closed tight.  It was a waste of money!  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Does not do a very good job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as I was traveling to two countries with different outlets and my hair is relatively short, so I thought this would be a winner.  Wrong.  It simply doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten the hair.  Great idea, just doesn&#x27;t execute.</li>
    <li> I love the product but It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the electric ones.  Love the probability though.  Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I would like it to get warmer than it does. But for camping it is the best option you have, especially when you are out there without electricity. It is also a great idea to have it in your car and make a quick fix to your hair while you are stuck in traffic.</li>
    <li> It does  heat up but I have fine hair and it does not get hot enough to really straighten my hair. I was thankful to have something to allow me some control over my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s barely hot enough to do anything. Doesn&#x27;t use much fuel though, and though only real option when there is no electricity.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to take on a long hiking trip in Europe.  Seemed light enough to carry long distances and the butane made not having electricity at times, no problem.  So on both these counts this item met my needs... It&#x27;s the slight issue  of hair straightening that is the problem!  I have relatively thick, coarse hair and this didn&#x27;t begin to straighten it,  just frazzle my ends.  Not good.  I would return it but can&#x27;t due to butane being a hazardous material.  Not good experience all the way around.</li>
    <li> It could heat better and more evenly, but over all a great cordless product!</li>
    <li> This was perfect for the music festival i attend every year. I would consider pairing with a butane powered airbrush if I can find it. Gets hot quick and does the job well!</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE, QUICK SHIPMENT</li>
    <li> Ordered this, for my sister, for use while she was in the hospital. Patients were not allowed to have any corded appliances, and this filled in nicely.</li>
    <li> Could have been a little hotter. Nice Travel iron in spite of that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item via amazon prime for a trip overseas.  Unfortunately, it does NOT get hot enough.  And now I discover that it is NOT returnable due to the butane cartridge.  Poor customer awareness amazon prime!</li>
