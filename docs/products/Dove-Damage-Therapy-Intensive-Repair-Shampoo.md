      <li>Dove Shampoo is an old standby for many, many people for a very good reason.</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with the Dove Cool Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>After about 5 washes we were able to see the difference.</li>
      <li>Glad we found this shampoo.</li>
      <li>After ironing, it looks even better.</li>
      <li>The best part is it does strength hair and it removes frizz while leaving hair soft shiny and full of bounce and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it gave me a nice clean feeling</li>
      <li>I have good hair days more often compared to the last shampoo that I never had a good day with.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not weigh hair down and it has a wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo because it leaves my hair smelling clean, but not annoyingly chemical.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t typically review shampoo, but I am happy with this purchase!</li>
      <li>I have lots and lots of fine hair.</li>
      <li>Smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous product that has worked so well with my hair.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo has a VERY strong odor, which caused intense nasal congestion for both of us within seconds after applying the shampoo.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use shampoo often, just twice a week, and this one works well enough to get the hair products and hairspray out of my hair, it has a pleasant smell, and the bottle size is huge.</li>
      <li>She is so happy that now she can leave her hair loose without having to worry about covering her split ends.</li>
      <li>I like the large bottle and flip top.</li>
      <li>It smells nice &amp; makes my hair soft.</li>
      <li>B001ET7ERI Dove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Conditioner, 25.4 Ounce  </li>
      <li>B001ET7KC2 Dove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Shampoo, Cucumber/Green Tea, 25.4-Fluid Ounces (750 ml)</li>
      <li>I also see results, after the very first application.</li>
      <li>The 2 pack price is really good &amp; a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>My coarse, chemically relaxed hair is super smooth and SO healthy</li>
      <li>My very first use i could honestly tell a big difference with the dryness and the brittleness feeling in my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, not thin.</li>
      <li>When we first picked up a bottle I wasn&#x27;t thinking it would be anything special</li>
      <li>My hair haled up very quickly and was very soft</li>
      <li>The shampoo didn&#x27;t strip my hair like most shampoos and following up with the conditioner left my hair feeling lovely!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave muy hair feeling dry or like it is covered in some kind of film.</li>
      <li>I can notice the difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s 11, and this is the first time she&#x27;s ever had an allergic reaction to a fragrance.</li>
      <li>I just recently bought Dove Damage Therapy Intensive Repair Shampoo, and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>works very well!</li>
      <li>She was still sneezing 2 hours after using the shampoo, and she finally felt better after we washed her hair (with another shampoo) and gave her Benadryl.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is very good for dry or damaged hair, especially if you live in a desert climate.  </li>
      <li>It smooths down her fly-aways and makes her hair look nice and straight (instead of all over the place), just the way that she likes it.</li>
      <li>I have straight, shiny hair that waves when it is humid.</li>
      <li>My hair is very prone to split ends, so I thought I would give this line a try.</li>
      <li>This dove product really does the trick for me.</li>
      <li>I Dont really like the smell..</li>
      <li>but it really stripped my hair and cleaned it maybe a tad too much.</li>
      <li>Dove, I really like dove shampoo and conditioner, it softens my hair and</li>
      <li>Its definitely moisturizing and makes my hair feel really clean and nice maybe even a little thicker!</li>
      <li>When we did use it I was shocked that no one had told us how great this product is!  </li>
      <li>mother has a very sensitive scalp, and this doesn&#x27;t bother it.</li>
      <li>but wow!</li>
      <li>We have used many drugstore brands as well as salon brands in the past</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t work for my hair type at all and completely change the texture of my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not harsh, doesnt strip my hair, and as a result I dont have to wash it every day.</li>
      <li>I thought was a complete dud, but she insisted otherwise.</li>
      <li>I got this after ordering Halleys Curls Natural hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and silky and texturizing shampoo&#x27;s are a disaster for it.</li>
      <li>I used it on my natural hair as well</li>
      <li>Dove has traditionally been known for gentle products, but this shampoo caused major allergy problems for both myself and my daughter.</li>
      <li>extra large bottles from Amazon are about $3.00 cheaper than at our local grocery store.</li>
      <li>The value is superb--this is definitely for those who want to look like a million bucks on a budget (I am a working wife and mom of 3, so the \\&quot;frugalista\\&quot; in me is alive and well)!  </li>
      <li>However, I would be wary of purchasing this product if you are sensitive to strong fragrances or have sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> excellent price for this product</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo.  No issues.  I think it is cheaper at local stores, but it was convenient to order online.</li>
    <li> So I am really impressed with this shampoo/conditioner combo. I Dont really like the smell.. but wow! I can see a difference after just 2 washes. My hair feels remarkably softer and its also noticeably shinier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for this one... I usually dont fall for all the marketing scemes, but this really works!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product that has worked so well with my hair.  The value is superb--this is definitely for those who want to look like a million bucks on a budget (I am a working wife and mom of 3, so the \\&quot;frugalista\\&quot; in me is alive and well)!  My coarse, chemically relaxed hair is super smooth and SO healthy looking/feeling.  You cannot afford NOT to try this amazing shampoo and conditioning team!</li>
    <li> I got this after ordering Halleys Curls Natural hair.  They recommend this shampoo and conditioner for the weave before you install.  I used it on my natural hair as well and it&#x27;s great.  The shampoo didn&#x27;t strip my hair like most shampoos and following up with the conditioner left my hair feeling lovely! For the record I&#x27;m a happy to be nappy girl with type 4 hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that works better than the really expensive salon brands for dry hair. It smells good and the 2 pack extra large bottles from Amazon are about $3.00 cheaper than at our local grocery store.</li>
    <li> Everyone has different hair, so shampoo and conditioners are very personal things. I have straight, shiny hair that waves when it is humid. My scalp is oily. I was very satisfied with the Dove Cool Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair is very prone to split ends, so I thought I would give this line a try. What a mistake!! This made my hair greasy, limp, and weighed down. It just felt dirty and gross. I tried it for a week and couldn&#x27;t stand it, so I gave it to my mother to try. To my surprise, the next day she was raving about this product. I thought was a complete dud, but she insisted otherwise. This is the cheapest product that she will use on her damaged, dry, color-treated hair. Usually she dishes out the cash for salon products. If she ever had to buy supermarket shampoo, she would get John Frieda and refuse anything else. If there was Bed Head, she would sometimes opt for that... but not anymore. She swears by this line now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has a very sensitive scalp, and this doesn&#x27;t bother it. The [[ASIN:B001ET7KC2 Dove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Shampoo, Cucumber/Green Tea, 25.4-Fluid Ounces (750 ml) (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B001ET7ERI Dove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Conditioner, 25.4 Ounce  (Pack of 2)]] made her scalp flakey. It also dried out her hair. But the damage therapy line does something miraculous for her hair. It smooths down her fly-aways and makes her hair look nice and straight (instead of all over the place), just the way that she likes it. After ironing, it looks even better. So on my mother&#x27;s behalf, I give this product five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: the conditioner in this line is lump prone.</li>
    <li> Dove, I really like dove shampoo and conditioner, it softens my hair and the conditioner is wonderful, I also use this products for my Brazilian humain hair it make the hair soft and easy to comb, my kids love it. I will always use dove or tresemme.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. It smells nice &amp; makes my hair soft. The 2 pack price is really good &amp; a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very good for dry or damaged hair, especially if you live in a desert climate.  I wish I could still find it in stores.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I cannot promote more. Dove Shampoo is an old standby for many, many people for a very good reason. It works with the balance of hair, to repair it strand by strand. I love this shampoo because it leaves my hair smelling clean, but not annoyingly chemical. I also see results, after the very first application. Use it with the companion conditioner. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use shampoo often, just twice a week, and this one works well enough to get the hair products and hairspray out of my hair, it has a pleasant smell, and the bottle size is huge.</li>
    <li> works very well! My hair haled up very quickly and was very soft</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple of years, and have seen a noticeable improvement in my hair. I am 68 and wear my hair long. I use a curling iron on my hair to curl it which does cause some damage. I have naturally thick hair that tends to be on the oily side, but this shampoo adds body and also helps to repair damage from the curling iron. My hair also has a good shine without looking or feeling oily.</li>
    <li> My wife was suffering from severe hair loss and split ends. The split ends made her hair look unhealthy and cumbersome to handle. Despite trying several shampoos and conditioners the problem still remained. I came across the Dove damage therapy intensive repair shampoo and decided to get one for my wife. After about 5 washes we were able to see the difference. Split ends have reduced drastically giving bounce and shine to her hair. She is so happy that now she can leave her hair loose without having to worry about covering her split ends. Glad we found this shampoo. She is using it regularly and has even advised her friends to change to Dove.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought Dove Damage Therapy Intensive Repair Shampoo, and I LOVE it. My very first use i could honestly tell a big difference with the dryness and the brittleness feeling in my hair. I&#x27;m going to continue to use to see if this is my saving grace for my hair! It is very reasonable price and smells amazing as well! I hope that when you make your purchase of Dove that it helps you like it has me.</li>
    <li> The only brand of shampoo and soap that never seems to annoy me. Doesn&#x27;t leave muy hair feeling dry or like it is covered in some kind of film.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a staple in our house now. We found this quite by accident one day at a local store and it sat unused until we need another bottle. When we did use it I was shocked that no one had told us how great this product is!  We have used many drugstore brands as well as salon brands in the past so we have a good basis to compare it to. When we first picked up a bottle I wasn&#x27;t thinking it would be anything special but I was so wrong. This is like a vacation for your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not weigh hair down and it has a wonderful scent. The best part is it does strength hair and it removes frizz while leaving hair soft shiny and full of bounce and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a great deal on it here and you can find the larger bottles so we just stocked up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want one of the best shampoos out there then give this a try.</li>
    <li> Dove has traditionally been known for gentle products, but this shampoo caused major allergy problems for both myself and my daughter. This shampoo has a VERY strong odor, which caused intense nasal congestion for both of us within seconds after applying the shampoo. Furthermore, my daughter&#x27;s cheeks became red and swollen about an hour after using the shampoo. She was still sneezing 2 hours after using the shampoo, and she finally felt better after we washed her hair (with another shampoo) and gave her Benadryl. My daughter&#x27;s 11, and this is the first time she&#x27;s ever had an allergic reaction to a fragrance. The smell also gives me a headache, so I have to keep my distance from other family members who use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, not everyone in my family has problems with the smell (which is otherwise pleasant). However, I would be wary of purchasing this product if you are sensitive to strong fragrances or have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> They do help to fix my damaged hair. I can notice the difference after the first use.</li>
    <li> I like the large bottle and flip top. And people keep complimenting me on how shiny my hair is! I wouldn&#x27;t typically review shampoo, but I am happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I wound up trying Dove shampoo by purchasing an airplane sized bottle and have been hooked ever since. I feel like my hair is in the best shape it has ever been. Smooth and silky. And the smell can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Thank you Dove for making this shampoo. Finally Ive found a product that just works! I used to use Herbal essences naked moisturizing shampoo. I liked that and it gave me a nice clean feeling but it really stripped my hair and cleaned it maybe a tad too much. My hair as a result was oily faster and I needed to wash my hair every day. Then I accidentally bought the same shampoo but in volumizing instead of moisturizing and I hated it!! I have lots and lots of fine hair. My hair is fine, not thin. And I hate volumizing shampoo&#x27;s they don&#x27;t work for my hair type at all and completely change the texture of my hair. My hair is soft, shiny, and silky and texturizing shampoo&#x27;s are a disaster for it. I tried out this shampoo because a friend recommended it to me and I&#x27;m absolutely loving it!! This dove product really does the trick for me. It&#x27;s not harsh, doesnt strip my hair, and as a result I dont have to wash it every day. I have good hair days more often compared to the last shampoo that I never had a good day with. Its definitely moisturizing and makes my hair feel really clean and nice maybe even a little thicker! Bottom line I&#x27;d give this a try!</li>
