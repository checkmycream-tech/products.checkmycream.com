<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very cute clip, easy to work with, right handed.  It holds all my medium thickness hair back at my neck perfectly.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> very pretty but the stones fell out.</li>
    <li> Jewelry Hair Clip, looked really good on the.  Screen shot, but not so hot in person.  I think it&#x27;s just too heavy to sit properly when in hair.</li>
    <li> Great barrette.  It is lovely for casual or dress wear.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t have more fun than this hair clip for under $6!!  It&#x27;s beautiful, heavy duty and sparkly to boot.  Arrived fast and it really is lovely.</li>
    <li> Looks even better than I thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really love it! Love the colors and the stones! I don&#x27;t got any complaints about it. The hair clip is in silver color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more gorgeous than the picture.</li>
    <li> I had got this one for myself. Got it. Loved it! Its sooo pretty. the colors are so bright &amp; the stones just shine. And then....my neice saw it. She,also loved...now its hers! Lol</li>
    <li> This barrette is very pretty, colorful and sparkly.  I have really thick hair and it works just fine.  As with a lot of barrettes of this type, it is a bit heavy and may not be the best for people with thin hair.</li>
    <li> For the price, cannot be beaten. It&#x27;s quite lovely.</li>
    <li> This does take a long time to receive because it comes from Hong Kong, but it is worth the wait.  It really is pretty.  And, a real value compared to the cost.</li>
    <li> For such an inexpensive item it looks amazing. The quality is top notch and the colors match so many dresses. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a really beautiful hair clip.  You need pretty thick hair to keep it up; otherwise it is really fun to wear.</li>
    <li> very nice and great price. it looks really nice.</li>
    <li> Little bigger than it looks but my daughter loves it anyway.  She has thick hair.  Very long and curly.  Hard for her to find clips to work.  This one worked perfectly and she would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the quality!  Also colors are not subtle not realistic!  Just wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
    <li> this is an item I really liked. it was exactly how I thought it would be and ill make a nice gift for my niece</li>
    <li> Beautiful and very well put together</li>
    <li> THIS HAIR CLIP IS BEAUTIFUL, SPARKLE  THE LOVE COLORS I HAVE WORE IT SEVERAL TIMES NOW LOVE THIS  IT HOLDS YOUR HAIR WELL</li>
    <li> Its pretty, but very heavy. Its not a barrette. Its a clip that doesn&#x27;t stay in hair very well. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I received my product and it was beautiful ! Just as in the picture ! It is so pretty ! And the price is unbeatable ! I absolutely looooove it !</li>
    <li> great sparkle and shine! looks great and hold well. I highly recommend this clip and others from this company, which i did try, and they were all great too</li>
    <li> This was packaged very well. I could see how it could break if it wasn&#x27;t. Very delicate, yet sturdy. Colors are vibrant. I will order more for sure!</li>
    <li> I absoulutely love this hair piece... It looks so much better in person than in the picture! It arrived right on time and I can not wait to wear it!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my teen,  she loved it.  She has very thick hair and it is strong enough to hold in place without snagging or pulling.  Looks better in person.</li>
    <li> For the price of the product, you get a lot of sparkle. It took a while to ship- but that was the only draw back. I get a ton of compliments.</li>
    <li> This is so pretty, I love the colors, nice quality, heavy, sturdy.  I was skeptical when I ordered, wondering if it would be too big for my head, and my fine thin hair.  It works great -  stays where you put the barrette without having to re-adjust all day long.</li>
    <li> This is so pretty, but bought it for a gift so don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up.  A little leary getting a product from China as their products are usually cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for me and, in order to keep it, had to turn around and get one for each of my sisters!  Everyone LOVES this clip when they see it.</li>
    <li> A very beautiful hair clip - perfect for a spring or summer wedding, or any dressy event.  Or, wear it just for the pure enjoyment of having something beautiful in your hair!</li>
    <li> I bought 12 of these beautiful crystal hair clips for my granddaughters wedding party. They are absolutely beautiful and very good quality. They arrived before the promised shipping date.That&#x27;s the reason for the five star rating.. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> came with a broken spare piece of metal clip. The main product is O.K. I liked it. It looks nice. That broken spare clip won&#x27;t help me to replace anything.</li>
    <li> awesome clips, will update after using it to see that the colour fades or not... looks are very very good</li>
    <li> The picture does not do this clip justice, it is beautiful.  Was shipped super fast and arrived wrapped and packaged very well.  I have very long hair and this clip is perfect; not to heavy and very strong.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hairpin. it locks good, and looks amazing. i got a lot of compliments when I wore it. Not too heavy on my hair. I would order more of those.</li>
    <li> this is so pretty. I thought it was small but it&#x27;s big. It was in good condition when I received this. I really love this hair pin. Thank you very much :)</li>
    <li> Pretty and very shiny. I&#x27;ve worn it twice and it latches just fine. Just a bit brighter than I expected.</li>
    <li> really nice and a must have addition to your feminine accessories, with nice sturdy materials. colors lasts and not fading.</li>
    <li> Love it...love it...love it...elegant hair clip...looks expensive at a bargain basement price...would buy another...shipping takes awhile...took about 3 weeks...comes from China...</li>
    <li> Pretty and good price. Very colorful! It is a small barrette, not meant for a pony tail. Not expensive looking but serves the purpose for hair decoration.</li>
    <li> I got this clip yesterday.  The finishing and the look as exactly the same in the picture.  The back clip is good to hold the good amount of hair.  Just the coloring is not even.  Planning to use the nail polish to make it more pretty.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of the price, but I love it.  I have VERY thick hair and it has no problems going around my hair and staying clipped in the same spot all day (where most like to slide down as the day goes).</li>
    <li> Very attractive barrette, but it arrived broken. That was clear back to Christmas. I&#x27;v tried for weeks to get a replacement; but they would never respond. Finally all they said was they would give me credit. I had asked for them to just send me another one just like the one that broke. I&#x27;m trying again and hope that this time it arrives before the occasion it is for and comes unbroken.</li>
    <li> It looks better in real life. Holds my hair in a ponytail perfectly. Love it. Glad I bought it. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Its pretty but weak, i would buy if i had thicker hear or for a child. its not bad. :/</li>
    <li> The clip is a little heavy but very pretty. Looks like its pretty good quality and the colors are very vivid!</li>
    <li> Ugly much too big will give to good will!!hard to find words for a piece of costume jewelry more suitable for the circus!!</li>
    <li> Its a beautiful clip can hold lot of hair but its a little heavy for my liking.. Took a lot of time to deliver.. Disappointed with the time it took to deliver..</li>
    <li> I ordered a lot of stuff and paid for it all. All I&#x27;ve gotten is the hair piece and nothing else...send the rest of my stuff,it&#x27;s paid for,and I&#x27;m sick of chasing this stuff all the time. Send me my stuff or a refund.</li>
    <li> Just as pictured!  I want 2 or 3 more!!!  Lovely!  It really gives my hair and my day little glamor, sparkle and fun!  Arrived early, and in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> It is gorgeous. I have had a lot of compliments. It is a nice hair clip. I would order more.</li>
    <li> Product is large and HEAVY.  Probably my fault for not reading the deminsions better. If u have shorter or thin hair, this product is not a good choice.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s anything like the other&#x27;s then I am sure that I will love it, as the other two that I have already received are absolutely beautiful and one of them will be used with each one of my daughter&#x27;s when they are married and will be passed down to their daughter&#x27;s or future daughter in laws.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair clip. Very heavy though you need think hair to use this. Love the colors in it. Goes with everything.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, but for some reason I didn&#x27;t expect it to be SO BLINGY and colorful. I do like it, but I&#x27;m 26 so I feel a bit silly when I wear it, but if your a teen or kid it would be ideal. Holds all your hair.</li>
    <li> The decoration was perfect, but the clip was broken.  I will need to fix that prior to being able to use this item.</li>
    <li> Very colorful. I used it to go to work. I got a lot of compliments. My co worker said it&#x27;s looks nice on my hair.</li>
    <li> they hair clip itself works and its okay, I just didn&#x27;t like it because when you actually get it, it looks ugly.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair clip, and I like it very much. Just know that if you order it, it will take up to 3 or 4 weeks, since it is mailed from China.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite barrettes, I love this so much, the pictures do it no justice. Very sturdy, holds really well, holds lots of hair which is good for me and just beautiful.</li>
    <li> Too heavy to use in normal people&#x27;s hair. Pretty, but cannot be put into hair that is attached to a regular head.</li>
    <li> Looks very cheaply made does not look anything like the picture bought it for my granddaughter and it does not look like it is made for a young girl</li>
    <li> After receiving these barrettes, I was surprised how beautiful they were. Great deal for the price. The pictures don&#x60;t  do them justice.</li>
    <li> Really like this with my bright shrubs at work.  Looks great and very strong for my super thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I gave a 5 star rating cause this hair clip is more beautiful than it looks in picture. Love it</li>
    <li> I got this for mom, she said she wanted one when she saw so I got her once and she just wearing and she loved the color on the hair clip very much. She wanted to get another if they came in a smaller size.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these clips for my hair.  I used one of them for a few times, less than 6.  One of the serrated parts of the clasp broke off and now the clip is useless.  It won&#x27;t close and hold any hair.  I haven&#x27;t started using the second clip yet.  I am very disappointed and it probably is just a glitch with the clip that broke.  I do recommend the clips because they are pretty and as long as they work a good buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered these just for something different and dressy. Very pretty and seem very well made...and they do not slip in my hair. Shipping seemed to take awhile but I think they came from out of the country so it was fine. Well packaged on arrival.</li>
    <li> Ordered on July 3rd and already arrived undamaged.  It is beautiful and hand painted... different from the other 8 I bought.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and it is definitely an eye catcher.  No complaints here... thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Just as how the title says. I got this clip for a present too. Although the clip was indeed shiny, there were places where the paint was coming off and it was chipped in places. :/ I&#x27;m not buying from this seller anymore. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars and not 1 star is that at least the clip was indeed shiny.</li>
    <li> Goes with most things I wear, sturdy, well made and also great gifts for friends and family! Thanks and God Bless!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and I purchased this to hold all my hair back in a low pony tail in the back.  It&#x27;s brightly colored and can look very dressy.  I like unique things, so it&#x27;s not over the top to me.  I love that it&#x27;s bright and shiny.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the alligator clips because they are so exquisite, but this barrette is very pretty, and you won&#x27;t find much for this price. Great deal.</li>
    <li> very colorful and light clip .  This was for a friend and she liked it very much.</li>
    <li> Fell apart as son as we tried to use it!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful but much bigger than I realized so not for me.</li>
    <li> This was absolutely gorgeous!! The colors are amazing. They look a shade lighter up close but still beautiful! I have purchased several Rossellini brand items and they are all beautiful. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a rainbow of color for your hair. It will go with every thing. The spring action release for this hair accessory is rather difficult and I do not feel that the item is secure in my hair.</li>
    <li> too big, too heavy. and it hurts</li>
    <li> I liked this barrette, except 3 of the flower&#x27;s petals weren&#x27;t painted.</li>
    <li> a bit sharp clip, other then that - very nice looking and suites the purpose</li>
    <li> So pretty! Took a while to get but where it is shipping from. It&#x27;s understandable well worth the wait. I have long hair so it looks so beautiful.</li>
    <li> Very pretty!! I love it and can&#x27;t wait to wear it with many different outfits.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as pretty as I expected!</li>
    <li> pretty bright colors and easy to create different looks with your hair using this hair pin planning on buying another one to get a different look</li>
    <li> These barrettes are just too cute...They are so colorful and shiny...Lots of bling!  The only drawback for me is that they are slightly heavy for my fine, thin hair.  They are good quality for the price.  I would definitely order these again.  Ladies...bring on the bling!!</li>
    <li> Nice hair brochure, the colors makes it great for any occasion dressing</li>
    <li> I should recived this item by february 3 and until now i didnt recived anthing februrary 15. I dont recomend this seller you will lose your money for nothing&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy from them you are not gonna recived anything</li>
    <li> I would call this more of a barrette than a hair clip.  It is very pretty.  I used to wear barrettes like this when my hair was long.  I am growing my hair out again and plan to use this a lot.  Barrettes like this tend to stay put in my fine-textured hair better than hair clips do.  Just realize when you order it that it comes from China and may take a 2-4 weeks to arrive from the time you order it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clips because the color are amazing.  I ordered this clip because it has colors I wear alot.</li>
    <li> The clip I received was not the bold colors shown, but a softer, not quite pastel shades. Though a bit disappointed, hence the 4 star review, the piece is still beautiful. I did read a few reviews where some received clips that weren&#x27;t the colors advertised, but took a chance. If you absolutely need the more primary coloring, you may not want this piece. If you are looking for a softer colored very beautiful piece, then this might be what you&#x27;re looking for to add a little something special.</li>
    <li> holds hair well, very silver in color. this piece is really bright and reminds me of spring a lot. great for livening up a dreary winter day!</li>
    <li> Three stars because the hair clip is very sparkly and eye-catching. But now its in my room and the clasp part came off of the decorative front. Does not work with thick hair lol.</li>
    <li> Very pretty barretts, ships from Asia so be patient ... well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Arrived damaged- oh and it&#x27;s your fault.</li>
    <li> received yesterday. very pretty. well made.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and holds all hair in ponytail. Clasp to close slightly off and has to be reset every time it is used - making me think this will not last long - that&#x27;s reason for 4 stars.</li>
    <li> If you had a mop of hair like Rapunzel this might work better but for us regular nonFairyTale people, it&#x27;s way to heavy.  It slides right out of my hair and I have relatively thick hair.  My hair is very soft so maybe thats the problem but be warned</li>
    <li> This is so very pretty and I ordered it as a gift for my daughter and she just loves it.</li>
    <li> Pictures do not do this justice. This is absolutely beautiful. I figured it would be like something from Wal-Mart but it is definitely NOT. This is a very well made product. It is heavy but stays put very well. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> So cute it makes me so pretty everytime i used it..</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair clip. Very ornate.</li>
    <li> It is so pretty! You would expect to pay a high price for something of this quality. Very well made on top of its beauty.</li>
    <li> I like it except that looking at the clip where I purchased it, the clip looked smaller.  It is really too large and not easy to find a hairstyle that will keep it in place.</li>
    <li> This is a gift to my sister. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Love it and it still works perfectly!!! I am going to order more!</li>
    <li> NOT such a good quality. the actual clip is broken i can&#x27;t even use it! ( straight to the garbage can ) wasted of money.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself and my nieces. We all love the elegance and beauty of the barrette. Beautiful with vibrant colors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for all of the girls in my family. One for my 24 year old daughter and for both sets of granddaughters. It was liked by all who received it. Thanks</li>
    <li> A little pizazz of color to add when getting your hair out of the way</li>
    <li> Beautiful clip, loved how all the colors went together.</li>
    <li> Very unique and beautiful. Big clip to hold alot of hair. Loved it.</li>
    <li> For the money it was a very nice clip.  It did take a while to get to me, but other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip its so pretty love the colors and its the perfect size, I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this piece for my sister to wear at her wedding I love it! I hope she does too.</li>
    <li> I do like this barrette, however, the colors are much brighter than expected, because the barrette is advertised with a white background, it doesn&#x27;t appear as it does in person.  The colors are extremely shiny and bright and I&#x27;m not sure that I would have purchased it if I had a better picture and/or understanding of what I was actually buying. I cannot wear this with very many outfits because of the coloring so bright and only looks good with certain outfits.</li>
    <li> This is a very classy looking product, looks really great in thick hair and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. With the free shipping it&#x27;s well worth the price.  I bought extra ones for gifts.</li>
    <li> It broke the second I took it out of the package</li>
    <li> Really pretty and substantial</li>
    <li> This beautiful hair clips is very sturdy.  Very good quality.  And it looks great!  I would recommend this clip to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> For the price this is an awesome buy! My girls love getting different style clips and bows for their hair that you don&#x27;t see everyday and for the price of this clip I was shocked that it was a metal sturdy clip! It doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap at all! Pretty quick delivery as well.</li>
    <li> Received my item early; Christmas Eve 2013 !&lt;br /&gt;The colors are just as bright and vivid as seen in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;This item arrived intact; no damage to the product or package.</li>
    <li> I love it, so pretty, strong hold, good for many hair styles</li>
    <li> Very nice.... Beautiful colors</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair clip but it takes awhile to get it.  I should give them a 5 star because I did order it around Christmas and I know it takes longer to get something in the mail.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> Arrived extremely well packaged and is simply beautiful,  Much brighter in person.  The clip is more than strong enough for my thick hair, which is more than I hoped</li>
    <li> It is very beautiful and works great. We really liked it very much. Good for anyone who wants one. Pretty.</li>
    <li> this is so pretty, the sparkles are insane. It looks fantastic in every day hair, or purchase for a formal updo. Make sure you take shipping time into consideration as it will be a while before the product arrives. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> simply superb ! very adorable clip, It fitted well to my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought it for someone else, so I can only comment on its appearance.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites! Soooo beautiful</li>
    <li> It arrived in great condition very happy with the barrette</li>
    <li> Great item. Great price. Product is as advertised. Arrived promptly!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a very few days in great condition and they are a beautiful vintage style. Look lovey in my wife&#x27;s hair!  : )</li>
    <li> Although it too me wayyyy to long to get this piece, it was worth the wait.  Because this piece is very beatuiful - the picture does it no justice!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent piece for someone who has long, heavy, or thick hair.  The colours are bright and attractive.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful, and HUGE! When I wear it, I get compliments. It is really big for a half-pulled up do for my hair. If you have really thin hair you could probably pull it all back in this. It is shiny and colorful.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip. A little more expensive than most but well worth it. I have used it daily for two weeks and still works flawlessly. Bright beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this but it so cheap looking that I just can&#x27;t.  I have bought plenty of other lovely barrettes from Amazon that are awesome.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t believe too many people would like this unless they were using it in a play for a very garish effect.  Do not recommend for regular everyday wear or for dress either.</li>
    <li> They are lovely.  Gave them to my granddaughters, 13 and 11.  They both agreed they were lovely. They haven&#x27;t worn them yet,  may they are afraid of the reaction they might get.  I think they will be pleased, especially if they are dressing up...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but it won&#x27;t grip my hair and stay put. Always falling out, I gave it to my friend next door who has thicker hair than I. Sturdy construction though and will stand the test of time.</li>
    <li> I love this hair piece! Would buy another one if I had a reason too because it is even prettier in person. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Five stars for this hair jewelry!  It arrived before it was due. It&#x27;s a good quality.  Fashioned to handle even thick hair.  Looks so beautiful!</li>
    <li> I love this beautiful crystal hair decoration.  The flowers are in several colors and the clip I received looks exactly like the photo in the listing. The listing calls it a hair clip, but it&#x27;s really a good sized barrette. The barrette is large enough to hold all of my hair back in a pony tail.  It took about a month for it to come thru the mail, so if you need it for a special event, order in plenty of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW-UP:  After two weeks of use this clip is broken and unrepairable. The metal piece on the underside of the clip that secures the hair broke completely in half. A waste of money for only a couple weeks of use.  What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> Very well made and unique - I have received many compliments on this piece!  The myriad of colors has allowed me to wear the clip with several different outfits and offers a unique look not often found on clips.  My hair is medium thick but long and the clip stays in place without slipping or tearing at my hair.  The jewels are sturdy and well crafted - I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not what was expected.  Can&#x27;t tell from the pic but this clip is really very long.  If you don&#x27;t have a mane to wear this in, might want to rethink.  Pretty but not practical.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and she love it!</li>
    <li> This was definitely worth the wait and price. I am always looking for cute hair accessories. This one is now one of my favorites. It is pretty and I had not seen anything like it before. I have very thick hair and it is sturdy enough to hold it, which is sometimes a problem if a clip is too small or slender. It also arrived faster than the estimated arrival dates given to me; I think I was given an estimated date that was about a month after I made the purchase. So it was kind of like getting a nice surprise in the mail because it arrived in about two weeks. Worth the wait though!</li>
    <li> It is beautiful, but way to heavy for my hair. I am going to have to find a new clip for it to stay in my hair.</li>
    <li> Nice clip. Heavier than I normally like. Nice colors, but a bit gaudy. If you have thin hair or just not much of it, this may be hard to keep in.</li>
    <li> This will only hold a very small amount of hair, the barrette type clip is a small size. I should have bought 2, that way I could put one of either side of my head.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to hold more hair like in a twist or bun, buy a hair CLIP, just be sure to look very closely at the photos for this difference.</li>
    <li> I just love this hair cli[p! It matches everything!&lt;br /&gt;It is quality made and will last many years!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase, the colors are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;this is a very beautiful piece, far better than I expected.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure about this hair clip when I ordered it. I was so happy when I received it. It is even nicer in person and totally exceeded my expectations. I could not even make it for how much it cost. I wear my hair up when I run, I was just looking for something feminine and this works for me. I still want to look good when I work up a sweat.  I am really happy that I made the purchase. It is well made and looks like it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Very pretty!  Not to heavy to wear in hair.  Seems to be made very well so far.  Reasonably priced compared to my local stores for items like this.</li>
    <li> This clip is absolutely beautiful &amp; the colors are so vibrant! I love it &amp; would highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> This does not look like high end jewelry, but it is very colorful and fun to wear.  The clip works fine.  I like it!</li>
    <li> This flower hair clip was bought to match my granddaughters graduation dress. It did just that. Very pretty great by. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. Took three extra days to get here. But was worth the wait. I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Colors are vibrant and pretty.  Nice hold even with my thick hair.  Matches with lots of cloth. Strongly recommend you get one.</li>
    <li> Stone fell out after wearing a couple of times  Other wise it was very pretty. Only reason for rating it losing a stone.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors, strong and sturdy, good for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Looks nice but came broken, i used adhesive to fix it and its fine now. I gifted it to someone and then found its broken so little annoying it was. But since it fixed firm its ok</li>
    <li> Very nice, just like picture however it arrived with two stones missing.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful!</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair clip!!!</li>
    <li> This is so Pretty &amp; Sparkly.  It was bigger than I expected though &amp; gave to my cousin with long hair.  She loves it &amp; wore it right away!!  Just love this product &amp; look to buy more in a smaller clip :)</li>
    <li> Looks as described. Looks great.</li>
    <li> I like beautiful accessories for my hair , always looks pretty as a Women or girl should be , and with this seller I found a variety of hair accessories in good prices and quality .&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this seller , for you or your girl .&lt;br /&gt;Remember back to school is coming up soon and they want to look pretty and style .&lt;br /&gt;Take a look for beautiful accessories .</li>
    <li> a little over the top but very pretty and useful. it is designed to hold any amount hair well.  am enjoying it</li>
    <li> I really like these, rather stunning in color and quality but a bit heavy and too large to wear on the sides.  These will work to hold a ponytail if your hair is not too thick.</li>
    <li> I could not believe how pretty these are. Very pretty and they really stand out. They are nicer in person.</li>
    <li> Size is little big for me. Other then is good.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful barrette.</li>
    <li> Love it! Holds a good amount of hair and is very pretty.</li>
    <li> It is gaudier than I expected.</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail today, and worth the wait!  It is very firmly attached to the clip, and stays in my hair well so far.  I did not care for the colors however.  I soaked it in some nail polish remover, and removed the color from the petals and leaves.  It worked really well, and even with that the metal is still shiny/nice looking!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful clip that is sturdy and holds all of my very long hair and I get lots of compliments on it!!! Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
