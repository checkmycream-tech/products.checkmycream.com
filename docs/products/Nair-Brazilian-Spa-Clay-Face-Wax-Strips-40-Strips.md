### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These wax-strips are absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>I wish you all the best of luck!</li>
      <li>Best strips ever!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>and it pulled off the hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>I warm the strips using a hair dryer, so they are perfectly melted and separate with no problem every time.</li>
      <li>They also include a removal pad with oil to remove any residual stickiness, which works great.</li>
      <li>I use these for my eyebrows and they work great.</li>
      <li>I love these wax strips!!</li>
      <li>I bought 4 of these because I could not find the product - (used successfully before)</li>
      <li>Rub them till warm and voila!</li>
      <li>(The body wax strips are also good.)</li>
      <li>If you already know the feeling of pulling hairs off, this product is good in that it</li>
      <li>They did a good job</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve concluded they may not be as good.</li>
      <li>It took forever for the strip to get warm, and even then it wasn&#x27;t  very warm at all.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased!</li>
      <li>Smells great, easy on skin,</li>
      <li>they work amazingly.  </li>
      <li>Rubbing them between your hands doesn&#x27;t work , I had to use my hairdryer to warm them up.  </li>
      <li>and effective.  </li>
      <li>I think the directions say to warm the strips by rubbing them in your hands</li>
      <li>Try at your own risk, unless you have very strong skin.</li>
      <li>Make sure to completely warm it, rub it really good and make sure it&#x27;s super warm.</li>
      <li>I do believe I require a bit more training to perfect it, but my first experience was not bad.</li>
      <li>The strips are very effective an are very gentle to the skin.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d have to use too many strips, so</li>
      <li>This is the most ineffective product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>Worked wonderfully on my cheeks, chin, and upper lip.  </li>
      <li>; product reminded me more of something you&#x27;d get while candy-making than anything I&#x27;ve ever been waxed with.  </li>
      <li>Use your hands to heat it --how much more convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice and clean finish</li>
      <li>/&gt;B. super convenient as you can do in your own time&lt;</li>
      <li>I rubbed the strip to warm it well beyond the point where the &amp;#34;Nair&amp;#34; imprint disappeared, since it felt like that happened way too quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was even able to cut the strips and use them just fine.</li>
      <li>you do your own waxing, this is worth trying.</li>
      <li>I had thought that warming the strips so easily sounded too good to be true, and it turned out I was right.  </li>
      <li>The oil gets all the wax off easily.</li>
      <li>Make sure you warm it up really well.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with smooth and hairless upper lip .</li>
      <li>these strips however would peel apart and snap off one side of the strip as if it waxed itself &#x3D; indication of cheap quality wax.</li>
      <li>smoothly-</li>
      <li>I used the strip that got the majority of the wax first, and it took off a quarter of the hair AT MOST.  </li>
      <li>However, withing minutes of waxing with this, I had bright red hives all over my body.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, the negative reviews are fair- if you follow the directions on the package they do not work</li>
      <li>, I may try the hair blowing trick and see if that works, as some people say more hair comes off that way as opposed to the hand heating, but if it means pulling at my skin multiple times, or my chin gets more damaged</li>
      <li>I was able to use the same strip more than once as well.</li>
      <li>You rub the strip between your hands to warm it up, you peel it apart like a bandaid, you apply the wax side to your upper lip, pull the area taut, and pull.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve never felt that would be warm enough.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a really good youtube video on how to do it (blow dryer, cutting the wax strip in a curve, etc) and it worked great.</li>
      <li>and right away I could feel my chin still hurt.</li>
      <li>use a hot iron to warm up if rubbing with your hands is not working well enough to make the wax melt evenly before applying.  </li>
      <li>Nice thing is when you heat them up in your hands, they are ready when the blue NAIR disappears.</li>
      <li>nearly pain free hair removal, no residue, pulls all unwanted hair in the first try.</li>
      <li>And I did it without pulling my skin off as the box warns against if you don&#x27;t get it all your first pull off .&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are a bit hot when I apply them to my skin, I wait about 30 seconds then pull out against the growing direction of the hair.</li>
      <li>If you MUST try it - try a sample patch first, but BE WARNED.</li>
      <li>Firstly the strips, when warmed between your hands, are supposed to peel apart</li>
      <li>locally any more.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time waxing, EVER.</li>
      <li>I occasionally wax at home and also have waxing done in a salon, so I&#x27;m very familiar with how the waxing process works.  </li>
      <li>I have previously purchased these at Wal-Mart and had been very pleased with them.</li>
      <li>The one strip I was able to actually use did manage to pull off fine facial hair pretty well.</li>
      <li>pretty much nothing.  </li>
      <li>I bought in store , it&#x27;s not clear if this comes with after-wipes , but make sure you have something for after the wax/hair pulling .&lt;br</li>
      <li>sure to remove oil from your skin with a baby wipe to, then completely dry it with a towel.</li>
      <li>used the large strips for my legs.</li>
      <li>I would also add that I have very sensitive skin and these strips are the only ones I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t give me a breakout or turn my skin a bright red.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I can say about these is that, if you can get them to work properly, they are nice because the clay is not as sticky as wax (which leaves sticky residue).</li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing about this product went as it should have.  </li>
      <li>I carefully followed the instructions, but the strips did not separate properly most of the time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using this product, my face was sore for the whole evening.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really upset with how this product works.</li>
      <li>Even when it did separate, it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t feel like they pulled too much on the skin, just the hair.</li>
      <li>I place them in front of my bathroom heater for a few seconds to warm them.</li>
      <li>I lke that they have the blue &#x27;nair&#x27; indicators on the strips when you warm them up enough.</li>
      <li>only tip I have is that the first time I used them, even though I showered right afterward, I guess I didn&#x27;t manage to get all the oil off my face.</li>
      <li>I leave it on for about 30 seconds, so it can cool down and really grab those pesky hairs!</li>
      <li>It takes more time than having a professional doing it at a waxing place but it is also a lot less money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing for quite a while and thought I&#x27;d give this new one a try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only did this make my face break out entire a huge rash - but now I might even have a chemical burn from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy on, and it stings a little when removing it, but what wax doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Worried I did some serious damage, I made sure I kept my face clean following, and put no other products on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be careful not to get them too hot though!</li>
      <li>The strip had all the wax on one side (so much for double-sided, and I realized this was actually going to end up being 20 strips rather than 40), and they were completely ineffective.  </li>
      <li>After reading reviews I thought I would go ahead and try this product, even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>They are NOT correctly formulated for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive in that area, always have, but besides an hour or 2 of redness at the spa it should NOT look like it does</li>
      <li>But I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Now I use just a touch of dishsoap diluted well with water to get the oil off completely, because if you have sensitive skin, that oil wreaks havoc on your complexion.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much residue left over</li>
      <li>It did get all the baby hairs though, which I was surprised.</li>
      <li>(I use a larger strip and apply it to my whole lip, I pull from the right, then the left, and then I get the middle.)</li>
      <li>Wipes didn&#x27;t cool it in an amazing way , so I used cold water on my upper lip and them reused therapeutic wipe and rubbed around  wipe&lt;br /&gt;residue</li>
      <li>I enthusiastically tried it on my upper lip, which was the main area I bought it for.  </li>
      <li>quick enough - I was still able to re-use the wax strip paper over the liquid wax on my upper lip and pull the hair out little by little .</li>
      <li>I really like these facial wax strips;  they pick up the peach fuzz over my lip and no hair is visible for weeks following a treatment.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have really any facial hair, but enough for me to notice it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These wax-strips are absolutely perfect. (The body wax strips are also good.) I&#x27;ve never waxed myself before, but it&#x27;s very simple. You rub the strip between your hands to warm it up, you peel it apart like a bandaid, you apply the wax side to your upper lip, pull the area taut, and pull. (I use a larger strip and apply it to my whole lip, I pull from the right, then the left, and then I get the middle.) If it leaves a few little hairs, you can reuse the strip to quickly catch those baby hairs, and the other side of the strip with the fresh wax can be folded in half and used for next time! The oil gets all the wax off easily. Seriously, my lip is now perfectly smooth, not a hair in sight, and it maybe took five minutes. It stings just like any wax does, but the redness wasn&#x27;t terrible, (and I&#x27;m very, very pale, I can stay red all day, but it faded quickly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only tip I have is that the first time I used them, even though I showered right afterward, I guess I didn&#x27;t manage to get all the oil off my face. I broke out disgustingly, it was awful. Now I use just a touch of dishsoap diluted well with water to get the oil off completely, because if you have sensitive skin, that oil wreaks havoc on your complexion.</li>
    <li> horrible...same experience as the other users. I used it one time and it burned my skin. Got rash and breakout. Try at your own risk, unless you have very strong skin. You were warned.</li>
    <li> These were all dried out. Had to throw the box away.  Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> use a hot iron to warm up if rubbing with your hands is not working well enough to make the wax melt evenly before applying.  Smells great, easy on skin, nearly pain free hair removal, no residue, pulls all unwanted hair in the first try.</li>
    <li> I tried these because I couldn&#x27;t get the Nads ones I usually use. What a waste of money. After trying over and over to heat the strips in my palms (and blowing warm air on them), the strips would not separate, rendering them completely useless. I&#x27;ve never had that problem with Nads. The only positive thing I can say about these is that, if you can get them to work properly, they are nice because the clay is not as sticky as wax (which leaves sticky residue). The one strip I was able to actually use did manage to pull off fine facial hair pretty well. Too bad they don&#x27;t consistently work! I&#x27;ll go back to Nads.</li>
    <li> and effective.  Nice thing is when you heat them up in your hands, they are ready when the blue NAIR disappears.</li>
    <li> While these do remove quite a bit of strips, they are loaded with mineral oils and other ingredients that are infamous for causing allergic reactions. If I had to rate my skin sensitivity (not in reference to pain but in reference to allergic reactions) from 1 being not allergic to anything to 10 being allergic to everything, I would rate my skin around a 3. However, withing minutes of waxing with this, I had bright red hives all over my body. It looked like I had been swarmed by mosquitoes! And all this from simply waxing my lip and brow!! I would not recommend these to anyone. They are NOT correctly formulated for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work well at all the wax kept coming off on my skin so I had to scape it off and if it didn&#x27;t stick to my skin then it didn&#x27;t take any hair with it</li>
    <li> I was getting tired of paying for someone else to wax my brows, so decided to try these. They did a good job but the results don&#x27;t last as long as getting a professional wax job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a really good youtube video on how to do it (blow dryer, cutting the wax strip in a curve, etc) and it worked great. It did leave my eye area a little red and swollen but not like I couldn&#x27;t go outside immed. after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the large strips for my legs. The area is too big and I&#x27;d have to use too many strips, so I&#x27;ll stick with hair remover cream instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on my underarms and it didn&#x27;t take off any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I just use them for my brows and upper lip from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really upset with how this product works. I&#x27;ve been waxing for quite a while and thought I&#x27;d give this new one a try. Horrible! Firstly the strips, when warmed between your hands, are supposed to peel apart smoothly- these strips however would peel apart and snap off one side of the strip as if it waxed itself &#x3D; indication of cheap quality wax. Secondly, I slathered the strip on to my leg and went for the pull.. instead of waxing my hair off, the wax is currently (as i type) stuck to my leg and peeled off the paper!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly so disappointed and pissed off that this brand of wax is in stores. What a complete waste of money. No thanks. Never again. Sorry for the harshness but this should not be sold.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I carefully followed the instructions, but the strips did not separate properly most of the time. All of the wax would stick to one side of the strip and it would not be sticky. The wax is supposed to separate so that half of it sticks to each side of the strip and you end up with two sticky strips. Even when it did separate, it didn&#x27;t work very well. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> If you have never waxed before or never been to a salon and had THEM wax you , you are in for a \\&quot;painful\\&quot; surprise . You are ripping hairs out of your face and it&#x27;s not going to feel like a leisurely massage .&lt;br /&gt;  If you already know the feeling of pulling hairs off, this product is good in that it A. Saves a ton of money over a salon doing it.&lt;br /&gt;B. super convenient as you can do in your own time&lt;br /&gt;C. Use your hands to heat it --how much more convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like someone else said , if you use completely to their directions a bit of a fail can happen . (So a star knocked off that ).&lt;br /&gt;  I have sensitive skin and when the residue was left on my lip because I hadn&#x27;t held taut and pulled hard/quick enough - I was still able to re-use the wax strip paper over the liquid wax on my upper lip and pull the hair out little by little . And I did it without pulling my skin off as the box warns against if you don&#x27;t get it all your first pull off .&lt;br /&gt;  Yes , it stings a bit after . Was red (just like at salon). Wipes didn&#x27;t cool it in an amazing way , so I used cold water on my upper lip and them reused therapeutic wipe and rubbed around  wipe&lt;br /&gt;residue with my fingers over the waxed area.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought in store , it&#x27;s not clear if this comes with after-wipes , but make sure you have something for after the wax/hair pulling .&lt;br /&gt;  I was sore for minutes . Then it kept dying down (like in salon) .&lt;br /&gt;  I did it before bed. Woke up a few hours later and red is gone . No pain. I am happy with smooth and hairless upper lip .</li>
    <li> I love this product! I warm the strips using a hair dryer, so they are perfectly melted and separate with no problem every time. They are a bit hot when I apply them to my skin, I wait about 30 seconds then pull out against the growing direction of the hair. It takes more time than having a professional doing it at a waxing place but it is also a lot less money. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have previously purchased these at Wal-Mart and had been very pleased with them. I&#x27;ve read several negative reviews but they have worked well for me. I place them in front of my bathroom heater for a few seconds to warm them. I suppose you could also use a blow dryer to accomplish the same thing. I think the directions say to warm the strips by rubbing them in your hands but I&#x27;ve never felt that would be warm enough. I would also add that I have very sensitive skin and these strips are the only ones I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t give me a breakout or turn my skin a bright red. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I&#x27;m not sure the box I ordered from Amazon is the same quality I previously purchased at Wal-Mart. I have had to use 4 strips for what I use to use 2 strips for so I&#x27;ve concluded they may not be as good.</li>
    <li> I was wary about it&#x27;s usage on the face. But I am pleasantly surprised. The strips are very effective an are very gentle to the skin.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> On at least half the strips the wax was stuck to my leg as opposed to coming off with the strip.  So bad that I used less than half the box.  Did not work at all.</li>
    <li> I typically use Veet wax strips. Store was out so I bought these... Best strips ever! Rub them till warm and voila! They did stick slightly when pulled apart but I used about 5 strips and had zero problems. I was even able to cut the strips and use them just fine. They took off the smallest hairs rather painlessly J might add. They didn&#x27;t feel like they pulled too much on the skin, just the hair. Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> It worked wonders for me. I have very coarse and thick hair and it pulled off the hair perfectly. Make sure to completely warm it, rub it really good and make sure it&#x27;s super warm. Peel it apart, then place it on the area you&#x27;d like to wax. I leave it on for about 30 seconds, so it can cool down and really grab those pesky hairs! Then pull it opposite where the hair grows (don&#x27;t pull UP, pull opposite. if you don&#x27;t know what i mean, watch a waxing video on youtube and pay attention to the way the esthetician pulls wax strips). It should work! I wish you all the best of luck!</li>
    <li> I knew that after using wax you get redness, you&#x27;ll get that at the spa too, however after using these I had to use several strips and yank at it multiple times to get the hair off. one fast pull only picked up a few hairs, most had the wax left behind. So I had to do it a few times to get all the hairs off. Well of course after it was red and hurt which is expected. Put the after wipe on and a few hours later it still burnt really bad. Woke up in the morning and right away I could feel my chin still hurt. Looked in the mirror and it&#x27;s all red underneath. There was a few strands that bled (again expected) but this made my whole chin red and rough. I have a feeling in a few days my whole underside will be rough and scabby. I am sensitive in that area, always have, but besides an hour or 2 of redness at the spa it should NOT look like it does now!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t get worse then this, I may try the hair blowing trick and see if that works, as some people say more hair comes off that way as opposed to the hand heating, but if it means pulling at my skin multiple times, or my chin gets more damaged then it already is, i&#x27;m not going to even give it a chance again. I wanted no hair, not a red beard!!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these because I could not find the product - (used successfully before) locally any more.  The wax is TOTALLY dried out - the only way to use it is to microwave the strips (maybe not for everyone...).  Would never buy this from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> This is the most ineffective product I&#x27;ve ever tried. All of the &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34;  came off on one strips (not divided between the two strips, as described), and the clay wax itself had zero sticking ability. For me, it removed no hairs. I&#x27;ve used other types of Nair, Sally Hansen, and strips in the past for my facial peach fuzz, and they&#x27;ve all done what they&#x27;re supposed to. This product, however, is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I thought I would go ahead and try this product, even though I have sensitive skin. Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, my face was sore for the whole evening. Worried I did some serious damage, I made sure I kept my face clean following, and put no other products on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this make my face break out entire a huge rash - but now I might even have a chemical burn from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% not recommended to ANYONE. If you MUST try it - try a sample patch first, but BE WARNED.</li>
    <li> Terrible product!  I occasionally wax at home and also have waxing done in a salon, so I&#x27;m very familiar with how the waxing process works.  Absolutely nothing about this product went as it should have.  It took forever for the strip to get warm, and even then it wasn&#x27;t  very warm at all.  The strip had all the wax on one side (so much for double-sided, and I realized this was actually going to end up being 20 strips rather than 40), and they were completely ineffective.  I don&#x27;t know how they can say these are reusable - I was left with a mess and couldn&#x27;t wait to throw it in the garbage.  I&#x27;m really shocked that a company like this, which has been around for a long time, would put out such a poor and cheaply made product.  I had thought that warming the strips so easily sounded too good to be true, and it turned out I was right.  Save your money  - Try something else.</li>
    <li> This was my first time waxing, EVER. I do believe I require a bit more training to perfect it, but my first experience was not bad. Yes, it stings... oh well. It&#x27;s hair pulling. I&#x27;m not a baby about it. It did get all the baby hairs though, which I was surprised. The hand rubbing method didn&#x27;t work well for me, but I took the advice of another person below and took a hair dryer on low to it... worked like a charm. I was able to use the same strip more than once as well.</li>
    <li> I really like these facial wax strips;  they pick up the peach fuzz over my lip and no hair is visible for weeks following a treatment.  It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other wax strips on the market and a box of 40 strips lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do your own waxing, this is worth trying.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, the negative reviews are fair- if you follow the directions on the package they do not work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, if you heat the wax strips up using a blowdryer or a lightbulb (be careful! Don&#x27;t burn yourself or start a fire!) they work amazingly.  The main complaint is that the wax strips don&#x27;t peel apart correctly or they leave wax behind.  IF you heat them properly and use them quickly enough after you heat them they work AMAZINGLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to remove oil from your skin with a baby wipe to, then completely dry it with a towel.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully on my cheeks, chin, and upper lip.  Make sure you warm it up really well.  Hurt less than getting it done at a salon and was quick and simple.  Will use regularly.  I&#x27;m so pleased!</li>
    <li> I use these for my eyebrows and they work great. I usually buy the regular nair brand strips and these work the same if not better. I lke that they have the blue &#x27;nair&#x27; indicators on the strips when you warm them up enough. I cut them to shape and then just rub them inbetween my hands for a few seconds and then rub them on the area i want hair removed again. You have to pull the skin taut and pull in the opposite direction of the hair growth. There isn&#x27;t much residue left over but they do have the wipes to remove any access. Will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Nice and clean finish</li>
    <li> I love these wax strips!! I&#x27;ve been using them for a year since I found them.</li>
    <li> So I have tried waxing before and dilepitory creams, and some of them have worked but either not as well or left chemical burns. I don&#x27;t have really any facial hair, but enough for me to notice it. So I tried the Nair Spa Clay face wax strips and they do get the little hairs, I was surprised. Easy on, and it stings a little when removing it, but what wax doesn&#x27;t. They also include a removal pad with oil to remove any residual stickiness, which works great. It was minimal clean up, and I would definitely  recommend it for removing small hard to reach hairs.</li>
    <li> These are difficult to pull apart.  Rubbing them between your hands doesn&#x27;t work , I had to use my hairdryer to warm them up.  Be careful not to get them too hot though!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I fell for another hair removal product!  This didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I enthusiastically tried it on my upper lip, which was the main area I bought it for.  I rubbed the strip to warm it well beyond the point where the &amp;#34;Nair&amp;#34; imprint disappeared, since it felt like that happened way too quickly.  As others have described, the wax didn&#x27;t come off evenly on the two strips.  The &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; product reminded me more of something you&#x27;d get while candy-making than anything I&#x27;ve ever been waxed with.  I used the strip that got the majority of the wax first, and it took off a quarter of the hair AT MOST.  I tried to use the other half, and it did...pretty much nothing.  The upside is that the wax strips didn&#x27;t irritate my skin too badly, and I didn&#x27;t break out afterwards, but that&#x27;s the nicest thing I have to say about this.  I threw the rest of the box away, but saved the post-wax towelettes, they&#x27;re the only thing I can see myself using again.  I&#x27;ll trust my facial fuzz to hair removal cream in the future, at least when I don&#x27;t feel like heading to the spa/salon/brow lady to let a pro take care of it.</li>
