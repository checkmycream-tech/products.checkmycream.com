      <li>This is a nice product for price, design and function.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re light, stylish, and fit my plastic frame perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised how well the spring-loaded mechanism works, making it cover my glasses perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great value if you order the right size</li>
      <li>Very light and usable product.</li>
      <li>However, the plastic is very cheap</li>
      <li>I love these clips.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure your order correct</li>
      <li>I used them mostly for driving.</li>
      <li>Since I wear prescription progressive lenses, it would be more of a hassle and cost to have a complete separate pair of sunglasses, so I&#x27;m happy to have found a size and style that works with my lenses.  </li>
      <li>These do fit prescription glasses with plastic frames well, provided you check the measurements and and make sure they are compatible.</li>
      <li>Easily clips onto my prescription glasses.</li>
      <li>They are very light weight, which is good on one hand, but because of that, they may be very easy to break, so I try to be careful with them.</li>
      <li>Great quality and pretty fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Light weight, easy off and on.  </li>

      <li>If you want this type of clip on or magnetic style to match your glasses exactly, you would probably pay $100 or more to order or have them made, so the clip ons are a money-saving alternative.</li>
      <li>The color isn&#x27;t too dark nor too light, perfect for driving or regular outdoor activities!</li>
      <li>These fit my glasses very well.</li>
      <li>The clip ons are nice and slim, so easy to slide into a small extra glasses case that I had, and then I have them handy in my purse.  </li>
      <li>The price is a bargain, better than buying from regular stores.    </li>
      <li>So make sure to keep them in a solid eyeglasses case when unused.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t expect them to last more than a year.</li>
      <li>I really like these.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think this is much of an issue for the price</li>
      <li>I really like these clip ons.</li>

<li> The only issue is this is my second pair due to one of the clips coming off, but if used properly its probably not an issue.</li>

<li> I tend to be rough on glasses, and covers...</li>
<li> In a recent outing, I attempted to put this on three times, each time I had to remove it after a few minutes because, facing the sun direction, I could barely see anything due to excessive glare caused by this clip-on sun glasses.</li>

<li> However, this is my second pair that has broken.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s only wrapped with newspapers in a paper thin plastic bag.</li>
<li> So if you&#x27;re carrying something relatively heavy with one hand, you usually have to put it down and use both hands to put on this clip-on sunglasses.</li>
<li> I must have ordered the wrong style as they do not fit my glasses well.</li>
<li> I have broken a couple of them already.  </li>
<li> size.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These fit my glasses very well.</li>
    <li> I love this clip on sunglasses! They&#x27;re light, stylish, and fit my plastic frame perfectly. The lenses are polarized and scratch resistant. The color isn&#x27;t too dark nor too light, perfect for driving or regular outdoor activities! The price is a bargain, better than buying from regular stores.    Be careful they&#x27;re fragile. The metal piece that connects both lenses can break them easily if lens are bended slightly. So make sure to keep them in a solid eyeglasses case when unused. I have broken a couple of them already.  About the seller. The service is prompt and the product is the same as what I have purchased in a regular store. However the package wasn&#x27;t well protected. It&#x27;s lucky the product wasn&#x27;t arrived broken. It&#x27;s only wrapped with newspapers in a paper thin plastic bag.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the clip-on sunglasses.  The clip ons are nice and slim, so easy to slide into a small extra glasses case that I had, and then I have them handy in my purse.  They are very light weight, which is good on one hand, but because of that, they may be very easy to break, so I try to be careful with them. Since I wear prescription progressive lenses, it would be more of a hassle and cost to have a complete separate pair of sunglasses, so I&#x27;m happy to have found a size and style that works with my lenses.  Oh, and I feel that the level of sun / glare protection is also satisfactory.  If you want this type of clip on or magnetic style to match your glasses exactly, you would probably pay $100 or more to order or have them made, so the clip ons are a money-saving alternative.</li>
    <li> These do fit prescription glasses with plastic frames well, provided you check the measurements and and make sure they are compatible. They are, however, quite fragile, as another reviewer also mentioned. I&#x27;ve gone through two of these clip-ons in a matter of months. I used them mostly for driving. While I did not handle them roughly, there were times when I had to put them on or take them off in a hurry, which they did not tolerate well. Unless you can ensure that you handle these clip-ons carefully all the time, don&#x27;t expect them to last very long.</li>
    <li> Very light and usable product. Easily clips onto my prescription glasses.</li>
    <li> I must have ordered the wrong style as they do not fit my glasses well. Otherwise they work well. The price was half what the same type of glasses were at Walgreens. Great value if you order the right size</li>
    <li> Light weight, easy off and on.  Good for thick lenses.  Would have given 5 stars if they had different shapes in this category.</li>
    <li> Prompt service, good product.  They fit my glasses perfectly.  I would definitely get another pair for my spare glasses.  Great!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product for price, design and function.  However, this is my second pair that has broken.  You should consider this as a disposable product.</li>
    <li> I really like these.  Great product .</li>
    <li> Fits great. Great quality and pretty fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Got them for my wife. She loves them. Very good quality and stay secure on her glasses.</li>
    <li> I love these clips.  Fit my larger plastic frames great.  Just make sure your order correct size.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like these clip ons. The only issue is this is my second pair due to one of the clips coming off, but if used properly its probably not an issue. I tend to be rough on glasses, and covers...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see well with this on my prescription glasses. In a recent outing, I attempted to put this on three times, each time I had to remove it after a few minutes because, facing the sun direction, I could barely see anything due to excessive glare caused by this clip-on sun glasses.</li>
    <li> I like the spring loaded mechanism that holds the clip ons to your glasses. However, the plastic is very cheap and I don&#x27;t expect them to last more than a year.</li>
    <li> They fit great and work great. They are a little fragile but I don&#x27;t think this is much of an issue for the price</li>
    <li> Fit well and great for the price</li>
    <li> Fit on thicker plastic frames with ease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of days. I&#x27;m surprised how well the spring-loaded mechanism works, making it cover my glasses perfectly. The only complaint I have is, it&#x27;s hard to put on or take off with one hand. So if you&#x27;re carrying something relatively heavy with one hand, you usually have to put it down and use both hands to put on this clip-on sunglasses.</li>
