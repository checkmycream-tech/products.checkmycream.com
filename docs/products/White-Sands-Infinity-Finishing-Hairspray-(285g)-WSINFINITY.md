      <li>Holds for a long time while leaving your hair smooth.</li>

    <li> This is a great hairspray! Holds for a long time while leaving your hair smooth. I definitely recommend it. The smell is great. This is the only hairspray i will ever use. Once you try it you won&#x27;t go back to any other spray.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to do my younger sister&#x27;s hair for her formal dinner, and it worked amazingly well. I remember using this product as a hairdressing apprentice and having a lot of fun making barrel curls stand straight up on top of the head block. I knew it was a great product, which is why I chose it to do my little sister&#x27;s hair. As any hairdresser knows, you don&#x27;t wash your hair the day you want to do a formal style with it because it&#x27;s then too clean and won&#x27;t want to stay. My sister, however, is not a hairdresser and did not know this- so she washed her hair and hour before I was meant to do it. I was very concerned that the style (that included a few hanging curls) wouldn&#x27;t stay in for the whole night, and with any other product it wouldn&#x27;t have, but when she got home everything was still perfect thanks to the White Sands Infinity Finishing Spray. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> White Sands Infinity Finishing Hairspray was used by my stylist and is probably the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to find it on Amazon. I just wish I could buy a case of it.</li>
    <li> One of my Fave Hair Products! A great spray (finishing spray) that gives a great final hold, yet you can run your fingers through it and restyle immediately if desired. A good product for fine to normal hair of varying lengths. Once you try it, it&#x27;s sure to become part of your regular hair styling routine!</li>
    <li> I live in a very humid state and this hair spray out of all hair spray products i use this is my favorite it&#x27;s very light on your hair it does try to stop any frizz and it&#x27;s very easy to brush thru would diffently buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and still like it the best.  I try others but keep going back to this one.</li>
    <li> It is the best hairspray! My hair is very fine and goes limp almost immediately but it stays all day with this hairspray, even when it&#x27;s raining!!!!</li>
    <li> This product does what it says....keeps the hair styled just the way I want it. It seems to have stronger hold than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this to anyone unless your wanting to walk around with helmet head all day. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with your  white sands hair products both the hair spray and the orchid oil. Please inform me if you have promotions on these products. Thank you. Dorothy</li>
    <li> The best spray I have ever used! I have used it for years!</li>
    <li> Great hairspray that holds your hair without being sticky or looking like a helmet head.  Also, the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> I was first given this spray by my stylist and I love it. I will buy it from now on. It holds very nicely and then when you sleep on it and restyle in the morning your hair springs back to the style and it does not feel sticky or plastic. The memory hold is wonderful. I really think this product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. I call it my &amp;#34;good hairspray&amp;#34; as , when I know that I want my hair to stay looking great , I use it.</li>
    <li> this spray really holds your hairdo in</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, I don&#x27;t use it all the time.  If you use too much it makes your hair feel dirty.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used! It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done and the hold lasts for hours. It also doesn&#x27;t make a sticky coating on your hair so you can still run your fingers through it. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone :)</li>
    <li> I was turned on to this product by my hair stylist. This is the only product brand that she uses. It holds well even with fine hair, without weighing it down. Love it!! Great pricing and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> It was nice, and kept my hair up however it works just the same as one I can find at walmart or target.</li>
    <li> this hairspray allows for additional styling after you spray.  it&#x27;s amazing what you can do this product.  additionally it keeps the moisture in and really protect my hair from thr Arizona sun.</li>
    <li> Simply the best finishing spray product ever. My fine hair and I love it!  Worth every penny and I will never use anything else on my red hot locks.</li>
    <li> Great for styling hair in humid climates!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this hair spray for my very fine hair.  It holds with no build up and build up is really a problem with fine hair. Glad I bought it.</li>
