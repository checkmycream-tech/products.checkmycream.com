<li> I&#x27;ve been using Hydro 5 razors for as long as they&#x27;ve been around, and have never once had razor burn until using these.</li>
<li> My husband uses these to shave his head, and he has a hard time getting the back of his head with these blades.</li>
<li> So, I can&#x27;t say for a fact that they are not genuine Schick, but if they are, they are not even close to the ones that come with the razor.</li>
<li> They look very similar, but the poor quality is immediately noticeable.  </li>
<li> They aren&#x27;t terrible, but I just placed an order for the US version.</li>

    <li> These cartridges were is a different language but the blades were the same. They work great and are my favorite blade!</li>
    <li> cut your costs--get a clean shave---when others put out products frequently, hydros 5 by schick have been around a lot longer---target price for 2 four packs, 33 dollars plus tax.  amazon 2 four packs, 18 something!  I rest my case.</li>
    <li> cuts the hairs off my face very good</li>
    <li> These blades with the Japanese writing on the box are different than the ones I buy in the states. Smooth shave, but wear out much quicker. Spend a little more and get the made-for-US blades, it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run. I&#x27;ve been using Hydro 5 razors for as long as they&#x27;ve been around, and have never once had razor burn until using these. They aren&#x27;t terrible, but I just placed an order for the US version.</li>
    <li> i use them to shave my head and they work well.</li>
    <li> Exact product. Works as expected, great price.</li>
    <li> China made but still a close shave. More band for the buck</li>
    <li> I cannot say for sure if it is the seller or just the product here....but what I can say with absolute confidence is that these are not NEARLY the same product that comes with the original Schick Hydro 5 razor.  I bought the razor and it came with 2 refill cartridges.  Each of those refills were amazing.  They were the sharpest, longest lasting razors I have ever used.  Based upon that experience, I ordered these refills.  They are NOT the same as the genuine Schick refills that come with the razor.  No way.  No how.  They look very similar, but the poor quality is immediately noticeable.  They are not sharp, nor are they made with quality.  These replacement blades were duller fresh out of the box than the original ones were after 15 days of every day, 2 person use.  So, I can&#x27;t say for a fact that they are not genuine Schick, but if they are, they are not even close to the ones that come with the razor.</li>
    <li> In Japanese, in german, in english or spanish Hydro 5 it is just the best razor that exist right know in the market BY FAR, buy with confidence, save some bucks, buy intelligent, stay alive longer....</li>
    <li> great product cane as discribed. Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> My husband uses these to shave his head, and he has a hard time getting the back of his head with these blades. So he borrowed my Venus again (the reason why I bought him these). Looks like we&#x27;re trading.</li>
    <li> Was surprised that the package was written in Japanese. ?..but good blades</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other brand and the Hydro last beyond the color marker on top.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> What can I say, thee blades provide the smoothest results. I wish they were cheaper. I don&#x27;t know how these companies can sell razor blades for so much. But for now, I&#x27;m just glad they work.</li>
    <li> Best 5 blade razor cartridge you can get.</li>
