<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Winter air New Hampshire is very dry, and running a woodstove at home makes the air even drier.  U-Lactin is the only product I&#x27;ve used that keeps my skin from drying out over the course of a day.</li>
    <li> Good substitute for Betamide lotion, which is no longer available.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and I love it.  Best lotion for dry skin I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It&#x27;s more expensive than many other brands, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Reaching 60 no longer allowed me to have soft, moist skin, and it was driving me crazy!  I have tried about 2 dozen products, including prescription LacHydrin, but have not received relief from the flaking, itching, and even painful skin.  The top layer of my skin had also begun to feel rough and stiff, as though I had stuck a thin layer of cellophane on it. My last attempt at relief was slathering a body oil all over my body, but that required laying down protective towels or blankets on my couch.  It took away the pain, but a couple of hours later, I could see that the flakes were still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching dermatologists recommendations, I sought a lotion containing urea and lactic acid.  Thought I&#x27;d give U-Lactin a try.  I was amazed with the product the first day!  The lotion actually soaked into my skin on the first application.  The flaky areas immediately improved, the itching stopped, and the ugly old lady \\&quot;alligator\\&quot; patterns smoothed out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NWCRDS U-Lactin Moisturizing Lotion - 16 Oz]]</li>
    <li> This worked better on my winter dry skin than any lotion I have ever used.  I slathered it all over my alligator skin after my shower, and it seemed to take away the dryness instantly.  It also lasted until my next shower, and my skin remained smooth, moisturized, and soft.  (Even my husband commented that my arms felt so soft, although he didn&#x27;t know I had tried a new product.)  I also love it as a facial moisturizer.  Goes on light and soaks right in.  Will buy again and again.  update - Have reordered, and so has my elderly mom.  She has some kind of discoloration on her shins, and swears that this lotion has lightened and smoothed out her skin.  Great lotion for legs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many hydrating lotions. This stuff is amazing. I will never buy any other lotion. Doesn&#x27;t have a scent (that I can tell) and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry cracked foot soles.  Best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
    <li> I use this on my feet and it is great. I love the price and it was not damaged during shipping.</li>
    <li> I noticed that there were these little bumps on the underside of my forearms and my elbows were looking a bit scaly. After doimg some research, it looked like using a lactic acid product was a possible solution. Ulactin is now my new favorite go-to moisturizer for just about everything. My little bumps are gone (took about 10 days of daily application) and even some small dry patches on my hands and legs are completely gone. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My mother has really dry elbows, and regular lotion was not doing the job, she has been using this and said that it works great.</li>
    <li> A dermatologist gave me a sample of a urea/lactic acid lotion for itchy legs.  It worked great, but I couldn&#x27;t find the brand when I wanted to buy more.  I bought U-Lactin as a replacement.  I used it for a while, but it did not help my maddeningly itchy legs at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon closer inspection of the ingredients of the two lotions, I found that my sample had 25% urea, but U-Lactin only has 10%.  I searched for another lotion that has 25% urea and found one.  My legs are happy again.</li>
    <li> My podiatrist recommended I get some AmLactin for my foot, which I have psoriasis on, to help with the itching, scaling and cracking.  This stuff is amazing!  My foot feels so soft to the touch and the itching and scaling go away, especially with repeated usage.  The pump is very convenient, so you aren&#x27;t trying to squeeze a bottle with slippery hands during application.  I will definitely reorder this product and have recommended it to my family members who have similar issues with their feet.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  We are allergic to lots of perfumy stuff and this works so great without the perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent SO much money on different lotions and creams trying to obtain soft hydrated skin. My search is over!!! Not only is my skin soft and supple but the bumps on the back of my arms and thighs are GONE! I decided to try it on my face and it was AMAZING! When I woke up my face was glowing and looked great. I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at all. It&#x27;s amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this lotion for 20 years,  it is the only non scented - lightweight lotion that helps keep my hands from breaking out with tiny blisters exzema? I dont know,  I just keep buying it. well worth the money but getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> I have a wonderful doctor that seems to understand not everyone want to be on scripts all the time. She told me about U-Lactin years ago and I&#x27;m glad she did. You can buy all those fancy and expensive over-advertised products, but, once you try U-Lactin, you&#x27;ll be sold. I live in the Northeast and our winters, along with being quite cold, can be very drying to your skin. I use this product once in the morning and again at night and my hands are so smoothe. One bottle will last you all winter. Try it...you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite skin moisturizing lotion. It is unscented and spreads smoothly. The urea in the product makes it very effective. I also like the new dispenser/bottle better than the previous design.</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 of the 16 oz btls &amp; got one righta way.............    the other were on the back order, but did arrive within a month    it does the skin well</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product for my eczema. It clears up my problem areas and leaves my skin very soft! The smell is neutral.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of lotions that soften and hydrate, but don&#x27;t remove the dry flaky skin. This lotion removes the flaky skin and leaves the hands smooth.  So far it the best lotion I&#x27;ve found to do this. I think it would be good for people with psoriasis on their hands.</li>
    <li> The U-Lactin was purchased for my wife to try because many over-the-counter products irritate her skin and she was looking for one that would work without the irritation. After doing an Internet search, we came upon U-Lactin as a recommended product. This is actually our second order, since she was extremely pleased with the first bottle. I&#x27;m sure we will continue to order the U-Lactin in the future.</li>
    <li> This lotion works!! My 12 year old son is allergic to basketballs and we have tried everything this season for his peeling palms.  This is the only over the counter product we found to work.  Put it on after bathing especially to keep the moisture in.  His dermotologist has since given him a higher percentage prescription of this urea cream to clear it up more quickly next time.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Suggested by my dermatologist to help my dry skin - it has helped enormously.</li>
    <li> Really helps with severely dry skin. As an RN, I am constantly washing my hands. In the winter this leads to extreme drying out of the skin on my hands (and winter dries out my skin anyway, all over, especially elbows, knees and shins). I have used this all over -- hands, knees, elbows, shins, even my face after exfoliating with BHA. I have been able to head off the winter cracking of skin on my knuckles and the backs of my hands with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tingle a bit when you put it on. But it helps. An added bonus is that this lotion seems to make your skin absorb more of anything else you put over it. So sometimes I&#x27;ll use this, and then half an hour later I&#x27;ll put on another moisturizing lotion on my hands or even my face. It really helps keep the moisture in, even in super dry winter indoors climates with the heat turned up.</li>
    <li> Great product but cost was a little higher this time.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time researching products for dry skin, especially after starting medication that only made my dry skin worse. Using this once a day has made my skin entirely smooth. I would recommend it to anyone. The urea is the secret ingredient :)</li>
    <li> Wow this is the best moisturizing and most effective exfoliating lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;ve tried Amlactin, Alpha-hydroxy AHA lotion, and many others that contained high levels of Ammonium Lactate, which gave me a rash that was difficult to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I almost didn&#x27;t try this lotion because of my prior terrible experiences, but I&#x27;m so happy that I took a chance. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 3 weeks and the texture of my skin has become significantly smoother, softer, and it seems to be fading my body acne dark spots, as well as preventing blackheads/acne.  It&#x27;s also so gentle that I can use it right after shaving my legs without irritation or stinging! I highly recommend it; a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could...please never stop making this or change the formula.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t entirely thrilled by the feeling this lotion left on my skin, and I don&#x27;t see how it can rejuvenate with such a small amount of lactin. I won&#x27;t be buying any more, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My doctor prescribed me a lotion that was $$200  dollars and she said there was no fixing KP, BUT this lotion worked. It&#x27;s not that stickey and cleared up my bumps on my legs and arms in a week!</li>
    <li> Healed rough patches I had been struggling with. This is the real deal. My podiatrist turned me on to urea,</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions I have ever used.  My Uncle recommends it for dry, cracked skin, especially in the winter when the air is so dry.  He also prefers it because it is non-greasy.</li>
    <li> .  This product was recommended by my dermatologists to strengthen the paper thin skin on the backs of my hands and arms.  It also  helps to soften and slough off those awful &amp;#34;sun-spots&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It truly works great, I notice that it tends to work better after you take a shower, but yah! amazing buy this dont mess with other products.</li>
    <li> Its about time a skin lotion that actually works. My wife has had extremely dry skin since elementary school and was picked on about then now its great smooth looking skin.</li>
    <li> When &amp;#34;Betamide&amp;#34; shut down, I started trying other products. This was my third product try and now use it only. Stops the winter itch and dry skin. Not greasy and easily works in.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Helped with my keratosis pilaris within a week!!!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I ordered this item on 04/07 and received it super fast (in two days) and began using it expressly by the instructions. Today 04/18/2014, I am absolutely AMAZED at what has transpired. I mean, I have struggled with so-called &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; (keratosis pilaris) on my upper arm/elbow, my thighs and lower back, since my early teens and even with multiple trips to dermatologists over the years and many other ointments, creams, lotions, potions, home remedies and the like, I decided to try this (largely in part to the reviews that I had read here), just as a last ditch effort. I must say, because I had so many other disappointing options, I was TRULY reluctant, skeptical, doubtful, to throw any sum of monies towards any more options, BUT, I did and I&#x27;m SOOOO glad I have done so with this product. While I realize that one product isn&#x27;t the miracle cure for all, based on my experience in just ONE week and the multiple expressed experiences of the other reviews you may read here, I can unequivocally say that my monies and time thus far, have been extremely well spent. It is remarkable how much of a difference there is in my skin texture there is and the improvement continues, (IN JUST ONE WEEK). I will update this in another 3 weeks to let you know if I&#x27;m still as elated as I am now. If you are like me, and don&#x27;t want to always resort to the sun to temporarily relieve this condition, (which would be much to the dismay of any dermatologist) give this product a try. It is well worth the expense, which I don&#x27;t find to be too outrageous, considering the benefits. I hope this was helpful and I&#x27;ll let you know in a few if I&#x27;m still on board.</li>
    <li> U-Lactin is difficult to find off the shelf in retail and is usually much higher priced. This is a good resource and will be buying more very soon. This product was recommended by a dermatologist. Great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t heard of &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; as a condition, but I was already experiencing it on the back of my upper arms. My husband has it on his thighs also. No amount of lotion would get rid of the bumps. U-Lactin does clear up (moisturize) the pours without causing acne or irritation. It&#x27;s worth the money to have this specialized lotion for these areas. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the only lotion I could find that had the two ingredients recommended by dermatologists (urea and lactic acid). It seems to really help my skin, particularly when I put it on after a shower. It takes a minute to rub in really well but it is worth it. My skin gets really dry in the winter and this lotion seems to work better than the Vaseline soothing moisture lotion that I had been using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for my psoriasis.  It&#x27;s been getting pretty bad lately, but this stuff is helping greatly.  I do need to take the time to put it on more than twice a day, but- my plaques are getting thinner, and now I have no pain associated with the skin being so tender.  IT&#x27;s helping a great deal- plus, I&#x27;m not getting anywhere near the huge flakes that I did have.  I still have flaking, of course, but it&#x27;s tiny- not in sheets like it was.  For the price, I&#x27;d say, if you have a skin condition, give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I have kp and have always had tiny bumps on my legs and arms...just two days after using this stuff, it&#x27;s gone! I&#x27;m finally smooth! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product for my mother and myself.  I love the product and so does my Mother, we felt a difference in our skin right away.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doctor. I have a skin condition that requires careful care of my skin and doses of strong steroids that damage the skin. This lotion helps to restore some of the damage done. It is the best I have ever used, and I have used many.</li>
    <li> I am almost up with the bottle and 3 weeks ago started using it with the exfoliating body wash. While the body wash I can&#x27;t really feel a difference I definitely feel a sting when applying this. That isn&#x27;t bad since you know it is doing something at least and it isn&#x27;t painful to the point where I would stop using it. I do feel smoother skin (not always 100% soft) for KP but doesn&#x27;t do anything for the red dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using in the morning and then coconut oil in throughout the day. Just to give anyone that also suffers from KP an idea of the routine I do.</li>
    <li> Great product, really nourishes and gently exfoliates!</li>
    <li> Great lotion, I have dry skin and this lotion prevents my chapped lips and cracked fingers in winter</li>
    <li> Good quality product. It was exactly what I was expecting. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have ever tried for my keratosis on the legs.  As long as I use it everyday after I shower, I am bump-free and moisturized!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Item delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This is the best face moisturizer ever.  I have dry skin and it is perfect for my face and very inexpensive. I would recommend to everyone who has dry skin.</li>
    <li> Slightly and I mean Slightly greasy.. not bad at all. Good size and presentation. Don&#x27;t need a whole lot to do the job.</li>
    <li> Have Keratosis Pilaris, doc said to use Amlactin or something similar.  I prefer this particular brand, keep ordering same one.  Wonderful hydration ,  doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy,  Keeps the skin from itching, no strange chemical smells.  Leaves skin well protected. Read about Keratosis  Pilaris on website &amp;#34;EverydayHealth&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love that I can find this product here on Amazon for ~20% less than I paid elsewhere.  I love this lotion, and I am confident that it is not old, outdated stock.  The packaging was appreciated, it was shrink wrapped in an easy to remove soft plastic.</li>
    <li> I have severe dry skin and nothing works but this...buy it!!!</li>
    <li> Really good for dry feet.</li>
    <li> have very bad eczema and have to use lots of fragrance free lotion, so purchased this one, does feel nice an smooth on my hands but dosent last very long ,have to keep re-applying, not quite sure if its doing any good but will be back after a couple more weeks to see if my hand condition changes.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> U-lactin is great for rough skin.  It does soften it.  A little oily, but I need that as my skin has lost it luster.</li>
    <li> definitely works i have seen great improvements in my skin</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that keeps my dyshidrotic eczema at bay.  Happy to find it at such a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was recommended as a means against keratosis pilaris (chicken skin), but it seems to be a shortlived relief. By later in the day my skin feels like it usually does. Maybe I need to use it more than once per day?</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion of all time, recommended by my dermatologist at least 20 years ago when the skin on my face began to get dry.  I use it every day, for face and body, and LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This lotion is doing exactly what I expected. It is important to use daily...I can feel the difference when I miss a day. I will definitely be ordering this product again!</li>
    <li> lotion all on the outside of the container.  It appeared to be well packaged and my bottle did not appear to have come open, so I assume the lotion came from another bottle.  Will not buy again because of the mess.</li>
    <li> After 2 trips to the doctor and multiple prescription and over the counter creams, I found this and it actually worked! My daughter has keratosis that embarrassed her and this has practically made it disappear after 1 week of using it twice a day. However, she does have to use it daily or it will come back.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my KP....I am hopeless again...</li>
    <li> The best product I&#x27;ve tried for KP!  Other products either did nothing or were so thick that I couldn&#x27;t use them.  This lotion is very light but very effective. I like using it because it sinks into my skin and leaves no greasy feeling. I can wear clothes over it without worrying about stains. There is no real scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one week of daily use, my skin is almost back to normal.</li>
    <li> when I opened the box the lotion was opened and had leaked.  I will live with it because sending it back seemed like too much of a hastle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using U-Lactin 1-2 times a day since I purchased it to try to manage my KP.  This was my last resort.  I&#x27;ve had it pretty bad since finishing up a round of Accutane a few years ago.  Not sure if there is a correlation, but it seems that once my Vitamin A levels dropped, my KP went insane. Anyway, I&#x27;ve had bumps, scabs and scars up and down my arms for years.  I can&#x27;t use Amlactin because my skin it too sensitive. But this stuff, U-Lactin, had made an incredible difference.  My arms are slowly looking better, healing and don&#x27;t have as many new &amp;#34;crops&amp;#34; of KP popping up. I&#x27;m a fan and will definitely buy more once mine runs out.</li>
    <li> My skin has always suffered from being too dry, and living in Idaho(which is basically a desert) I never thought I&#x27;d be able to get it under control. I&#x27;ve tried so many things, but this started working almost the same day! And now almost two weeks later, I can hardly believe the difference. No problem with packaging or shipping. No more chicken skin for me :)</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for dry skin on hands and feet. Only need a tiny bit; works great around cuticles to help prevent hangnails, and soothe dry heels.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing skin cream available.  The spots on my head that the dermatologist have been following for possible cancer have completely disappeared.  My last check up (this week) was completely clear!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this.  After just a couple of uses, the bumps on my thighs from keratosis pilaris are gone...smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on keratosis pilaris.</li>
    <li> This product does NOT contain Ammonium Lactate !!  It is listed under Ammonium Lactate Lotion which is TOTALLY INCORRECT</li>
    <li> I love it because Colorado is very dry and It does a great job of lubricatiing my sking and the fact that it is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for many years. If you are bothered by dry, itchy skin in the wintertime, this is the lotion to use.</li>
    <li> Having a skin sensitivity to Glycerin based moisturizing products (Gold Bond, Vaseline Intensive Care, etc.), my Dermo Doc provided me with a sample of U-Lactin about 6+ years ago.  It works GREAT for me, with my general dry skin issues during the winter, and I have been using this ever since.  My wife has also now been using it pretty regularly.  She has no sensitivity like I do but she really likes it (light smelling) and works very well for her also.</li>
    <li> This is actually a great product. Skin was 50% smoother by 3rd day(nightly application) and under good control by the 2nd week. My keratosis pilaris is graded moderate to severe on thighs and moderate on upper arms. Unfortunately, red scarring will take much longer to fade but at least the texture and itchiness subsided greatly.&lt;br /&gt;It is urea base so I only applied at night to avoid smelling like old urine. The concentration is low enough that it may not have that effect but just in case.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend NOT using this product if your skin is irritated, or rashy...it is NOT meant for eczema rashes because it will burn but you can use it to prevent eczema, dry skin, KP, cracked heels.</li>
    <li> seems to be my dry spots on my hands</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist recommended it and we love it! It works wonders on your feet and and takes care of dry skin with just a couple of applications.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for dry skin, I have kp I have been trying to use it for that, but I didn&#x27;t work. It has only kept my skin hydrated and smooth that&#x27;s good for keeping my skin nice and smooth, but I still have the bumps unfortunately.</li>
    <li> good lotion.  great buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I am so glad Amazon carries it.  Amazon makes it simple to find products that I cannot find locally.</li>
    <li> I have Keratosis and have been self conscious all my life about it.  This lotion works slowly so be patient!  If I could post before and after pictures of my legs and arms, the difference is AMAZING!  Use it right after you get out of the shower, you don&#x27;t need much.  1 pump will cover both arms with no issue.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed it being better or worse than other lotions but it stinks. Don&#x27;t like using it because of the smell</li>
    <li> Hoping to replace a more expensive lotion with this but it just didn&#x27;t work as well.  It was okay, but going forward will splurge for the brand name product.</li>
    <li> I was suprised how non-greasy it was for the length of time it hydrated.  Excellent product which I have recommended to others..</li>
    <li> No odor. Gentle on the skin and soaks in well. Doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy.</li>
    <li> Entire contents of bottle spilt inside packaging, bottle arrived empty.</li>
    <li> Light and nearly scentless mid weight lotion. Absorbed fast. Not much exfoliation. I used it on a face a few times with no irritation. It didn&#x27;t last particularly long, but I did like the simplicity of this lotion. Seems to be a quality product, with good ingredients; I just prefer a richer lotion in the winter. Bonus for not smelling like powder or gummy bears.</li>
    <li> My legs--my shins &amp; calves--are extremely dry. This lotion is very thin and didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. Maybe it works for people with skin not as dry as mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of extra scrubbing on the backs of my arms and legs since buying this product. It&#x27;s hard for me to tell if the extra effort is what&#x27;s keeping my skin smooth, or the lotion.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well as expected for an AHA, but the price was ok.  I probably would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; (keratosis pilaris) looks so much better after only a few weeks of use. My husband has even noticed the difference. Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> this lotion is the best available for my dry skin! it is not oily and really keeps the skin from scaling!</li>
    <li> This product is quite effective at combating chronically dry, itchy skin. The lotion is easy to apply, absorbs well and the pump is  convenient.. I will definitely keep this on hand  all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have ichthyosis and the combination of urea and lactic acid helps my condition.  The lotion is effective; there is a very slight odor that is somewhat unpleasant, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product compares to others like it because this is my first purchase but I have very severe keratosis pilaris so I didn&#x27;t exactly get that immediate of a result (which I wasn&#x27;t expecting from the start.) However, I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now along with dry brushing and I do see a change in the number of red bumps on my skin as well as I can visibly see small hairs where there are red bumps left showing that the hair is coming through on its own! It takes some dedication but it does help to improve the appearance of kp but it isn&#x27;t completely cured just yet.</li>
    <li> Smells a little funny, moisturizes well, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s given me earth-shattering results.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for people with dry skin.  The picture should be upgraded with a picture of the new style container.</li>
    <li> Made my skin baby smooth all day and even on days I forget to use it</li>
    <li> The smell is a little off (not bad, but a little odd), and I wish it came in a larger quantity, but I&#x27;ve been using this every day in the morning and my skin has never been so clear and smooth! Love this stuff. I ordered it just a little over a month ago and I&#x27;m almost all out, so I&#x27;m back to order again! Hopefully this time it won&#x27;t spill in the bag. It did waste a bit of the product last time.</li>
    <li> This helped clear the clogged pores around my triceps and back of my thighs(keratosis pilaris) Within a week of using this(and Drinking lots of water everyday) I started seeing improvement, I can see the little ingrown hairs come out of the pores, the bumps are no longer red, and its smoother too.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff.  She swears by it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the few weeks since I&#x27;ve gotten it and haven&#x27;t noticed any benefits yet. The smell is very unpleasant and it&#x27;s very difficult to rub in - even a small amount! I got it to help with the keratosis pilaris on my arms and it really hasn&#x27;t helped with that at all. I thought it would help with dry/itchy skin, which I get sometimes, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefit with that either. In fact, the coconut oil I was using before was doing a much better job so I&#x27;m switching back to that. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> This product makes the wrinkled skin on my arms look smooth and supple again. It works better than any other body lotion that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and my skin is soft and smooth - not an easy feat since I do have some trouble with keratosis pilaris.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy or sticky and can be reapplied with no negative effects on days when it&#x27;s especially cold and dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin, I have severely sun damaged skin and this product take the rough \\&quot;nubbiness\\&quot; away ][[ASIN:B0001ZA3Y2 U-Lactin Dry Skin Lotion - 16 oz.]]after the first use. It is truly amazing. Now if I could just find something that worked for that cellulite....</li>
    <li> My skin had almost a powdery surface from dryness.  I tried everything and slathered different ones on every night - to no avail.  The first time I applied this cream, my skin changed immediately.  I have patches of skin that feel like alligator and even these patches, after just two days, are changing.  I think the smell is great - no perfume is great for allergy sufferers.  It just smells like most unscented products and it disappears in about a minute.  The one thing I like best about this product is that it leaves no sticky residue.  Your skin stays soft all day.</li>
    <li> Didnt do its job. Rashes is still here, did not even minimize the rashes. Its very liquidy and its itchy in the skin. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Since Doak Pharmacy discontinued their Carmol 10 lotion two years ago, I was in search of its replacement and by golly I found U-Lactin at Amazon, the best place to look for arcane items.  I bought it and tried it on my husband&#x27;s very rough heels and turn them into into a baby&#x27;s behind (well, almost).  Nothing worked before without using very heavy duty emery board as well as foot lotion to smooth them out.  The reasons U-Lactin works so well was because among other things, urea is the key ingredient.  Both Carmol and U-Lactin contain urea but with a difference since U-Lactin also contains Lactic Acid that smooths the skin even more, so U-Lactin is definitely the better of the two brands.  Urea attracts moisture from the air and seals it on your skin, keeping it moist without feeling greasy or gloppy.  Urea also heals inflammations of your skin.  I use it both on my body and my face, at night as it works well for a total body care.  Just avoid the eye areas.  During the day, I would add a layer of lotion with SPF 15 to protect my aging skin.  I love my U-Lactin lotion.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft but not greasy.  Absorbs quickly so you can get dressed right away.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve had this dry crepey patch of skin on my shin that I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of oils and lotions to get rid of. After two uses of this lotion in winter, the patch looks much better and is not flaking as it did before. I do not smell the urine smell that other people have experienced as this lotion is unscented, light and can be worn alone or under your regular lotion. I love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I started using U-Lactin on a recommendation from my Doctor.  It keeps moisture in my skin without feeling oily or slick.  Very good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It helps to heal my dry skin throughout the winter.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. Recommended long ago by a dermatologist. When I use it, I don&#x27;t itch. And it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product highly recommend for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!I had keratosis pilaris on the back of my thighs.I just couldn&#x27;t stand the appearance of the bumps anymore.I did some research online.This product was mentioned a lot on blogs and websites.I saw results in about 3 days.I couldn&#x27;t believe it!!!ALL of the keratosis pilaris on the back of my thighs has completely gone away!!!!I am so happy that I purchased U Lactin.I can wear shorts and skirts without feeling self conscious.This product is good for my mild eczema too!!It is not greasy, absorbs quickly, a little goes a long way, and no strong fragrance!!LOVE this stuff.I call it \\&quot;the magic lotion.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Ive been using this throughout the summer months and my skin looks and feels softer. With that being said, I have not used it during the colder months when my skin is generally dry. That will be the real test for me and if I remember I will do a follow up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ulactin for years, and it is the only product that works for me.  It prevents eczema and heals dry skin.  Wish it was still available in stores.</li>
    <li> Never got to try the lotion. Was hoping it would get rid of those little red bumps that are sometimes on your arms. Anywho. It arrived in a box, in a bag, with lotion all over the inside of the bag. NO PEANUTS. NO BUBBLE WRAP. Genius! Pump was broken and not functioning. So I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous face and body moisturizer. It sinks in very very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. The urea in this cream is a keratolycitc agent, which means it really breaks down dead skin, which in turn, helps the moisturizer moisturize better. The addition of lactic acid helps to exfoliate as well and create a smooth appearance for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Urea creams such as this are great for KP aka chicken skin.  Apply this after you get out of the shower and then apply a thin layer of vaseline on top to lock in the moisture.  Your KP, if it&#x27;s not too too severe, should be eradicated within a few days,</li>
    <li> This lotion is really great.  I have been suffering from chronic chapped skin, so bad that it actually cracks, bleeds and is painful.  No OTC lotion I found has worked.  I have been applying this at least 1x in the AM (and 1x at night if I can remember) and it has been FANTASTIC.  I have not had any dryness or cracked skin since I started using it and it healed my hands in MAYBE 2 days!!  It&#x27;s also helped with my cuticles which tend to get really hard quickly.  I love how NOT greasy it is and how quickly it absorbs into my skin.  Will be buying more with no doubt!</li>
    <li> Day 3 of use: keratosis pilaris bumps are already deflating, all redness has gone, and my skin is beginning to look normal. I am never going without this lotion again.</li>
    <li> After the manufacturer stopped making Carmol 10, I found this product and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s handy in the bathroom after a shower.  My only wish is that they make it available in a 3-oz tube, like Carmol 10 was.</li>
    <li> Does what it promises for my specific skin problems, very quickly absorbed and soothing. I could not ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> Really really hydrating lotion! My skin feels much better and more hydrated! Love it!</li>
    <li> Works great for my skin condition! and rather inexpensive compared to regular daily body lotions with its therapeutic properties.</li>
    <li> Have used for about one week and notice a huge difference. Has definitely helped my dry skin. I hope with continued use some of brown spots will lighten. No unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This lotion works for me like none other, and like everyone else I recommend it highly.  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of lotions in the past, and this is fantastic stuff.  I&#x27;m so glad I can get it from Amazon, because our local drug store no longer will order it for me.&lt;br /&gt;My purpose for reviewing U-Lactin is not so much for the product, but rather for the packaging.  I like to order the 16-oz. bottles so it will last a while, but the dispenser is worthless, and I&#x27;ve just had to throw the &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; away because it does not work.  This is not the first time I&#x27;ve had trouble, as it happens with about every other bottle I get.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m that inept - it happens too often.</li>
    <li> item exactly as described.  This is one of my most favorite lotions for winter skin</li>
    <li> After having had an awful experience with U-Lactin&#x27;s terrible smell, I was absolutely delighted to try this U-Lactin which, to be honest, does not smell.  Whether it will make my skin as soft as the Am-Lactin needs to be proven, but based on my limited experience with it, it seems to be working.  It absorbs quickly and the pump bottle is easy to use.so I&#x27;ll no doubt buy it again.</li>
</ol>
