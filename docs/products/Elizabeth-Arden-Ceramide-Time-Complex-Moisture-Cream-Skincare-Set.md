      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love this face lotion.  </li>
      <li>I do love this moisturizer</li>

      <li>I am on my 4th bottle over more than a year.</li>
      <li>I love Elizabeth Arden moisturizer.</li>
      <li>the face, I love it.</li>
      <li>My favorite skin moisturizer of all time.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon and can keep enjoying a product I really like.  </li>
      <li>Great for all skin types, this moisturizer is very emollient for my extra-dry skin, light-weight and quickly absorbed, and the texture feels good going on.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended a ceramide face cream for my extremely dry skin, and this brand is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to use it for a couple of weeks to appreciate its full effect.</li>

      <li>It really is an excellent moisturizer, keeps dry skin soft.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I couldn&#x27;t find it, and would try various moisturizers, none of which I liked very much, or could compare to this Elizabeth Arden.  </li>
      <li>And having a sunscreen in it is excellent, protecting our skin from potentially dangerous uv light.  </li>
      <li>I have absolutely no idea why moisturizer is so pricy, other than the fact that we all seem willing to pay the price for it, but I do think Elizabeth Arden moisturizer is the best!</li>
      <li>It is very expensive at the cosmetics counter and eventually the price rose beyond what I could in good conscience spend for it</li>
      <li>I find that in conjunction with regular exfoliation with Cure Aqua gel, the Skin Science serums and Watts Retinol at night, I&#x27;ve removed all fine lines and  fading my sun damage spots and this stuff protects my moisture.</li>
      <li>It pumps out the wrinkles for real around your mouth, neck and of cause</li>
      <li>I have used this product for over thirty years and found the product I just ordered through amazon to be exactly the same</li>
      <li>I look early 50&#x27;s and am in 60&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Although, I can&#x27;t say it actually fits into a stocking very well in this packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, but they stopped making this Ceramide Time Complex and have changed the formula with a different name.  </li>
      <li>I generally use two or three containers over the course of a year.  </li>

<li> Rather than staying on the surface, ceramide sinks into the skin moisturizing on a deeper level.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Right now, the only complaint I have is that the package was VERY DIFFICULT to open.</li>
<li> I used other products to erase time, but this was hands down a no brainier for moisture.</li>
<li> I recommended this to my sister, who has not used cosmetic moisturizers and who lives in a very dry climate so her skin had really dried out.  </li>
<li> I do not use the little oil capsules</li>
<li> It&#x27;s one of the few products that combine ceramide with a sunscreen.  </li>
<li> It keeps my skin looking dewy-fresh all day with its hydrating complex that boosts skins moisture level up to 450% in one hour, and I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t smear under make up.  </li>
<li> I was so disappointed when I could no longer find it at my local drugstore.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, but they stopped making this Ceramide Time Complex and have changed the formula with a different name.  I was happy to find it on Amazon and can keep enjoying a product I really like.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this moisturizer for several years.  She says that it is the best that she has found since we live in a dry climate.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years...I look early 50&#x27;s and am in 60&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I do love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion.  I was so disappointed when I could no longer find it at my local drugstore. Quality is superb!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over thirty years and found the product I just ordered through amazon to be exactly the same but at a great savings.</li>
    <li> This product gives your face wonderful moisture, making you look younger.  It last alday ,you don&#x27;t have to re-apply. You only need a small amount which means it last a long time.  It pumps out the wrinkles for real around your mouth, neck and of cause the face, I love it.</li>
    <li> Great for all skin types, this moisturizer is very emollient for my extra-dry skin, light-weight and quickly absorbed, and the texture feels good going on.  It keeps my skin looking dewy-fresh all day with its hydrating complex that boosts skins moisture level up to 450% in one hour, and I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t smear under make up.  I like the ingredients, and I appreciate that it also has UV protection.  I recommended this to my sister, who has not used cosmetic moisturizers and who lives in a very dry climate so her skin had really dried out.  Her skin responded beautifully in only a week, and her friends are asking what she&#x27;s using!  It iOS non-comedogenic, and a high-quality moisturizer.  I will keep using it as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Elizabeth Arden for over 30 years, and when they first came out with the Ceramide Time Complex formula, I was sold.  It&#x27;s a great product, and I enjoy buying it online because the price is so great!  I won&#x27;t be without my Arden moisturizers, but this is the one I use daily under my makeup.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product I have been using daily for 13 years. It is the only moisturizer/anti-aging type product I use.  Using it daily enabled me to switch from a liquid makeup foundation to powder foundation once the Ceramide cream has had a chance to soak in. I generally use two or three containers over the course of a year.  A little goes a long way.  It is very expensive at the cosmetics counter and eventually the price rose beyond what I could in good conscience spend for it so I looked to the Internet and was delighted to find this discounted option.  I do not use the little oil capsules but I give them to my Mom as they work better for her skin type.  My skin type is like my Dad&#x27;s-- oily/medium/Mediterranean while hers is dry/fair/Eastern European.  I hope that this product is never discontinued and I hope that it will forever continue to be offered at an affordable discount.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was a good price.  It works excellent on my skin leaving it well moisturized.</li>
    <li> Have used this brand product for years.  Sometimes I couldn&#x27;t find it, and would try various moisturizers, none of which I liked very much, or could compare to this Elizabeth Arden.  It really is an excellent moisturizer, keeps dry skin soft.  And having a sunscreen in it is excellent, protecting our skin from potentially dangerous uv light.  It&#x27;s really the best. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am a 42 Asian/Anglo smoker living in desert dry Colorado and have spent 15 years hunting for something with sufficient moisture. This product is a god send. I am on my 4th bottle over more than a year. Heavenly. I can&#x27;t say I saw visible results aside from dewiness. I used other products to erase time, but this was hands down a no brainier for moisture. I use it morning and night.  I find that in conjunction with regular exfoliation with Cure Aqua gel, the Skin Science serums and Watts Retinol at night, I&#x27;ve removed all fine lines and  fading my sun damage spots and this stuff protects my moisture. Huge fan.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  My favorite skin moisturizer of all time.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for several years. Still like it.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer. Woks well for my skin. I use it for years. Also, price is the best available in the market. Will buy it again</li>
    <li> I am waiting to form an opinion on this product as I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week.  Right now, the only complaint I have is that the package was VERY DIFFICULT to open.</li>
    <li> What a bargain! Great stocking stuffer! Although, I can&#x27;t say it actually fits into a stocking very well in this packaging. I love Elizabeth Arden moisturizer. I have absolutely no idea why moisturizer is so pricy, other than the fact that we all seem willing to pay the price for it, but I do think Elizabeth Arden moisturizer is the best!</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my daughter.  I have used Elizabeth Arden Ceramide products for years and love them.  I got my daughter started and she says this is the best moisturizer she has ever used.</li>
    <li> Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Time Moisture Cream is amazing.  My dermatologist recommended a ceramide face cream for my extremely dry skin, and this brand is the best I&#x27;ve tried.
