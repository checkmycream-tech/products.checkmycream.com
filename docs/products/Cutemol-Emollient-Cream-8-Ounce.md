<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The best stuff ever!  My husband has had serious problems with dry, cracked hands and actually has an area on his thumb that is split open.&lt;br /&gt;No other product has ever worked on this problem, not even prescription strength moistureizers.  A doctor recommended Cutemol and it is the only thing that works!  Would give this product 10 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome.  I have eczema on my hands and wash my hands often which inflames the rash.  This helps provide a barrier and in turn helps my hands feel better and not be &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; all the time.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time as promised and is an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> Great find!  Keeps my super dry cuticles soft and pliable all year long.</li>
    <li> a small amount of this really makes a difference to my brittle nails and dry cuticles.  I only use it at night though, because it&#x27;s quite emollient.</li>
    <li> Definitely one of the best.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizes for my psoriasis and this has been the one I have returned to. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and get acute rash often, this really helped. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good cream for nails but the smaller size is less messy and easier to use. I recommend the 2 oz size.</li>
    <li> Amazing cream. Its very thick and that is why its recommended to be applied at night. Just make sure u have ur contact lens off before u touch this. It works wonders on my skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream and I use it every single day. As soon as I get out of the shower (while my skin is still moist), I use the cream on my feet, concentrating on my heals and nails. I used to have problems with my big toenails cracking in the right in the middle of the toe which is really painful.  I&#x27;ve been using Cutemol since last Christmas and my toenails are moist and haven&#x27;t cracked once in the whole year! I rub the excess into my fingernails and they are growing like crazy and very strong. Also, you need to use so little that the 8 oz jar that I bought lasted the whole year. I just had to buy a new one last week. You will love this product. No more cracked heels for me!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I had used it for years for my own severe dry skin, and recently thought to try it on my 4 year old&#x27;s eczema. She had severe cracked skin at the corners of her mouth - I tried steroids and other medicated creams without benefit. When it finally occurred to me to try the Cutemol, it literally got better within 48 hours. So pleased. Now using it for her daily on all of her eczema trouble spots. Great, strong product, great company.</li>
    <li> Thick, greasy, and irritated my eczema. Made me break out more after I used it.</li>
    <li> I have the driest hands on the east coast, and its only November and my knuckles and fingers were splitting. My son told me about this product and how well it worked for him so I ordered the 8 oz container and have been using it for about 5 days ,its a miracle all my cuts are healed and my hands feel great ! No more itching or burning or need for vaseline at night on my hands I only need Cutemol, I will never run out of this product.</li>
    <li> I worked for a Derm Doctor .They had samples of this.It&#x27;s wonderful.I Wash my hands often as I work in the Healthcare Field. Also great for dry ,cracked feet.Rub it in w a couple drops of water.You will see a difference after 1 use.....It&#x27;s a little greasy but a small price to pay, cuz it works and it&#x27;s the only thing that worked for my dry, cracked hands</li>
    <li> Great product, fast acting, will buy again and again</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for countering the extremely dry skin on hands and feet that can be a problem for those of us who live in dry areas of the West.</li>
    <li> So glad to find this product outside of a dermatologist&#x27;s office, and at a much better price too!  This is also good for healing scars to keep the skin hydrated!  Love it after a good foot soak!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer for ALL skin types, buy it!</li>
    <li> I spply this cream to my hands snd feet after shower at night. It ptotects my dkin snd make them nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says and goes a long way. It was recommended by my dermatologist. Also the price at Amazon is the best that I have found.</li>
    <li> Best thing for dry skin. Doctor recommended it. We always have it on hand.</li>
    <li> Perfect skin cream, reduces winter cracking.</li>
    <li> Nice heavy cream.  My skin splits on my thumb.  It softens the skin, but doesn&#x27;t heal it.</li>
    <li> Amazing cream!  Its the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Far better than prescription creams.  Works on eczema, winter chapped hands, dry cracked heels - anything I&#x27;ve thrown at it!  I see awesome results with the first application every time and it only gets even better with a second application.  Its thick and stays in place.  I usually apply it after a bath in the evening and will then use a thin, breathable glove or sock over top.  In the morning skin is smooth, soft and supple.  It even works on the worst cracked, bleeding heels.  I&#x27;m diabetic and anyone else who is will know that it takes more time for diabetics to heal than other, except with this cream.  It works; it REALLY works!  I&#x27;ve recommended it to others who also share my delight in just how well this cream works.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. My nails are no longer splitting. My hands are no longer dry.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. Very effective for dried out winter skin.  There&#x27;s a slightly greasy feel, but if you folow the instructions and apply the moisturizer and then rinse your hands and pat dry, there&#x27;s no residue at all.</li>
    <li> Cream seems to work as stated. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommend! A++++++</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have found it to meet every expectation.  It&#x27;s wonderful on dry, damaged skin and is the only product I have ever seen that will actually help nails to grow making them more healthy and stronger.  I would recommend this product to anyone whether they are young or elderly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of creams and lotions for dry skin and nothing -- NOTHING -- has ever worked as well as Cutemol.  It was recommended by my dermatologist after I developed eczema on one finger (I know!).  It feels very thick when you put it on but that feeling goes away within about 5 minutes or so.  It has a mild scent that goes away within 15 minutes of application, like many petroleum-y based hand/hair creams have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has helped keep the eczema on my one finger under control.  It worked so well I decided to try it on my super dry &amp; cracking heels.  After the second night, my heels were unbelievably soft.  I now use it on my feet twice a day - in the morning after my shower and then at night before putting on my pedicure socks.  I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to wear sandals in the summer!  For my hands, I use it throughout the day; a decent amount in the morning and at night, and a small amount after every hand wash.</li>
    <li> Great for ordinary cracked fingertips.</li>
    <li> I do not like moisturizers that are greasy. Cutemol really works to moisturize without being greasy. it is great for winter dry skinQ</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this cream for the face, she said her dermatologist told her to use it on her face.  It makes the skin smoother looking and eliminates fine lines.  It is thicker like a paste, but I skim it on all over my face neck and even on my decolletage which has made the skin more supple and younger looking.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product and delivery. Seeing improvement. Thankful for that.</li>
    <li> You can always tell a good cutical and nail cream by it&#x27;s texture. It should feel waxy to the touch and go on smoothly, leaving a shiny texture to your cuticles and nails for some time after applying. If it soaks into the skin, it&#x27;s NOT cuticle cream, it&#x27;s HAND LOTION. My nails are a mess, brittle &amp; dry and my cuticles are even worse. Over the winter the pain from my cuticles ripping and tearing leaves my fingers aching. I had previously tried a cuticle cream that was available from Bath &amp; Body works and it was excellent. It came in a 2oz tub, but they have since discontinued it. I spent a little over a year searching for a good cuticle cream, but most of them contain too much water. A water based cutical cream won&#x27;t stick like a mostly wax based cutical cream and will soak into the skin. You would think that&#x27;s what you want, right? Wrong! Actually it&#x27;s a wax based cutical cream that seals, heals and protects cuticals and nails. Cutemol having two main wax ingrediants does the job well. This is not a fix all, as you will still find your cuticles splitting (if you have dry skin like me) but if you apply a good amount of cutemol every night before bed (wearing \\&quot;sleep gloves\\&quot; also helps) this will most definitely heal up a good portion of hang nails, split nails and rough cuticles.  I recommend massaging vigorously into your nail bed, using a soft brush if possible. Apply extra cutemol if needed. Massaging the cutemol in deeply helps stimulate skin growth and will also help heal your hands and fingers. I also highly recommend this item for dry feet and heels. I had been using the Burts Bee&#x27;s foot cream and to be honest this works 10 times better (and costs much less!).&lt;br /&gt;Beware! This is NOT HAND CREAM. It is going to go on and stay on looking waxy, and if you are not familiar with cutical cream you may think this is strange. Trust me, a GOOD cuticle cream will need to look and feel that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried for the price. Even pricier cuticle creams don&#x27;t have the same effectiveness and texture as Cutemol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!cier cuticle creams don&#x27;t have the same effectiveness and texture as Cutemol.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This emollient is very thick, and great for winter skin cracks. I use it on a fingertip, and wrap it with a bandaid. Works great.</li>
    <li> The cream was recommended by my Dermatologist to use on the crack around my finger nails.  I was a bit shocked at the cost, but now know why.  I suffer from psoriasis and dry hands.  I use this cream daily and love it!  I would recommond this product for anyone who suffers from dry hands especially during the colder months.  If you follow the directions on the bottle by putting the cream on and washing your hands it&#x27;s not as greasy.  I put this on my crack lips as well and it&#x27;s cleared up my lips.  It&#x27;s not recommended for lips, but I didn&#x27;t have much to loose in trying it.</li>
    <li> This product really worked for my wife who received a sample from her dermatologist for dry splitting skin mostly on her hands.Received 8 ozs. for what you would probably pay for 2 ozs. Great delivery also</li>
    <li> I have suffered from very dry skin on my hands for over one year. This condition had recently become extremely uncomfortable and left me more likely to experience small cuts during housework or paperwork. However, after my first overnight application of the cream covered with cotton gloves, there was a major improvement in the dryness. My hands are much more comfortable today, and look smoother as well! I will continue to use this product, and will post an updated review later.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!! My hands have been so soft since I have been using this lotion.  I use to get hang nails but not anymore.  I have beeen using it on my feet as well and today I went to get a pedicure and the nail lady commented that my feet felt smooth.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had eczema on my hands for the past 10 years.  I tried various over the counter products but the only thing that worked was prescription steroids UNTIL I discovered Cutemol earlier this year. I was skeptical at first but after 3 days of use, I noticed a big difference. Since then, I have purchased 4 bottles. I LOVE this product.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product for my chronically dry cracking cuticles, heels and dry skin around toe nails.  Due to some medical conditions I suffered these problems, specially on my hands which I had to wash frequently for infection control purposes.  Cutemol has given relief.  I use it daily.  A little bit goes a long ways.  It also comes in 2 oz tubes useful for travel.  It works best on hands when directions to rinse hands, apply and then rinse again are followed.</li>
    <li> I find that this cream works well on my very dry skin. I use it every day.  My skin loves it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff help my eczema on my hands and feet. Love it</li>
    <li> Although it did not completely clear up the problem, it has helped.  We received it quickly and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> After just a few days your hands are smooth and soft.  No winter dryness showing!  I love it and use it year round!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine introduced me to this cream because I have so much trouble with my   fingers cracking and splitting and hurting every winter. I have been using this cream since November  and my hands have never felt or looked better and my fingers haven&#x27;t cracked and I am not living in  pain. Plus my nails have never looked better. I would bathe in this product if I could!! Do not be afraid of the price, it is well worth it, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot and it isn&#x27;t greasy. The jar works out to be a better deal than the tube. Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> In winter my chapped hands crack and sometimes split or bleed.  Cutemol helps a lot.  I need to re-apply more than twice a day when this happens.  However this product is the best I have found,</li>
    <li> Have severely dry feet that peel and this unfortunately did not help them.</li>
    <li> VERY heavy weight. I only use this at night time. If you rub it into your cuticles, you&#x27;ll never again need to cut them. Leaves my hands the best they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
    <li> This cream is all purpose, it helps your nails and cuticles....keeps feet in good shape.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Very helpful for winter cracked hands.  One of the best that I have found.</li>
    <li> The best hand cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Cute mil is a great moisturizer. Product was received as stated</li>
    <li> I had very dry rough hands. I have been using this cream for over 10 years. No drugstore-bought cream seemed to work as well.&lt;br /&gt;A young coworker recommended this cream because his wife, a manicurist, had dry, peeling and bleeding hands. Her dermatologist recommended this cream. And it worked!&lt;br /&gt;This cream heals fast and protects longer than any other cream. Two years ago, I gave my 28 year-old son half a jar. He just asked for more this year.&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW the directions,and you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. I always have a small tube in my purse. I live in a cold climate and tend to have dry skin. this provides relief without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on a quest for a better hand lotion.  This one stays on a while longer I think because of the wax but you will need to re apply after you get your hands wet or after a few hours to keep your hands and nails from feeling dry.  Excellent also for dry, callused feet.  But a bit expensive for my feet so I only use it for hands and nails.</li>
    <li> great moisturizing cream</li>
    <li> Have been using for years -- recommended by my dermatologist. Very good product -- but if your hands get as red and itchy (and sometimes cracks bleed), must apply many times a day; and sleep with it on all night.</li>
    <li> Doctor told me to use this to eliminate dryness on my heeld and bottom of my feet. Better than  bag balm</li>
    <li> love it.  If you have really dry hands and feet, this is for you</li>
    <li> great stuff for eczema</li>
    <li> I love this cream. If you have dry skin please get it. I use it on my heels and my nails. This is great for the cuticles. I have using this for the past&lt;br /&gt;12 years. My Skin Dr. gave me a prescription  for it and it worked. I never stop using it</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product!</li>
    <li> This product is sold at my dermatologist&#x27;s office. It is truly wonderful on really dry hands and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have problem dry skin, particularly hands and feet. I&#x27;ve tried MANY lotions and creams, but Cutemol seems to be most effective, particularly if used a few times a day and before bed. It has a heavy, greasy feel to it, but you can rinse your hands with water after applying, dry lightly, and the greasy feeling goes away while the beneficial effects continue. At night, I slather this stuff on my toes and heels and wear cotton socks to bed. In the morning, my feet are amazingly soft.</li>
    <li> Good for a regular lotion, but not worth the price. Regular hand or body lotion found in Walmart just as good.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better. Heals your hands over night. Try it because you will love it and always keep it in the house.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. You need to use it regularly for it to truly work its best. I also put it on dry even though it tells you to have damp heels beforehand. I find it works better for me. Even with one use it gets your heels to look well enough to go out in public!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband whose hands crack SO bad in the winter (we live in Maine) and we&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there that is suppose to heal without success but this one does!!!  It is excellent and we&#x27;ve recommended this to many people already and will continue to do so.  A very good product!!!</li>
    <li> It helps keep my rough feet smooth.  Much better than others that I used. Price is high, but worth it. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for anyone that suffers from SEVERE dry skin, or eczema.  Applying the cream can be challenging because of it&#x27;s thick consistency.  However, it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> After many, many seasons of cracked feet and fingers, I followed my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation of Cutemol.  I&#x27;ve not had cracked nails in years--literally, honestly!  It&#x27;s not inexpensive, but I use it nightly for one reason--it works!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and have been using this product for approx. 2 years on my hands and feet . It is the only cream that seems to help my very dry and cracked skin.</li>
    <li> Has really helped to heal my dry hands. I work in a hospital and this cream has saved me. Plus my derm recommends it!</li>
    <li> combined with DermaNAIL and my fingernails are BEAUTIFUL and strong. Am very happy.</li>
    <li> Cutemol is the best moisturizer cream I have ever used. I am a man with a lifelong problem with dry skin, especially in the winter. During that time my hands become extremely dry, accompanied by splitting at all my fingertips and very red sore skin on my knuckles.It is very painful. I have tried every cream advertising relief from this condition, but Cutemol, recommended by my allergist, is the ONLY product that worked, and worked better than I ever expected. I apply it at night and wear cotton gloves...sort of a Jackie Kennedy look. Although it looks a bit odd, this has been the solution I have long sought. This past very cold winter in NY would usually result in 10 disastrous cracked and bleeding fingertips and knuckles. Instead I didn&#x27;t have a single incident of either. Also, it keeps cuticles moist and therefore I need fewer manicures.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommend. So far I would say it has improved my extreme dry skin on hands by 10 percent with daily use for 2 weeks.  I was hoping for much smoother skin but am a nurse who hand washes too many times to count a day... Product is a bit greasy for my preference but I will continue to use as it was over 20 bucks for the product... Hoping for improved results soon.</li>
    <li> Finally a cream that actually helps heal cracked, calloused skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it under cotton gloves at night.</li>
    <li> this is a miracle worker cream - my hands are in water all the time and constantly dry - this is the first cream that has repaired my hands.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> this works so well on dry,cracked skin. Even though it is pasty.it works wonders. I use plastic gloves nightly with this cream,and it def does the trick. I constantly wash my hands so my skin gets cracked to the point that it sometimes bleeds. This is definitely recommended by me</li>
    <li> Love the tiny tubes, but they are very expensive.  Tried the jars which are more reasonably priced, but not as pleased with the product.  It&#x27;s a lot more liquidy and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist recommends Cutemol to her patients.  It is extremely thick and rich (not to my liking actually) but it does the job.  I have cracked fingers and, if used diligently, it works quickly to heal these cuts.</li>
    <li> I went to the dermatologist because my feet were so dry &amp; calloused that they were cracking in spots.  She gave me samples of Cutemol to try.  I have tried so many different dry skin creams for my feet.  This stuff is miraculous.  It fixed my poor feet right up.</li>
    <li> This is the very best hand &amp; body cream for dry skin. I have tried everything and this gets me through the winter without cracks in hands &amp; feet. I am now using it in the summer months as well... Nothing has ever worked this well.</li>
    <li> I use it on legs, feet, especially dry heels and hands as often as I can.  It&#x27;s thick, but really helps keep my dry skin managable.</li>
    <li> I have every skin problem you can imagine, starting with the absolute driest skin on earth. I hear others complain about their dry skin, then I look at it and in comparison to mine theirs looks normal. On top of the horrid dry skin, I have eczema, continual peeling skin syndrome (a rare genetic disease that means the tips of my fingers peel off, then turn hard, then peel off over and over since I was 3 years old), keratosis pilaris, and just generally gross skin. No drugstore lotions have ever helped. When a dermatologist recommends Cetaphil to me I want to slap them across the face and shout, \\&quot;Do you not recognize what you&#x27;re dealing with here?\\&quot; This is no run-of-the-mill dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly 30 years of pain and embarrassment, I ran across this lotion in the foot care section of Duane Reade, Given that I&#x27;ve tried everything, I don&#x27;t know what made me give this tube a try, without even reading reviews. But I did, and my hands have been changed. I can&#x27;t describe how grateful I am. My skin doesn&#x27;t ache. It&#x27;s not dry. It doesn&#x27;t even peel. To treat continuous peeling syndrome is a BIG deal, since every paper written on it says there is no treatment. Other emollient creams have helped a little, but nothing treats like Cutemol. And I mean I&#x27;ve tried everything - even this weird ointment I had to get in a Russian pharmacy that some peeling skin sufferers swore was the closest thing to treatment (and smelled like tree sap mixed with menthol). Cutemol is IT. Stop your searching and try it - a little dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is very good for moisturizing your skin. Has helped my cuticles and nails very much. Would recommend this to anyone that has dry hands.</li>
    <li> love it! actually worked very good on my bf feet I thought it would not work but his feet has gotten much better</li>
    <li> I have tried them all.  This is extremely moisturizing without the greasy feel left behind.  Better than anything on the store shelves.</li>
    <li> recommended by our dermatologist</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hand for 3 years now and have tried almost every hand cream out there.  This is one of my favorites!  It&#x27;s a thick white cream that leaves your hands oily but it&#x27;s great for overnight.  I put them on at night and sleep with a glove and in the morning, my hand isn&#x27;t cracked or dried.  I also really like The Neutrogene Norwegian Formula Hand Cream.  That one is like a petroleum jelly with the added benefit that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hand feeling oily after.  So that one is a good day cream.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this cream. My younger son and I get very dry hands. This is the best product I have ever used (and I have tried A LOT!). The only negative is that it smells like the hospital, but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Very good cream for extremely dry skin. My husband uses it all winter because his hands crack and bleed. It really helps.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I just wish it came in a big tube,the tub can be a little messy, but the cost is so much better in the bigger size.</li>
    <li> During the winter months my finger tips get cracked, sore and bleed, UGH! My dermatologist recommended this to apply nightly. This was the first winter I didn&#x27;t walk around with band aids or nu-skin on my finger tips. Great product, great price! I now use this exclusively even through the summer. This is a thick cream and takes some getting use to but it works and lasts through a couple hand washings. Definitely recommend for rough hands.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the smell and very thick</li>
    <li> Working in healthcare I wash my hands dozens of times per day. This has caused me to develop some eczema. Dermatologist prescribed constant moisturizing with this product. It is on the expensive side but you get what you pay for. One thing I learned in this process was &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; are better than &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; for treating excessively dry skin.</li>
    <li> My impossibly brittle nails have finally started growing! I use it every morning &amp; night.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product isn&#x27;t carried in local stores, but as long as I have access to Amazon I&#x27;m happy!  This is a miracle treatment for dry hands.  I have dermatitis on the palms of my hands that&#x27;s a reaction to gluten and as long as I use this regularly I don&#x27;t have to use the prescription steroid salve!  Oh, yes, and I don&#x27;t eat gluten products!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best emollient creams I have ever used. A little goes a very long way. If you have dry, sore, cracked heels, this is the perfect product for you. It&#x27;s great for your hands, elbows, and knees as well. The only thing I caution is to use just a little bit. Otherwise, it could get greasy and your feet will squish around in your shoes. In the winter, use this cream after your shower and put socks on. You won&#x27;t believe how wonderful your feet feel after a few days. But, it&#x27;s like anything else... if you stop using the cream, your feet will become cracked and sore again.</li>
    <li> This lotion works extremely well and quickly.  Recommend by our dermatologist. Have tried many other extreme condition lotions and they don&#x27;t compare how well this lotion works.</li>
    <li> Overpriced. Very sticky and uncomfortable to use. Nothing but mineral oil and water. Very messy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my heels &amp; feet. A jar lasts for almost a year. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever encountered for very dry skin.  Feels a little greasy going on but soaks right in.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample of this, and it immediately helped  a problem with dry cuticles and hands - I ordered it as soon as I had tried it just once...it is a heavy cream, and I wear gloves with it at night - wonderful for dry skin.  A little goes a long way![[ASIN:B000NSH2L4 Cutemol Emollient Cream, 8-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Still like Cutemol even though the price went up over 40% at the drugstore. I was very disappointed to see that the ingredients have changed and now there is no LANOLIN in the cream......what is that about? Lanolin was THE most effective ingredient in this cream.  I might get a cheaper cream in the future that has the same ingredients.....very disappointed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best cream I ever had. Really done a get job on my dry skin ,THE BEST will never use any thing else, Will be ordering more soon.Thank you</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist and is an INCREDIBLE cuticle cream. My cuticles are no longer ragged and torn, necessitating fewer visits to a nail salon and healthier skin overall. Although it&#x27;s somewhat heavy, you can rub it in completely at night, wear gloves, or wash your hands (as is suggested on the container). It&#x27;s truly a cure-all and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough! Cracked, ripped, torn cuticles? Red, chapped hands? This is your product! Can I give it even more stars?</li>
    <li> This cream is so nice and easy to use.  My heels stay nice and smooth.  I find putting on small footies at night helps keep the cream close to the feet and off the sheets</li>
    <li> This is a good cream for my hand. It has helped it</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because I kept getting cracked skin next to my thumbnails, and it was extremely painful. Regular hand cream, even good stuff like Neutrogena, didn&#x27;t help. The Cutemol worked amazingly well and quickly. I&#x27;ve only needed to apply it once a day (at bedtime), and haven&#x27;t had any further problems with cracked skin. Worked wonders on my feet as well. But... the big caveat is that you have to be prepared for 5-10 minutes of greasy stickiness before it gets absorbed. It just plain feels WEIRD, but it didn&#x27;t take me long to decide it was worth it. It has a subtle, pleasant fragrance, too. Contrary to the directions on the label, I&#x27;ve found that the greasy/sticky feeling goes away faster for me if applied to dry rather than damp skin.</li>
    <li> I use it for my feet.  Better than Aveeno and Lubrederm, both products I use for other parts of body.  I would not recommend this on hands or face/neck as it is way too greasy (so to speak).  I&#x27;m happy I got it.</li>
    <li> a colleague introduced me to Cutemol a few years ago.  I work in a hospital and wash my hands before and after every patient.Since I have begun using Cutemoldaily, I have successfully avoided the dry  hands and painful skin cracks that plagued me due to frequent hand washing and the usual dryness that occurs with the changing of the seasons.</li>
    <li> This is really helping my hands and nails! I put on at night wear cotton gloves while I sleep and am having great results.</li>
    <li> If yo have issues with dry or chapped skin, this product will work wonders. I have issues with my hands drying out in winter. I worked in electricial construction in the weather for years. It&#x27;s especially tough on your hands. Also, using sanitizers, which are alcohol based removes the oil from your skin and leaves it dry, Dry and cracked skin can be more than a cosemetic issue as it leaves a route for infection into your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been excellent for me. It&#x27;s not exactly inexpensive, but it works well and goes a long way. You need very little to produce a good result and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands with the typical feel of hand creams or lotions. My method of use: dampen your hands or whatever you need to treat. Apply a tiny drop of Cutemol to the surface of your skin and rub it in. The cutemol will help seal in the moisture and provide a barrier on your skin. I&#x27;ve given more of this away than you can imagine. It&#x27;s gone to doctors, nurses, construction guys, and others. They all love it and continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order a 2oz. tube first and try it. I&#x27;m prety sure you&#x27;ll like it better than anything you&#x27;ve used before. One warning: My wife likes to \\&quot;steal\\&quot; my Cutemol and use it to remove her eye makup; it&#x27;s a bit expensive for that, but it works great! I don&#x27;t recommend much, but I not only recommend Cutemol, I whole heartedly endorse it. In fact I buy it and give it to people I see who need it. They always order more!</li>
    <li> My hands spend a lot of time in water and harsh soaps, chemicals both at home and at work.  I always have splits in my skin that are quite painful.  I have tried many things in the past.  This was referred to me by a dermatology office.  It has solved my problem!  No more skin issues!  And I am so happy to have found this at Amazon!  Thanks again Amazon! I have been recommending this to all my friends.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> If you  have very dry skin, this Emollient Cream is excellent.  It has more moisturizers than Eucerin Cream.  It goes a long way also.</li>
    <li> This cream is soothing and it takes care of the dry skin I had on my palm.  I put it on every night under white cotton gloves.  It is not oily at all and during the day I add a little bit of water in my hand--mix in cream and it protects your hands from water.  I love it and so do my hands.  Thank you Amazon for your quick delivery.[[ASIN:B001H324JO Amazon.com Gift Card]]</li>
    <li> Works much better then many hand creams I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of hand creams this works the best.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 2 years now.  It really keeps my hands and fingers soft and free from drying out, cracking and peeling  Would recommend to anyone.  Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Best cream you can ever buy...for your dry skin..or other conditions you have on your skin...well be money spent well...my skin is clearly faster..</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for dry skin. My dermatologist recommended it for my very dry and cracking skin. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion. I have eczema and this really works. I&#x27;ve tried everything. My boss, a pediatrician, recommends this to his patients.</li>
    <li> This product works better than the other 6 creams I have tried on craked heels! I seems to fill in cracks and allow them to heal quickly. The best!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very grease and thick white cream.  I bought this after all the great reviews. I used for my severe dry skin and my dry cracked feet and unfortunately for me it did nothing. I hate to be only negative review about but I didn&#x27;t feel any better and went back to use Flexitol Heel Balm that to me is a little less grease and keep my feet smooth for a few days.</li>
    <li> After 1 jar, my feet were soft and smooth again. The army had left them scaly an ugly.   Thanks Cutemol!</li>
    <li> great cream the best for very dry climates</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!!The best for dryness. Use before shower and the results are phenomenal. Will reorder this item.</li>
    <li> a bit disappointed the cream was melted in the chair when it came to me.</li>
    <li> It was extremely creamy and covered my legs well but I broke out in a red itchy rash after using it so haven&#x27;t touched it since.  If you&#x27;re not allergic to it it&#x27;ll be great for you.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years! Best product on the market. Before I go to sleep, I get in bed and then put it on my hands and feet. All heal cracks and splits gone and feet and hands soft.  It&#x27;s only product that works for me. Highly recommend it, I&#x27;ve tried everything else and a dermatologist recommended this. Friends with eczema have found relief with this non prescription cream as well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a moisturizing cream that helped my extremely dry skin during the winter months.  This product really improved my skin appearance and kept my hands moisturized.  The only downside is that it takes time to rub in the skin and air dry due to the &#x27;pastey&#x27; texture.  However once absorbed in your skin, it works wonders!</li>
    <li> Great product, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this for hands and feet.  It is extremely emollient as my hands are working overtime.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time, well packaged and it worked for a short time.  Then it seemed to not work for me anymore on the spots I used it on.  This is what happens all the time so far with the different things I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I have tried several lotions like aquaor, eucerin, vainicream, Vaseline, etc. this is the only thing I found to work for my five month old&#x27;s eczema ( other than steroid shot). Very thick and has sort of diaper rash cream smell and feel. But stays on and keeps his skin soft.  So glad we tried this. It is so worth the money. If you&#x27;re looking for a great lotion for eczema , give this a try.</li>
    <li> The best product for winter hand dryness</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of use, it 98% eliminated my peeling fingernails problem.  It requires continued, daily use.  I apply and rub in to my fingernails and cuticles each night before going to bed.  One 8oz jar has lasted 18 months for me.</li>
    <li> Item as described and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion recommended by my dermatologist</li>
    <li> After a week of using this, my nails are awesome! No more hangnails, or dry cuticles. My eczema is almost 100% clear! Even on my arms and legs! It was like taking over my legs and arms. Was embarrassing. This stuff is goopy, and doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t make YOU smell bad. I always put on some lounging pants and socks to help soak in any excess I may have on my skin. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I see a big difference in the skin on my heels.  My heels are less cracked and dry.  I have applied each night and put on a clean dry cotton sock.  I have tried many other products for this condition, but seem to be getting great results from this one.</li>
    <li> There is NOTHING like Cutemol. I am a nurse and wash my hands more times than I care to count. In the winter months my fingers crack and truly hurt. This product helps more than anything I have ever tried and I will not be without it. Great for the heels as well.</li>
    <li> We use this on our tired ,beat-up achy feet. We are hickers and arter a long outing trekking and climbing our feet have he&#x27;d it. Having tried a good number of other similar products we tried this. What luck ! Totally smooths and sooths,tired ,sore and sometimes cracked feet. A little goes a long way so it is economical. We highly recommend this cream for anyone who is on their feet extensively as well as hikers,walker,jiggers ,runners ,etc.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream for my extremely dry and cracked hands, This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m getting ready to order some more.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended it for my incessantly dry hands. I decided to use it on my heels because they are always incredibly dry and often cracked. I was amazed at what one night of lotion on my heels (with socks) did.</li>
    <li> great for eczema or dry skin and a great  price</li>
    <li> I love this product and it was shipped and delivered properly. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for the eczema skin, my son kept scratching his skin even after applying the cream. I gave it three stars because it&#x27;s thick and moisturizes the skin</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  The little cracks around my fingernails heal when I use it and my hands are also softer and more resilient.  I tend to use it at night, when the emollient has a chance to sink in and not be subject to water or soap after I apply it.  That helps the material do its work.</li>
    <li> I used this cream along with PURE olive oil on my daughters skin.  She suffers from severe eczema and this cream has really helped keeping her skin moisture and from constantly scratching.  Bought a 2nd one.</li>
    <li> I originally was given this as a sample after having very sensitive skin and dry cracked hands and fingers.  This Cream has done wonders for my hands.  It goes on greasy, but absorbs into your hands quick and keeps moisture out.  Great for densitive skin!!!  It jhas even worked well on my son&#x27;s excema!!!  Works great when put on at night if the greasy feeling bothers you.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with extremely dry and/or cracked hands.  It is the only thing that has helped me.</li>
    <li> I had severely dry skin on my face. I use this every nigbt, not only did it clear up my face, reduce the size of my pores, makes my skin like baby skin, but it makes my lips baby soft too. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on oily faces for obvious reasons. But for me, this product is a miracle product.  Only apply at night because of the thickness.</li>
    <li> The best cream for growing strong nails, soft cuticles, and soft hands.  They require more words, but that&#x27;s a stupid rule.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested to me by my podiatrist, who gave me samples.  I was delighted by the result.  Even in summer, regular use prevents hard, cracked foot callouses from forming.  It also strengthens the nails on my hands, and prevents those awful tiny, deep cracks that form on fingers once winter sets in.  It takes a bit of effort to thoroughly apply and rub it in, but it is every bit worth it. Also worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small way I would improve it is either to make a nicer fragrance or just let it be fragrance free.  It doesn&#x27;t have a BAD fragrance, but slightly medicinal.</li>
    <li> excellent for eczema hands and dish pan hands</li>
    <li> Works great for dry skin - I use it at night - skin is soft in the morning - a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> In my personal opinion The Cutemol Cream is worth the money. It saturates your skin and nails really good. This is the second time I have purchased this cream. The size of jar it comes in is a good size and last quite a while. It doesn&#x27;t let your nails dry out and helps them to grow. Personally I like this cream.</li>
    <li> I ordered this ointment after seeing the really low price on Amazon.  Fantastic transaction!  I&#x27;ve used this ointment for years after having it recommended to my by my dermatologist/</li>
    <li> My fingers stay very dry around the nails.  This stuff is smooth, rich and luxurious going on and just feels really good when it is rubbed in. The area is is immediately soft and loses the dry, cracked and flaky look and feels great.  It seems quite expensive but it takes very little to get the desired results.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for very dry cuticles that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Have been using Cutemol specifically to help with dry, peeling nails.  I have seen a significant improvement.</li>
    <li> Good but heavy.  Use only as a moisturizer for my nails &amp; cuticles because it takes to long to be absorbed.  Maybe if you apply before bed...</li>
    <li> best hand cream ever!!!!</li>
    <li> The dermatologist suggested to try this.  It is working very well for my son&#x27;s dry cracked skin problem on his hands/fingertips.  He uses it overnight with gloves on.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry cracked hands.  Really works.  I use it at least once a day, try to use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> By far the best product for my eczema that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It&#x27;s expensive but for me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> not as greasy as I&#x27;d expect for what it does. When first applied, it smears and the &#x27;instant gratification&#x27; part of me said &#x27;uh oh&#x27;. But it blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I&#x27;ll still be on the hunt for that perfect emollient cream; but, til found, I like this and will get regularly.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this. I have had cut, ragged and bloody cuticles since I can remember. Slab on just a dime-size of this at night and you wake up with your cuticles sealed and smooth, healthy hands. Worth the price as the formula is effective and not a lot cream is needed to treat hands.</li>
    <li> Cutemol was recommended several years ago by my dermatologist, and it works very well.  I have very dry skin so I use it on my hands and feet.</li>
    <li> i dont like that it is full of parabens and what not but it really is the only thing that has helped my hands i have contact derm that i have not been able to control since the birth of my child 2 yrs ago with the FREQUENT and washing  this is the ONLY thing that has consistently worked  other creams tend to fail me after a while for some strange reason</li>
    <li> Great for cuticles, hands and any area of dry rough skin. I use it daily and have noticed a remarkable improvement.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from a skin clinic here locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It feels a bit sticky initially, but it does absorb into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it!</li>
    <li> I have a terrible case of peeling nail buds and this product works like a charm. I apply as instructed and the peeling goes away in less than a week.</li>
    <li> Quite a few pharmacists never heard of it - wide selection - excellent packaging</li>
    <li> Very rich cream, am using in conjunction with DermaNail as suggested and seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment much on if it works, because the fragrance was totally overwhelming.  I sent it back to the company and got a refund.</li>
    <li> Price was right; delivered in two days; my wife is delighted!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> i was just to strong for his skin i read so many good reviews before i bought it and no good for my son</li>
    <li> Nice Product. A little goes a long way. This is the second time I have purchased this</li>
    <li> I have dry skin naturally and this cream is the best I&#x27;ve used. I got it as a sample when I ordered dermaNail from the same Summers Laboratories. This cream has a healing component to it and I&#x27;ve used it for scratches and it seams to prevent scarring. It heals cracks and splits on the fingers in days rather than weeks. I even use it on my lips overnight and no longer need to use chapstick type products. After trying the sample, I immediately bought the 8oz container. I can&#x27;t recommend this cream more highly.</li>
    <li> Slather this stuff on at night and your skin will be soft as a baby&#x27;s bum in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;After enduring decades of split fingers, hangnails and rough heels my dermatologist introduced me to Cutemol.&lt;br /&gt;Here are three of my successful strategies:&lt;br /&gt;1. Slather on feet, put on socks and go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;2. Slather on hands (special attention to cracks and cuticles), put on rubber gloves and go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;3. Slather on hands, rinse palms with hot water and then dry them, to remove greasy feeling and get on with your day.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using Eucerin original (which is like library paste and recommended to me by my dermatologist) for many months on this eczema patch on my calf, but it wasn&#x27;t really helping.  Got Cutemol in about 10 days ago and it seems to be drying the eczema right up (by drying up, I mean no longer red/inflamed/itching).  It looks like the spot may heal up in a few weeks, which given the length of time that beast has been on my leg, is a miracle.  The only things I don&#x27;t like about Cutemol are the hospital scent, and the stickiness when used on the hands -- but that is very a minor problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/30/12: The eczema patch, formerly palm-sized, has been reduced to a few pimple-sized dots. This was used in conjunction with the same steroid cream I&#x27;d been using before with the eucerin. For whatever reason it works better for my skin. YMMV.</li>
    <li> I have chronically dry skin due to eczema and have tried tons of dermatologist-recommended moisturizers in the past. Cutemol is the only one I&#x27;ve used that manages to keep my skin moist for more than a couple hours. It also seems to improve the quality of your skin over time, so you will need less and less as you keep using it. It&#x27;s so thick that the only time it&#x27;s really usable is before bedtime. However, your skin will still be moist in the morning and probably throughout the rest of the following day, so it&#x27;s worth it. Quite pricey but worth the money if you&#x27;ve tried everything else like I have.</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick and rich.  My dermatologist had recommended it for my psoriasis, and it does help quite a bit.  I use it between flare-ups and also during flareups with prescribed medication.  The 8 oz size is cost efficeint.</li>
    <li> Was introduced first to this product by a doctor, I have a problem with my skin and this is the best cream I have ever used.  Would not do without it.  The price is also better here on Amazon than any other location that I have found so far.</li>
    <li> fantastic moisturizer for the whole family</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this cream for psoriasis.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores.  Only online and Amazon had the best price for it.  Although it doesn&#x27;t take away the psoriasis it is soothing on the skin and helps on the more than itchy days.</li>
    <li> My hands and elbows get very, very dry, particularly during the winter. This cream is incredibly thick, and a little bit does wonders for healing dry, cracked hands. The bonus for me is that what little scent it has goes away quickly. It can feel a bit greasy for a few minutes, but it&#x27;s a very fleeting feeling. Cutemol is a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth the cost. An 8-ounce tub lasts me a very, very long time. In addition, I apply once in the morning and it lasts through the day for me, which is more than I can say for most other hand creams!</li>
    <li> This was sent as a gift since I have found it to be very helpful.</li>
    <li> It is truly the best cream for my severely dry skin! I have been using it for years and have always had great results.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and this cream has done wonders for my skin.  You don&#x27;t need a lot because the cream is very rich in thickness.&lt;br /&gt;love it!!</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of hand lotions, cuticle creams and oils.  All trying to find one product that I thought worked better for my ragged cuticles and peeling splitting nails than regular lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried everything at the drug store, I&#x27;ve tried Nail Tek, I have even splurged on OPI and to be honest while they aren&#x27;t bad products they didn&#x27;t really do a much better job than the lotion.  They certainly didn&#x27;t do much to improve my nail beds or soothe my cuticles in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutemol is quite comparatively expensive to most of these products at first glance but I finally decided I wanted to try it because it seemed to me that Summers Laboratories knows what they&#x27;re doing and approaches nail and skin care from a very scientific point of view.  If anything could actually help, I thought, it had to be this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a major shortcoming.  I wondered if I should subtract a star but ultimately I decided I still loved it in spite of it&#x27;s issue.  You see the consistency of this cream is almost reminiscent of marshmallow fluff.  It is similarly pretty sticky.  Not quite marshmallow sticky but if you rub this all over your hand then you will not want to touch anything for a little bit.  After about 20 minutes is absorbs almost completely in and leaves nothing but a very soft vaguely waxy feeling which is only annoying near touch screens and then after that fully absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the kind of lotion that is probably best applied before bed and then covered by a glove or fingertip protector so you can go about your business and let it absorb all night.  That might sound a bit overkill but you will be amazed at the difference if you do that.  My whole hand&#x27;s texture has changed.  My hands even look younger!  The skin has a youthful texture and the skin has plumped up giving an almost &amp;#34;hand model&amp;#34; appearance.  I can&#x27;t stop looking at my hands and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has immediate results on your nail beds as well.  It will hydrate your cuticles but it will also absorb into your nail bed and lend it increased flexibility after application.  You won&#x27;t experience even better results than that for 4-8 weeks when your nails have grown out more and you can tell the difference in the newly grown out nail.  My nails used to split and crack as soon as they left the edge of my finger but after regular application of cutemol they are much more resilient and resistant to splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase this with Summers Laboratories Dermanail product as well so I am sure that product has helped as well and I recommend if you are getting this for nail issues to get that product as well.  Both take weeks to work and are comparatively expensive but it is a great deal because you actually get RESULTS.  I have tried everything, rejuvacote, nail envy, every sally hansen thing under the sun, and while some of them are nice products and cheaper than Summers Labs products they do not provide the drastically improved results that these products have given me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutemol and Dermanail are also much larger volumes than you are used to getting with nail products.  This is 8 ounces compared with the normal .5 ounces that most cuticle conditioners come in.  So actually it IS cheaper.  And Cutemol goes a looong way with just a little bit.  Dermanail too is much larger than the nail treatments you&#x27;re used to getting.  It is 1 oz and you only need one drop per nail per treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage you to just stop searching and buy this stuff.  It is on another level.your cuticles but it will also absorb into your nail bed and lend it increased flexibility after application.

    <li> This cream has been our favorite bar far.  Wouldn&#x27;t pick anything different.  Great for dry skin!  Our whole family uses this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for less than a week and I can already tell a difference. Great to use before bed. It is thick and you can tell for awhile after application that you have it on but that is a small price to pay for the improvement in my hands. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> What a blessing!  Although it doesn&#x27;t provide an overnight cure for the extremely annoying skin splits on my fingers, it does provide overnight relief.  My hands are so much softer.  I&#x27;m very grateful for a product that does the healing and softening job so quickly!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using the Cutemol! It Works really well &amp; the price was very affordable. Thank you tons.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It really mosturizes your skin!  I have escema and this is the only lotion that really keeps moisture in my skin.</li>
    <li> My baby has had severe eczema since he was 2 months old. He is definitely growing out of it with every passing month, but unfortunately its an excruciatingly slow process. I&#x27;ve tried everything from slathering him up every few hours with oils/lotions/creams.....and humidifiers....and daily dose of antihistamine, but no matter what, we have to go back to the topical steroids :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This emollient cream has a good thick gummy consistency, not as thick as Aquaphor and not as thin as Cetaphil. It sticks very well on the skin. I do apply a layer of Cetaphil first and then apply this. We do this a couple of times per day and we&#x27;ve managed to stay away from the steroids longer (touch wood).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its only been 2 weeks since my baby started using this and we can see him significantly calmer, less itchy and sleeps better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;Jan 21&#x27; 2013&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;Its been a month of using this product and we are really pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> it works well, the doctor recamended it for my daughter for here skin disorder. she loikes it it seemes to be working</li>
    <li> bit pricey, but best thing i&#x27;ve found for dry cracked hand. use it sparingly daily to prevent dry hands.</li>
    <li> Cutemol is the only hand cream that keeps my fingers from cracking in the winter.  It was recommended by my dermatologist  a couple of years and I am never without it.</li>
    <li> It is very Expensive. It is extremely Messy. It Did not relieve my symptoms. My doctor recommended Cutemol for a mysterious rash which may associated with Celiac Disease.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a dermatologist friend of mine when I complained about dry cuticles and heels.  I apply every night before retiring and again in the morning after showering and love the effects.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have used it for several years.</li>
    <li> work good on dry ichy skin.</li>
    <li> love love love. Need to warm up in hands to distribute easier but still love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a special effects artist got your hands to go back in time.</li>
    <li> This is the richest lanolin cream ever sued.  Cutemol Emollient cCream will soften even the driest skin.  I use this cream several times a day.</li>
    <li> This works really well at relieving dry skin on my hands.  Best of all, it seems to work all day and my hands don&#x27;t hurt from the dryness anymore.</li>
    <li> This product was first given to me by my dermatologist.  It started working on my dry cracked skin as well as some keratosis spots I have.  It has healed my skin and eliminated the raised itchey spots from by back.  It massages right in, is not greasy and is very thick so a small amt goes a long way.  Now even my daughter, who is a nurse, and my husband use it for their dry skin.  The product is worth the cost as it does what it is supposed to do and does not have fragrance that is offensive.  I will order it again and the delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> Solves the toenail and toe cuticle problem as well as being the best ever for problem nails and cuticles.  The best!</li>
    <li> Very good stuff! works perfectly for what my doctor recomended it for... High quality cream! microcrystaline beeswax is the key i think</li>
    <li> Very thick moisturizing cream for dry and peeling cuticles.</li>
    <li> My hands and feet have never been softer. I love how the callus are now gone on my feet and how soft they are now.  I also love the fact that I also have the soft hands in the world now. I would tell and one that is looking for nice soft hand to use this. I would also suggest that people use this that are looking for a simple way to make the feet soft.</li>
    <li> So I have eczema flareups every now and then. Whenever a flareup is in the make, all I need is this stuff to make it go away. It keeps the skin moist for a long time, where other cremes only last an hour or less. It smells a bit and is extremely greasy but if you&#x27;re an eczema sufferer like me, that will be the least of your worries ;)</li>
    <li> Excellent cream!  It is thick going on but after rubbing it in it is amazing how soft your hands and feet feel. Within 3 days your chapped skin in healed.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this cream all the time.  It was reccommended to us by my Dr. and he was right on.  It is an excellant cream, thank you.  The quality, price and delivery of this product was superb.</li>
    <li> Although I am bad at being consistent with the use of this product, my daughter had a friend whose skin was so dry it was bleeding and she let her try some that you sent me in the small tube and she went crazy over it.  It helped her dry skin tremendously .  I would recommend this product for dry skin and if use consistantly I believe it will work for your nails</li>
    <li> I WAS ASKED TO USE THIS BY MY SKIN DOCOTR... AFTER SIX DERMATOLOGISTS THIS IS THE ONLY CREAM THAT WORKS. I HAVE SEVERE DRY SKIN ESPICALLY IN THE WINTER. MY HANDS WOULD THROB. AND MY SKIN AROUND FINGERS WOULD PEEL FROM DRYNESS. NOT WITH THIS. AND IT IS MUCH CHEAPER AT AMAZON..AND BELIEVE ME I TRIED EVERY CREAM U COULD THINK OF</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders on my husband&#x27;s hands. He has eczema that makes his skin split really badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He used this cream on his hands overnight with socks over them because the cream is so thick. He did say it felt gross on his hands because it was so thick, but he dealt with it because his hands improved considerably.</li>
    <li> Much more cost effective to by the lotion is volume rather than is a tube.  Have used the tube for winter 2014-2015 and it does a good job of keeping hands moist and preventing skin cracks around finger nails.</li>
    <li> Works awesome on my severely dry skin! Moisturizes completely and stays moist for 24 hours! Very thick and the best part has no scent!</li>
    <li> Best cream ever for extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> a great product for combatting skin irritation.</li>
    <li> absolutely wonderful, did everything it said it would do for cracked finger tips, healed them.</li>
    <li> Of all the lotions I have tried for my dry hands this is BY FAR the best. Since this is not exactly cheap, I use other lotions to supplement, but if nothing helps, this will! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I ordered this expensive tub in another attempt to help my eczema on the palm of my hand. It is very thick. If I didn&#x27;t know any better I would definitely use it. But I was so bummed to see all the preservatives &amp; parabens in it. These are dangerous! If you&#x27;re looking for help for eczema, the only thing I have found that is ahhhmazing is Cortizone Eczema Cream....&amp; I have tried almost everything.</li>
    <li> The only cream that heals my severely dry/cracked fingers in the winter.  I apply before bed and before I leave for work in the morning, running any residual cream through my dry hair.  Works like a charm and my hands are pain-free from deep cracks!</li>
    <li> This does wonders for your skin especially in the winter&lt;br /&gt;Every one should go out and get this product for their family</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for dry skin. Thick and long lasting. Noticeable difference after use! Find it best for legs and feet. Don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin and a wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good but not great...very heavy and very greasy, but then after about 15 minutes it soaks into the skin. it has improved my dry skin on my legs a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing a dermatologist for my chronic eczema on my hand.  She recommended using Cutemol daily to help moisturize my hand.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of creams on the eczema and this one gives me the best results.  Non-greasy, goes on thick, doesn&#x27;t burn or sting like some of the others.</li>
