<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it!!  Just what I needed!!</li>
    <li> Not very sharp.  Doesn&#x27;t cut the pill, more like crushes it into two pieces.  It would be better IMO if the plastic cutter was actually a razor blade.  I&#x27;m using on unscored pills, so it may be easier for some.</li>
    <li> This is unusual for me......I really like most of the products I buy...I was disappointed ...I have a variety of sizes of pills...it just didn&#x27;t do the job.......sorry.</li>
    <li> could not find the larger pill cutter in our area but did here, it does cut even the larger pills.</li>
    <li> Wish the blade was metal.  It cuts but could be better.</li>
    <li> Has a places to hold the tablet which is great but the blade is hard plastic which can crush the pill in stead of cutting. It does work great back up as no really sharp razor blade is used</li>
    <li> works well,seems like it will last.Rubber base is good idea.</li>
    <li> There is no blade to cut the pill!  Unbelievable.  You just crush the pill by putting a lot of pressure on splitter device.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a great idea, sleek design and user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;safe and effective&lt;br /&gt;plastic poly blade&lt;br /&gt;Easy on hands/wrists&lt;br /&gt;An easy (and safe) way to halve pills</li>
    <li> My pharmacy sent my 400-mg, twice a day dose in a single 800-mg tablet. All 180 days&#x27; worth of it. I figured the easiest solution would be to get a pill splitter.  Some of the devices sold here had comments that they didn&#x27;t line up oval or oblong tablets very well. Mine were, so I focused on one that would easily cut oval tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sabi Chop seems to do that, but the limited number of reviews concerned me, and the fact that the actual \\&quot;blade\\&quot; was plastic and not metal. Then I figured that $10 was a small price to pay if it didn&#x27;t work, and I could always return it - or just toss it. At the very least I&#x27;d be able to weigh in on one side of the issue or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived today and the very first thing I did was to test it. I split three tablets. None broke, all split more or less in the center and the cutting action is very easy. I chose to press down on the lid with the palm of my hand, with the Sabi Chop on the kitchen counter top. A loud crack indicated each successful operation - so loud I was worried, but the tablets  were neatly split.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to position the tabled so that the middle was approximately under the blade - there is no mechanical adjustment or alignment - but I figure the unevenness will balance out over the morning and evening dosage, right? :) Not that I&#x27;m off by much, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place to position the tablet is a soft, grey \\&quot;rubber\\&quot; or plastic bed with an indentation. It is oblong or oval in shape and works well for my tablets. If you have round tablets, then if they are larger than about 15mm in diameter, they will not fit in the position under the cutting edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for the blade, if one can call it that. It seems of a good quality and it is shaped in an edge, but not an overly sharp edge. It looks like a blade, just a little blunter, but still perfectly able to cut my 800mg tablets with ease and without crushing the tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am quite happy with this andcertain it will do the job I bought it for. As for longevity, I will be sure to post back in this review if and when something goes awry. Until then, assume it is working and doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 6 month later and I can report that this little device still faithfully splits my tablets. If I run my fingers over the cutting \\&quot;blade\\&quot; I can feel a very slight deformity in the plastic, but it isn&#x27;t visible if I look at it - not even if I look very closely. And there has been no reduction in it&#x27;s capability to split pills.</li>
    <li> Nice price for such a small product. It cuts all my pills without them flying over the kitchen floor and keeps them secure after they are cut. I tried other products and they&#x27;re just as safe...especially when using a blade... Good product.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star review 2 days ago. Today, the cutter broke! ... cutting the same magnesium pill I&#x27;ve been using all along.  WTH? Seriously, the plastic is that cheap that I only got about 30 uses out of it? That&#x27;s ridiculous! Too late to send it back now. Annoyed!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1557NS2NKII5U]]Susie explains why she loves the Sabi Chop &amp; demonstrates how easy it is to use</li>
    <li> I used the Sabi Chop Cut-and-Take pill splitter for my oblong shaped pill, and it worked great.  I did not have any trouble with the plastic blade like I thought I would have, and the grey plastic part held my pill firmly in place.  I was able to split a 1000mg pill in half using only two fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that being said, I could see where some would have issues with it.  The Sabi Chop Cut-and-Take pill splitter would not work well for circle shaped or soft pills.  I didn&#x27;t have any like that so I couldn&#x27;t test that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> This works well, but better on longer pills.I received this for review.  I tried both long and round pills in this the longer ones did better then the round ones.  It cut the round ones but they were not in equal parts. I like it for the long pills and I will cotinue to use this for them.  It is great for my daughter who can&#x27;t take large pills so it works great for that.  If you can not take large pills then this will work for you.</li>
    <li> Works well on the oversized pills that are impossible to swallow</li>
    <li> No matter the pill or the reason that you need to split your pill, Sabi Chop Cut-and-Take Pill Splitter is perfect for you! It&#x27;s a small, compact container that you can throw in your medicine bag for travel or hide in your cabinet if you&#x27;re at home. Any oval pill fits perfectly into the gray area with lines marked so you can evenly cut it in half. You flip it closed and easily press, not much force is needed. Ta-da! Evenly cut pill, perfect for whatever the reason you need to split your pill. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Do you frequently take pills that start as the wrong dosage and you have to split to take half? With dog meds, it happens more than you can imagine, as pill sizes are setup for human dosages not that of pets. Higher dosage pills may often be cheaper, if you don&#x27;t mind splitting them yourself. Or perhaps it is just easier for you to swallow a smaller pill. Using a knife to split the pills isn&#x27;t always the safest option. I recently had the opportunity to try out the Sabi Chop Cut-and-Take Pill Splitter for just such a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage is fairly simple. You just place the pill in the soft plastic, grooved location, and close the cover. You then press hard on the top and the pill splits. That is all there is to it. There is no sharp blade involved here, just hard plastic that is safe to the touch. You do have to press hard to get the pill to split, but it is just pressure that you must apply to the top. Since you don&#x27;t have to try to hold the pill in place so you can cut with a knife, it is actually pretty safe and easy, but it is a hard press before the pill eventually splits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pill splitter works best with oblong pills as the grooved plastic is shaped that way. However, it works fairly well for round pills, too, at least for half dosages. If you have trouble getting the pill to split in the right location to get half dosage, close the top of the unit part of the way and then line up the pill. This will assure proper sizing. Getting a quarter dosage will be more difficult as it requires two splits, but you&#x27;ll run into the same issues using a knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic poly blade has both its pros and cons. You can safely clean the unit in water without risk of a steel blade rusting. It won&#x27;t wear down easily either. However, it clearly isn&#x27;t a blade, so you must press hard for the pill to split. This might be more difficult for the older crowd with less arm strength. But placing the unit on a hard surface like a table when you split the pill helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.</li>
    <li> It works well but is cheaply made. After just a week or two, I dropped it on the carpet and the hinge broke.</li>
    <li> Pill choppers I have used in the past made it really hard for me to get a pill cut perfectly in half. Every time I tried the pill would slide around. This pill chopper has a little compartment that made where the pill wouldn&#x27;t slide around. Assuring me that I would get exactly half of my pill. It also has a wall built around the chopper part making sure that none of the pills would slide off and get lost. Which is great for me, because I am sure one of my little ones would find it and that wouldn&#x27;t be good. So not only is this perfect for making my life a little easier it also helps me keep my children a little safer.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I have always had a hard time swallowing pills. I never even thought to use a pill cutter until I came across the CHOP pill cutter. The simplicity of the design is perfect. It is nice and compact. This makes it easy to take with you and have it be concealed. One also doesn&#x27;t have to press hard when trying to break the pill in half. Just a little pressure and you have a perfectly cut pill. I can tell you that I will be using this cutter from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I&lt;br /&gt;have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> I need to split oblong pills, which is what this is designed to do. It&#x27;s pretty easy to position the pill and then close the lid without disturbing the pill&#x27;s placement. I&#x27;d have given this five stars if it had a sharp metal blade, but it has a plastic edge. My small pills don&#x27;t split as cleanly with the thicker plastic, and a little bit of each pill turns to powder. It&#x27;s not a huge deal (I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I find an oblong pill cutter with a metal blade), but I&#x27;d rather take all of my pills instead of most of them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I take quite a bit of medications and I really needed a pill splitter! Then on top of that, Charlie, our Yorkie takes a few pills, mostly the Heartworm one, and he won&#x27;t take it because it&#x27;s huge, so I have to cut his pill, too! So, we really needed an extra one so we wouldn&#x27;t contaminate each other&#x27;s pills and now I have one! The old one is for Charlie now and this new one from Sabi is ours. It&#x27;s a really neat Pill Splitter and very easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use. And Sabi made it so easy because it has the impression of the pill right there in gray and all you do is put the pill down inside that indention and then close the lid! Presto, the pill is cut in two!  Do not use on capsules. These are for tablets, pills and vitamins only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This awesome pill splitter can split all pills of any shape or size, cleanly, accurately, and easily. It employs a non-steel/non-razor durable plastic poly blade so it’s safe and won’t easily wear down. And you don’t have to worry about it rusting if it gets wet so it’s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s also great for those pills that you don&#x27;t really need the full dosage that you had to get, like for example, on some of my muscle relaxers or pain medication, if I don&#x27;t want to take the full dosage, I will cut them in half to either make them last longer or I didn&#x27;t want to get too groggy. So, it works for the pills that are too big to swallow whole but also if you need to cut your dosage in half. Just remember it doesn&#x27;t work on capsules. It has to be a hard tablet form.</li>
    <li> One of my daily medications needs to be cut in half. I have always broken it in two with my fingers along the little score in the pill. I often get two different sizes and sometimes they crumble. The CHOP minimal effort pill cutter by Sabi has changed that for me. I use it about once a week and cut the pills that I need. No more mess. Well worth it for anyone who has pills that need to be cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Not sharp enough to cut many types of pille.</li>
    <li> When I was asked to try out the Sabi CHOP Minimal Effort Pill Cutter, I was skeptical! In the photo it looked like a hard plastic unit with a dull hard plastic cutting device. It appeared to be something that wouldn&#x27;t deliver the blow without hurting my hand and crushing the pill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the unit arrived, I quickly found out I was wrong. It is smaller than your powder compact and feels great in your hand. It delivers a precise cute to your pill while keeping it contained! No more of the pain in the hand moments and hunting for the pills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pill cutter is perfect for the elders in your life or anyone that is weak yet needs to split medication for lower dosage or to make swallowing easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

The opinions I&lt;br /&gt;have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the chance to try the Chop Minimal effort pill cutter. I am a man, so I found the largest pill I could find to try out this product. It took little effort to chop the pill in half, which surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different people split pills for different reasons: some pills, especially daily vitamin supplements, are so large that they can be difficult to swallow whole. Oftentimes, pills come in only one high dosage version and you need to halve or quarter them to get a lower dose. Others split pills because it’s more cost effective, since higher-dosage pills frequently cost the same as lower-dosage ones.&lt;br /&gt;No matter the reason, if you split pills regularly you have likely encountered many pill splitter pitfalls. When we began to investigate the task of splitting pills we quickly realized that this seemingly trivial task is actually riddled with problem.&lt;br /&gt;We wanted to create a superior pill splitter. We designed a pill splitter that can split all pills of any shape or size, cleanly, accurately, and easily. It employs a non-steel/non-razor durable plastic poly blade so it’s safe and won’t easily wear down. And you don’t have to worry about it rusting if it gets wet so it’s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;We made it adjustable to all pill types, easy to hold and press, and at the same time fun to use and beautiful to look at. We hope that when you use CHOP, you’ll get into the ritual of snapping your pills to size and use the moment to stop, breathe, and think on the importance of your health and the time you invest in ensuring your healthcare is accurate, non-wasteful and… just plain fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife takes high blood pressure medicine. She only needs half a pill and was havingtrouble cutting the pills. This pill cutter, cuts her pills easily. I believe the cutter can be used by anybody easily. The CHOP minimal pill cutter can also be bought at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Basically worthless.  It crushes or shatters most pills.  The cutting blade is made of plastic that is not sharp enough to cut pills.  I suggest buying any pill cutter except for this one.</li>
    <li> I thought the plastic cutter wouldn&#x27;t last too long, but I cut 2 or three pills a day and it seems to hold up well.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right but it basically shattered every pill I tried to split. Not useable at all. Back to fingernails for me.</li>
    <li> Compact and easy to use. gives a clean cut without crushing the pill to powder. can be used on any shape or size pill. overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> it broke the second time I used.  What a waste of money</li>
    <li> Plastic cutter doesn&#x27;t work and just crushes the pill rather than cutting it.  Would have been better off purchasing a less expensive basic pill slitter!</li>
    <li> If your in need of a good pill cutter you need to try out the CHOP by Sabi. I only recommend cutting longer more oblong pills, cutting round pills will only create a mess. The cutter works great at creating an even cut every time and the rubber inside is great at keeping the pill in place while cutting it. The small size is great to take in a purse or bag while traveling and the plastic is sturdy. It was very easy to use and didn&#x27;t require much effort at all. Please remember this works better with longer oblong pills.&lt;br /&gt;You can check out my full review here &gt;&gt; [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Small, easy to use and effective.  I love how easy it is to clean and store.  No steel blades or razors makes it safe for everyone.

    <li> You may think that due to there being no actual blade it would be hard to cut the pills, but I assure you it is easy. You just need to make sure you have it flat on a firm surface and using the palm of your hand just press down. I found that it only took about the same amount of pressure as the ones with blades do. I have week hands and wrists and found no problem working this cutter. With this cutter being completely plastic, you can easily wash it if needed and not a worry about a blade becoming rusty. There is a slight unclean cut effect (crumbs of pill) but I also get that with my cutter that does have a blade. I take a bunch of vitamins and they are pretty big and thick. It just makes it easier to take so many if I do not have to swallow the complete pills whole. This pill cutter had no problems cutting right through them with only a little pressure. With this cutter I also get a more even split in the actual pill due to the rubber insert keeps the pill from sliding around like with other cutters. The back hinge is well built and seems like it would last a long time. I did notice one thing that you have to be careful of, if your pill has one of those protective coatings on it, the cut may be a tad off. My suggestion after cutting a few of these is to just press down on the cutter firmly but a bit slower than normal and you will get a more even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my complete review please go to - [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.

    <li> It would be better if the cutter was metal instead of plastic. This was the biggest downfall of this product</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t know about any of my readers but I unfortunately have suffered from severe migraines all of my life and because of that I have probably been taking pills for the majority of my life or at least my mom and grandmother had to nearly break an arm attempting to break a pill in half and then crushing it to add it to some orang juice or water to give me when I was younger. Can you imagine how I felt when I saw that Sabi has a pill chopper that doesn&#x27;t take too much out of you to chop a pill in half. Not to mention that I still have to take some horse shape pills for my migraines along with melt on your tongue ones depending on the severity of the pain. This Sabi product is the business. You simply place the pill inside, press down and BOOM your done! Trust me I just placed an order for my mother, granny and aunts.  Did I mention that I had fun while doing it? Yep I did!

    <li> I got this because I take a very large pill that doesn&#x27;t fit into a normal pill cutter.  The &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; on this is plastic and not only did it bend on the very first pill I put in there, the pill remained un-split.  If I used all my force I could break the pill but it wasn&#x27;t split evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all a garbage product due to the non-existent blade.</li>
    <li> Does not work well on the oval pill I bought it for.  Very disappointed.  There is no razor to cut the pill but a fairly wide plastic piece that ends up crushing the pill I bought it to cut.</li>
    <li> Depending on how dense the pill is, some pills are partially crushed.  This is primarily due to the fact that there is no blade, just a piece of plastic to do the cutting.  This lack of sharpness can be an issue.</li>
    <li> pill cutter? More like pill crusher.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this because Sabi makes such great products and I loved how compact this is, but it isn&#x27;t the best at cutting pills. I thought the plastic &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; would be good too because I could fly with this in my carry-on with no hassle, but because the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; is plastic it means it doesn&#x27;t make the smoothest cut. This does cut pills, but it tends to squish the pill causing a lot of the pill to be reduced to powder. I won&#x27;t say that it is awful because it does do the job of cutting a pill, it just does it in a messy way. I still use this when I need fast, compact, easy solution, but it isn&#x27;t my go-to splitter because it is messy.</li>
    <li> I got one of these to review. It works well for larger, oval pills. If you need to cut smaller, or round pills, I&#x27;d look into getting a different cutter. I do love the no slip base. Everything on this is BPA free. I also like that it&#x27;s impossible to cut yourself. There is no metal blade, making it safer than a lot of other pill cutters on the market.</li>
    <li> Sabi has introduced a great product to help you split pills without having to break them with your fingers and ensuring that you cut them how you need them cut. Not only that but they also have a great Easy Pill Traveler to keep with you while you’re on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabi Pill Splitter is a small, (1.2 oz in weight) that cleanly splits your pills and vitamins and it BPA free. There is absolutely no mess once the pills are split and it’s hand washable! It has a non-steel/non-razor durable plastic poly blade so it’s safe and won’t easily wear down. I love it because if my daughter ever got a hold of it, there’s no worries of her slicing her little fingers! It’s very easy to do the plitting, too! Just place the pill in the middle, push the lid down and press with the palm of your hand. Once you’re done just pop it open and it’s done.</li>
    <li> It split my large vitamin pill in half just fine. I&#x27;m not sure if it would be good for round smaller pills though, because I didn&#x27;t have any to try it out on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> We had a supply of pills and the dosage was recently cut in half. It seems so wasteful to toss the pills with the higher dosage.  This Sabi product is well made, sturdy and worked really well.  It really did require just &amp;#34;Minimal Effort!&amp;#34;  I loves the fact that the Pill Cutter is adjustable to accommodate all pill types&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.

It cut my mother in laws up with little crushing.

    <li> This pill splitter is really lovely. The pill is completely enclosed so they can’t go flying off into space and each half is captured inside its own little compartment. And complete containment also means that pill splitting does not require feats of strength worthy of Hercules to work. The Sabi pill splitter’s  unique “chop cap” distributes pressure evenly over the cap’s wide surface. Press the lid with your palm and voil&amp;agrave; - halfsies. Meanwhile, the “blade” is made of a durable plastic poly making it much safer than metal splitters and won’t rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Let&#x27;s just say my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t have to use a knife any longer. He is quite thrilled with how easy and convenient the chop cut and take pill spliter is. He has one pill that he cuts in half a few days a week and all he does is place it in the compartment, close it, and it&#x27;s split in half! It&#x27;s also easy to take around. Just like the description says, it works better on larger/longer pills. We tried it on a smaller one to see what happens, that it&#x27;s not that good. Safe and effective and stylish as well. It&#x27;s also affordable.</li>
    <li> I really like this pill cutter, it is much nicer than the generic one i was using previously. I will advise though, this cutter will NOT half a round pill exactly. It is made to use with oblong pills. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone who has arthritis, as it takes some force to split the pill.</li>
    <li> With cutting pills in half this works well and effortlessly. This is also small enough to carry in a purse or any carry on bag when you travel to any where and need to take your pills.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a guy who has a need to split pills every day.  He was tired of doing it with a knife and cutting board.  He was excited to try this, but after ruining 3 pills decided it wasn&#x27;t for him.  I contacted Sabi about it, and basically found that if the pills do not already have a pre-indentation in them, this will only turn your pills into powder.  If the pills do have an indentation for splitting, this works great as it keeps the pills from catapulting everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read my full review here:  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Weather you split pills that are just too big to swallow or because of dosage the CHOP works fast and perfect every single time!! My husband has to split pills every single day and the Sabi is a perfect tool for him. We&#x27;ve tried different pill splitters, the last one we used splintered the pills, it was horrible! When we tried to split the tiny pills, it didn’t split them, it literally crushed them to powder. That was frustrating to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CHOP is designed to split all pills, it doesn’t make any difference the size or shape. We found that to be very true!!  The CHOP uses a non steel and non razor, but very strong plastic poly blade! It’s super easy to clean, just wipe off with a rag. The CHOP will last for years!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place your pill in the pill shape cut out, it’ truly works for all shapes too! Close the top of the CHOP and press down and you’re done!! Couldn’t be easier and couldn’t be more of a clean break&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> This product is simple and easy to use. Contrary to other reviews, I had no problems using it on a 500 mg Tylenol. It took hardly no force to press down, keeps the pill in place as you&#x27;re pressing down, and it doesn&#x27;t fly everywhere once it&#x27;s broken. It gives a nice clean cut so you don&#x27;t have to worry about jagged edges like when you try to break a pill in half by hand. It&#x27;s small so you can take it with you on the go if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in return for an honest review. Regardless, all opinions ARE MY OWN.</li>
    <li> No need to be a body builder to use this pill cutter!  Easy to use and durable.  Cleans well.  Splits pills accurately!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this on the oblong pills and it worked great. The gray rubber in the middle helped a lot in securing the pill inside for a clean cut. There are no metal parts so I don&#x27;t have to worry about rusting. It&#x27;s also very easy to use and I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of force to cut the pill in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> What does \\&quot;Chat With Vera\\&quot; think of the CHOP pill cutter?&lt;br /&gt;Well, first of all, I must emphatically state that you should ONLY cut your pills when authorized by your prescribing doctor to do so. Some pills should be taken WHOLE and never cut. Some folks in order to economize or make their prescription medicines last longer, cut pills. This should NEVER be done unless your doctor says it is o.k. to do so. Now, what do I think about this particular CHOP pill cutter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice, neat product. The lid is concave and fits the heel of your hand/palm nicely so that pressure applied to the CHOP doesn&#x27;t hurt your hand or fingers. This is a plus when arthritic hands are applying pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts large pills or small pills - elongated, oval, square, round. The \\&quot;floor\\&quot; where the pill is seated awaiting being chopped (don&#x27;t you like my hint of whit?), is designed to help position and hold the pill before lowering the top to cut the pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really need to visit the Sabi website and see the nice products they have, to learn about the Sabi company. Read a little about them.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you look at this product and others made by Sabi, don&#x27;t just brush them off. Think about someone in your life that would benefit from ANY of these fabulous products. Who do you know that would benefit from using a CHOP or other Sabi product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> It tells you up front that it works best with oblong pills.  And it does.  It still cut my round pills, I just had to make sure to clean the plastic blade after each pill.  I was please with the results and the up front admissions by Sabi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Everything on the Sabi Chop Cut-and-Take Pill Splitter is plastic, so although it can cut pills effectively, it doesn&#x27;t have sharp edges, which is a huge advantage when you have young children. I know that may be a turnoff for some, but that&#x27;s an important feature for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate anti-slip rubber base. With this pill cutter you can really &amp;#34;put your weight into it&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t have to rely on your hands alone. Because it is a nice wide area, you can use the palm of your hand rather than your fingers and push down with the weight of your arm. This is much more effective and easier on both mine and my husband&#x27;s hands than the cutter we had been using which requires you use your fingers and hands alone. He has chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy and has pills he has to cut, but it was hard for him because of the pain in his hands. I have Fibromyalgia, so I also have pain with my hands, and it was hard for me as well. Since we don&#x27;t have to use our hands alone, this is a much better solution for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does mention that it works best with larger oblong pills. Unfortunately, his pills are round, so I don&#x27;t have experience with the oblong shape, but based on the design I do believe that would be even easier, though we found the large round pills to still be fairly easy to cut - particularly if we compare it to what we had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Prior to using the CHOP, I was using a kitchen knife to split pills.  That method was not safe at all or easy to do.  I like the CHOP has a great no skid surface.  In terms of pressure, of course you have to press down on it good.  Obviously the bigger the pill, the more force you will have to use.  I do like the blade is plastic and not metal as a I have two small children and carry this around in purse.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about them cutting themselves on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some pills, horse-pills I like to call them, are so huge I have no idea how any normal human could possibly swallow them. Times like that call for a serious pill chopper. I’ve tried several that had sharp metal blades and they just frightened me. Catching a finger in one of those would be no joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike those dangerous pill cutters, the CHOP Minimal effort pill cutter has a non-steel/non-razor durable plastic poly blade so it’s safe and won’t easily wear down. It can split any pill regardless of the shape or size and it splits them cleanly, accurately, and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s great that the pill cutter is adjustable to all pill types. It’s also so easy to hold and press that I was able to cut pills with just one finger.</li>
    <li> Unless your pill that you are splitting is oblong and made really solid, good luck.  All this thing does is \\&quot;crush\\&quot; the pill more than anything.  I take about 10 different meds and I tried with each pill, same thing on all but 2.  It splits it, but it crumbles and is messy.  You are better off with a steak knife</li>
    <li> I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I was sent a Sabi CHOP minimal effort pill cutter to review. This is a model that I had never seen before, nor had I ever used in my work setting. Its blade is made of a durable plastic poly blade, which is different than most metal bladed models that I have seen. The base of the cutter is made of rubber, to ensure it does not slip during use. The rubber inset inside the pill cutter helps to stabilize the tablet. One simply closes the lid, and presses the lid down lightly to cut the pill in half. This model is very easy to use, and the lack of metal blades makes it safe to have around a home with children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this pill cutter. It was definitely easy to use, and required little effort. The only difficulty I had with this unit is that it did not split pills as well if the tablets had a coating on the exterior. In that situation, the plastic poly blade was not sharp enough to split the pill evenly. For use on uncoated tablets, the CHOP pill cutter worked very well.</li>
    <li> An attractive looking item.  I really wanted this to work.  I first saw this item on fab.com and purchased it because I wanted a pill cutter that did not look like something my grandmother would use.  Cute design, but it needs a real metal blade on the cutter.  This pill cutter does the same as if you got a plastic ruler and used the plastic ruler to try to cut your pill in half.  Greatly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received the Sabi Chop Cut and Take pill splitter for review. Sometimes I need to split my pills in half when the Dr. cuts down my dosage. I used to use a knife to cut them in half, but it&#x27;s so messy and they are never evenly split. Plus my mom hates to take her pills when they are big, so this helps her to take it much more easily. I use this all time and would never go back to using to a knife.</li>
    <li> I recieved this item for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the DayBox pill box, I also received the pill cutter from Sabi. I personally really like the pill cutter. I use it to cut my benadryl pills in half. This works very well, and the good thing is that when you are cutting the pill, it doesn&#x27;t fly out because the container is closed.</li>
    <li> CHOP is an easy pill cutter utilized to remedy the complicated situation of being able to take pills with minimal effort.  we used CHOP to split our son&#x27;s chewable vitamins in half.  The precision of the pills may vary according to the size, shape and texture of the actual pill.  The functionality of CHOP comes from the rustproof, non-steel plastic blade that delivers a safe, clean cut without a wearing down or dulling of the unique non-razor blade. A very useful product for our family.  I received the CHOP mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. - See more at: [...]</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re pill(s) fits precisely within the indented area, you&#x27;re in big trouble. I&#x27;m attempting to cut round pills in half. Being generous, the result is a relatively even split 20% of the time. Otherwise, the cut is angled and much closer to 1/3-2/3. Far from an even split. Intensely frustrating.</li>
    <li> Needless to say, only a minimal amount of force caused this thing to break.  It worked only long enough to divide up about 50 calcium pills, before the hinge snapped off.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect little device that cuts any pill. It&#x27;s super strong, durable, and beats any other pill splitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I&lt;br /&gt;have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> The only pills I divide are oblong but I tried it on a few round pills and as other reviewers mentioned, the smaller round pills are not even or semi-crushed during the dividing process. However, it does a decent job on the oblong pills but it won&#x27;t be replacing my pill cutter with a metal blade. It is nicer for traveling as it&#x27;s lighter and contains no sharp blade to worry about dulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> This pill cutter works great! It lines up with any pill perfectly to cut it in half evenly and you don&#x27;t have to slam it down hard like other pill cutters. It cuts easily. I use it every night wih my medications.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the pill cutter. I have 3 kids and I know that if they use this then no one will lose their fingers because of the cutter being plastic.</li>
    <li> I received the CHOP Minimal Effort Pill Cutter to review!  For my husband’s medications I have actually used a knife and that is not an easy way to cut pills in half.  I’ve used a pill cutter before, but it was mainly for round pills and this pill cutter is for any shape or size, which is awesome!  It’s so easy to use and it cuts the pill accurately!  This pill cutter is superior to any other pill cutters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s made of non-steel/non-razor durable plastic poly blade, so it’s safe and won’t easily wear down.  The best part of all is that you don’t have to worry about it rusting if it gets wet, so it’s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Perfect finally a splitter that my oversized B vitamin will fit in.</li>
    <li> This pill cutter has a plastic \\&quot;blade\\&quot; which does not cut pills cleanly. The result is pills that seem more shattered rather than cleanly cut. I would not recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks great and seems like it would travel well, but the functionality just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product mostly because of it&#x27;s design. When I got it and used the actual product, my concerns grew for long term use. The middle divider that cuts/splits the pill is made of plastic, and as I was cutting my calcium pills with it I became worried that what if over several months or even after a year the plastic will be  worn out or damaged. But for the moment it works well and I love it!</li>
    <li> The plastic blade on this thing is not even sharp.  I know plastic will never be sharp like a real blade but it was just dull.  This thing just crush off chunks on my pills.  It did not need to be exact for my purpose but this was useless.  I returned the item because such a dull plastic blade had to be a defect.</li>
    <li> The Product is perfect! Very Good quality</li>
    <li> CLEARLY THE FIVE STAR REVIEWS ON ONLY SABI ITEMS ARE \\&quot;done by Sabi\\&quot; themselves and FULL OF IT.  The rubber base is a great controlling surface and the deep recess volume of the lid allows for some whipper sized caps to get whopped but the plastic blade offers nothing in terms of sword strength so you have to be Samson to exert enough force to get the divider (have nerve even calling it a blader) to guillotine your pill.  If you can do it you do get a clean break and since the rubber really adheres you can very precisely make the placement allowing for dang accurate proportioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely can&#x27;t easily do bigger than a 350mg med, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be Fair do read the response from the manufacturer in the \\&quot;comments\\&quot; below.  The videos the CEO made available definitely are worth reviewing before you use the product the first time.  Smacking the blue is indeed as much a stress reliever as popping bubble wrap.  I&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Tried a few different pill splitters but this one worked the best, so bought additional ones for others to use to make pill splitting easier.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the safety blade on this pill cutter, it divides pills cleanly and easily while ensuring safe usage for those with impaired vision or dexterity.  It&#x27;s also small, discreet, &amp; sturdy, making it perfect for throwing in your bag.</li>
    <li> At first i was a bit concerned about the blade not being metal or sharp enough to do the job...but now that i have tried it several times i find that it really does do a great job at cutting pills in half. I have nothing bad to say about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I have a few medications that I am supposed to only take half of one a day. It&#x27;s so hard to cut pills, so I was excited to use the CHOP Pill Splitter. If you make sure to put it on a hard surface and place the pill carefully so the groove is exactly where you want to split the pill, and then close it hard with the palm of your hand...then you should be able to split your pill accurately and cleanly. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far, but I have only tried long oval pills like the one shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> No matter what the reason is, splitting pills is never a fun job.  If you do it with a knife, you will either split the pill unevenly or it will break apart.  This seems like an easy task that is performed regularly, but it is not as easy as one might think.  I have had the experience, and we have a very cheap pill splitter that is not always reliable.&lt;br /&gt;I got to review a pill splitter that can split all pills of any shape or size, cleanly, accurately, and easily. It employs a non-steel/non-razor durable plastic poly blade, so it’s safe and won’t easily wear down. And you don’t have to worry about it rusting if it gets wet so it’s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;This particular pill splitter is adjustable to all pill types, easy to hold and press, and it is even fun to use while looking attractive.  It is hoped that when you use CHOP, you’ll get into the ritual of snapping your pills to size.  As you use it, take the moment to stop, breathe, and think on the importance of your health.  Also, know that you will avoid the pill splitting pitfalls!&lt;br /&gt;My mom and I were so happy with this pill splitter.  It promised what was delivered, and I highly recommend it.  If you are looking for a product that easily splits pills and is well-made, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This item worked quite well on some of my pills while on my other ones not so well. I had a hard time getting the cutter to cooperate with me and cut in the center I was able to do about a 75% cut which in my case not so good due to the fact that I was supposed to take 400 mg instead of the full 800mg pills I got from the store. I did however find that the more square a pill the easier to cut it was.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Cutting pills in half can be a challenging experience. I have used knives (that shot the pills across the counter), I have tried pill cutters (that shoot the pills on the floor) and I have tried even biting them in half (which I wouldn&#x27;t try again). Using the Sabi Split Easy Pill Cutter was so easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pill fit perfectly in the slip-preventing rubber base, and the super-durable plastic blade snapped it right in half. It is so easy to wash and is completely kid-safe (not that I would keep it down where they could play with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple and easy to use. I like that the lid closes down tightly so that the pill stays completely inside the box when it is cut.&lt;br /&gt;Pushing down on the cap with the palm of my hand was super simple too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on Sabi website to check on other great products and even watched the little YouTube video of how to use the pill cutter. The Sabi Split Easy Pill Cutter is another product that I surely will get my use out of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> This does not cut, it crushes.  Could not use the crushed pill.  No way to know how much of it you&#x27;re using.  This does  of  it pills.  It crushes them.</li>
    <li> I really like the CHOP Minimal Effort Pill Cutter by Sabi. I would definitely recommend buying the CHOP Minimal Effort Pill Cutter. It was very easy to use. It did a great job cutting the pills I placed in CHOP to cut. The benefit that it does not use a dangerous razor is a big plus if you have children in the house that might be able to get there hands on the pill cutter. I give this product a 5 start review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> When I received the Sabi Chop Cut-and-Take Pill Splitter I wondered how well it would work.  It is a plastic circular contraption about two inches in diameter.  I wondered how well plastic could chop a pill.  The instructions read to place it on a flat surface and use your palm to press down on the top.  Sounds simple enough. Well, when I applied to review this my mother was alive and was taking a number of medications.  I thought this would be useful to have around.  Although I am strong enough to use this, she would not have been.  So if you are thinking of buying this for someone who is weak due to illness, you may be the one who has to use this for them and chop their pills for them.  Additionally, it works very will with the type of pill it is intended for -- a long, oblong pill.  You have to very carefully place it in the cutter or you won&#x27;t get a 50% cut on it, but it works very well for these.  If you are planning on using a round, small, or other shaped pill, you will not want to use this cutter as all it creates is a mess.  (Again this is not the type of pill it is intended for use cutting.)  However, I know for myself, do I really need an extra pill cutter around?  This isn&#x27;t a common sized pill for myself (and like I said, my mother passed between the time I applied to review this and the time the item arrived for review.)  Even with her pills, I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this as it only cuts one type of pill and has to be pressed so firmly with the palm of the hand.  But if you have difficulty cutting long large oblong pills, this is the pill cutter for you if you have the strength.  It appears the company is responding to every low rating, and I assure them I followed instructions and used the palm of my hand, and the strength needed seemed excessive for a pill cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> This was a great little chopper for those huge pills that the doctors love to give us. It chops right through them like they were butter. The only thing with this though is if you are chopping smaller pills you have to be very very careful because it can crush them instead of cutting them, which of course is bad. This is made more for the oblong pills and not really the round  I did use it to chop in half a small pill the size of an aspirin and when I went slow and took my time it sliced through it much better than when I just chopped it fast. So chopping bigger pills, no problem .... chopping smaller pills not so great.</li>
    <li> When I use CHOP to cut some pills I wanted to try a variety of sizes - from tiny little Ibuprofen pills to my Huge Vitamins.  I found that it lives up to it&#x27;s name and really does Chop every type of pill I put in it very easily.  This is great for busy parents, people with arthritis or pain in their hands, elderly or anyone who wants an easy to use pill splitter!  A great product for anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I loved that this was a simple product to use. No matter what size the pill this can chop it.  You don&#x27;t have to be strong. it is a simple close of a lid and it is chopped.  So perfect!  I think it&#x27;s great for elderly.</li>
    <li> Nice size, you can hold it in your hand and split pills, The pill splitter itself is not sharp enough to split some of the pills with out splitting them in three or four pieces</li>
    <li> This should be called &amp;#34;pill crusher&amp;#34;.  Every pill turned into powder.  The 2 dollar sharp metal pill cutter from CVS works far better.  This one was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used pill cutters for years. Even one with 12 shapes with which you can replace the standard triangle. That one worked but was really crummy thin plastic. Until I saw this Vivacity chop pill splitter it was impossible for me to get your average large oval pill in the right place. All those have a pointed triangle pill holder. Well I&#x27;m not adept and have a tremor in my hands so I could not get the pill across the triangle and have made some very creative splits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this one holds oval or rectangular, large or small, pills in place and I can finally get the pills split in half.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a hard push down to do the cutting, but I am happy with the trade-off between easy cutting into weird shapes. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>

Just insert the pill, press down with your palm, and CHOP! It&#x27;s very easy to keep clean and it&#x27;s very lightweight so it&#x27;s easy to keep in your purse or luggage!</li>

    <li> This week I had the chance to try out two Sabi products. The first was the Sabi Chop Cut-and-Take Pill Splitter. This makes it incredibly easy and simple to chop pills in half. If you have little kids, like I do, trying to give them vitamins can be tricky. Even children&#x27;s vitamins that are chewable can be difficult to eat for some kids, so the pill splitter makes it easy and simply to cut a pill in half. It&#x27;s easy to use and I love how tiny this product is. You could easily slip it into your purse for quick and easy access.</li>
    <li> The Pill Cutter was surprisingly super easy! Just put in and push down. I was skeptical cause there was no blade it was all plastic but nope simple to use and broke it into 2 pieces and not 5 which would of annoyed me --the pieces weren&#x27;t even but still small enough to swallow with no issue! Mind you it works with the long pills and not round, so it kinda looses a star for that...but all and all...great product.

    <li> It just so happened that the week after I received the CHOP Minimal effort pill cutter, that I got a cold and had some massive pills prescribed. I, sadly, am not able to swallow large pills so I had a chance to try the pill cutter. It worked perfectly! With a simple push the pill was chopped and ready to be taken. Yes, I am 30 years old, and still have a hard time swallowing large pills. I&#x27;m able to acknowledge this is unusual, but I know I&#x27;m not the only one out there who have a hard time swallowing large pills.

    <li> This works great for oblong shaped pills... like Tylenol or others in that shape. As you can see from the padding on the inside to nest the pill it, that is truly what it&#x27;s designed for. Does it work with other shaped pills? Yeah, but the cut isn&#x27;t as even. Does that make it less awesome? Nope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it without problem to split different shaped and types of pills. Each one was easy to do and the result was a nice cut, better than if I was trying to break it with my hands- possibly crumbling it between my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a pill cutter around the house, this is a good one. I wasn&#x27;t too worried about the kids cutting off digits either. So I recommend it for those that need a nice pill cutter... and for those that think they don&#x27;t need one... one day you&#x27;ll wish you had one... just saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest review.*</li>
    <li> This is a great little pill splitter for the average user. Do not let the plastic blade fool you. It is up to the job!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one of these to evaluate and review. But I would never recommend anything that I did not believe in. Have faith that this is a great tool in your arsenal of med related helpers.</li>
    <li> This pill splitter is very durable and compact, easy to hold and press down, and keeps the pills contained. It made the job much quicker and less frustrating. I like how easy it is to open and push down, as well as the fact that it is not sharp or hazardous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Not so great for round pills, but OK for oblong ones - the depression for holding the pill in position is oblong shape.  Still, my dad&#x27;s oblong coumadin pills don&#x27;t really split all that cleanly.</li>
    <li> These Sabi products are so easy to use. This Chop pill cutter is that way also. Just open the lid, stick the pill on the padded spot and close the lid with a hard push. Breaks the pill in half.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking through the review sso far and I am very surprised at all the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried using the chop, I had a small round pain killer that needed to be split. I wasn&#x27;t worried about  how it got split, i just needed it split into a smaller fraction. I ended up getting one half in tact, but the other half crumbled into about 4 or 5 pieces.  Which was fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried using it I took a little more time placing the pill in and getting it placed just right. It cut evenly and accurately. It was simple to use and I love that I can flip the chop over and save the other half of the pill in the chop until I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade it plastic, but I found it to be very nice and easy to use. I have tried several different types of pills in it and all have worked wonderfully. I use the Chop all the time now and never imagined how much it would change my pill routine for the better. My kids are even impressed with it because I can shop thier pills down to an easier size for them to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Crushes the pill instead of splitting it because they use a dull plastic piece instead of a metal splitter.  Useless overpriced product.</li>
    <li> Just does not on my pills. I would suggest one with a sharper blade and able to hold different sized pills. Clearly this unit is not properly designed.</li>
    <li> I appreciate how easy it is using the pill crusher instead of crushing pills manually with two spoons for medications which I have to mix in with foods and drinks for DS.  Not only are these both effective tools, they are both small enough to toss in a purse, diaper or gym bag, and any type of luggage just in case you might need them on the go as well!&lt;br /&gt;Read more at [...]</li>
    <li> Best pill splitter I have found.  Works so well and smooth.  The last few splitters I had wore out within weeks, we&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts but so far, so good</li>
    <li> This pill splitter might work on extremely tiny pills but I doubt it as the cutting blade is plastic.  The inner groove you place the pill on is very small so not any of my pills fit down in it. The outer ring didn&#x27;t stabilize the pill for cutting.  I just tossed it into recycling.</li>
    <li> As a nurse, I would highly recommend this item to at home residents because of its simplicity and ease of use. Often we come across necessary medications that are too large or too long and this pill splitter does the trick. For those perhaps with arthritis in their hands the wide top makes it very effective to use your palm to split the pill. As for my fellow nurses its a great tool to keep in the med cart to keep your med pass as efficient as possible.</li>
    <li> It fractured the medication&lt;br /&gt;Very poor results b</li>
    <li> My concern is the cutter is plastic rather than a sharp piece of metal.  Unsure how long before it crumbles the pill rather than cutting.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t  like the  product</li>
    <li> Terrible,  doesn&#x27;t have a  metal blade. Just boke my pill into pieces.</li>
    <li> This works well, but better on longer pills.  The round pills take some practice and luck to split without crumbling them too much.</li>
    <li> I like this pill splitter but I prefer it with oblong pills.  I can cut a small round pill but not always successfully.  It may be my fault and not the cutter&#x27;s.  It takes time to master the art of cutting the pill to a perfect size.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers have said it is good for oblong pills - much easier than the Apex  Ultra Pill splitter which I bought first.  The issue as others have said is that it uses a plastic blade, so the cut is not as clean.  Having used both, I prefer this one.  You still have to be careful lining up the pill, but I find it much easier that the Apex.  I&#x27;d recommend it for oval/oblong pills but if they came up with a similar design with a metal blade I&#x27;d go with that.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well at all. It is very hard to send her the pill so that it will stay as you close the lid. Also there is a lot of crumbling where the pill is split.</li>
