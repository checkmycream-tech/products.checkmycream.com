      <li>I definitely will be a returning customer and HIGHLY recommend shopping here.</li>
      <li>They are not sharp like thought they would be.</li>
      <li>They are not sharp....</li>
      <li>A tightening of the screws fixes the problem for a few seconds but, as one would expect, the vibration works them just loose enough to make the noise very quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> They are not sharp like thought they would be.</li>
    <li> The adjustable clipper&#x27;s on-off button fell apart, this happened approximately three weeks after I purchased the product. The edger clipper is doing well. I&#x27;m not happy about the adjustable clipper.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Used it on my very picky 19 year old son. Great results.</li>
    <li> Been loving the brand along time</li>
    <li> just got them in WOW so far so good got them shipped really fast used the trimmer only so far and they work great if anything changes ill update this review but for now 100% satisfied and you cant beat the price</li>
    <li> Item purchased for my son for Christmas. He was so excited. He said this brand is the best.</li>
    <li> Great combo just don&#x27;t like how the trimmer get real hot after about fifteen minutes.</li>
    <li> Due to the reviews and stars I purchased this kit for my husband.  The first time he used it it malfunctioned and smelled like it was burning.....I will be contacting Amazon and the seller to receive my money back.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! No more sending my two boys ages 4 and 6 to the barber! Their dad cuts their hair with ease! This product paid for itself long ago.</li>
    <li> First off the shipping was fast, the product was as described, and it works great.  I really enjoy using these clippers, they are sturdy, and fit well in your hands, although I am not a professional barber, they work well for my home use.  Overall, a great experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 20 years. I&#x27;ve owned every brand out there. These are without a doubt the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Thank u i really liked this clipper set for that price. I have always shopped at amozon and seemed to have never been let down thank u once again</li>
    <li> Bought it for my hubby for his business and he loves it. It works just perfect.</li>
    <li> I would not use any other clippers, Just the best.</li>
    <li> Do you get the clippers &amp; the t outliner &amp; the outliner II Or just one of them or just of the outliners?</li>
    <li> excellent product... it is of the best quality and they are so great that i use them daily with pleasure</li>
    <li> Works perfect thank you</li>
    <li> Gave it as a birthday gift to him and he LOVES it!! It was better than his Wahl clippers.  Great product!  Does not pull on his skin like some clippers do.  He&#x27;s a happy camper! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Use it to cut my hair myself about every two weeks. Now I don&#x27;t have to pay $8 - $12 just to get my head buzzed. Pays for itself rather quickly and lets me cut my hair whenever I want.</li>
    <li> I expected more. For their name, and the price, I was expecting something that would be barber-shop quality. Out of the kit, only the smaller trimmer qualifies, in my book. The larger clippers leave a lot of single-strands sticking up and require a few extra passes. They also have a &amp;#34;rattle&amp;#34; which I have narrowed down to the plastic casing. I can hear the rattle unless I am holding the clippers tight, as if I&#x27;m doing the jobs of the screws which hold the plastic case on. A tightening of the screws fixes the problem for a few seconds but, as one would expect, the vibration works them just loose enough to make the noise very quickly. I thought about using some thread lock and tightening them down/letting the thread lock cure, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how that would affect the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else was fine, but I really expected more out of the larger clippers. The problems I have with them are what I would expect from a cheap pair after a few months of use, not a brand new &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; pair right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had it to do over, I would buy the trimmers separately and find a different clipper.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for at a decent price. Beginner or expert, you must get these. I like to cut my own hair and this saves me time and money going to the barber shop, so if your reading this GET IT!. Comes exactly how pictures.</li>
    <li> I love them but im missing my 5&amp;7 gaurds</li>
    <li> The clippers are not very good for blending but they cut very well! The edgers are sharp but this is already known</li>
    <li> This was worth every penny</li>
    <li> My husband loves his news clipper and barber set, especially the fact that it is so quiet.&lt;br /&gt;The price was excellent.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I thought I had done my research well but I was wrong. I bought these based on the good reviews and I&#x27;m a hair stylist so I needed good clippers. I had these for three months and they stopped working completely. So so upset! Wasted the money and now have to get new ones Amazon wouldn&#x27;t refund the money.</li>
    <li> Great American made product. Will cost more but will last.</li>
    <li> Professional power and quality that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> It was just as I had expected</li>
    <li> Good clippers but they are half the price at your local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Garbage, clipper power button came broken and trimmer blade was rusted.</li>
    <li> These clippers are the best clippers that I have purchased. They were delivered very fast. will update after a few months.</li>
    <li> Bought this product a while back, with in the second use the switch started giving trouble.</li>
    <li> Love how clean and easy these work</li>
    <li> Waste of money. I bought these and they get really hot in your hand. Going to take temperature of clippers after running a few minutes. Someone is going to get burnt</li>
    <li> Took a long time for the vendor to ship the item but now that I have the combo kit, no complaints. Should have purchased this kit years ago instead of the other &amp;#34;want to be&amp;#34; clipper brands.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son. He wanted a better set to use. He said it works very well and is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> very happy with product, very quite and powerful, being used in a salon and coworkers very impressed. will recommend to others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no pro, but these are really great clippers.  My sister, who is a pro, recommended this make/model, and to date I have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> The back piece on one of my clippers broke.</li>
    <li> High quality electric hair clippers. These were recommended by a barber friend of mine. He has used these for years. You can get replacement clipper heads and power cords and keep them running for year . He recommended them for the price as a combination set.</li>
    <li> Andis is a great brand,  there products are long lasting and affordable. I will definitely be recommending them to others.</li>
    <li> Great clipper works great</li>
    <li> GREAT clippers. The t-liner cuts like butter.</li>
    <li> Make sure they send you the right machine. They sent me the Andis envy which is 75.99. I ordered the one in the picture which is 89.99. I wanted the envy I would of paid the 75.99 for it.</li>
    <li> These are by far my favorite clippers are by far the best clippers I have had. I had Wahl clippers and they snagged way too much. I oiled them a bunch and they still snagged. I returned them to get another pair and the very first pair I received I oiled them and used them on my client and they said it was snagging on their hair. So I turned to Andis clippers and I will NEVER return to Wahl clippers. Andis just does just a great job with fading and I absolutely love the T-outliner. It is a nice clean cut and makes it look like a clean shave. It&#x27;s really close without hurting my clients. I am also pleased with the seller. I received the e-mail stating I will receive my clippers on Monday or so and I got it in the mail within three days. So I didn&#x27;t have to wait long at all. So that makes me even happier. I definitely will be a returning customer and HIGHLY recommend shopping here.</li>
    <li> My son loved them.  They are great.</li>
    <li> Powerful clippers for what I need to do.</li>
    <li> They are really nice professional quality clippers, unfortunately the guards which are plastic, cracked after a few uses.</li>
    <li> This product started out great.  But it stopped working properly.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my son as birthday gift, he enjoyed it very much, grandson is in training to get his barbers license said they are very professional.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it no stars.. When I got them in they weren&#x27;t adjusted right, they were leaving lines in the hair. So I adjustedthem and they still leave lines. They are not sharp.... I used the edges twice And they stopped cutting in the middle of my cut! So mad I paid $100 for them</li>
    <li> I love this kid and so does my son who received it as a gift, pricing right, shipping fast and great reviews.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, everything was in order. The clippers performed exceptionally well. Great buy for the price with the trimmer included.</li>
    <li> It came on time and it cuts well... More than I can ask for..</li>
    <li> I ordered this about 2 months ago. The clippers are ok but the trimmers came dull.... I am a hair stylist that rely on my tools to make money. I had to buy the peanut trimmers to replace this. Not ever buying this brand again!</li>
    <li> I would rate a 5 stars on product, BUT because there was a problem with shipping I am giving them a 3.  I bought it as a gift for my hubby.  He loved the color and the clippers, great purchase for him.</li>
    <li> clippers blade keeps loosening up, and the trimmer just out right stopped working.</li>
    <li> The clipper itself works fantastic but the t-outliner is cracked when I got it and it messes up at times. I was unhappy about that.</li>
    <li> Would have gotten five stars if guards were not bent.</li>
    <li> Dope, gets hot quick tho, not as sharp as anticipated but gets job done</li>
    <li> Excellent quality . Clipers work very well . the trimmer could use being a bit more fine for that close shave .</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality and Cut!!! Recommended by my former barber. Unfortunately for him they work so well so that is why he is my former barber :) You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husbands a barber and this specific set is all he uses, He repurchases it religiously, and they him about 3 years considering he uses them for hours on end 5-7 days a week. Totally worth it. You should know what your doing when using machinery of this sort though, just sayin. Dont zeek yourself :)</li>
    <li> This product was as described, looking forward to getting more!</li>
    <li> Love my new clippers, cut my boyfriend hair with them now he want a fresh cut every week</li>
    <li> On/off switch was broken for hair clippers rite out the box. Outliner/trimmer works great. Too exspensive for the quality.</li>
    <li> great product and great deal.</li>
    <li> great pair of clippers that are professional quality</li>
    <li> Thank you item works.</li>
    <li> Very good clipper set</li>
    <li> It says it&#x27;s for barbers it&#x27;s really not besides for the T outliner i do not recommend for barbers .</li>
    <li> I really love them they work really good ...</li>
