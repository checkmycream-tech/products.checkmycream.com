      <li>I love to use it getting out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since switch to coconut oil and like it better than either apricot or baby oil.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>love this works better to moisturize better than any lotion or cream you can find.</li>
      <li>So nice and light.</li>

      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>It is very light and soaks in quickly, does not feel greasy at all!  </li>

      <li>has made my skin tighter, smoother, and more hydrated and fresh looking.</li>
      <li>and thats good enough for my intent.</li>
      <li>The oil has a light, pleasant fragrance and is not sticky like other oils</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to use right out of the shower, on my dry diabetic, feet!</li>
      <li>guys still look at me and many are 20 years and more younger.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and packed well.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not thick at all :)</li>
      <li>I wanted to transition from baby oil after a shower to something more natural.  </li>
      <li>It is nice especially at night.  </li>
      <li>I have heard it is good for lots of other things, but haven&#x27;t had time to try them yet.</li>
      <li>Product came right on time.</li>
      <li>Very much prefer coconut oil to this product.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re all different :)</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive for a lot of bang!</li>
      <li>Just mix with a couple drops of my favorite essential oil and&lt;br /&gt;hello</li>
      <li>They consistently have the freshest and highest quality.  </li>
      <li>This Apricot oil is great for every part of the body wherever dry skin is present.</li>
      <li>i mix with other oils and it amazing</li>
      <li>I also use it for a body oil in place of lotion and it makes your skin very soft and the oiliness goes away relatively quick.</li>
      <li>I have dry skin and have used oil over lotions for some time as I feel they do a better job.  </li>
      <li>and if your skin is feeling really dry mix it with a little rose hip oil and you will find nothing better.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s also an amazing massage oil, but I will but a larger bottle next time,</li>
      <li>This is ok not much smell to it though.</li>
      <li>The apricot oil is silky and odorless but it just isn&#x27;t very nourishing.  </li>
      <li>Bottle arrived kind of dirty and the lid was cracked, so when I pour it the oil kind of seeps out of everywhere.</li>
      <li>And yes, you can totally cook with it, which is what she uses it for, but not the only thing I use my own for.</li>
      <li>The mixture of the two has been a very inexpensive way to clean my face along with a hydrated clay mask I use daily.</li>
      <li>But then I purchased this oil and realized that if I use it daily I have a mild reaction to it.  </li>
      <li>My face hasnt been this clear and mosturized for quite some time!!</li>
      <li>It has lightened some age spots, and leaves my face super soft and definitely not dry.</li>
      <li>Odorless, not as smooth as expected, becomes sticky after 5 minutes of use</li>
      <li>He has somewhat sensitive skin and it has not broken him out at all.  </li>
      <li>I found good old baby oil to be far more moisturizing (but hate petroleum based products).  </li>
      <li>Use ONLY pure products like this one and NOTHING that you would not put in your mouth...generally.  </li>
      <li>I mix this with my Shea Moisture curl enhancing smoothie and it makes my hair feel so soft an manageable.</li>
      <li>It smells like old cooking oil.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and not oily at all.</li>
      <li>I use it on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll have a little left over for next time, will use with clove and cinnamon cassia and others to make a nice oil for personal empowerment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll get the job done when combined with a few other elements of importance.</li>
      <li>Wish it absorbed a little faster</li>
      <li>Really softens the rough skin on my feet and keeps them from cracking.</li>
      <li>I will seek their products out and spend an extra dollar for the peace of mind that I will not get some old sketchy rancid product from a company I don&#x27;t know, and have to hassle with the return, shipping and handling, all that nonsense.  </li>

<li> Just do a test on a small part of your skin before applying too much of it.  </li>
<li> It keeps it soft and fluffy</li>
<li> Purchased this to use with a couple other oils for facial use.</li>
<li> Not too greasy and lasts a very long time.</li>
<li> Also works well on scalp if you have dry scalp.</li>
<li> Using a few drops I massage into facial skin and it absorbs well.</li>
<li> whatever other uses I can incorporate it into.  </li>
<li> A little of this oil goes a long way!!</li>
<li> I have to be a little careful though, because even when my hair dries it can leave everything a little oily.</li>
<li> Yup, a little bit it&#x27;s all I need.</li>
<li> I mix a little bit of this oil in a moisturizer I make.  </li>
<li> and I guess the apricot is a little heavier.  </li>
<li> I usually use a little raw coconut oil while my face is wet</li>
<li> Used it, but can&#x27;t close it because the cap was missing.  </li>

    <li> Used it, but can&#x27;t close it because the cap was missing.  Mail me a cap and I will give you 5 stars.</li>
    <li> great service and delivery of product thank you&lt;br /&gt;works great</li>
    <li> Using as a nice moisturizer. Not too greasy and lasts a very long time. No need to reapply again and again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to use with a couple other oils for facial use. Using a few drops I massage into facial skin and it absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time &amp; a great product</li>
    <li> This Apricot oil is great for every part of the body wherever dry skin is present. Also works well on scalp if you have dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Wonderful on an 80 year young face.  So nice and light. What is put on your skin, is ingested by the body&#x27;s system.  Use ONLY pure products like this one and NOTHING that you would not put in your mouth...generally.  Hey! guys still look at me and many are 20 years and more younger.</li>
    <li> I tried this for my face, and I broke out, just a bit.  I used it on my hair...and it was very nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil for blending with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived kind of dirty and the lid was cracked, so when I pour it the oil kind of seeps out of everywhere. It had a seal on it, though, so whatever I guess.</li>
    <li> Seems it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf ina  werehouse for years. It smells like old cooking oil. Expired. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I wanted to transition from baby oil after a shower to something more natural.  The apricot oil is silky and odorless but it just isn&#x27;t very nourishing.  I found good old baby oil to be far more moisturizing (but hate petroleum based products).  I&#x27;ve since switch to coconut oil and like it better than either apricot or baby oil.</li>
    <li> love this oil! It&#x27;s great to use right out of the shower, on my dry diabetic, feet!</li>
    <li> i put this on my face and feet. Really softens the rough skin on my feet and keeps them from cracking.</li>
    <li> I add a little bit to my lotion, and it ramps up the moisture! Very inexpensive for a lot of bang!</li>
    <li> I have eaten apricots many times and never knew I had any type of allergy.  But then I purchased this oil and realized that if I use it daily I have a mild reaction to it.  The oil is good, nice feeling to the skin as long as I don&#x27;t over do it.  I mix a little bit of this oil in a moisturizer I make.  It is nice especially at night.  Just do a test on a small part of your skin before applying too much of it.  Excellent price for me at the time of my purchase (less than 5 dlls). Have been using it for almost 9 months now and I still have plenty in the bottle.  Yup, a little bit it&#x27;s all I need.</li>
    <li> Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is good.</li>
    <li> I really liked , I let the hair soft,shiny and hydrated.I&#x27;m very happy with this oil.</li>
    <li> for starters I was expecting it to smell like apricots. But it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all. It is an oil and I will use it but I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Odorless, not as smooth as expected, becomes sticky after 5 minutes of use I would not recommend it for massages! Arnica oil is so much better!!!</li>
    <li> I mix this with my Shea Moisture curl enhancing smoothie and it makes my hair feel so soft an manageable. I have to be a little careful though, because even when my hair dries it can leave everything a little oily. A little of this oil goes a long way!! No smell that I could notice and it&#x27;s not thick at all :)</li>
    <li> love it i mix with other oils and it amazing</li>
    <li> arrived timely and intact</li>
    <li> I put this on after shaving and it kept me from getting a shaved burn! Product came right on time.</li>
    <li> Great as a carrier oil for my DIY serums &amp; creams !!! Great for the skin !</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for your face.  Use it sparingly as you don&#x27;t need a lot. It has lightened some age spots, and leaves my face super soft and definitely not dry. You can also put on towel dried hair to add moisture and shine to your hair.  Again, use sparingly on the hair too.  Give it a try!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed for the price.  :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom so she&#x27;d stop using mine. She loves it! And yes, you can totally cook with it, which is what she uses it for, but not the only thing I use my own for. Yummm.</li>
    <li> Using in place of a lotion for our dry and cold Minnesota winters that are tough on skin.  Just mix with a couple drops of my favorite essential oil and&lt;br /&gt;hello better skin.  Wish it absorbed a little faster but it is what it is.</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase, recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it easily absorbs into my hair.  The oil has a light, pleasant fragrance and is not sticky like other oils</li>
    <li> Works great for skin and I even found a use for leather chairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great, light on the skin oil, however I think I still prefer olive oil on my eye lids.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and packed well.  It smell nice...not stale or rancid like some brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried using on my face but my skin wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.  I usually use a little raw coconut oil while my face is wet and I guess the apricot is a little heavier.  It may work for someone else though. We&#x27;re all different :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT....I love to use it getting out of the shower. My skin is so soft and not oily at all.</li>
    <li> My face was so red and bumpy from using Neutrogena soap... I read some reviews on Oils and now thats all I use on my face for the most part. I use Apricot oil on my face before I put on my makeup (just a tad). My face hasnt been this clear and mosturized for quite some time!!</li>
    <li> Love the company.  They consistently have the freshest and highest quality.  I will seek their products out and spend an extra dollar for the peace of mind that I will not get some old sketchy rancid product from a company I don&#x27;t know, and have to hassle with the return, shipping and handling, all that nonsense.  Now foods are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use in lip balms, lotions, salves, creams and whatever other uses I can incorporate it into.  I look foreward to mixing this lovely oil with scents, it&#x27;s also an amazing massage oil, but I will but a larger bottle next time, now that I know I can trust the product.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times on my hands and I massage my toddler with it before he goes to sleep.  It is very light and soaks in quickly, does not feel greasy at all!  It has no smell which is probably a good thing since I don&#x27;t like to use any fragrances on my son.  He has somewhat sensitive skin and it has not broken him out at all.  I have heard it is good for lots of other things, but haven&#x27;t had time to try them yet.</li>
    <li> I use it on my natural hair. It keeps it soft and fluffy</li>
    <li> Very much prefer coconut oil to this product. This seemed to have a drying affect rather than moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Nice product. feels great on skin</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to use the oil washing method along with castor oil. The mixture of the two has been a very inexpensive way to clean my face along with a hydrated clay mask I use daily. I&#x27;m noticing the combo has made my skin tighter, smoother, and more hydrated and fresh looking. I also use it for a body oil in place of lotion and it makes your skin very soft and the oiliness goes away relatively quick.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and have used oil over lotions for some time as I feel they do a better job.  This is a good moisturizer and good price</li>
    <li> I put two drops of this oil in my palm, add water, and apply around my eyes for eye nutrition and also for crows feet at the corners of my eyes</li>
    <li> Wanted to get Jojaba oil but they were too expensive and I&#x27;m on a budget so apricot will do. I need a base oil and I&#x27;ve used apricot kernal oil before and it worked good. So It&#x27;s in my budget, came on time, nice amount so I&#x27;ll have a little left over for next time, will use with clove and cinnamon cassia and others to make a nice oil for personal empowerment. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll get the job done when combined with a few other elements of importance. So a good oil, good enough for me anyway. It&#x27;s not  Jojaba but it is a base oil and thats good enough for my intent. You use what you got and substitute when you can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Wonderful face oil that layers beautifully over foundation and moisturizer, or on its own!</li>
    <li> love this works better to moisturize better than any lotion or cream you can find. and if your skin is feeling really dry mix it with a little rose hip oil and you will find nothing better.</li>
    <li> This is ok not much smell to it though.</li>
    <li> Love this product...smell, quality, packaging etc!</li>
</ol>
