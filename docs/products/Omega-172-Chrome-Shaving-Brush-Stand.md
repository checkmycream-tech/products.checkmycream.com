      <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with the purchase.  </li>
      <li>Overall, wonderful stand!</li>
      <li>Seller should add more detail description...</li>
      <li>This is a lovely chrome-dipped brush stand.</li>
      <li>you have to make sure to squeeze in all the bristles in the opening.</li>
      <li>Loved it at first</li>
      <li>This is a most important tool for all men who use a brush to put lather on their faces for shaving.  </li>
      <li>works well and looks good for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The Omega #172 shaving brush stand (in hard chrome, model #171 in goldtone plating) is as good as it gets; nice, heavy steel rod, perfect hard chrome plating, flawless welds, all at a very fair price.  </li>
      <li>I really like the stand, it is solid, elegant, and holds my brush perfectly.  </li>
      <li>It works just fine.  </li>
      <li>so the stand holds it by the hair, but that is just fine with me.</li>
      <li>Balance seems fine, no worries about tipping over.  </li>
      <li>This little guy stands about 2.5 inches tall and is the perfect size for my Art of Shaving brush.  </li>
      <li>Nice finish and holds brush very well.  </li>
      <li>This metal stand does not feel or look cheap</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>The stand is compact in size (fits nicely onto a medicine cabinet shelf), sturdy enough and holds the brush at a nice angle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and sturdy and very simple yet elegant in design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d much prefer a more comfortable stand, a taller stand that would allow me to hang the brush by the neck of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Letting your brush dry out should greatly extend its life, so having a brush stand is pertinent.  </li>
      <li>This ring wraps around right where the handle meets the bristles!</li>
      <li>my 30mm Pat Camara badger brush barely fits in this stand - but for brushes with shorter, smaller (22-26mm) knots, it&#x27;s just the perfect size.  </li>
      <li>Quick shipping&lt;br /&gt;Exactly</li>
      <li>one is perhaps right for a frequent traveler, but for home, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more for a larger stand if it does a good job of holding the brush by its handle rather than the knob, with space between stand and knot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a really easy job, is there any reason it should cost so much money?    </li>
      <li>I dry my brush most of the way after use, so, for me this item is more useful as a storage solution.</li>
      <li>For the $ this little stand is great.</li>
      <li>Great shaving brush stand although I felt it a little pricey</li>
      <li>If it were a bit taller and available in stainless steel or brushed nickel it would be a nice option.</li>
      <li>It should fit any shaving brush of non-crazy size, and it does not take up much space.</li>
      <li>For the price, I think it is worth it as I cannot imagine having to ever replace this.</li>
      <li>I would have liked it to be a bit taller, but the brush fits alright when placed just above the bristles.</li>
      <li>The top of the stand didn&#x27;t fit the larger brushes</li>
      <li>I liked the style of the stand but the arm was way too short for any of my Shaving Brushes!!!!</li>
      <li>I spent a lot on  my razor made in Germany, so might as well pair my brush with a good looking stand.</li>
      <li>Good badger shaving brushes are an investment; take care of them properly with a decent, affordable brush stand like this one.</li>
      <li>lo and behold, I was hanging the brush by the top knob instead of the neck next to the bristles!</li>
      <li>The design is simple, sleek, and small... and it holds my shaving brush perfectly.</li>
      <li>The product does exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Ok, when you put the brush in this it does not go all the way on the last notch of the handle.</li>
      <li>only surprise was how short it is, but then again, i was warned of this by prior reviews... will do an excellent job for what i need it for so A+++ all around, for the stand</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was a lot of money for a piece of metal.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly as it was described.</li>
      <li>OK, I like it, but big deal</li>
      <li>A good badger brush is not cheap</li>
      <li>Very functional, simple with a bit of style (not fancy or over the top).  </li>
      <li>But how much you are willing to pay for this product is up to you.</li>
      <li>for\\&quot; to be reminded of how true this frequently is.</li>
      <li>It is the usual really good Omega quality, I&#x27;m giving it 4stars</li>
      <li>The only issue is that the stem of the stand touches the brush after the brush has been used and has bloomed but it can easily be avoided by placing the brush at an angle.</li>
      <li>That being said, I would have liked it to be slightly taller</li>
      <li>The shaft of the stand could be about 1/2 inch taller to accomdate larger brushes easily.</li>
      <li>May not hold large brushes in a stable manner.  </li>
      <li>This is a great little brush stand for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>The Omega 172 holds the Vulfix 660 brush very well.</li>
      <li>It does what it is supposed to and does not take up too much space doing it.</li>
      <li>There is not all to much to say about it, it holds a shaving soap brush without costing a lot of money.</li>
      <li>Compared with others, the price makes it a real bargain.</li>
      <li>Very stable and sturdy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought the stand was going to be a bit bigger and heavier. When I grab my brush from the stand I&#x27;d say the stand falls over 80 percent of the time. Just kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G</li>
    <li> Simply allows me to store and dry my brush every day.  Not a lot of surfaces to stay wet or get dirty.</li>
    <li> I use this to hold my tweezerman. I bought it because I didn&#x27;t want my brush picking up anything from my bathroom sink area. It works great! I don&#x27;t have any complaints for this product.</li>
    <li> This is a solid shaving-brush stand that seems far more sturdy than its plastic counterparts.  It has a modern, attractive look, and the base is small enough to fit in the bottom of my shaving bowl, freeing up counter space in my small bathroom.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it was designed to do--keep the brush in proper hanging position for drying. Could be a little taller, but that might cause the center-of-gravity to be off. There&#x27;s nothing to complain about here, given that it does what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
    <li> For the $ this little stand is great. Each morning the brush is dry and ready to use. It&#x27;s also a beautiful design.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s solid metal, not cheesy plastic, which is a plus. Chrome is a plus, as well. If you&#x27;re spending money on a brush, buy a stand and take care of your shaving tools.</li>
    <li> I occasionally have to go through the experience of \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; to be reminded of how true this frequently is. I finally replaced the poorly designed &amp; equally poorly manufactured holder I purchased on eBay (for about half the price) with this one. Not much more to say beyond it works well and looks good for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Perfect stand; clean and efficient, exactly what I needed. Worth the cost to keep your old school brush lasting for year.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed out of the box is how small the holder is. Still very functional though and aesthetically beautiful. Does its job well...I am using it with the Escali badger brush!</li>
    <li> This metal stand does not feel or look cheap and, well, it works. It should fit any shaving brush of non-crazy size, and it does not take up much space. The brush goes on the stand bristles down. This way gravity can help dry the brush after you wash it. If you let a badger shaving brush dry standing on its base with bristles up, it will not dry well and the hairs will weaken and fall out. A good badger brush is not cheap so you want it to last as long as possible. For that reason, a stand is effectively a mandatory purchase, and it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> This is one of the cheaper metal shaving brushes and it&#x27;s good at what it does, which is holding a brush! It fits my Edwin Jagger small travel brush (19mm knot) loosely at about 7/8th of the top of the handle (see pictures), so it can definitely hold a larger brush, perhaps up to a 25mm knot depending on the handle size. The opening of the brush holder is about 25mm but the radius of the hole is about 28mm. The stand is about 2-11/16\\&quot; tall    The only issue is that the stem of the stand touches the brush after the brush has been used and has bloomed but it can easily be avoided by placing the brush at an angle.</li>
    <li> Great shaving brush stand although I felt it a little pricey however, it works great and has held every brush I&#x27;ve put in it . I believe some have complained that it rusts after some time. I&#x27;ve had mine for several months and have not had that problem, then again I don&#x27;t have it in standing water nor do I put brushes that are dripping wet into it. YUMV.</li>
    <li> This has worked well for me. It looks good and is functional.</li>
    <li> Not much can go wrong when you go with this. It&#x27;s chrome which goes with nearly any decor and it&#x27;s rugged. Holds my brush perfectly, is easy to clean, this is a good stand. Also, it holds any brush so no worries about handle size.</li>
    <li> Loved it at first but after five years, it rusted and I had to buy a new one.  They use poor quality stainless steel.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was a lot of money for a piece of metal. But it is perfect, and my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> A nice shaving accessory.  The design is simple, sleek, and small... and it holds my shaving brush perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am not sure any one is better than the other, but based on price and style I went with this stand for my shaving brush. It does what it is supposed to and does not take up too much space doing it. If you are going to invest in a decent shaving brush go ahead and spend a little money on a stand too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a metal holder for your shaving brush. No technology or anything here. That being said, I would have liked it to be slightly taller</li>
    <li> Works fine but should cost less than half.  I mean, it is a bent piece of metal tubing.</li>
    <li> I really like the stand, it is solid, elegant, and holds my brush perfectly.  Just what I was looking for.  I spent a lot on  my razor made in Germany, so might as well pair my brush with a good looking stand.</li>
    <li> This shave brush stand is quite nice and well made for the price. I am new to using shave cream brushes and acessories like this so at first I was disappointed because the brush did not fit in the stand...it seemed that the stand was too \\&quot;short\\&quot; to hold the brush! WOW, I thought, this is very unusual...so, I looked at the stand again and at the brush...lo and behold, I was hanging the brush by the top knob instead of the neck next to the bristles! LOL....anyway, turns out that this is a fine stand for your shave cream brush and looks great too. It&#x27;s nice and sturdy and very simple yet elegant in design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PWN</li>
    <li> I have been using the tip of a metal coat-hanger to hold my Omega silver tip brush, by sliding the handle neck into the tip of the coat hanger. This worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I let myself be influenced by the reviews and bought that Omega 172 stand.&lt;br /&gt;However it will not take the brush by the neck of the handle, because the stand is way too short.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, even if the stand was taller, the opening is too narrow to take the handle by its neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to hang the brush by the base of the knot, between the bristles and the handle, at the point where they meet.&lt;br /&gt;But you have to make sure to squeeze in all the bristles in the opening. From time to time, some bristles are pushed on the outside of the opening.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, once hanging, the bristles are pressed against the stand.&lt;br /&gt;This stand is far too small. And I get tired of having to pay attention every time that all the bristles have gone into the opening, and not some pushed outside, damaging the side bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d much prefer a more comfortable stand, a taller stand that would allow me to hang the brush by the neck of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, I left the cute little thing in the cabinet and I have reverted to my coat hanger, which lies flat on a shelf under a big pile of towels near my sink, with only the tip emerging from the edge of the shelf, allowing me to hang the brush immediately by the handle&#x27;s neck, without fussing about being careful enough to squeeze all the bristles into the holder, and the bristles touching nothing.&lt;br /&gt;From what I read about the Gillette or the Acqua di Parma, or similar, that is probably what I wanted, with a larger opening to accept the handle at its neck, and no touching of the stand with the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, this is a cute little thing, with clever Italian engineering to save on everything, size, volume, metal, where a lot of required features have been compressed together to produce a tiny objectat a tiny price.&lt;br /&gt;This one is perhaps right for a frequent traveler, but for home, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more for a larger stand if it does a good job of holding the brush by its handle rather than the knob, with space between stand and knot.&lt;br /&gt;I may offer this one as a present and buy myself another one when I have found the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very few reviewers have touched these questions.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps because they don&#x27;t know how easy it is to use a metal coat hanger!</li>
    <li> The Omega #172 shaving brush stand (in hard chrome, model #171 in goldtone plating) is as good as it gets; nice, heavy steel rod, perfect hard chrome plating, flawless welds, all at a very fair price.  It&#x27;s a tad bit small for your larger shaving brushes - my 30mm Pat Camara badger brush barely fits in this stand - but for brushes with shorter, smaller (22-26mm) knots, it&#x27;s just the perfect size.  Good badger shaving brushes are an investment; take care of them properly with a decent, affordable brush stand like this one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Product is as expected. The shaft of the stand could be about 1/2 inch taller to accomdate larger brushes easily. Just right for my basic brush.</li>
    <li> very solid brush stand, much better quality than i expected. has a good weight to it... only surprise was how short it is, but then again, i was warned of this by prior reviews... will do an excellent job for what i need it for so A+++ all around, for the stand AND Simplybeautiful (the company i bought this from)</li>
    <li> This stand is compact and rock solid.  I previously had a plastic stand which broke, but there is little chance of that happening with this one.  Compared with others, the price makes it a real bargain.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for home use.  Excellent design, good price.  Could have been a little taller for my preference but it does trick.</li>
    <li> This is a most important tool for all men who use a brush to put lather on their faces for shaving.  This particular one is very well made, sturdy and well suited for the brush.  I tried before to get by without one, but only succeeded in ruining the bristols on my brush.  Avery good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the purchase.  The item was exactly as it was described.</li>
    <li> The actual stand that I received does not have the center portion of the stand as is pictured, however, this doesn&#x27;t seem to detract from its utility.  I like the look of the stand pictured, but it&#x27;s not a reason, at least in my mind, to return it. It is still a nice, clean-looking stand.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  May not hold large brushes in a stable manner.  Also, I will watch for rust formation as this may stain a non-stone or non-sealed counter (not marble, granite, etc). No rust so far.  Letting your brush dry out should greatly extend its life, so having a brush stand is pertinent.  Again, you get what you pay for so the stand was a bargain.  If buying a heavier or larger brush, may want to consider a stand such as the wooden one sold on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Tweezerman badger brush and if fit perfectly. I recently purchased a larger badger brush and the opening on this stand was  too small to fit the new brush handle and the height was too short. When buying these stands find out the opening width and stand height as they are different from stand to stand. This was a nice quality stand that will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a simple design and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space</li>
    <li> Only 2.5 inches high! I was expecting to hang my brush by the groove in the handle, but it would not fit. Have to hang it by the base of the handle, where bristles starts. Seller should add more detail description...</li>
    <li> I have a decent brush collection and some have knots as large as 29mm.  The top of the stand didn&#x27;t fit the larger brushes so I gently tapped it on a cylindrical head of my vice to open the tangs a bit.  Worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again...  but I probably won&#x27;t need another one in a long time!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for any of my brushes</li>
    <li> It is the usual really good Omega quality, I&#x27;m giving it 4stars because I wanted a round base, this one has an oblong base.</li>
    <li> It works just fine.  A stand is neccissary to keep your shaving brush properly dry where the bristles are joined to the handle.  Otherwise  mold will grow and cut the bristles off at the base.</li>
    <li> This does the job. The job is to be a piece of metal with little arms to hold a shaving brush. That&#x27;s a really easy job, is there any reason it should cost so much money?    Yes, the reason is that there is not a cheaper little bit of metal that holds a shaving brush to be found on Amazon. So we&#x27;re stuck.    Decent product, terrible price.</li>
    <li> There is not all to much to say about it, it holds a shaving soap brush without costing a lot of money. Its durable because its metal so it wont break (unless you do something extreme to it) and should last you forever unless you lose it. Overall its, well, a shaving brush holder.</li>
    <li> Got this item on time, and in good condition. I will say that is seems smaller than I thought it might be. That being said, it is fairly heavy for its size. My brush is hung just below the wooden handle by its bristles (tweezerman badger brush). I dry my brush most of the way after use, so, for me this item is more useful as a storage solution.</li>
    <li> Works well, and looks great in my bathroom.  I use this to hold an Omega boar bristle brush - perfect fit.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely chrome-dipped brush stand. Others at Nordstrom&#x27;s are $75 and up for the same quality! My boyfriend loved the gift, and now his brush&#x27;s bristles don&#x27;t get bent like they did before, drying without the stand. Do be advised, however, that this stand holds the brush between the hair and the handle, unlike the Nordstrom&#x27;s stands that are a little larger and hold the brush only at the top of the wood handle.  Neither my bf nor I have a preference on how it holds the brush, and I doubt there&#x27;s a difference during the drying process. Overall, wonderful stand!</li>
    <li> I just changed over to using a badger hair brush from using shaving cream from a can. This tree works and does the job. I think I will upgrade over time, but it does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I would have liked it to be a bit taller, but the brush fits alright when placed just above the bristles.</li>
    <li> This keeps the bristles on your shaving brush from being crushed by laying it on its side to dry. If you stand it on it&#x27;s handle the water/soap left in the bristles will seep into the handle/knot and eventually the bristles will start falling out. This does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do and looks good doing it.  Pricey for its small size but worth it if you care about what your stuff looks like. If you don&#x27;t you can fashion a brush holder out of a wire coat hanger. If you take shaving seriously enough to use blades and a brush you&#x27;ll probably want this or something like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he is very pleased with it.  It is attractive and does the job.</li>
    <li> The product does exactly as described. It is chrome and it fits my Art of Shaving brush perfectly. But how much you are willing to pay for this product is up to you. Having this stand in my hands, I would value it at about $5. I tried looking around dollar stores, Walmart, Bed Bath and Beyond but no where has a brush stand. I guess it really comes down to how much you want to pay for a standard stand for your brush. This shipped fast and packaging was perfect. No complain for the seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having a bit of &#x27;buyers remorse&#x27; from this purchase. I only got it because I&#x27;ve switched to shaving with a blade and the brush requires a stand to let it dry correctly. BUT, there&#x27;s no reason this thing should cost $15+ dollars...$2.50 would be more like it!</li>
    <li> This is a great little brush stand for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is relatively compact, does not take up much space on your bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;2. It fits my brush well, the tips of the bristles hover *just* above the countertop.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has an attractive chrome coating, which aesthetically goes well with brushes that are chrome or black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is a great blend of form and function, I am well pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Nice finish and holds brush very well.  Balance seems fine, no worries about tipping over.  Good stand for the price.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my brushes will last a bit longe now&lt;br /&gt;Need to ensure that your brush is not too big or this will not fit&lt;br /&gt;Looks very nice on my glass shelf</li>
    <li> OK, I like it, but big deal it is a piece of wire that holds a shaving brush. The price is absurd, of course the other higher priced ones are even more ridiculous. Might have been cheaper to ask an orthodontist to bend the wire for me.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, stands on its own.  My brush is a little bigger than most so the stand holds it by the hair, but that is just fine with me.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a simple stand.  He does not need one with the place for the razor.  This one works perfectly</li>
    <li> This is very small and I have 2 different size shaving brushes and both are too big even though one is a small brush. Returning it the same day I got it.</li>
    <li> The Omega 172 holds the Vulfix 660 brush very well. The stand is compact in size (fits nicely onto a medicine cabinet shelf), sturdy enough and holds the brush at a nice angle. If it were a bit taller and available in stainless steel or brushed nickel it would be a nice option. Overall, I&#x27;d buy it again since it is a vast improvement over a plastic holder.</li>
    <li> This little guy stands about 2.5 inches tall and is the perfect size for my Art of Shaving brush.  Very stable and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I use my double stand for two different sized razors, so this came in handy for my badger brush. Nice inexpensive solution.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, keeps your brush bristles-down so it dries properly.  My only reason for 4 and note five stars is my wish it was a tad taller to accommodate larger brushes.  Other than that it&#x27;s a great bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> The stand was too narrow to fit my brush and even if it wasn&#x27;t too narrow the stand is too short. For those who are curious my brush is the Escali badger brush.</li>
    <li> Very functional, simple with a bit of style (not fancy or over the top).  Fits well on the batroom counter.</li>
    <li> I liked the style of the stand but the arm was way too short for any of my Shaving Brushes!!!! Must have been made for short inexpensive brushes!  I don&#x27;t know, they should have specified the dementions of the stand in their discription!!  Didn&#x27;t bother to send it back.....didn&#x27;t make sense with the shipping charges!!</li>
    <li> Ok, when you put the brush in this it does not go all the way on the last notch of the handle. This ring wraps around right where the handle meets the bristles! Have been using this for a while now and it does what it says it does. For the price, I think it is worth it as I cannot imagine having to ever replace this.</li>
    <li> Heavy weight stand, heavier than I expected. Fits my brush perfectly.Holds the brush about a half inch above the counter top.</li>
