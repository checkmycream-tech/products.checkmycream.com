      <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle &amp; am going to give this awhile before I know anything concrete about it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ive been taking this product for 2 weeks now and I can already see a difference in the quality of my skin. My skin is less dry and I see less wrinkles than before. My face is glowing and looks healthier! I cant wait to see what an entire MONTH of this will do.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  I have been using it for a few weeks and have been asked by friends and family what I have changed :) Definitely give this product a try, you won&#x27;t be dissatisfied!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with these phytoceramides, I have been taking them for a few weeks and see improvement in the texture of my skin. Easy to take and no side effects, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Everyone is talking about phytoceramides as a hydrator of skin that erases wrinkles. As the PR says &#x60;Phytoceramides are the plant-derived equivalent of ceramides, a lipid that keeps your skin hydrated and plump. You start to lose ceramides as you age, and as a result, your skin beings to appear rough and wrinkled. Taking phytoceramides orally restores the natural outer layer of the skin. These powerful molecules work from the inside out, getting absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the inner layer of your skin. From there, they seep to the outermost layer where they restore the cracked and damaged barrier, moisturize and fill out wrinkles and sun-damaged areas.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What RADIANT COMPLEX capsules add to the magic is the fact that theirs is rice derived as opposed to wheat or sweet potato and the delivery of phytoceramides is higher than with competitors. This formula contains the important addition of vitamins A, C, D, and E - each of which is scientifically proven to enhance antioxidant boosts. When a company offers a 100% money back guarantee you can pretty much depend on the efficacy of the product. Try this for only a couple of days and see if you don&#x27;t notice a fresher appearance to your face and hands and hair and nails - and the rest of your body! Grady Harp, August 14</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product; I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time and have already noticed my nails getting stronger, my hair is silkier and I swear my skin is glowing! I have very weak nails but within a few days of taking the supplement, my nails were no longer peeling or bending.  On top of that, my skin looks and feels nourished and hydrated. I&#x27;m sold, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the vitamins for two weeks and can already tell the difference in my skin. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I will have to say this product really does work on your skin! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think because I have never taking anything that says it will help my skin from the inside out.  I tested it out for the time period (meaning I took it for a month like the bottle says to do) I only had one problem and that was remembering to take it a half hour before eating. But that was just me. I could tell after about 2 weeks that my skin was improving. My skin started feeling a bit softer and even my fine lines look a bit pumper. I am now a believer that a capsule can work on your skin from the inside out!&lt;br /&gt;Now some of said that it helped their hair and nails and that didn&#x27;t happen for me. I think that may of been because I only took it for a month, I think over time it would have. *This item was received free for the purpose of testing, for a honest and unbiased review*</li>
    <li> This product is of good quality. It was shipped well and I got what I asked and paid for. I have been taking phytoceramides for about four months now with good results. I got it because of dry skin and a little facial sagging due to weight loss. I am happy with It and will take it as long as it works. you will get better results by eating good, getting enough rest, and using a facial moisturizer with a sun block. I am 57 and people tell me I look 40 so I must be doing something right. oh and don&#x27;t forget drinking a lot of water is very important too. hope this helps you too.</li>
    <li> I definitely notice a change in my skin which is pretty amazing. The only thing about it I didn&#x27;t like was the taste but hey, just shot gun it down, right? It&#x27;s medicine!</li>
    <li> IDK…I don&#x27;t see a difference after two bottles, but will continue with the third to see if there&#x27;s a change.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the advice of Dr. Oz.  Unknown if it is working yet.</li>
    <li> I noticed no difference whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Love these!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle &amp; am going to give this awhile before I know anything concrete about it. So far so good though.</li>
    <li> After having taken the recommended dosage (one capsule daily) for three weeks I&#x27;ve become a believer in Phytocermides Capsules. The claim that they promote &amp;#34;skin cell renewal and rejuvenation&amp;#34; is true. Within days I noticed that my skin, particularly my facial skin and the backs and palms of my hands, were moister than they had been in a long time. I soon noticed that the mild rosacea that I have had for some time began to clear. With this much improvement in such a short time I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what will happen as I continue to take these capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I take several other dietary supplements I made a note of the ingredients to make sure I wasn&#x27;t overdosing on anything. (If you take other supplements, this is always a wise thing to do.) According to the ingredients label, these capsules contain 100% of the daily value of Vitamins A, C, D, and E. They also contain 40 mg of phytoceramides derived from rice.</li>
    <li> I had originally heard about phytoceramides on Dr Oz and tried another brand and it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me, I think because it was the kind made from wheat. The rice ones work better and I really like this Radiant Complex brand, I&#x27;ve been taking it for a few weeks and I have seen good results: my skin is smoother and my &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; that i am taking it for are less visible.</li>
    <li> I have taken this for almost a month and my skin looks great!  People are saying that my skin is glowing and I look so young! For sure I will continue to use it.  I have nothing but good to say about it. Try it . You will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Ceramides are sphingolipid molecules that are essential to the structure and function of the skin and they are frequently decreased or disturbed in unhealthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Radiant Complex Phytoceramides is a supplement that contains natural ceramides derived from rice in addition to 100% of the recommended daily allowance of four vitamins (A, C, D, E) that are also critical for healthy skin.  Proper nutrition is as important to maintaining the appearance of the skin as are drinking plenty of water and getting enough sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety-sealed bottle that I received expires 05/16, almost three years from receipt.  It contains 30 vegetarian capsules and the label instructs to take one capsule daily 20 to 30 minutes before a meal with an 8 oz. glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bottle of phytoceramide capsules was provided by Radiant Complex for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I definitely notice a difference! My skin feels so soft and hydrated! Great product, great service- I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Super excited to gives these a try!  Hope the product is as great as their customer service!  I will report back on the product later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the bottle is labeled so well.  It tells what the vitamins are supposed to do and what they are targeting.  We take so many vitamins and it is hard to remeber what each one is for.</li>
