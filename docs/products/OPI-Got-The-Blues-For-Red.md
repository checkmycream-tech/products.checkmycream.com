      <li>This is my favorite color for my nails.</li>
      <li>THIS RED IS THE BEST FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE FAIR/PINKISH UNDERTONE TO THEIR SKIN.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite fall/winter colors.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years.  </li>
      <li>After reading reviews here that this was a great red for someone fair skin, I decided to go for this shade.</li>
      <li>LOVE OPI NAIL POLISH AND</li>
      <li>Took me forever to find it &amp; is one of my favorite colors.</li>
      <li>I love every one of them.</li>
      <li>So glad I can get it on line.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyways, this color works great on me, and very classy.</li>
      <li>Good coverage and durability, holds up well in real life situations.</li>
      <li>Great deep red for us fair skinned gals!</li>
      <li>This red looks great.</li>
      <li>I looked online to find it and saw that Amazon was selling it for a really discounted price!!!</li>
      <li>The consistency is very smooth and also very opaque.</li>
      <li>Since I change my polish every week, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>I love this color so much.</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned with red undertones.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a brighter red, but this is really good color for the winter and fall season.</li>
      <li>Very quick shipment, and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Look Great, it is darker than the traditional reds but much brighter</li>
      <li>A nice rich red color, love OPI, worth the extra money you spend versus drugstore nail polish.</li>
      <li>So good that satisfy what I expected!</li>
      <li>I just got my nails done today (9/11/12) and choose this red because it&#x27;s one of my favorite colors.</li>
      <li>I get acrylic on my nails and the last two times I&#x27;ve had my nails filled, I&#x27;ve taken this color tp use</li>
      <li>3 of my friends have actually purchased the same color because they liked it so much.</li>
      <li>If you want a darker red color than this will fit the bill.</li>
      <li>most reds either turn my skin yellowish or pink.</li>
      <li>Went on really well.</li>
      <li>This is a TRUE blood red!</li>
      <li>&quot; but that is more of a deep plum red...</li>
      <li>I always feel hesitate to try a bold color before, and since my Asian light skin tone, I have to be careful choosing</li>
      <li>A very nice deep, dark, red with blue undertones..</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a true red that isn&#x27;t orangish or OPI Red go with OPI O&#x27;Hare &amp; Nails</li>
      <li>One in a rich true red, a darker red ( this one ) and a red with a pink undertone.</li>
      <li>Seller shipped a glass bottle of red nail polish in little more than a padded envelope thru the mail.</li>
      <li>As a side note, the shipping was fast, but upon arrival, I could see red bleeding through the mailing envelope.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a dark red, but not a burgundy  - more of a crimson with a hint of blue.</li>
      <li>but I guess they&#x27;re not willing to make it right since they never bothered to get back with me after I wrote to them...</li>
      <li>Bought some of these for the Wife, apparently OPI is the &#x27;crème de la crème&#x27; of nail varnishes</li>
      <li>This is a real pretty color Red closer to a deep darker Red lasted long on my nails with a base and top coat.</li>

<li> Delivered in few days !</li>
<li> I usualy don&#x27;t wear nail polish, just use my toes, but lately I have been painting my nails everyweek.</li>
<li> Also, it lasted at least 5 days before chipping.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time find OPI polish here in my small time.  </li>
<li> Needless to say it was busted &amp;</li>
<li> I had looked all over for this color of OPI, and had been unable to find it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
<li> I ordered this from the seller late Sunday night &amp; got it in the mail delivery on Tuesday afternoon!!!!</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <li> Love OPI polishes, and this color looks good with my skin tone.  It&#x27;s a dark red, but not a burgundy  - more of a crimson with a hint of blue.</li>
    <li> This is a great color that I always get compliments on. 3 of my friends have actually purchased the same color because they liked it so much. I have really fair skin, but it looks good on all skin tones.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of trouble with classic red nail polish because I have very pale skin most reds either turn my skin yellowish or pink. This red looks great. The polish goes on nicely with no problems. I use Stickey base coat and 2 coats of the polish the a no chip top coat and it lasts about a week.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST red nail polish without being too bold!!</li>
    <li> Seller shipped a glass bottle of red nail polish in little more than a padded envelope thru the mail. Needless to say it was busted &amp; red was everywhere. Contacted the seller but I guess they&#x27;re not willing to make it right since they never bothered to get back with me after I wrote to them...no refund either.</li>
    <li> This is a TRUE blood red! It is darker than the picture makes it seem. In the dark it almost looks brown or dark marroon.  OMG! I ordered this from the seller late Sunday night &amp; got it in the mail delivery on Tuesday afternoon!!!! It was even faster than Amazon prime shipping. If you are looking for a true red that isn&#x27;t orangish or OPI Red go with OPI O&#x27;Hare &amp; Nails Look Great, it is darker than the traditional reds but much brighter then Got the Blues. Took me forever to find it &amp; is one of my favorite colors.</li>
    <li> I love this color so much. I always feel hesitate to try a bold color before, and since my Asian light skin tone, I have to be careful choosing colors- otherwise, those color could make my hands look so dark of some sort...&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this color works great on me, and very classy.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fall/winter colors.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years.  Only problem is that the polish gets too thick before I&#x27;ve used it all...&lt;br /&gt;about 2/3 of the way down in the bottle.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because no preservatives are used?</li>
    <li> After reading reviews here that this was a great red for someone fair skin, I decided to go for this shade. I am fair skinned with red undertones. I love reds, but most don&#x27;t look good with my complexion. I usualy don&#x27;t wear nail polish, just use my toes, but lately I have been painting my nails everyweek. This color does look great! A nice rich red color, love OPI, worth the extra money you spend versus drugstore nail polish. As a side note, the shipping was fast, but upon arrival, I could see red bleeding through the mailing envelope. I contacted the seller the next day, email only (offered to send pictures), the seller said no problem, didn&#x27;t ask to see my pictures or to mail back the damaged bottle, they sent another one ut express shipping!! Great experience, thank you!! P.S. If your loking to buy OPI, check out their site online to get a really good look at their colors, or use Google, put in the OPI color in the search bar, click on images an serch, you will get tons of pictures of the color you wish to see.</li>
    <li> OPI is the only nail polish I use and is the only nail polish I will ever use. Good price from this company.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brighter red, but this is really good color for the winter and fall season. The consistency is very smooth and also very opaque. I only needed two coats. Also, it lasted at least 5 days before chipping. Since I change my polish every week, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I bought three different red polishes. One in a rich true red, a darker red ( this one ) and a red with a pink undertone. I have received two of them so far, this one and the pink tone one. I love every one of them. If you want a darker red color than this will fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed. I receive so many compliments on this nail polish! I get acrylic on my nails and the last two times I&#x27;ve had my nails filled, I&#x27;ve taken this color tp use</li>
    <li> This is about the only RED nail polish I use.  The red is a cranberry red, not too blue or orange.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment arrived in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Best color for fall I love this color I have medium skin color warm tone and it looks really good on my nails</li>
    <li> Perfect colour! Delivered in few days !</li>
    <li> Great color and price!</li>
    <li> LOVE OPI NAIL POLISH AND THIS RED IS THE BEST FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE FAIR/PINKISH UNDERTONE TO THEIR SKIN.</li>
    <li> A very nice deep, dark, red with blue undertones.. Just what I was looking for... Beautiful color for the the fall. I painted my nails with three coatings and it has been on 4 days with no chipping. I bought this color bc it reminds me of OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s BBQ\\&quot; but that is more of a deep plum red... Both are beautiful. Anyway... I&#x27;m happy to add this one to my nail polishes. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great deep red for us fair skinned gals! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Good coverage and durability, holds up well in real life situations.</li>
    <li> I just got my nails done today (9/11/12) and choose this red because it&#x27;s one of my favorite colors.

    <li> Awesome color! Went on really well. A second coat of paint is not needed to achieve the color.</li>
    <li> Bought some of these for the Wife, apparently OPI is the &#x27;crème de la crème&#x27; of nail varnishes and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Great Color and OPI is definately one of THE Best!</li>
