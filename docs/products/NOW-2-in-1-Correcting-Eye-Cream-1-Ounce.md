      <li>(besides get a good night&#x27;s sleep!).</li>
      <li>Your eyes feel great &amp; works good on the Crows Feet wrinkles too!</li>
      <li>Great eye cream, for getting them darkish circles undetected.</li>
      <li>It has a great smell, I think someone else mentioned like Fruit Loops, and I agree.  </li>
      <li>A great value for the price</li>
      <li>Best at diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>THAT is a good bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smooth, creamy, wonderful eye cream!</li>
      <li>I researched many difference formulas and am pleased to say this was an EXCELLENT CHOICE!  </li>
      <li>Otherwise you have makeup on top of caked cream, which is not too attractive.</li>
      <li>This lady is a satisfied customer &amp; am a repeat customer!</li>
      <li>Since I really love and trust Now Foods products, and had read some good reviews about their 2</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with this moisturizer and feel it is a great value for how long it lasts.</li>
      <li>I feel you HAVE to give your face a minimum of 30 days to adjust to a new product and 60 for best results.  </li>
      <li>Best eye cream so far.</li>
      <li>Very light and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this NOW line for the skin.</li>
      <li>This is a brand I can surely trust.</li>
      <li>If I see more results I will post again.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it will lighten my eyes up more.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased to say this cream does not bother me at all.  </li>
      <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>Very impressed, the amount you pay for is amazing, I was expecting a small container</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes and would purchase this again.</li>
      <li>I rarely wear makeup so that was a compliment from her : - )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>probably if I can find another parabens free eye cream.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous product that delivers results.</li>
      <li>THIS IS LIGHT AND AIRY.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is non greasy and light.</li>
      <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s parabens free, so</li>
      <li>First off, I love the smell...</li>
      <li>I just started using this cream as I am familiar with NOW products and wanted to try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are synthetic products that are stronger, but I like knowing I&#x27;m not putting as much synthetic stuff on my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes into the skin quickly and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>For a more naturally based product it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>After a month, my skin was far more supple.  </li>
      <li>have been using it for a month or so (not everyday but most of them) and I havent notice anything that blows my mind.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was so worth trying.  </li>
      <li>right in.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it does absorb very fast and has been great so far with the dry autumn weather.  </li>
      <li>I normally do not buy a separate eye product because if it is good enough for the face, I can feel it is good enough for the eyes, but got it on sale</li>
      <li>When the bottle was almost empty, I had to find more!  </li>
      <li>I use this cream pretty exclusively for under eye circles and lines.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS - Actually SAW a difference.  </li>
      <li>A real keeper!</li>
      <li>Sometimes it stays white on my skin, but I just blend it some more and it blends</li>
      <li>have become very sensitive to a lot of eye creams &amp; makeup and am changing over to more natural products.  </li>
      <li>I liked all the other NOW Foods products I bought, so I ordered the 2 in 1</li>
      <li>If you need a ton of help with lines and dark circles, you may want to go with something stronger, but for a bit of help, and a less-chemical solution, this is nice stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty decent--</li>
      <li>Using this daily and most days TWICE daily, I still have enough for probably six more months in this container.  </li>
      <li>I have no idea if really works</li>
      <li>This eye cream tightens the skin around the eye, yet is gentle.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this through Super Supplements months ago and ordered a second bottle through this vendor December 12th because I thought I was almost out.  </li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s kind of a strong smell for an eye cream, but weird me, I like it.</li>
      <li>As of right now, it lightened my eyes a little bit and it does help give more a natural look, but I still see the darkness.</li>
      <li>Correcting Eye Cream with high hopes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than any other natural eye brightener and firmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Using both daily for 10 days and after the first 5, have visible results!</li>
      <li>I have problems with many skin care products being too harsh.  </li>
      <li>It is nice and thick, but not oily, so</li>
      <li>I still haven&#x27;t opened the new bottle</li>
      <li>She immediately said mom are you using a new concealer -</li>
      <li>I did not see any difference in fine lines, puffiness, or dark circles.</li>
      <li>I am beginning to notice some fine lines and dark circles, under my eyes, and thought I needed to do something about it</li>
      <li>The skin around my delicate eye area does look firmer and brighter - this is all due to great natural ingredients like Vitamin K and Mulberry Extract.</li>
      <li>I have used many eye creams searching for one that deeply moisturized, tightened the under eye area, and reduced dark circles.</li>
      <li>but it is actually quite large as eye creams go.</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot;</li>
      <li>it really feels like it is penetrating dry skin around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>, the cream is quite thick, but it blends in easily anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used this in conjunction with a complete NOW product routine for the last 60 days.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really carry any particular smell which wouldn&#x27;t bother me anyway, but it is a thick cream, which is appropriate, I never understood eye creams that are watery and thin.</li>
      <li>My last bottle disappeared at an airport and during the two weeks it took to get more, I could see a slight difference with the small lines returning and</li>

<li> how long this stuff</li>
<li> This cream is very intensive and oddly enough smells faintly like Fruit Loops.  </li>
<li> Can not really review since contzainer was not in working order.</li>
<li> Its only been a few days</li>
<li> I am confident you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m noticing a real difference in my eyes and after having spent a small fortune on other products finally looked into less expensive alternatives.</li>
<li> BUT nothing other than using concealer took the dark away.  </li>
<li> I have dark circles and everything I have tried</li>
<li> So not worth the aggrivation</li>
<li> after using this for less than a week I could not get the product out of the pump.  </li>
<li> But it does help firm it a bit and lessen the dark circles.</li>
<li> because it&#x27;s so thick, it does take some time to fully sink into your skin, so I usually give it several minutes before adding makeup over it.</li>
<li> One little pump is all you need and because of the pump, you don&#x27;t overuse it like jar eye creams.  </li>
<li> do NOT use like anything that feels greasy or heavy on your skin.  </li>
<li> The tube that you need to get the product out of the bottle was missing and I have to dig the product out of the bottle just to use it.  </li>
<li> It feels nice not to be putting nasty and toxic acids and chemicals on my under eye area.</li>
<li> I also had a few bumps close to the corner of my eye that disappeared.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other creams costing 10 times as much and been disappointed.</li>
<li> I found this product while on a vacation trip in a small store.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how this will be in the summer</li>
<li> BUT the dark always made me feel that I looked tired.  </li>
<li> You have to at least TRY IT!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can not really review since contzainer was not in working order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes and would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot; (I&#x27;m 35) I still have the fear and signs of wrinkles setting in around my eyes.  This cream is very intensive and oddly enough smells faintly like Fruit Loops.  All in all I&#x27;m noticing a real difference in my eyes and after having spent a small fortune on other products finally looked into less expensive alternatives. I am so glad that I did.  I&#x27;m not sure how this will be in the summer but it does absorb very fast and has been great so far with the dry autumn weather.  A real keeper!</li>
    <li> I have no idea if really works but my skin likes it!</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream as I am familiar with NOW products and wanted to try. I have dark circles and everything I have tried doesnt seem to work. Its only been a few days so I don&#x27;t know if it will lighten my eyes up more. As of right now, it lightened my eyes a little bit and it does help give more a natural look, but I still see the darkness. It has ingredients in it that I can actually pronounce. I don&#x27;t like putting things on my face I dont know what it is. I would recomend this product. If I see more results I will post again.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS - Actually SAW a difference.  I normally do not buy a separate eye product because if it is good enough for the face, I can feel it is good enough for the eyes, but got it on sale and so I did.  I used this in conjunction with a complete NOW product routine for the last 60 days.  I feel you HAVE to give your face a minimum of 30 days to adjust to a new product and 60 for best results.  I used this with their CoQ 10 serum and Wrinkle Rescue Moisturizer.  MY FACE COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT use like anything that feels greasy or heavy on your skin.  THIS IS LIGHT AND AIRY.  Totally nongreasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes into the skin quickly and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had darkish circles under my eyes, or always felt they were till I realized it is just very thin skin there.  BUT nothing other than using concealer took the dark away.  The circles themselves of course stay.  That would be something for maybe injections or whatever.  BUT the dark always made me feel that I looked tired.  Well this changed THAT appearance.  My daughter noticed it probably a week into me using it.  She immediately said mom are you using a new concealer - I rarely wear makeup so that was a compliment from her : - )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, their products go a LONGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG WAY.  Using this daily and most days TWICE daily, I still have enough for probably six more months in this container.  THAT is a good bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell.  I have noticed such a difference in my eyes.  They seem brighter to people that see me often and the darkness is totally diminished with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so worth trying.  I love everything about this NOW line for the skin.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream and the results are immediatly! You can feel your skin tightening after the 1st use.Your eyes feel great &amp; works good on the Crows Feet wrinkles too! I also recommend the face cream too! Using both daily for 10 days and after the first 5, have visible results! You have to at least TRY IT! 5 stars for Now Foods and their vitamins &amp; minerals also! This lady is a satisfied customer &amp; am a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> The lotion is non greasy and light. Absorbs into skin within seconds. I&#x27;d buy again. A great value for the price</li>
    <li> I have used this for almost a year.  I noticed a brightness on the skin under my eyes within two weeks.  After a month, my skin was far more supple.  During the summer months, it was all I wore on my skin except moisturizer and sun screen.  People kept commenting about how much younger I looked and one person even said I looked &amp;#34;happier&amp;#34;!  My last bottle disappeared at an airport and during the two weeks it took to get more, I could see a slight difference with the small lines returning and the brightness definitely fading.  I researched many difference formulas and am pleased to say this was an EXCELLENT CHOICE!  I am confident you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye creams searching for one that deeply moisturized, tightened the under eye area, and reduced dark circles. I liked all the other NOW Foods products I bought, so I ordered the 2 in 1 Correcting Eye Cream with high hopes. I was not disappointed! This is a fabulous product that delivers results. I&#x27;ve used other creams costing 10 times as much and been disappointed. This is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> Smooth, creamy, wonderful eye cream!</li>
    <li> This eye cream definitely stands out, after using it for only a week it brightened my eye circles and I could see the difference! It doesn&#x27;t really carry any particular smell which wouldn&#x27;t bother me anyway, but it is a thick cream, which is appropriate, I never understood eye creams that are watery and thin. Very impressed, the amount you pay for is amazing, I was expecting a small container but it is actually quite large as eye creams go.</li>
    <li> This eye cream does not sink into the skin, it stays as a white residue all day. I did not see any difference in fine lines, puffiness, or dark circles. Therefore it is not a winner.</li>
    <li> I am beginning to notice some fine lines and dark circles, under my eyes, and thought I needed to do something about it (besides get a good night&#x27;s sleep!). Since I really love and trust Now Foods products, and had read some good reviews about their 2 In 1 Correcting Eye Cream, I thought \\&quot;what the heck.\\&quot; I must say, I am already beginning to notice a difference. The skin around my delicate eye area does look firmer and brighter - this is all due to great natural ingredients like Vitamin K and Mulberry Extract. It feels nice not to be putting nasty and toxic acids and chemicals on my under eye area. This is a brand I can surely trust.</li>
    <li> The tube that you need to get the product out of the bottle was missing and I have to dig the product out of the bottle just to use it.  Such a hassle.</li>
    <li> I use this cream pretty exclusively for under eye circles and lines. It&#x27;s pretty decent--because it&#x27;s so thick, it does take some time to fully sink into your skin, so I usually give it several minutes before adding makeup over it. Otherwise you have makeup on top of caked cream, which is not too attractive. But it does help firm it a bit and lessen the dark circles. For a more naturally based product it&#x27;s not bad. I&#x27;m sure there are synthetic products that are stronger, but I like knowing I&#x27;m not putting as much synthetic stuff on my skin. If you need a ton of help with lines and dark circles, you may want to go with something stronger, but for a bit of help, and a less-chemical solution, this is nice stuff. It&#x27;s better than any other natural eye brightener and firmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> First off, I love the smell... It smells like oranges, I think it&#x27;s kind of a strong smell for an eye cream, but weird me, I like it. I also like the packaging even though it&#x27;s unnecesarily bulky. Oh, and it&#x27;s parabens free, so yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the formulation, the cream is quite thick, but it blends in easily anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a month or so (not everyday but most of them) and I havent notice anything that blows my mind. So I&#x27;ll say I dont have a problem using it but I wont buy it again probably if I can find another parabens free eye cream.</li>
    <li> I first bought this through Super Supplements months ago and ordered a second bottle through this vendor December 12th because I thought I was almost out.  I still haven&#x27;t opened the new bottle and it&#x27;s almost March, just to let you know how long this stuff lasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have become very sensitive to a lot of eye creams &amp; makeup and am changing over to more natural products.  I am pleased to say this cream does not bother me at all.  It has a great smell, I think someone else mentioned like Fruit Loops, and I agree.  It is nice and thick, but not oily, so it really feels like it is penetrating dry skin around my eyes.  Sometimes it stays white on my skin, but I just blend it some more and it blends right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with this moisturizer and feel it is a great value for how long it lasts. One little pump is all you need and because of the pump, you don&#x27;t overuse it like jar eye creams.  I will definitely continue using this and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream so far. Best at diminishing fine lines and wrinkles. I also had a few bumps close to the corner of my eye that disappeared. Good stuff!!!</li>
    <li> after using this for less than a week I could not get the product out of the pump.  When I opened it the stem that is supposed to be attached to the pump was not there. So in order to use this  you need to open the container and pound it on your hand until the product comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So not worth the aggrivation</li>
    <li> I found this product while on a vacation trip in a small store.  When the bottle was almost empty, I had to find more!  This eye cream tightens the skin around the eye, yet is gentle.  I have problems with many skin care products being too harsh.  This one is the perfect combination of results and gentleness.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream, for getting them darkish circles undetected. Very light and not greasy at all. Truly has lifted my sacks</li>
