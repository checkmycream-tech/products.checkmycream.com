### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product was GREAT!!</li>
      <li>:-D</li>
      <li>It is great alternative to Panoxyl that he loves.  </li>
      <li>This product works just as good as Pan-oxyl</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s looking good</li>
      <li>Yes it work, it clean up my acne in two weeks love de best</li>
      <li>I want to be fair and say that I have not used this product more than 2-3 times.  </li>
      <li>This is a better, cheaper alternative.</li>
      <li>Bought for my brother, noticed his skin got better in a week.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>My son uses it for his teenage acne and he tells me he sees a great deal of improvement when he uses the wash.</li>
      <li>Overall its great.  </li>
      <li>I am super allergic and cant use regular soap on my face and this product works great</li>
      <li>Just make sure you peel the sticker off first before using it in the shower or it&#x27;ll start coming off over time as water gets on the bottle.</li>
      <li>Regardless, it still works great to keep my oily-prone skin dry and pores clean.</li>
      <li>The price is right too!</li>
      <li>I was prescribed it because I have folliculits on my chest &amp; it has helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>I was able to order this prescription strength bottle online, same size, and same great value.</li>
      <li>(Get real people!!)</li>
      <li>This stuff works wonders on my adult acne (the same as my friggin adolescent acne, lol).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather like a traditional body wash, but it is effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i was once like you unsure of this product and if its worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried to get more a month later</li>
      <li>Uses it for his back and face but like ProActive, your skin gets use to the wash, so it works more effectively when its used with every other week or so.</li>
      <li>One thing to be careful about is that it is only 5oz while most bottles in the store are 8oz, however the price of the 5oz makes it a better deal than what I would pay in the stores here.</li>
      <li>It actually seemed to work better if I just applied it directly to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was a great buy because purchasing it from a Dermatologist is expensive.</li>
      <li>It really helps clear you up.</li>
      <li>Pan oxyl is being sold in stores again at normal pricing, so for all you people trying to sell it on amazon at 300 times the price, the party is over.</li>
      <li>Could I just mix it with some normal body wash and have it compliment it?</li>
      <li>and I dont get any new break outs.</li>
      <li>and it works exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>Ordered this product because it&#x27;s what I usually buy at the pharmacy (following doctor&#x27;s orders)  It arrived quickly and works fine.  </li>
      <li>I realized a couple of weeks later that the same concentration of benzoyl peroxide is now available on shelf products (no more hassle trying to explain what I need to the ladies at the pharmacy window or special ordering for me)</li>
      <li>Great option for those who are unable to locate the brand name wash currently.</li>
      <li>Not only was the service fast</li>
      <li>but it was much cheaper than I have found in stores locally.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent replacement if for some reason you don&#x27;t have Google and can&#x27;t find a deal like I just described, but it&#x27;s definitely an inferior product.</li>
      <li>This product reminded me of something that was called Phis-o-hex back in the 60&#x27;s, which was mainly just a cleansing scrub.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually MORE EXPENSIVE than Pan Oxyl foaming wash (I just bought 6 tubes of Pan Oxyl from another vendor for $50, free shipping/no tax) and it takes at least twice as much to create the same amount of suds.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is the only over the counter acne wash that has worked for me! I&#x27;m placing a reorder now, just in case I need some in the future.</li>
    <li> Yes it work, it clean up my acne in two weeks love de best</li>
    <li> this was prescribed to me by my dermotologist. Unfortunately we moved and switched jobs. No skin guy and no great insurance to afford another. I was able to order this prescription strength bottle online, same size, and same great value. This stuff works wonders on my adult acne (the same as my friggin adolescent acne, lol). Amazon.com always delivers on time.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy because purchasing it from a Dermatologist is expensive.</li>
    <li> If you have acne, you need this.  It really helps clear you up.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my prescribed wash had finished. This product is a knock off from the benzoyl peroxide prescription.  It is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I used to have severe acne issues and been using this product, starting from 5%; now that my skin is used to the formula, I had to increase the concentration.  It&#x27;ll dry your skin for a couple weeks so use it once a day or every other day.  I spent thousands of dollars on brand name products and even Proactive, but nothing works like this.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product because it&#x27;s what I usually buy at the pharmacy (following doctor&#x27;s orders)  It arrived quickly and works fine.  I realized a couple of weeks later that the same concentration of benzoyl peroxide is now available on shelf products (no more hassle trying to explain what I need to the ladies at the pharmacy window or special ordering for me)</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Panoxyl for my acne...when I got to the pharmacy they didn&#x27;t have it so the gave me this instead.  I tried to get more a month later but it was backordered so I ordered from Amazon.  Overall its great.  Just make sure you peel the sticker off first before using it in the shower or it&#x27;ll start coming off over time as water gets on the bottle.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product. the only thing that works for my acne. my search for this is over. going to keep ordering from amazon</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was prescribed it because I have folliculits on my chest &amp; it has helped tremendously. I use it to was my face also!! :-D</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day and my face is on its way to rehabilitation. it&#x27;s looking good</li>
    <li> We have been unable to source Panoxyl or any other type of wash containing Benzoyl Peroxide for some time in the UK so decided to try this. Seems to have the same effect as Panoxyl so far.&lt;br /&gt;Have given five stars because it arrived within the quoted timescale and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement would be if it was stocked in UK then it would be quicker delivery and cheaper shipping.</li>
    <li> Bought for my brother, noticed his skin got better in a week. Uses it for his back and face but like ProActive, your skin gets use to the wash, so it works more effectively when its used with every other week or so.</li>
    <li> Within a three days I noticed that all of the acne on my back was decreasing and by the end of the second week I had no visible pimples on my shoulders or back.  It doesn&#x27;t lather like a traditional body wash, but it is effective.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a generic to a product labeled Panoxyl. This product did not resemble the brand named product in the least. This product reminded me of something that was called Phis-o-hex back in the 60&#x27;s, which was mainly just a cleansing scrub.</li>
    <li> This product was GREAT!! During the pan oxyl shortage, when a bar of the stuff was being sold on amazon for 20 bucks a bar????????? (Get real people!!) This is a better, cheaper alternative. FYI. Pan oxyl is being sold in stores again at normal pricing, so for all you people trying to sell it on amazon at 300 times the price, the party is over.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase Panoxyl for years for our teenage son.  Recently, they abruptly discontinued their line and no one else sold an equivalent line.  I searched and found this product and it works exactly the same.  It is great alternative to Panoxyl that he loves.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was given a prescription for this item earlier this year, and when I went to get it refilled, I was told it is now an &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; item. It can get expensive. While the packaging is the same from the prescription wash, the product differs slightly in that it has a grainy texture. Regardless, it still works great to keep my oily-prone skin dry and pores clean. The price is right too!</li>
    <li> I ordered the wash for my son on Thursday and received it on Saturday well packaged. Not only was the service fast but it was much cheaper than I have found in stores locally. One thing to be careful about is that it is only 5oz while most bottles in the store are 8oz, however the price of the 5oz makes it a better deal than what I would pay in the stores here. My son uses it for his teenage acne and he tells me he sees a great deal of improvement when he uses the wash.</li>
    <li> This product works just as good as Pan-oxyl which is the brand I was using before the company discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I want to be fair and say that I have not used this product more than 2-3 times.  I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of the product or the results it produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this product was difficult to use as a body wash, which is what planned to use it as.  It doesn&#x27;t latter and you have to use a lot to cover your body.  It actually seemed to work better if I just applied it directly to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can anyone of you explain how I would use it as a body wash?  I&#x27;d like to give it another chance, but its really hard to apply it evenly.  Could I just mix it with some normal body wash and have it compliment it?</li>
    <li> im 17 and i have sever acne let me tell you&lt;br /&gt;let me just say that this product within a month has eradicated all acne&lt;br /&gt;literally this is nuclear war fare however its for acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was once like you unsure of this product and if its worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is</li>
    <li> I am super allergic and cant use regular soap on my face and this product works great its been three months and I dont get any new break outs.</li>
    <li> Great option for those who are unable to locate the brand name wash currently. Item appears to work the same.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used this product before, but in the past we purchased it from our local pharmacy. This product came in an 8 ounce bottle.  Since no size was mentioned in the description and since the price was comparable to similar 8 oz. products offered on Amazon, this is what I expected to receive.  When my package arrived, I ordered two bottles, each bottle was only 5 ounces.  While I like the product, the cost was rather high for such a small bottle.  How disappointing.</li>
    <li> Simply put:  NO WAY.  It&#x27;s actually MORE EXPENSIVE than Pan Oxyl foaming wash (I just bought 6 tubes of Pan Oxyl from another vendor for $50, free shipping/no tax) and it takes at least twice as much to create the same amount of suds.  It&#x27;s a decent replacement if for some reason you don&#x27;t have Google and can&#x27;t find a deal like I just described, but it&#x27;s definitely an inferior product.</li>
