      <li>Easy to fill</li>
      <li>Easy to fill and no leaks.</li>
      <li>Works just fine for carrier oil and lavender use.</li>
      <li>Filled mine with caster oil</li>
      <li>I made homemade mascara and these empty containers worked great</li>
      <li>Tried to unscrew it and the whole top snapped off.  </li>

      <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
      <li>The thing is, it was pretty difficult to pour castor oil into them, i still haven&#x27;t figured out the best way to go about it.</li>
      <li>These are terrific for many uses.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic, very high quality and professional looking!  </li>
      <li>these are good quality, and i like that it has the little black plastic thing u stick in the top after its full, so when you pull the brush out it doesn&#x27;t have excess on it.</li>
      <li>* the photo may seem like you get one straight tube and one curved tube, but mine were identical.</li>
      <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t really give your lashes any volume.</li>

      <li>I keep my natural oils and apply same to my lashes at night.</li>
      <li>Nice containers but seal piece is really tight and doesn&#x27;t let hardly any mascara come through</li>
      <li>I had been using a dark bottle, inserting a lash wand then applying, these have make the process so much easier.</li>
      <li>Exactly as shown &amp; came within a few days</li>
      <li>Though I found the hole a bit small to pour my oils; It took a long time for it to fill up and ended up kind of messy.</li>
      <li>They were exceptionally hard to fill and the top was so tight that when you pulled the wand out it took all the mascara off of it.</li>

    <li> question don&#x27;t apply to product. But the bottles were just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed it!</li>
    <li> These are terrific for many uses.</li>
    <li> Does the job...I use a 5 ml syringe to fill</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used yet but they look great!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my diy essential oil eyebrow &amp; lash serum and it is perfect. Just fill and go. you might want to get a little funnel if you will be filling a lot since the hole is small.</li>
    <li> I bought these to put my own vitamins and minerals in. They were the perfect size.</li>
    <li> Great bottles for mascara, although the questions for the review certainly dont apply</li>
    <li> These are fantastic, very high quality and professional looking!  I use them for castor oil eyelash treatments ~ perfect! I only wish they sold them in larger quantities so I could share them with friends.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Wish I could find these in stores</li>
    <li> There is no product in these, so I don&#x27;t know why there are questions referring to that, but anyway, I use these containers to make my own mascara. They were exceptionally hard to fill and the top was so tight that when you pulled the wand out it took all the mascara off of it. Definitely won&#x27;t be getting these again.</li>

    <li> works great for my homemade eyelash serum!</li>

    <li> These are great. I filled mine with pure castor oil for my eyelashes. Easy to fill and no leaks.</li>
    <li> I finally made my mascara.  It took me awhile getting in the mascara container.  I go to use it and the container broke.  I am not happy about this.....I will be trying a different company.</li>
    <li> Empty containers...as described.  thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> These mascara tubes were easy to fill and they are very nice to use with my own recipe!</li>
    <li> Will purchase again. I made a bunch of castor oil with vitamin E &amp;#34; treatments&amp;#34; to apply at night. I shared them with family of course...and i love it. And it obvisouly will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Mix up night time blends in these.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for a oil mixture for my eyelashes and eyebrows, they came as expected and right on time.</li>
    <li> I received 2 empty vials.  I assumed the mascara was commin separately, but I have seen nothing.  Received package almost two weeks ago.  Have seen no other package. I have no use for two empty vials. Haven&#x27;t been able to find a phone number to call.  Please advise.&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe Elliott.</li>
    <li> these are good quality, and i like that it has the little black plastic thing u stick in the top after its full, so when you pull the brush out it doesn&#x27;t have excess on it. The thing is, it was pretty difficult to pour castor oil into them, i still haven&#x27;t figured out the best way to go about it. Maybe the containers are too narrow, or maybe I&#x27;m just not resourceful.</li>
    <li> Came with two hard plastic tubes, two brushes, and two rubber inserts. I needed something to put my homemade lash serum in that didn&#x27;t leak and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my DIY eyebrow serum!</li>
    <li> These are empty bottles I use to make my long lash formula. The brush is a nice size and the tubs hold a great deal of liquid. I keep my natural oils and apply same to my lashes at night. They work wonderfully.</li>

    <li> as advertised, these are empty tubes, there is no product in them. I plan on making my own mascara</li>
    <li> These work perfectly!  I make my own mascara and these were easy to fill and the brush does not clump.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown &amp; came within a few days</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and product was as specified.  It is very hard to get mascara into tubes you need a VERY small funnel.</li>
    <li> First tube broke the first time I used it. Tried to unscrew it and the whole top snapped off.  Hoping the 2nd one last.  Don&#x27;t thing I would order these again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working for what I wanted it for, but I think it may have a crack in it and is leaking.</li>
    <li> These are pretty great. My only complaint is that the wand bristles are really separated and not very pliable.</li>
    <li> Very nice for home made mascara:)</li>
    <li> These are really nice and just as described.  Perfect for my homemade mascara, it makes it look so professional!  My favorite recipe is one I found on You Tube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g_uztxWm-Fg).</li>
    <li> came as described, quick delivery</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t really give your lashes any volume.</li>
    <li> Used to make DIY eyelash serum.  Appears to be good quality and does not seem to leak.</li>
    <li> Great mascara tubes. I make my own and these are perfect.</li>
    <li> As expected. Two plastic mascara tubes, both identical. I fill them with oil to put on my lashes and brows at night.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my castor, lavender &amp; almond oil concoction to help eyelash/eyebrow growth. It works absolutely perfect for what I&#x27;m using it for! The little black inserts for the top help get all the excess oil off the brush, and I love that part. It prevents gobs of oil getting in your eyes. These are the perfect thing to execute my concoction :) I will note, that the black insert is wonderful to take the excess oil off the brush, but may not work well if you&#x27;re using these for mascara. Also, when I went to clean the tube to refill, I pryed the black top insert out with a pair of tweezers, which worked easily enough. Then I put a little soap &amp; water in it &amp; shook if up then dryed with qtips. Just refilled for a second time!  * the photo may seem like you get one straight tube and one curved tube, but mine were identical. No problem though, they are both lovely!</li>
    <li> .. i use these to apply castor oil to my lashes and the brush is of quality..</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I use them to apply castor oil to my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> These arrived on time and in tact. I use this for an organic oil mixture I use on my brows and lashes and I am generally pleased. There is a slight amount of my oil that leaks on the screw section of the product, but that may be because I am using this for oil and not mascara. A swipe with my finger or a tissue every now and then takes care of the issue. I have made this oil for others and would purchase from here again. The clear bottle is also quite helpful is see in how much is left in the tube.</li>
    <li> Works just fine for carrier oil and lavender use.</li>
    <li> The tube made it difficult to load the mascara. I would also like a different brush.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for making my own mascara.</li>
    <li> I love these! I use them for my eyelash homemade serums!</li>
    <li> These work perfect for my homemade eyelash serum. Easy to fill and they seal tight to prevent any liquids from leaking out. I would definitely recommend this product. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought these for a lash serum and works great. The bottle is a little different than pictured but I actually like it better.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. I made homemade mascara and these empty containers worked great</li>
    <li> Great for what I need them for!</li>
    <li> Got these for essential oils for my lashes, they work very well.</li>
    <li> I bought these empty mascaras because I wanted to do a home made lashes serum. I received them in perfect condition and they work well. Though I found the hole a bit small to pour my oils; It took a long time for it to fill up and ended up kind of messy. Otherwise, great mascara!</li>
    <li> very nice.  thank you :)</li>
    <li> Great for my &amp;#34;eyelash growth&amp;#34; concoction--castor oil and vitamin E! I needed to make one for my travel kit so I ordered these mascara bottles. Works perfectly!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice clean empty mascara tubes. I use them for essential oil treatments to make my eyebrows and eyelashes healthy.</li>
    <li> These are great.. I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
    <li> The brush is bending after a couple of weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Nice containers but seal piece is really tight and doesn&#x27;t let hardly any mascara come through</li>
    <li> Works well...made my mascara and using it daily to apply!</li>
    <li> Great and easy product. Filled mine with caster oil and I apply nighly to my lashes and brows. Olive oil is another way to grow lashes and brows.</li>
    <li> Great for what I needed to use them for.</li>
    <li> I love this! I made my own eyelash treatment and I have one in my bathroom and the other one in my purse.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
