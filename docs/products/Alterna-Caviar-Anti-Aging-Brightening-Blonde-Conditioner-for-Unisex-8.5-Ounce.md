      <li>and I love the body it gives !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using alterna for years, and it is by far the best shampoo and conditioner on the market today.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST color correcting conditioner I&#x27;ve use in all 36 years of being a blonde !!</li>
      <li>my hair is so silky and healthy that it&#x27;s falls out of my ponytail.</li>
      <li>I love all the products of alterna, use them for more than 2 years.</li>
      <li>I use this product normally and it&#x27;s a great match</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo I have found since my hair has turned grey.  </li>
      <li>Definitely the best shampoo for color treated/ bleached hair smells great leaving hair younger looking, seems to repair damage from styling and chemicals</li>
      <li>Alterna is such a great brand</li>
      <li>This gets rid of all my tangles leaving my hair with a smooth, sleek finish.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost because it works!</li>
      <li>smells great, a good product for blonde hair but the shampoo is drying and the conditioner not very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Would never pay full price</li>
      <li>and I absolutely loved this after highlighting recently.</li>
      <li>It bottle leaked a bit but other than that I as happy with the product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good conditioner and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair!</li>
      <li>I love the Alterna shampoo/conditioner series because they are free from the usual harmful chemicals, so my hair always feels super soft and healthy after using it.</li>
      <li>ti the same quality as the versions I buy at my salon, which costs $15 more per bottle.  </li>
      <li>Like the caviar blue shampoo, a great product; however I don&#x27;t think it necessary to use every shampoo, perhaps every other time to make doubly sure the brass is kept at bay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Alterna hair care products for well over a decade now, and I&#x27;m just delighted with how this brings out the blonde of my color job.  </li>
      <li>However, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a color change, my hair is still a brassy blonde color, but my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten any brassier so maybe it&#x27;s preventing it from changing any more.</li>
      <li>Really like this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Changes the texture of my hair to soft moisturizerized hair!</li>
      <li>previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
      <li>Being over 30, I needed something to help my thin hair from breaking, tangling, and feeling like straw; using Alterna has assured that my hair is long and beautiful everyday.</li>

    <li> Really like this conditioner. It smells excellent and the biggest difference is that it&#x27;s a purple conditioner. I have used purple shampoos but have not used a purple conditioner prior to this one. I bought both together and my hair was softer and had less frizz. I have thin hair so I used less than what others may use on a daily basis and it did not weigh my hair down. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best shampoo for color treated/ bleached hair smells great leaving hair younger looking, seems to repair damage from styling and chemicals</li>
    <li> Anything you buy of this product line is going to be amazing! The down fall is my hair is so silky and healthy that it&#x27;s falls out of my ponytail. LOVE IT!</li>

    <li> This line deftinitley lives up to it&#x27;s branding. You actually feel and see your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I would change is the packaging from Alterna.</li>
    <li> Alterna is such a great brand and I absolutely loved this after highlighting recently. It brings moisture to my color treated and dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love all the products of alterna, use them for more than 2 years. previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have found since my hair has turned grey.  It makeshift hair look silver and I love the body it gives !</li>

All in all it&#x27;s a good conditioner and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST color correcting conditioner I&#x27;ve use in all 36 years of being a blonde !! If you want the best results use with its sister shampoo. As always, found it on the ULTA site...then went to Amazon and got it faster, and NO shipping  charge because I&#x27;m an Amazon Prime member</li>
    <li> Purchased this for the second time. I have silver hair and when using this product I never have to worry about dull hair.  Always leaves my hair shiny.  Would definitely recommend this product if you have any silver in your hair.</li>
    <li> smells great, a good product for blonde hair but the shampoo is drying and the conditioner not very moisturizing. I would not purchase again</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Would never pay full price</li>
