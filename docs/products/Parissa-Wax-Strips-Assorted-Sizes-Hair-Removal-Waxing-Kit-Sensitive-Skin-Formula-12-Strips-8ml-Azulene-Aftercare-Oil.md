### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I know from eperience that it works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>I have been very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>good to have these handy.</li>
      <li>these were a great price, good product and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used my hands or a hair dryer to warm the strips</li>
      <li>Before I separate the strip, I rub it between my hands a bit to warm the wax.</li>
      <li>The wax does soften in your hands when you rub them before and seems to adhere better to the hairs.  </li>
      <li>These sensitive strips are wonderful though because they are so easy to use, if you do by chance make a mess, you can easily clean it with the Azulene oil, and best of all, almost NO irritation!</li>
      <li>The combination of the sensitive strips and the calming Azulene oil is great and it&#x27;s a combination</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>like I did at first, it won&#x27;t remove hair effectively.  </li>
      <li>Most were not really all that great.</li>
      <li>I used these on me and it was amazing how fast and how well these worked.</li>
      <li>really just warm them between your hands, peel the strips apart, press onto the skin, and pull off.  </li>
      <li>Parissa is extremely easy to use and she likes that the wax strips are clear.  </li>
      <li>I gave it 2 stars because it came on time, and exactly as promised online.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I should have gone with the more traditional wax and separate strips.</li>
      <li>The only reason she did not give it five stars was because the strip doesn&#x27;t work all that well when you use it more than once.  </li>
      <li>I did get better the more I used but overall not as easy as I was hoping for what looks like such a simple product.</li>
      <li>Of course, we all wash the area to be waxed and make sure it is completely dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried these type of wax strips before and as a novice user didn&#x27;t have much luck getting them to work.</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d known about this brand much sooner.</li>
      <li>Might sound like a lot, but it goes pretty fast and is worth it for me because my skin has had a reaction to other waxing products (red and itchy).</li>
      <li>After I smooth it on the area to be waxed, I rub an ice cube on the strip, dry the water off, then remove.</li>
      <li>Some hair would come off but overall it left more than it took.  </li>
      <li>I like these strips better than the clear wax strips of this and other brands.  </li>
      <li>Out of all Parissa products (or just waxing products in general), this is by-far my absolute favourite!</li>
      <li>We all have different skin types, and a product that works for one person may not be right for someone else.</li>
      <li>Problem is, I also have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>You really have to press them on; if you don&#x27;t use enough pressure to press it onto the hair</li>
      <li>DO NOT waste your money.  </li>
      <li>I plan on keeping these around for the sensitive area waxes.</li>
      <li>These are fairly easy to use, work well (not perfect), and are definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Barely adhered to skin</li>
      <li>If I had to sum it up, these wax strips worked better than tape, but worse than a proper professional waxing.</li>
      <li>Leaves behind more hair than it takes.</li>
      <li>I used a hairdryer to heat up the wax strips instead of my hands, as suggested by other reviews here, and that worked very well.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes this wax because it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt as much as other products.</li>
      <li>I find it easiest to cut the large strips in half.  </li>
      <li>That said, I managed to get about half the hairs I wanted to come off, and the rest refused to budge--so much so that I had to shave.</li>

<li> Does not work and leaves wax on your skin that is difficult to remove.  </li>

    <li> No pain, but they hardly work at all. Leaves behind more hair than it takes. So dissapointed...will not be purchasing again.</li>

    <li> I wanted to save some money and tried these strips.  But I was sorely disappointed. They don&#x27;t work and only left sticky wax on my skin. I&#x27;m going back to my esthetician.</li>
    <li> Barely adhered to skin</li>
    <li> Out of all Parissa products (or just waxing products in general), this is by-far my absolute favourite! I&#x27;m Persian and therefore have dark, quite coarse hair, especially on my face. Problem is, I also have sensitive skin so waxing usually irritates my cheeks and I break out. These sensitive strips are wonderful though because they are so easy to use, if you do by chance make a mess, you can easily clean it with the Azulene oil, and best of all, almost NO irritation! The combination of the sensitive strips and the calming Azulene oil is great and it&#x27;s a combination I use weekly so I know from eperience that it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. (I just do my face - not legs or bikini.) I have been very happy with this product. It took me a few tries to get a handle on using these - at first, I had all of the issues that people have cited in their reviews. Of course, we all wash the area to be waxed and make sure it is completely dry. Before I separate the strip, I rub it between my hands a bit to warm the wax. I cut it to size and then separate. After I smooth it on the area to be waxed, I rub an ice cube on the strip, dry the water off, then remove. If there is a little wax left on my skin, I use the unwaxed side of the strip to dab off the extra wax. The ice really cuts down on any remaining wax - often, I have none or just a small spot or two.  Hope these suggestions work for you. Might sound like a lot, but it goes pretty fast and is worth it for me because my skin has had a reaction to other waxing products (red and itchy). We all have different skin types, and a product that works for one person may not be right for someone else.</li>
    <li> So upon opening the package, I was surprised at how small the \\&quot;large\\&quot; strips were. I would say there are enough for facial waxing and/or underarms and bikini. Not enough for legs. I used a hairdryer to heat up the wax strips instead of my hands, as suggested by other reviews here, and that worked very well. The bikini line could be done with ease. I then tried it on my armpits, and that was a disaster; did not work at all, even though the hair was long enough and I followed the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Recommend for facial hair and bikini line, especially for touch ups.</li>
    <li> Does not work and leaves wax on your skin that is difficult to remove.  DO NOT waste your money.  Totally useless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought wax strips for myself before even though I have had others give me some to try out.Most were not really all that great. I used these on me and it was amazing how fast and how well these worked. I wish I&#x27;d known about this brand much sooner. A definite thumbs up.</li>
    <li> These are fairly easy to use, work well (not perfect), and are definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really just warm them between your hands, peel the strips apart, press onto the skin, and pull off.  As a beginner and first time waxer, it took a few tries to figure it out.  You really have to press them on; if you don&#x27;t use enough pressure to press it onto the hair like I did at first, it won&#x27;t remove hair effectively.  For me, this removes about 80% of the hairs.  It leaves some behind which I tweeze off after.  I&#x27;ve used this product on underarms and bikini area and continue to use it like once/month.  I find it easiest to cut the large strips in half.  I&#x27;ve used my hands or a hair dryer to warm the strips and I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions on the box, looked online for tips, but still the strips left patches of hair. I ended up shaving anyways. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. Perhaps I should have gone with the more traditional wax and separate strips. I gave it 2 stars because it came on time, and exactly as promised online.</li>
    <li> these were a great price, good product and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this wax because it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt as much as other products. She used to only used Nads, but switched to Parissa after she was disappointed in the thick and sticky mess that Nads started to leave behind.  Parissa is extremely easy to use and she likes that the wax strips are clear.  The only reason she did not give it five stars was because the strip doesn&#x27;t work all that well when you use it more than once.  However, it does not leave a weird film or wax residue behind, and the oil included is a bonus.</li>
