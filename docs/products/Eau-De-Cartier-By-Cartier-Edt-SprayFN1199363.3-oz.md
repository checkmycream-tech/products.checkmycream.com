    <li> Smells awesome.  Light masculine scent that gets compliments from many people</li>
    <li> To me, this one is a knock-off. I used recently eau de cartier and I decided to go for my second bottle but oh surprise...this one does not smell like my previous one and it lasts very little. Cartier is a brand name! This version of the perfume does not seem to be a Cartier one.</li>
    <li> The perfume is totally awesome very centric&#x27;s</li>
    <li> BEST PERFUME EVER! MERCI MONSIEUR CARTIER! WHAT WOULD THE WORLD DO WITHOUT THE FRENCH DREAM MAKERS, KINGS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND GORGEOUS SCENTS!</li>
    <li> My nephew came to visit and had this cologne. My son loved it so much, he used it. Christmas came and I decided to get him a new bottle. In Macy&#x27;s it was a lot more. I saved a ton of money and got the same product on Amazon. It is the genuine version. Cartier!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with that cologne back in 2006, and I can&#x27;t help loving the cologne, my girlfriend loves it too. That&#x27;s what really matters to me. Excellent s&amp;h btw.</li>

    <li> Great scent with Oud wood and lavender footnotes! Shipping could have been a little faster, took a week.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite perfume! It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every penny; it&#x27;s got a fresh, different kind of smell. Very vibrant and refreshing! I must use a spray of it every time I walk out the door!</li>
    <li> very good from cartier, great unisex scent, soft and clean, great for casual use around the office or around the house &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is a favorite. it  was for a gift.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I wanted! Smells so fresh with a hint of citrus.</li>
    <li> nice and original in sealed box</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Very light, citrus-y.  Not over powering at all.  And what a great value from Amazon.  Best price around by far!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake I don&#x27;t like it. Feels like I waste my money. you can&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
    <li> es uno de los mejores perfumes, excelente aroma, excelente precio, se los recomiendo, les recomiendo este producto.&lt;br /&gt;fueron responsables en la entrega en buen tiempo</li>
    <li> My acceptable smell.&lt;br /&gt;My skin interacts with colognes and usually makes any perfume turn to smell like vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is the only brand which my skin doesn&#x27;t interact.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Job well done!</li>
