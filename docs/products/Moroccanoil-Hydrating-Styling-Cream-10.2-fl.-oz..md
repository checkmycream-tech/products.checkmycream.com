      <li>Shih Tzu fur feeling amazingly soft and leaves the dog smelling fantastic.</li>
      <li>My hair does not get fly away and it does not get dried out and frizz on the ends!!</li>
      <li>I am able to actually put my hair down (after having it in a pony tail) and my hair still looks nice.</li>
      <li>For All Hair Types 10.2 oz and got intense curl cream.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Not the real deal at all.  </li>
      <li>and I would diffinetly recommend it to others, but buy it from professional salon!!!</li>
      <li>This product completely transforms my fine, limp, frizzy hair to shiny, lustrous and seemingly thicker head of hair that I barely recognize as my own.</li>
      <li>Use it with a combination of other Morroccan Oil products; completely satisfied.</li>

      <li>Makes your hair manageable, not heavy.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product had been recommended to me.  </li>
      <li>It helps keep it tame, soft, smooth, and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I like it especially in the dry, winter months when my hair gets static and very dry.</li>
      <li>I put a few pats in my hand and rub it lightly after I blow dry my hair, so this could be why it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate frizz.  </li>
      <li>With naturally curly hair, this is the ONLY product I will use on it.  </li>
      <li>I am a young senior, and Moroccanoil brings back the color and shine to my hair.</li>
      <li>It works well if I blow dry or leave it wet to air dry, and it was a fabulous price.</li>

    <li> arrived quickly - no problems</li>
    <li> excellent , i bought it again</li>
    <li> A very little goes a long way.  I can&#x27;t say that it totally eliminates frizz, but I also don&#x27;t use it on wet hair.  I put a few pats in my hand and rub it lightly after I blow dry my hair, so this could be why it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate frizz.  I like it especially in the dry, winter months when my hair gets static and very dry.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> Great hair cream. Works great is not greasy. Washes out easily. lasts all day. Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair products.  It was recommended to me by hairstylist and it works magic on my hair.  All you need is just a tiny size drop to do medium hair.  It helps keep it tame, soft, smooth, and shiny.  I usually start from the ends of my hair, then apply at the root so it won&#x27;t come out too greasy. Trust me, less is more with this if you have fine hair like I do.  I apply it, then blow dry my hair.  Love it! And, the smell is fantastic.  I order the again and again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product for curly hair. Not greasy and not crunchy just the right feel without frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream keeps my hair hydrated preventing fly-aways.  I am a young senior, and Moroccanoil brings back the color and shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great to tame down fuzzy hair.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I love using it and can use it every day. It works well if I blow dry or leave it wet to air dry, and it was a fabulous price. Can&#x27;t beat that. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing down those fly away hairs! I use it for my buns and ponytails.</li>
    <li> Very good product , i will recomendad!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great with a clean and light fragrance. Most importantly it leaves hair feeling moisturized and super soft and manageable.  It never feels greasy or weighs hair down. It&#x27;s great for humans but we found another surprising use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not we use this on our dogs.  My aunt told me about using it on her small dog&#x27;s coat and I thought she was pulling my leg. It really does work great on dogs! I know this isn&#x27;t the intended use and I recommend checking with your veterinarian before applying to your pets.  That being said, I can definitely confirm this cream leaves Shih Tzu fur feeling amazingly soft and leaves the dog smelling fantastic. We simply wash, towel dry and then apply a small amount of Moroccanoil hydrating cream to the dog&#x27;s fur and work it in. Sometimes we brush it through but that&#x27;s not even necessary. This doesn&#x27;t just work on long haired dogs either.  We tried some on  a miniature pinscher and his coat was left super shiny and luxuriously soft.</li>
    <li> I loved the oil. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> Best styling cream. Makes your hair manageable, not heavy. I have semi-fine hair. When I forgot it at home, I had a harder time styling my hair. I use the hairspray to give my hair lift. Smells good too. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter at her recommendation. She loves this product!</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s from the manufacturer</li>
    <li> Super great product! So glad my hairdresser recommended it. Makes my hair soft and easily manageable.</li>
    <li> works wonderful on long hair, not greasy or oily</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she loves this product so I thought it would be a great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> Use this after every shampoo and it keeps my hair healthy especially since I perm and color!</li>
    <li> Use it with a combination of other Morroccan Oil products; completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product was NOTHING like the bottle my Daughter &amp; I got in the salon....it has no smell and the one in the salon smelled fantastic....the texture isn&#x27;t the same either....VERY unhappy...</li>
    <li> Love it!  It protects my hair from the heat of the flat iron and eliminates frizz.  I&#x27;d be lost without it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, makes my hair nice and curly, it does not make my hair oily, and it smell good.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this product. It has made such a difference in my hair, I give it as gifts. Everyone loves it &amp; it smells great. I even put it on my Maltese &amp; Yorkie after bathing &amp; it helps with tangles.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser called Moroccanoil &amp;#34;a vitamin pill for your hair.&amp;#34;  I tend to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the amazing aroma, the product never is greasy and is easily absorbed by my hair.  I will continue to use Moroccanoill for as long as I can get my hands on it...or hair!</li>
    <li> Love, love love this stuff - cannot imagine my life without it. My hair does not get fly away and it does not get dried out and frizz on the ends!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a long way. I use a pea size amount every day and a bottle lasts me almost a year. Smooths frizziness without making hair oily</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m looking for this site on internet news.&lt;br /&gt;and find it item.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m not recived the product yet, but i think that it good price.&lt;br /&gt;so i&#x27;ll buy later too.&lt;br /&gt;i like this site.</li>
    <li> This is my Holy Grail of hair products. I am very active and wash my hair frequently. I am able to actually put my hair down (after having it in a pony tail) and my hair still looks nice. This product completely transforms my fine, limp, frizzy hair to shiny, lustrous and seemingly thicker head of hair that I barely recognize as my own. I have been recieving many compliments since I started using this. Previosly, I was using It&#x27;s a 10 Spray. This is a much better product for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> We love it no mor ten gal hair</li>
    <li> Works really well for people with straight hair trying to curl their hair and have it stay.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my wife and we were really impressed with it.</li>
    <li> Was not the same quality as the product purchased in store.  Texture was thinner and scent was different. For the few dollars more it cost in store I will not buy again from amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream For All Hair Types 10.2 oz and got intense curl cream. Went to return it and it says it&#x27;s not eligible for return.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works as described.</li>
    <li> my hair is damaged from hair dye etc. this product really helps and makes it look good again! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioning/styling product.  It leaves your hair soft, silky, light and  manageable.  Once I started using this I never used another conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years &amp; I love it! I would not straighten my hair without it</li>
    <li> Great styling cream.  It leaves hair soft and smooth without being greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. It is excellent at taming my frizz and leaving my hair much softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product had been recommended to me.  What a difference it makes!  Works great for control of frizz.  Great product.</li>
    <li> But this product before at gbs this is not the same product don&#x27;t even have the smell.being buying this product for 3years I no it well</li>
    <li> I love it in my hair ! Shine and smell it very good!</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil is very good product but the one I recieved from this vendor was watery. Not sure why!</li>
    <li> Not really hydrating and the perfume smell gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> Favorite Moroccan oil product</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair. this product is to heavy for the curls</li>
    <li> My favorite hair conditioner!</li>
    <li> Yeuwww, I don&#x27;t know why but it stinks very bad, like cheap men&#x27;s cologne. I bought real stuff before from professional salon and it smelled very nice... it should have light scent to it.  Also, the texture of it doesn&#x27;t feel right either... It&#x27;s too gooey and tacky.  And also for some reason when the package arrived the trademark logo on the bottle has been scratched off. Hmmm I wonder why?&lt;br /&gt;I love Morrocanoil products and I would diffinetly recommend it to others, but buy it from professional salon!!!</li>
    <li> With naturally curly hair, this is the ONLY product I will use on it.  No more gels, mousse, or sprays.</li>
    <li> Not the real deal, it smell like Razac lotion, it smell&#x27;s really strong and Bad it made my hair cake-like, it was very clumpy, and Stuck together, I  have use this product for years and never had it made my hair feel like this. Not the real deal at all.  Totally fake.</li>
    <li> Used product many times, but this one was different. Returned</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift ---- they love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, have been using this for years and I&#x27;m sold on it. Would recommend to people needing extra moisture</li>
