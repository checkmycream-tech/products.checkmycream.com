    <li> This liquid appeared to be too thick to spray through sprayer.  Not sure what was in this bottle.  What was weird was when I switched liquid to bottle that was previously worker it quit working.</li>
    <li> This product does work and once heat is applied all stickiness dissipates. The cons for me were the presence of \\&quot;cones\\&quot; (Silicone type substances)and I wish the ingredients were listed out. This stuff also has a STRONG smell.</li>

This helps my hair be much more controllable and I can get it straighter than I ever have been able to before.  My hair tends to be dry and I get split ends very easily.

    <li> My mom used to work at a salon and she gave me a sample of this to help tame my fine, fly-away, split-endy hair. I love it! A few spritzes on the bottom half of my long hair while I&#x27;m blowdrying smoothes everything down, and a little spray over the crown of my hair to finish. Very lightweight for fine hair that is easily weighted down by product. Beats the frizzies and humidity in windy Chicago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice and both times the spray failed. The product is good, but if you can&#x27;t get it out, does not help much!</li>

    <li> This stuff is incredible. Light and makes my  hair shiny and smooth</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  It makes my hair so easy to handle and make straight.  However, it breaks my skin out.  Tough choice!</li>

    <li> This product may sting a little at first. But overall I like it. It works great. It tames flyaways and leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I loved using it, but wanted to find a lower price than my salon offered.  After one use, the spray nozzle clogged and it wouldn&#x27;t spray.  I tried transferring to another bottle and realized it wasn&#x27;t the sprayer, but the product was not quite the same as what my salon offered.  Product was super sticky and didn&#x27;t do the same as the one I bought from my salon.  I would not recomend purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She loves the product and it&#x27;s at a much cheaper price than at the salon.</li>
