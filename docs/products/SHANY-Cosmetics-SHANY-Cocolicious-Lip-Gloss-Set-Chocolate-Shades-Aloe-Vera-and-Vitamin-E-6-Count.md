<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this lip gloss after reading many reviews and I am pleased with it. It is very moist and works well. I would recommend to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that if I put a nice comment for this product; I will get a free makeup kit which I never received. Nonetheless, I liked the lip gloss though.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent my wife received it for Christmas and was ecstatic about the quality of this product. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like the colours but the colour doesnt stay when you apply it on your lips! I thought it would be more colourful upon application.</li>
    <li> Cute Colors any tone can pull them off they do last and I loved the smell of them…the chocolate color is my favorite one.</li>
    <li> Ok so this may be my fault for buying a product thinking that the chocolate was just shades. Nooo.. They actually taste like one and despite my love for anything coco, I am repulsed by these. They are too strong and too sticky. I can&#x27;t give them away fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for different chocolate shades not flavor. Doh!</li>
    <li> some of the shades are a bit weird and they taste like artificial chocolate.  The taste is gross to me.  I wish I would not have bought them.</li>
    <li> They smell exceptionally great! There is no flavor,  it isn&#x27;t sticky,  doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, superb as an everyday...constant reapply!!!</li>
    <li> Tastes like chocolate. Really creamy. Works!</li>
    <li> BEWARE- contains petroleum! This is what gasoline is made from. Highly toxic!</li>
    <li> So far this is a great product. I am African American andi have a milk chocolate skin tone. The colors in this set are ver complimentary.  The glosses are long lasting and the colors are rich and true. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product for those with medium to dark skin tones. I purchased for my sister for Christmas because she loves gloss and because of the great reviews. Some of the shades looked better on me than it did on her, so she gave me two. I discovered that the orange shade looks great on me - I would have never picked it otherwise - it actually doesn&#x27;t look as orange as it seems on the picture, but more reddish/pinkish against my tone. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like some glosses, but on the other hand, I suppose that is why you have to reapply it frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish these were sold separately because not all of the colors look great on the same skin tone, so I took away a star for that reason and because it isn&#x27;t long lasting. I&#x27;m at the point in my life where I don&#x27;t like excess stuff - I won&#x27;t buy one get two free just because, I want to use every bit of what I buy. But for someone looking to try other colors, this is a great start.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lip gloss, but the SHANY Cocolicious  Lip gloss Chocolate is the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I have all but one lip gloss collection.  I love each and every color, so much so I bought duplicates for my mother.</li>
    <li> shipped as stated wife likes them</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Three of the six colors matched my darker skin tone. The other colors I distributed amongst my three daughters, so I didn&#x27;t feel like I wasted money. It moisturizers our lips for a fair amount of time, two hours. It does have a scent which is not too overwhelming for me or my girls.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I have not used mine yet but they appear to be sticky...not sure. But I do like most of the colors for my brown skin tone.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing company which has amazing products!  This product alone is legendary in the making.  It allows the coverage of a tinted gloss with the sweet scent of chocolate.  Great job Shany!</li>
    <li> Each gloss is nice and sheer  but they are on the sticky side.  Sticky gloss can be a problem is your hair blows in the wind or if you&#x27;re kissing.  Love the chocolate fragrance</li>
    <li> My sister gave me this as a gift.  I loved them so much I bought it and gave it as a gift to my mother in law.  Now she&#x27;s hooked too.  Great product with beautiful color palette.</li>
    <li> There are so many colors and they do all go with every complexion so I was able to give my friends the ones that would look better on them.</li>
    <li> These are great lip glosses!  Good color selection and so far they&#x27;ve stayed on (surprisingly) for 7-8 hours with no annoyance.  The chocolate taste/scent is barely noticeable to me, so not an issue.  Great value!!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t sticky it highlights you natural skin tones it shows who you are not who your trying to look like just adore it</li>
    <li> I love this lip gloss.  It works well with my skin tone (dark skin tone). It&#x27;s not sticky and goes on my lips well.</li>
    <li> purchased them for my daughter nice shine and smells nice. Delivery was fast will purchase product again. This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I picked this lip gross because of the colors. When I received it I mas more than happy with the colors. They are true to the picture. Then I tried one. Oh my goodness I am in love. They go on so smoothly. Now  I have to see if you have other colors. I like bright colors for the summer. Loving them.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the flavor. I am not a fan of traditional lip stick flavor. They are a bit stickier than I would normally like but not too bad.</li>
    <li> this product was a big disappointment to me. the colors were not saturated enough on the lips, and the texture was almost like water. it had no taste or scent like chocolate either. so, I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors except for the orange...but maybe I need to learn to use it...but smell good and long lasting. I will be buying the other set also!</li>
    <li> I wish they had more colors then browns but I love it.. Hazelnut brown African American they have great color pigment . Thank you SHANY!!</li>
    <li> I picked this product because of the colors. When I received it I mas more than happy with the colors. They are true to the picture. Then I tried one. Oh my goodness I am in love, lol!!!  They go on very smoothly and does not feel sticky. The best thing is the color lasted all day.</li>
    <li> I love lip gloss and this collection is fantastic! They go on smoothly &amp; have just enough color and shine. Heavy lipstick was never my preference but the different shades in this collection mean I&#x27;ll have a use for them all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this collection. The colors are so prefect. They match my skin tone perfectly. I&#x27;m not big on make up but I&#x27;m in love with SHANY cosmetics. This was a great buy for a great cost.</li>
    <li> The aroma of chocolate is enticing. The colors are good on me and I am of fair complexion, and they seem to last. And what a bargain,6 colors at a shade under $1 for each.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this product!  Glides on smoothly - like butter baby.  A+ product.  Told my (best friend) neighbor  &amp; nieces about it.  Not too shiny and not too dull.  Ladies - the BrooklynDiva55 says - get it today!  As a woman of color these just enhance my beauty.  Will  purchasing again so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> My wife asked for these for stocking stuffers and fell in love with them the minute she opened the pack, I will definitely order more!</li>
    <li> You can not beat this for the price, great colors, flavors and it looks great when you wear it. I am more a fan of gloss then the stick and this helps to give your lips a natural shine.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product.  i like the lipsticks because of the creamer feeling and the way it makes me look.  .&lt;br /&gt;I just start using this product.  Compare to Avon these are much better.&lt;br /&gt;This product meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I will telling others to make a purchase</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this gloss--not sticky and very soft on the lips. I&#x27;d love to see some of the colors sold separately, maybe in multiples.</li>
    <li> These glosses are a very good buy and are just as good as much more expensive ones I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are nice and product does not smell nor is it sticky.</li>
    <li> Great lip gloss!! Colors are great, long-lasting, and very moisturizing.  Will definitely re-order!</li>
    <li> Like the it wisn the color was brighter</li>
    <li> Colors are neutral. Smooth and smell good</li>
    <li> I love these.  They cover well, and they smell &amp; taste like artificial chocolate.  I have a few favorite colors in the set, but overall as an olive complexion female they all work wonderfully.  The color you see in the tube is the color it looks on your lips!</li>
    <li> The Colors are beautiful the gloss is not sticky and it was priced just right. And I also loved the samples that I got along with my purchase. I highly recommend Shany Cosmetics</li>
    <li> This glosses are awesome! They are very moisturizing and non- sticky! Plus, each color is flattering and beautiful! They have shimmer, but not too much like kid lipgloss... I would have rated 5 stars, but the felt applicator sheds into the gloss a bit, which is a tad annoying but nothing I can&#x27;t deal with!</li>
    <li> Liked the colors and they look really good on but I underestimated the chocolate smell. Others may care for it, but I am not a fan.</li>
    <li> i loved it, as i m still using this product</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great quality! Smells really tasty, however the product does not last long on the lips. I do think the product is overpriced due to the gloss only lasting less than 30 min.</li>
    <li> Wife love&#x27;s them and plan&#x27;s on ordering the second set .</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift. The recipient LOVES the colors and the slight glitter effect in the lip glosses. The variety is a plus as well as the aloe vera and vitamin E ingredients. SHANY specializes in makeups for \\&quot;women of color\\&quot;; however, this can be used by all women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New shades can be possible or tested by mixing small bits of lip gloss from differnt bottles on a small piece of paper or recepticle and mixed with a toothpick, cotton swab, or finger. The attractive boxed packagine has a easy-carry handle for portability. This was a safe and fun purchase.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&amp;#34;ve seen Shany cosmetics for years on Amazon and never took the plunge....until now.  I absolutley love this lip gloss set and it smells like chocolate---very light, not overbearing.  The colors are rich, not as thick as a lipstick but a good consistency.  Also, they have packed a lot of great color choices in this package, it really goes well my with neutral make-up pallet.  Highly recommend, good price and quality -----------I think I&amp;#34;m going to buy the red/pink version of this for Xmas.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great sheen and long wearing</li>
    <li> These colors are great and the name is appropriate because these colors look hot on darker skin tones.  The smell is incredible, the colors are long lasting, provides great moisture with the right hint of sheen.  If you are a woman with fuller lips like myself, these glosses with fit you perfectly</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s exactly what they said when I gave it to my daughters...  It really smell like chocolate. They came to my room and I smell it already and I was not even close...  It give a slight tint and the lips look very nice I am even using it.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Color is rich and beautiful. All the colors I like are all packaged. I will recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s 1 color in this set that I absolutely loved, the rest was ok. There was nothing wrong with it, just not my shade.</li>
    <li> Three brown shades in the collection were great for my skin tone.  It smelled like chocolate as I put them on-wonderful.  I wish they had a little more staying power-longer lasting. These were fabulous but I wished that they had more of the colors that I liked in the collection-I liked three colors but I wish they had doubles of the colors that I liked.  Some of the colors I felt needed to be a little more there/less transparent.</li>
    <li> The colors are okay but the gloss is too runny for me. It&#x27;s probably okay for younger consumers who don&#x27;t have to worry about feathering.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of chocolate lip gloss; not only love the colors but love the feel on my lips!!</li>
    <li> I have just received my order, and I love it.  The colors of gloss are wonderful, I will order again.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love these lip glosses.  I put it on in the morning and touch up throughout the day.  It adds just a subtle tint to my lips.  I will definitely be ordering these again!</li>
    <li> Very nice colors for dark skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit too shimmery for my taste, the color doesn&#x27;t really go on you, it&#x27;s more of a shimmery lipgloss rather than one that really shows on your lips.</li>
    <li> I love these ethnically compatible colors and the prices for them! I now have a color for all my outfits and moods!!!!!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ARXDHQ/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> I purches both sets, 1 and 2 for me and my daughter. We are in love! She is a light brown and I am a dark complexed and the gloss colors are great on both of our skin tones! The quality is great! The case is nice, the individual glosses are sleek and professional looking, the brush is smooth, and it smells like yummy chocolate! The color and gloss lasts for hours! Perfect with the Shany Lip liner set. Shany is the BEST!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend. She loved the colors and thought it was a great addition to her makeup collection.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GOOD AND KEEPS LIPS LOOKING GOOD ALLDAY</li>
    <li> THIS LIPGLOSS SMELL SO GOOD AND THE PRICE IS GREAT I LOVE SHANY PRODUCTS BECAUSE THEY ARE CHEAP AND GOOD QUALITY</li>
    <li> I am very particular on how I like certain things. With that being said, every cap on each lip gloss should have had a plastic wrap. You know taper perfection . Sandra jones.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the applicator tip and the flavor or aroma of chocolate was weak at best. I am comparing this product with Chocolate Thunder. I prefer Chocolate Thunder and will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Even though there are varied shades, all the shades seem to go with my skin color. The product is long lasting and keeps my lips moist. I personally like the chocolate flavor of the lip gloss. Who doesn&#x27;t like chocolate?</li>
    <li> Wow! This gloss is awesome! Not sticky at all! Really plush applicator that allows gloss to go on really smooth. I usually must put on carmax chap stick first but not with this gloss. Only one dip is enough! They also have long lasting color. Now on to the best part........they SMELL yummy like chocolate! What a treat. Kinda sexy also for your partner. I will purchase this brand over my usual MAC gloss. Much better in my opinion not to mention the price. These are a MUST HAVE!!!</li>
