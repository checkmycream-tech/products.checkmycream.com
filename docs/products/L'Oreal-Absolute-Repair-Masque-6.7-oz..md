      <li>Love this moisture treatment.</li>
      <li>Check out cloudy apples youtube videos, and Batiste to learn more:)</li>
      <li>One of my favorite.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite product that I have now bought 5x on Amazon after trying them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this is a better product than others out there</li>
      <li>The more I used it the better the results.     </li>
      <li>This is my favorite product for my hair, I can see the difference when I use this product, used as instruction.</li>
      <li>and wow, my hair looks beautiful and healthy again.</li>
      <li>First off, let me say this is a good product.  </li>
      <li>I received this item very quickly and with no issues.</li>
      <li>Hands down, the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>My wife is using it and it is perfectly fine</li>
      <li>I find it easier to comb and tangle free.</li>
      <li>Fantastic conditioning products.</li>
      <li>Sally&#x27;s &amp; my hair feels so smooth &amp;</li>
      <li>So this product its great but not enough for my hair.</li>
      <li>It is a really good product, and the seller is completely recommended.</li>
      <li>Its worth is girls!</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;ll have more than you need at the end of the day ;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that people love to touch my hair now because it looks so soft and bouncy :)</li>
      <li>For regular maintenance, I use joico k-pak and that has kept my hair especially healthy and soft looking.  </li>
      <li>Great relief from my usually very dry hair.  </li>
      <li>Hair is soft and has a nice sheen.  </li>
      <li>The mask is marvelous, it nourishes and keeps the hair moist and it makes the hair very soft - almost as if it&#x27;s still wet</li>
      <li>I still wish it didn&#x27;t cost as much as it did, but I guess if it continues to keep my hair healthy, it will be worth it.</li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it if you have semi-wavy hair prone to frizz.</li>
      <li>Their Professional line of shampoos, conditioners and other products our excellent!</li>
      <li>Previously I was just using TRESemme shampoo/conditioner and a spray leave-in conditioner, and I think that combo worked just as great as this line of products.</li>
      <li>Shipping was really fast!!</li>
      <li>Amazon hasn&#x27;t carried this before and I am thrilled to find it here, in the stores I have never seen it for less then $37.00 which is what I paid for it, well not anymore : )    </li>
      <li>Very awesome product, but it was very hard to wait this product arrive</li>
      <li>Better than having my hair professionally done.</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey, but well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>, I had to look for help to know which post-office place was my package, because wasn&#x27;t delivered in my home  but worth the sacrifice.</li>
      <li>My hair feels very silky, much softer, and more managable after using the masque.</li>
      <li>Also decreases Frizz and keeps hair looking freshly trimmed by preventing and easing split ends</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews here I was very excited to order L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Professional Series Absolut Repair Masque (I also ordered the shampoo/conditioner.)</li>
      <li>It is concentrated so you do not have to use that much making it well worth the price!</li>
      <li>Really, while this LOreal product is good, there&#x27;s no reason to spend so much money when you can go to a local Sally Beauty supply and pick up some Kolesterol for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but only for the best !</li>
      <li>as well am glad to be able to find it on Amazon for less than exorbitant salon prices!</li>
      <li>It was these products that I used for the first time yesterday.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no effect after one use better than after a simple conditioner, and there&#x27;s no effect after using it for 2 months.</li>
      <li>but I periodically use this all over and it leaves my hair smooth and soft without an oily shine.</li>
      <li>My stylist recommeded this product, but I did not want to purchase at higher salon prices.</li>
      <li>I first tried this hair product about 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t used anything else until moving to the States.</li>
      <li>The mask was my first introduction to the L&#x27;Oreal Prefessional line</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and love it.  </li>
      <li>The jar itself is a good size even though it&#x27;s not huge</li>
      <li>I have a strong suspicion that the product I received  was not actually absolute hair repair but a cheap rash causing substitute.</li>
      <li>The Neofibrine formula feels more concentrated and using a very small amount of the product will do the work, and the Lactic Acid feels more diluted.</li>
      <li>The moment you let this stuff sit in your hair for 2 minutes (or even longer if you want) and rinse your locks in cool water, it will be sooooooooo silky and will be beyond soft.</li>
      <li>As you get older and color your hair more often, a product like absolut repair is necessary.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels more dry and dehydrated with this.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of conditioner on my roots because I tend to have more oily hair rather than dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Products works very well for my hair and provides a softening to my hair versing the harsh and dryness that it has.</li>
    <li> Very nice product to repair very quickly damage hair</li>
    <li> ex wife loved it.  appeared on doorstep as/when expected</li>
    <li> Fantastic conditioning products. I don&#x27;t use a lot of conditioner on my roots because I tend to have more oily hair rather than dry but I periodically use this all over and it leaves my hair smooth and soft without an oily shine. Also decreases Frizz and keeps hair looking freshly trimmed by preventing and easing split ends</li>
    <li> Patiently awaited my new conditioner and it came on time ! Love this product. It&#x27;s a little pricey but only for the best !</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner I have found that tames the frizz in my hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave it flat like some of the other \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; conditioners. I love it and highly recommend it if you have semi-wavy hair prone to frizz.</li>
    <li> I have medium long hair that is colored every 6-7 weeks for the past 10 years. For regular maintenance, I use joico k-pak and that has kept my hair especially healthy and soft looking.  For some reason, after my last coloring, my hair became really brittle, dry and frizzy looking at the ends and even the joico k-pak couldn&#x27;t fix it. So I tried L&#x27;oreal, because I used their coloring packages before and they contain a really great working conditioner. I tried this product after doing some searching, tried it out and wow, my hair looks beautiful and healthy again. Great stuff. At least for my hair. I am going to continue using this for extra conditioning every 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed that people love to touch my hair now because it looks so soft and bouncy :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff..&lt;br /&gt;Too bad its so pricey, wish it was cheaper. Softens hair alot! Helps restore damaged hair, try the vials of latic acid loreal ampules for hair, thats even stronger for extremely damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful stuff! I have extremely dry and frizzy hair. So that you understand how dry, I didn&#x27;t wash it for two weeks (once a week is my normal time) before I used L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Neofibrine Repairing Shampoo for Very Damaged Hair for the first time. After two weeks, my hair was starting to get some oil in it but not enough that it looked or felt dirty. It was finally controllable after about a week and a half. When I used the shampoo, I immediately felt a difference. My hair felt softer than it normally does with other shampoos. It felt like I was conditioning it. I washed my hair twice and used the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Conditioner, rinsing it out immediately. Then I put on the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Masque and left it on while I finished showering about 10 minutes or so. I did put in a little leave-in conditioner I regularly use as well. I was going to put a chemical straightener on it after I used this shampoo but it was so soft and shiny, especially compared to normal, that I changed my mind and will use this shampoo and conditioners a few more times before I decide to use the straightener. A chemical straightener will take the frizz out and comes with such rich conditioners that your hair is soft and manageable and you don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron with it. But, this shampoo and the conditioners are almost as good as a straightener without the chemicals. The new girl at work today said, \\&quot;Your hair looks different. What did you do to it?\\&quot;. It was these products that I used for the first time yesterday.  This is a real review by a real individual who has absolutely nothing to do with Loreal. I plan to post this same review for all three products. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and what works for me may not be the thing for you but you will not know unless you try it.</li>
    <li> I got coerced by my hairdresser into buying this product and the repairing shampoo (which he insisted had to be used together) and I have been extremely impressed with the results. I damaged my hair by bleaching it and it was a big ole hot mess before using this deep conditioner. After I use it, which I do about 1-3 times a week, my hair always feels amazing and soft and looks and smells great. I have no complaints about the product itself, but I find the price ridiculous. This is the first deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other, cheaper products. Considering you only need to use a small amount of product per use, I&#x27;m pretty confident this jar will last me at LEAST 6 months of regular use. However, I can&#x27;t say that I am likely to spend $30 again once I run out. So, if you don&#x27;t mind the price, I would highly recommend it. Otherwise, keep searching.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on and off for over 5 years, i am a little bit of a hair product junkie. I always come back to this one! I do think you should dry your hair a little before using and try to leave it in as long as possible :)</li>
    <li> I did my research, and found out that this is no different than any other nice shampoo. HAIR PRODUCTS CANNOT &amp;#34;REPAIR&amp;#34; HAIR I was so disappointed with it that I went to the library and bought a book called &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t go shopping for hair products without me,&amp;#34; by Paula Begoun. This gave me some of the answers that I was looking for, but the products were virtually impossible to find at the store. Eventually, against &amp;#34;hair savvy&amp;#34; recommendations, I died my hair. Suddenly it was shiny!! There is something about having it all one solid color that makes it reflect light (I went a deep red/dark brown). I also only wash my hair once a week now and that has increased the shininess when I do wash it. Check out cloudy apples youtube videos, and Batiste to learn more:)</li>
    <li> I first tried this hair product about 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t used anything else until moving to the States. Since L&#x27;Oreal products are more expensive here, I decided to switch to something else that doesn&#x27;t cost as much. I tried dozens of different products and nothing worked for me as well as this hair masque.   My hair is colored, plus I blow dry it and style it everyday. The L&#x27;Oreal professional is the only brand that keeps my hair super silky, shiny and manageable no matter what. It is a little expensive as I already mentioned, but worth every penny. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love it. My hair is shiny and soft after using this product!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have used! And I feel like I&#x27;ve used them all. A friend turned me on to this line of products, and now I can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of this Masque. But this time the product I received was not good. Looked like an artificial product and not the original Loreal absolut repair masque.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s $28 a bottle when their Nature Therapy Condition is WAYYY BETTER &amp; half the price! Don&#x27;t buy this, buy Loreal&#x27;s Nature&#x27;s Therapy conditioner. I buy mine @ Sally&#x27;s &amp; my hair feels so smooth &amp; so much more healthier and silkier and easier on your pocket book too. $28 is way to much for such a small bottle of a conditioner that is just so-so.</li>
    <li> This product is magic for your hair. It smells incredible, makes your hair feel so healthy, and it really is a good deal. I totally recommend this hair masque!</li>
    <li> Same as Salon, overpriced product.</li>
    <li> I am hard on my hair like so many other women.  I have spent so much money over the years on hair care products.  When my hair stylist introduced me to the professional Loreal line I couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderful my hair felt and behaved.  There is nothing out in the market place to compare.  Their Professional line of shampoos, conditioners and other products our excellent! I believe they are also a great value as well.</li>
    <li> I have thin color treated hair and have always battled with split ends. This product has dramatically changed my hair for the better without weighing it down! I absolutely love this product line! It is concentrated so you do not have to use that much making it well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Absolut Repair Masque is awesome!  I used it last night along with the shampoo.  Hair is soft and has a nice sheen.  Great relief from my usually very dry hair.  Recommend this for all African-American women with relaxers.  Its worth is girls!</li>
    <li> My hair has become very dry from coloring and alot of sun exposure. My stylist recommeded this product, but I did not want to purchase at higher salon prices. I was happy to find it for this lower price at Amazon. It seems to really be working well. My hair feels very silky, much softer, and more managable after using the masque. I keep it in longer than a few minutes as well. I still wish it didn&#x27;t cost as much as it did, but I guess if it continues to keep my hair healthy, it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and love it.  I have tired other conditioners but keep coming back to this one since it definitely helps the frizziness that comes from coloring your hair! My hair is very fine and it still works great!</li>
    <li> First off, let me say this is a good product.  It does make my hair feel silkier, which probably means healthier.  However, I&#x27;ve used Kolesterol brand hair cream for decades, but when life changed and I could afford some more expensive products I chose to try something else.  Really, while this LOreal product is good, there&#x27;s no reason to spend so much money when you can go to a local Sally Beauty supply and pick up some Kolesterol for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> My hair looked the same as when I use my cheap conditioner. I do recommend Loreal power dose, this really works.</li>
    <li> Pro: Get this if you have dry, damage hair. I colored my hair at home and let&#x27;s just say it has been a working process trying to revive my hair back to its original softness and healthiness. The moment you let this stuff sit in your hair for 2 minutes (or even longer if you want) and rinse your locks in cool water, it will be sooooooooo silky and will be beyond soft. I recommend rinsing your hair in cool water because it locks in the keratin ingredients and silkiness since hot water can dry out your hair. It smells incredibly good, like salon good. Once you blow-dry or flat-iron your hair, it will still retain its silkiness. Literally guys, this stuff works so good that it&#x27;s scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the amount you get, but you may only need to use this once like me so you&#x27;ll have more than you need at the end of the day ;)</li>
    <li> I use this as a daily conditioner on my very fine wavy hair and it works great for me!  It&#x27;s very concentrated, so you don&#x27;t need to use to much.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Absolut Repair Masque and Shampoo with Neofibrine, and I received the Lactic Acid cellular repair. I thought to give it a try, and I didn&#x27;t like it. The Neofibrine formula feels more concentrated and using a very small amount of the product will do the work, and the Lactic Acid feels more diluted. I have used the Neofibrine Absolut Repair for a long time and it really helps my hair. I have straightened my hair in Brazil with a Loreal product (Brazilian blowout that lasts 1 year or until the hair grows). I also don&#x27;t like to receive what I didn&#x27;t order. It&#x27;s posted Neofibrine on the product picture, and they are selling the Lactic Acid product.</li>
    <li> The mask was my first introduction to the L&#x27;Oreal Prefessional line and it got me hooked! The jar itself is a good size even though it&#x27;s not huge but it has lasted me for a while now. This works really well when used once a week with a clarifying shampoo - I prefer the Neutrogena one - or with the matching moisturizing shampoo if the hair is very damaged. The mask is marvelous, it nourishes and keeps the hair moist and it makes the hair very soft - almost as if it&#x27;s still wet and it has that lush quality to it; this product helps to keep it manageable and silky. I find that after using this for two months now my hair feels very slippery on the days when I apply it, sometimes I can&#x27;t even have it up, it just unravels from any hair do unless I pin it down and use hair spray. The more I used it the better the results.     I also adore the matching shampoo and conditioner because they really added a lot of moisture to the hair shaft.. I highly recommend this for anyone who needs a quality deep treatment for their thirsty hair.    Amazon hasn&#x27;t carried this before and I am thrilled to find it here, in the stores I have never seen it for less then $37.00 which is what I paid for it, well not anymore : )    - Kasia S.</li>
    <li> I use this masque as a daily conditioner. It works wonders on my seriously over stressed hair!! Also because loreal makes kerastase, you know your getting a top notch product!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews here I was very excited to order L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Professional Series Absolut Repair Masque (I also ordered the shampoo/conditioner.) I&#x27;ve been using all three products for four days now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any different in my hair whatsoever. I have VERY dry hair. It&#x27;s frizzy, and extremely prone to breakage. Previously I was just using TRESemme shampoo/conditioner and a spray leave-in conditioner, and I think that combo worked just as great as this line of products. However, TRESemme is significantly less expensive. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this line.</li>
    <li> Since using the L&#x27;Oreal absolut repair masque, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my hair texture.  It turns dry, coarse hair into smooth, healthy hair.  It is especially beneficial to apply in the winter when hair becomes very dry.  As you get older and color your hair more often, a product like absolut repair is necessary.  It is a bit pricey, but well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t repair, soften, silken or do anything to my hair. The smell is the only plus-side to this conditioner. This is horribly overpriced as it&#x27;s worse than drugstore conditioners. My hair feels more dry and dehydrated with this. I was incredibly disappointed as this conditioner was the last resort for my hair. Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me, however, doesn&#x27;t mean others won&#x27;t have luck with it. Just my experience. (I used this product every other day for about a week to see if any difference occurred.)</li>
    <li> If u have damaged hair like me, i regularry die and straighten my hair, after using this masque result is really wonderful! Thnx loreal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the real stuff. It conditioned my hair but not like the one I bought from my hair stylist.</li>
    <li> Well my hair is so damage because I bleached it a lot of times. So my hair is so elastic and broken and dry. So this product its great but not enough for my hair. I think this product will be better for a little damage hair. The smell is not good at all. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product for my hair, I can see the difference when I use this product, used as instruction. One of my favorite.</li>
    <li> It is a really good product, and the seller is completely recommended.</li>
    <li> I think this is a better product than others out there (nature&#x27;s therapy, etc). This is my favorite product that I have now bought 5x on Amazon after trying them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They provide similar results, but this product just leaves my dyed and damaged hair a little bit softer. I find it easier to comb and tangle free. I use it as an everyday conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- I like the texture, it&#x27;s thick. This means I use have to use less product each time.&lt;br /&gt;- I prefer the smell of this product over Nature&#x27;s Therapy, whose apple scent is a bit much. This one has a slight medicinal smell&lt;br /&gt;- Packaged very nicely. The nature&#x27;s therapy jar is so big. Plus the nature&#x27;s therapy is hard to handle when wet as it is very slippery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the amazon price I paid was 30 for the larger version (16.9oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********Beware there are cheaper ones but some claim fake products so pay the premium for amazon version</li>
    <li> It makes my hair dull but after second wash it looks better and feels soft.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair naturally - and it is colored to boot.&lt;br /&gt;So I use this product once a week overnight (applying a good dollop to clean damp hair, and sleep with shower cap - rinse out in morning).&lt;br /&gt;  My stylist recommended doing this to strengthen my dry hair shafts and keep them moisturized with an extended treatment.&lt;br /&gt;For someone with dry hair, it works wonders!  Absolut Repair smells rich, makes my hair slicker and shinier, and even gives it a bit of body the next day upon blowdrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I as well am glad to be able to find it on Amazon for less than exorbitant salon prices!</li>
    <li> Completely repairs you hair. Heals it. The best, I tried so many.</li>
    <li> My wife is using it and it is perfectly fine, she has sensitive skin and has no problem about it.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  With each use my dry, color treated hair gets silkier and softer.  It&#x27;s really quite remarkable what this conditioner can do!</li>
    <li> Love this product and will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> The conditioner is great for your hair right after you have colored or highlighted your hair.  I keep this on hand for myself and my daughter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my hair dresser reccommended it. Soon after using this product I broke out in a horrible rash on my neck. I made an appointment with a dermatologist who suggested it was likely the Shampoo that caused my terrible rash. I have a strong suspicion that the product I received  was not actually absolute hair repair but a cheap rash causing substitute. My advice do not buy from this seller!</li>
    <li> If you have damaged, no shine hairs, need repair, need a miracle this is the key product. Very awesome product, but it was very hard to wait this product arrive, I had to look for help to know which post-office place was my package, because wasn&#x27;t delivered in my home  but worth the sacrifice. Next time I will try to find in a physical store.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. I use it twice a week. It makes my hair feel silky. Better than having my hair professionally done. No more dry split ends.</li>
    <li> I love it . It works very well. And It smells so good. I will buy it again when it gone</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair that is very dry, thus causing tremendous breakage no matter what i did.  I decided to try the shampoo, conditioner and the mask from L&#x27;Oreal Expert Lactid Acid and let me say that the moisture has returned making my hair more manageable causing less breakage after only 1 application &amp; my usual daily moisturizing Pantene hair cream.  The best thing is you don&#x27;t have to sit under a dryer for 20 minutes while the conditioner or mask works, just 2 minutes massage of the mask and rinse it and the work is done.  This is my new brand for hair care.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is like gold and it&#x27;s the only thing that gets my hair smooth and shiny and healthier after I&#x27;ve had it colored. It literally nursed my hair back to health after a terrible perm! I would strongly recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> excellent product for my hair.</li>
    <li> It made my hair a little oily. Next time I use it again I&#x27;ll do it only in the ends</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Shipping was really fast!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very soft</li>
    <li> My wife recommends because is a great quality product. She told me that the product exceeded the expectations. Probably I will need buy other soon.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference after using it for 2 months... There&#x27;s no effect after one use better than after a simple conditioner, and there&#x27;s no effect after using it for 2 months. Moreover, I noticed that my hair started falling out twice as much.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Really works. I&#x27;ve been lightening my hair once a week with a lightening gel and this mask really helped me to moisturize hairs before and after every procedure.</li>
    <li> My Wife Love this Product</li>
    <li> Salon used this on my hair 2 yrs ago to repair damage from perm n coloring to my hair n it works. So i use it twice a wk to maintain</li>
    <li> This works very well for my hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; of it or causes any build-up.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I received this item very quickly and with no issues. I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair after just one use.</li>
    <li> Love this moisture treatment. Thick and creamy mask- smells good and makes my hair super soft. Use once a week!</li>
    <li> I have my hair professionally colored every 8-10 weeks, and this treatment (recommended by my colorist) is the only thing that nourishes my &amp;#34;over stressed&amp;#34; hair, keeps it shiny and manageable too.  Much better than the drugstore conditioners I had been using in the past.</li>
    <li> I have always used it but this alone is not enough if you want to style your hair or have frizzy hair. I have wavy hair and it works good when used with L&#x27;Oreal serum. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
