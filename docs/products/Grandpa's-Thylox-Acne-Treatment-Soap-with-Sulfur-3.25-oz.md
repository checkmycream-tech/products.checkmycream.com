### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this soap for months now and it works great!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>EXCELLENT!</li>
      <li>I am also very fair skinned</li>
      <li>Thank you for a great product.</li>
      <li>and this is GREAT.  </li>
      <li>as advertised happy with seller</li>
      <li>Very effective</li>
      <li>You can feel good about using it on your skin.</li>
      <li>but I thought the product would be good for my skin.</li>
      <li>We did not have good luck with this product.</li>
      <li>I have had good luck with sulfur based products, so I tried this soap.  </li>
      <li>I love how great my face has cleared up.</li>
      <li>Is nice soap for my skin, takes car of acne and blemish.</li>
      <li>The soap worked better than I exected it to.</li>
      <li>It may be that it takes longer, but most of the people here that said that they noticed a difference noticed it by this point.  </li>
      <li>Consequently, I&#x27;d recommend a more compact-shaped 3% sulfur bar or, if your skin can tolerate 5% sulfur, the Derma Klear bar.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not terrible, but for me, it doesn&#x27;t do anything that a $0.50 bar of soap already does.  </li>
      <li>Her face is much better ever since she started using this soap.</li>
      <li>I just bought two more bars of this soap.</li>
      <li>He had moderate acne but is very happy that it is under control.</li>
      <li>use it all the time, now, and I really love the way the soap smells.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s part the reason I&#x27;m writing this review and to order some more.</li>
      <li>If you want something that works better than Thylox, then I recommend Enzymatic Therapy</li>
      <li>So far I am very pleased with the results!</li>
      <li>Works great so far.  </li>
      <li>Grandpas original coal soap works better, Plus, I now smell manly.</li>
      <li>the sulfur smell isn&#x27;t the best, but if you look at proactiv and many other great acne meds, sulfur is a key ingredient.  </li>
      <li>I have very mild acne and incipient rosacea; this sulfur soap helped with both.</li>
      <li>i strongly suggest this product.</li>
      <li>, so I think I&#x27;ll be buying it from Amazon while I can get it with free super-saver shipping.</li>
      <li>The sulfur smell is kind of an after-smell and very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you like the smell of *cheap* dime store perfume, then this is for you.</li>
      <li>this is cheap and does the trick.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, there is quite a significant promise the manufacturer profess, but doesn&#x27;t accomplish: it does NOT dissolve and remove blackheads.</li>
      <li>My skin (46) was not bad at all</li>
      <li>The product is great for other types of skin.</li>
      <li>But with other types of skin it would probably great.</li>
      <li>When first taken out of the package it smells fine</li>
      <li>Entering the bathroom for a quick midnight piss&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>super product.  </li>
      <li>I will alternate use of this bar with a gentle cleanser like Purpose, but I think it has helped my skin a great deal.</li>
      <li>Used it twice a day in the beginning to see super results in like three days.  </li>
      <li>My teenage son said it makes his face feel clean and fresh!!!  </li>
      <li>up.it really does work for my son who has acne and now his face really looks a lot better since he started using this product.thanks</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this soap, but I realize now that, for me, it was a huge mistake.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll use this until I can get to the doctor, but this is a lot better then regular acne face washes that you get at the drugstore.&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first some spots on my face broke out a bit, but there had been some latent spots that probably needed to be \\&quot;pulled</li>
      <li>Bought this for my grandson &amp; he uses it consistently.</li>
      <li>I have used one other sulfur based soap that was recommended by my dermatologist for adult onset acne, but thought I&#x27;d try this since I could get it more easily from amazon.</li>
      <li>I used a non-acne facial moisturizer after each wash and have been fine.</li>
      <li>this is a really good product for anyone who has a little acne and would like to clear it</li>
      <li>i was at the point where i really didn&#x27;t think anything would work.  </li>
      <li>This product arrived on time but did not work out as much as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>It didnt treat my acne very well.  </li>
      <li>I guess this is too much for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard of some people having flare ups when they use a new product, but this was a first for me.</li>
      <li>I usually wash with a nice smelling body wash after using it in the shower.</li>
      <li>I still have a few zits here and there, but for the most part my face is pretty clear.</li>
      <li>It really works &amp; it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
      <li>Severely dried my skin and in return made it more oily by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>After trying various herbal remedies with mixed results, as in, nothing was quite strong enough to permanently keep the mites from munching on me, I read someone&#x27;s online suggestion of sulfur soap, which, thank God, pretty much solved the problem.</li>
      <li>The morning after I started using this soap, I began to notice fine bumps all over my face, like my pores were extremely clogged.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve had small bouts of acne in not so sexy places on my body (back/butt) from working out</li>
      <li>I tried this soap after reading all the positive reviews and after only a week my skin has improved dramatically.</li>
      <li>i suffer from mild adult acne and decided to give this a shot after reading reviews here and on other sites.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really complain about the slight smell because this soap works well for me, better than any other soap out there.</li>
      <li>I want to use one in the shower, maybe it can clear up the rest of my skin.</li>
      <li>I have adult acne, I thought I would try this product.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>i have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This soap does make a difference, but it&#x27;s not going to clear up my face completely.</li>
      <li>the smell is natural with NO added fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have suffered with acne  since my early teens (I am now 29) and nothing would clear it up.</li>
      <li>it also cleared up the blackheads, completely.  </li>
      <li>But I have extremely sensitive oily skin that will freak out if I put anything with exfoliants  on my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;My health food store in Alaska sold it to me for 4.99 at first, but now suddenly it&#x27;s 6.99(!)</li>
      <li>My daughter (15) does break out and had several new break outs as soon as she started using the product.</li>
      <li>I only hope it will always keep her face clear.</li>
      <li>but once wet you can really smell the sulfur.</li>
      <li>My doctor told me I had contact dermatitis and wouldn&#x27;t consider the possibility that I might have an allergy to mites that most people have on their skin and never notice, though everything I read made me think that must be it, since I&#x27;d changed detergents, slathered on moisturizers - which made me worse, taken vitamin A, eliminated foods, etc.</li>
      <li>That quickly developed into a full-blown break out complete with very painful, &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; acne like I haven&#x27;t experienced in years.</li>
      <li>However, the bar itself has a wide and thin shape, which meant that it wore down to a sliver more quickly than the other bars I tried.</li>
      <li>I have always had minor to moderate breakouts in my upper back, this is the only soap i have found to keep it clear.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Is nice soap for my skin, takes car of acne and blemish.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin.  Products like benzoyl peroxide aggravate my acne problems and my dermatologist advised me to stay away from it.  I am also very fair skinned so every red spot shows immediately. I have had good luck with sulfur based products, so I tried this soap.  The soap does dry my skin out, but I have also found that any cleanser that has helped my acne usually does.  At first some spots on my face broke out a bit, but there had been some latent spots that probably needed to be \\&quot;pulled out\\&quot; so to speak.  In the past few days these spots have started to dry up and lose color.  I will alternate use of this bar with a gentle cleanser like Purpose, but I think it has helped my skin a great deal.</li>
    <li> The soap worked better than I exected it to. My acne has been reduced by atleast 75%. Other reviews and my doctor warned me of how drying the soap was but I didn&#x27;t find it to be too bad. I used a non-acne facial moisturizer after each wash and have been fine. The only complaint I have about the soap is the smell. I wish it had a nicer scent. When first taken out of the package it smells fine but once wet you can really smell the sulfur. I don&#x27;t care for the smell of sulfur. I would recommend this product to friends and have.</li>
    <li> The soap formulation itself works well, like several other 3-5% sulfur soaps I tried over the course of several months. It has a 3% sulfur concentration so it&#x27;s on the milder end. The sulfur smell isn&#x27;t too bad--you&#x27;ll smell it, but it isn&#x27;t as overpowering as some topical sulfur creams. However, the bar itself has a wide and thin shape, which meant that it wore down to a sliver more quickly than the other bars I tried. Consequently, I&#x27;d recommend a more compact-shaped 3% sulfur bar or, if your skin can tolerate 5% sulfur, the Derma Klear bar.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my niece, who has acne problems and nothing seems to help. She had nothing to loose, so she got it and it works!!! Her face is much better ever since she started using this soap. Other products had similar start, but after a while they stop having effect. I only hope it will always keep her face clear. So far I am very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> i suffer from mild adult acne and decided to give this a shot after reading reviews here and on other sites. big mistake. my pimples are typically small and rarely are they painful and deep. within a week and a half i developed a cluster of deep, painful zits. weird, i thought, but didn&#x27;t chalk it up to the soap. after another week of use i broke out in another set of deep, painful pimples on another area of my face. after that, i quit using immediately. the smell didn&#x27;t bother me, but the massive zits did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this soap at all.  Doesn&#x27;t remove make up, leaves skin dry and clogged. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in acne improvement either.</li>
    <li> Entering the bathroom for a quick midnight piss&lt;br /&gt;You sniff something malodorous, something amiss&lt;br /&gt;The man behind the curtain, he is in your tub&lt;br /&gt;Grandfather is giving his zits quite the rub</li>
    <li> I have used one other sulfur based soap that was recommended by my dermatologist for adult onset acne, but thought I&#x27;d try this since I could get it more easily from amazon. The morning after I started using this soap, I began to notice fine bumps all over my face, like my pores were extremely clogged. That quickly developed into a full-blown break out complete with very painful, &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; acne like I haven&#x27;t experienced in years. I used it about 4 days and the acne just kept getting worse. I&#x27;ve heard of some people having flare ups when they use a new product, but this was a first for me. This breakout is so bad, it&#x27;s going to take forever to recover from. I had high hopes for this soap, but I realize now that, for me, it was a huge mistake.</li>
    <li> the product was just as described. Will us it for a month and see how it works.</li>
    <li> This soap is nothing short of a miracle! I have suffered with acne  since my early teens (I am now 29) and nothing would clear it up. I have had both over the counter and prescription medications, even expensive laser treatements. I tried this soap after reading all the positive reviews and after only a week my skin has improved dramatically. I have no new blemishes and no more blackheads! If you&#x27;ve tried everything with no luck, try this soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read that sulfur would help break up keratin (I have keratosis pilaris on my upper arms).  After daily use for about 3 weeks I have yet to notice any difference.  It may be that it takes longer, but most of the people here that said that they noticed a difference noticed it by this point.  It also hasn&#x27;t done anything for the various other pimples I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not terrible, but for me, it doesn&#x27;t do anything that a $0.50 bar of soap already does.  I&#x27;ll be looking for a keratosis treatment elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I got this soap because a few years back I had gotten a sulfuric face wash from the dermatologist. I am currently unable to see a dermatologist right now and remembered that the main ingredient used was sulfur. So I looked for something similar and saw this, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I still have acne, but not as bad as I did before I used this. This soap does make a difference, but it&#x27;s not going to clear up my face completely. So I&#x27;ll use this until I can get to the doctor, but this is a lot better then regular acne face washes that you get at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this soap for months now and it works great! I love how great my face has cleared up. I still have a few zits here and there, but for the most part my face is pretty clear. A big improvement from before. I just bought two more bars of this soap. I want to use one in the shower, maybe it can clear up the rest of my skin. I only use this soap now. Great product!</li>
    <li> My teenage son said it makes his face feel clean and fresh!!!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This product worked well for about a week. Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap works well for me. The product is great for other types of skin. But I have extremely sensitive oily skin that will freak out if I put anything with exfoliants  on my skin. I guess this is too much for me. But with other types of skin it would probably great. Sorry I couldn&#x27;t be of more help.</li>
    <li> We did not have good luck with this product. My skin (46) was not bad at all but I thought the product would be good for my skin. I actually broke out and I usually have no blemishes. My daughter (15) does break out and had several new break outs as soon as she started using the product. We will not be using this item.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had small bouts of acne in not so sexy places on my body (back/butt) from working out and this is GREAT.  worked on all and i have tried everything!  the sulfur smell isn&#x27;t the best, but if you look at proactiv and many other great acne meds, sulfur is a key ingredient.  this is cheap and does the trick.  buying it again and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> My doctor told me I had contact dermatitis and wouldn&#x27;t consider the possibility that I might have an allergy to mites that most people have on their skin and never notice, though everything I read made me think that must be it, since I&#x27;d changed detergents, slathered on moisturizers - which made me worse, taken vitamin A, eliminated foods, etc. After trying various herbal remedies with mixed results, as in, nothing was quite strong enough to permanently keep the mites from munching on me, I read someone&#x27;s online suggestion of sulfur soap, which, thank God, pretty much solved the problem. When it was really bad, sometimes I even applied the soap suds like a lotion and didn&#x27;t rinse it off. My skin tends to dryness, but this didn&#x27;t make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time, now, and I really love the way the soap smells.  It&#x27;s an old-fashioned smell that I associate with sun-dried sheets and clawfoot tubs. The sulfur smell is kind of an after-smell and very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My health food store in Alaska sold it to me for 4.99 at first, but now suddenly it&#x27;s 6.99(!), so I think I&#x27;ll be buying it from Amazon while I can get it with free super-saver shipping.</li>
    <li> I have always had minor to moderate breakouts in my upper back, this is the only soap i have found to keep it clear. I have used this type of soap for over a year then I forgot to stock up so I used my wife&amp;#34;s soap and bam! Started breaking out again. That&#x27;s part the reason I&#x27;m writing this review and to order some more.</li>
    <li> Not sure how much i like the soap yet because I&#x27;ve only used it 4 or 5 times.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as Sulfo-Lo, which I used to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap based on the reviews I read here. I like it. I am not sure if it&#x27;s the end all for my skin, but it&#x27;s part of my regiment now.</li>
    <li> i was at the point where i really didn&#x27;t think anything would work.  i have incredibly sensitive skin and i am extremely allergic to everything.  this product not only cleared up my acne it also cleared up the blackheads, completely.  i have to caution that this soap is drying but after a week or two my skin adapted and is no longer dry (i can&#x27;t use moisturizers because i&#x27;m allergic).  i strongly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of *cheap* dime store perfume, then this is for you. If you want something that works better than Thylox, then I recommend Enzymatic Therapy DermaKlear Acne Treatment 3 oz bar soap. It has 5% sulphur and the ingredients are healthier. IT WORKS and the smell is natural with NO added fragrance.</li>
    <li> as advertised happy with seller</li>
    <li> this is a really good product for anyone who has a little acne and would like to clear it up.it really does work for my son who has acne and now his face really looks a lot better since he started using this product.thanks</li>
    <li> Severely dried my skin and in return made it more oily by the end of the day. Grandpas original coal soap works better, Plus, I now smell manly.</li>
    <li> Sulfur containing products have always worked well for my skin, this product included. My only complaint is the slight smell of sulfur, it is not overwhelming but it&#x27;s there. I usually wash with a nice smelling body wash after using it in the shower. Your bathroom will smell a little but you can use candles or spray. I can&#x27;t really complain about the slight smell because this soap works well for me, better than any other soap out there.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandson &amp; he uses it consistently. It has cleared up his face &amp; back. He had moderate acne but is very happy that it is under control.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne, I thought I would try this product.  It didnt treat my acne very well.  I got alot of irritation.</li>
    <li> Worked for my bad back acne, but it left a horrid smell percolating on my back. the stench remained on me all day long. Beware if you are using this soap and will be in public</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time but did not work out as much as I thought it would. I have three people using it and it&#x27;s not working for any of us.</li>
    <li> It really works &amp; it&#x27;s natural.  You can feel good about using it on your skin.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT! Very effective</li>
    <li> super product.  Used it twice a day in the beginning to see super results in like three days.  I wash my face nothing less than three times a day , but you can and will over dry if you use it that much . After you get the clarity you want then only use it every other day.</li>
    <li> I have very mild acne and incipient rosacea; this sulfur soap helped with both. Of course it smells like sulfur, but it&#x27;s bearable; it also dries the skin a little bit, but I applied a moisturizer immediately after washing with the soap and had no problems with the dryness. All these are minor cons, compared with the pros.&lt;br /&gt;However, there is quite a significant promise the manufacturer profess, but doesn&#x27;t accomplish: it does NOT dissolve and remove blackheads.</li>
    <li> Works great so far.  Does smell a bit, but that&#x27;s just proof there is sulfur in it!</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that works on my late in life acne.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
