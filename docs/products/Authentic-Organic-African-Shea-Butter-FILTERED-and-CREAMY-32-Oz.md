      <li>We like the oil to make the Shea Butter melt faster, give a smoother flow and give off a pleasant sweet almond aroma.</li>
      <li>it kind of smells like play dough, if you spray some perfume on top of where you applied it makes it better.</li>
      <li>Oil, in most cases, does not moisturize.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Great product that I will be recommending to family and friends :)</li>

      <li>I love it for custom body butters and hair conditioners.</li>
      <li>after that it was okay.  </li>
      <li>Clearly worth the money!!</li>
      <li>Very cool product and purchased Recommend</li>
      <li>I think thats the most important factor for my continuous use.  </li>
      <li>This one is nice, not and overly powerful shea butter smell and is creamy.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for all of the REAL benefits of shea butter, purchase from a fair trade, certified organic website that guarantees unrefined, organic, un-tampered with shea butter.</li>
      <li>Thankfully it arrived with very minimal smell and is wonderful for the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great value. Not as creamy as I expected but when I added other oils to it it came out with a good consistency. The tub is large and will last me a while.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It&#x27;s natural and it has multiple uses. I actually use it for my scalp since Im rocking my natural hair. The product is stiff but microwavable. The tube is huge. This is such a great deal. The shipping was fast as well.</li>
    <li> warning this review is going to be a little long just because I want to be as detailed as possible to help who ever is looking into this product....    I&#x27;m dark skin....I have stretch marks and some dark spots and discoloration.... after A LOT of research I came up with this product.     NO it does not smell like Victoria secret! But I swear that&#x27;s the ONLYYYYYYYYYY downside. (does not stink either...earthy smell goes... away after a while)    why I love this product....it literally leaves my skin moisturize the WHOLE day...my skin is SUPER soft...I&#x27;ve been using for less than a week and I DO see a BIG difference....I truly do believe my light stretch marks are starting to even out with my true natural skin color (I even asked my husband to make sure I&#x27;m just not going crazy;; he agreed)... as for my dark spots they&#x27;re getting lighter.    The way I like to use this product....  When I&#x27;m going to shower (hot shower) I put the container in with me just to warm it up (I heard somewhere that heat helps, not sure how true this may be, but its working for me)  I pat my self dry and then apply with some palmer&#x27;s coconut vitamin e oil.  I massage into skin and then go on with my day.    Again I&#x27;ve been using this product for like 3 days I REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY DO SEE A HUGEEEEEEEEEEE DIFFERENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    PROS::    LEAVES UR SKIN FEELING 10X BETTER (I swear to you this is true)  QUICKLY OBSERVS  REALLY FAST RESULTS  Ohhh did I mention the BANGING PRICE!?!?!?   BUYYYY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WHAT R U WAITING FOR????????  ...........PEOPLE IM SOOOOOO SERIOUS!!!!!!!  I&#x27;ve been dealing with these bad skin conditions since a little girl.... and I&#x27;m truly am seeing a big difference.  Its money well spent.</li>
    <li> Easier to apply onto the skin with the same moisturizing element.    Delivery was quick and the jar is truly huge.  I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months already, not even half-way through.</li>
    <li> This was a very good product. It came pretty quickly and was bigger than I had expected. Its very hard like a bar of soap but if you warm it up in microwave for appox. 2-3 minutes its just fine. It will leave your skin soft and silky and you don&#x27;t have to use very much at all. This lasted me for several months and I will definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Living in the desert, and washing my hands a lot, my hands get extremely dry and cracked. I used to use petroleum jelly for quick relief, but have stopped using petroleum in favor of more natural products. I remembered that, a few years ago, I used to buy tiny jars of shea butter from a lady who would come into the store where I worked. So I searched Amazon and decided to buy the 32-ounce tub. This is a lot of shea butter. I decanted some into an 8-ounce jar to use at work and, using it daily for six months, have barely made a dent. Just a little bit on my fingertip is enough. Because the weather is cold, I do have to soften it between my fingers before it comes to spreading consistency. It is a bit greasy, but I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s just about the only thing that makes my hands feel better. During the summer, I keep it refrigerated, because it melts if left out at room temperature (my summers are over 110°F).</li>
    <li> Way too hard...not whipped at all.</li>
    <li> Nice product, moisturizes deeply.  The butter is creamy and clean.  I use it in my legs from time to time and they are really soft now, even if I don&#x27;t use cream for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin and hair feeling soft and protected! I orderd the 32oz which lasted a while. I think its better for you than alot of other products. Try it you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been using Shea Butter for years and this one definetly does the trick. I have dry skin and because this is thick it covers me well and don&#x27;t make me feel slippery.  Get product and service.  My only issue is that during shipping, it kind of melted in the box and leaked on my other ordered items.  Maybe the company should put container in a ziploc baggy during shipping...just in case!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful,its used for many reasons. Make your skin smooth. I will tell my family and friends about shea butter.</li>
    <li> I purchase this before.  I all ways add water to my shea to moisturize my hair and gylgecerin . I&#x27;m still trying to get it where it does not fill dry or sticky. SAAQIN and Halaeveryday are the same company.  Its a shame that they have a number on a product that is not the number. As well the domain name is not up to date.  Selling shea butter on some and Africa butter is what is sold as well but they have shea listed.  They could increase product knowledge contact for customers by spending time updating their info.  I email customer service person was rude named Amed  - know as Majahid Amed on the internet who knows he could be the owner.  I think it is important when buy a product customer service is who they say they are so you can at lease ask questions about where the product came from and it does not list that on the container.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this was trully organic but I really did enjoy the creamy consistency of the product. Shea butter is naturally a good moisturizer so I wanted something that did not have a lot of added ingredients. I like the light scent,</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for everything.  Hair and skin so far.  Looking for new ways to use it.  Also great with skin discoloration as well my daughter had to have surgery on her face and unless you know what you are looking for you can not tell that she has a scar on her face at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit oily but it works great on dry skin, I dont recommend it for your legs if you wear leggings or skinny jeans though, the shea butter is so thick and sticky on your skin the pants stick and become hard to pull on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have had terrible eczema my entire life (I&#x27;m currently 24 years old) and I have used all kinds of lotions and creams and prescriptions and all sorts of medicines and ointments and diets and cleanses and treatments and everything you could think of. Ever since I discovered this though, I have never looked back! I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff, but it is amazing....It has some sort of healing effect that can only come from all things natural! My sisters use Aveeno and Jergens and Eucerin and St. Ives and Vaseline and all of those name brand lotions that sell at a premium, with all of their man-made preservatives and chemicals and such. None of them ever provided relief for me that would last more than an hour or so. This shea butter stuff though.....is thick....and rich, and it just somehow does what none of them could do!&lt;br /&gt;Oh and buy the 32 oz size. It will last a while. I feel amazing all day as soon I put this on!</li>
    <li> No aroma, excellent price. Will be mixing this in our own mixture of Shea Butter, Almond Oil and Almond Extract. We like the oil to make the Shea Butter melt faster, give a smoother flow and give off a pleasant sweet almond aroma. We have bought the Shea Butter in prepackaged 7 ounce sizes but figured this would work as well and give us a definitely, less costly product with good coverage for 3 plus months longer use.&lt;br /&gt;I have done this before with a moisturizing lotion (about 10 years ago) that all my friends just loved. It was made for a Christmas gift and they kept asking me to make it again, so, maybe this will please them now, and, again at Christmas. We shall see . . .</li>
    <li> This was a great buy for me! It smells exactly how raw Shea butter should smell. The consistency is a little grainy feeling but I am not complaining.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great deal! I will use this for awhile!  Clearly worth the money!! Thank you so much !!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great pricepoint so I can use to make my own lotions..it is very.nice to have it filtered so I don&#x27;t have to mess with it!  thanks!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this as it was a large quantity for a great price, but I was so disappointed when I opened it. The smell was nauseating to me and the texture was hard and gritty. Maybe that is what \\&quot;authentic\\&quot; shea butter is supposed to be like. I think I will stick to the more expensive brands I have used. I love natural products but this one was not for me.</li>
    <li> Smells like it is mixed with a strong olive oil or something.  The smell is not good and is overbearing.  I used it to make my cocoa-mint body butter but all I can smell is this Shea butter.  Yuck.</li>
    <li> This smells like really shea as any one who has ever used raw shea would know.  Really nutty and earthy smelling, however, it is a bit gritty before it is slow melted over a double boiler.  after that it was okay.  Still did what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great oil! Helped my niece with problems of excema.Just great on the skin for softening; I live in the midwest where there&#x27;s bitter cold wind in the winter and it really protects the skin in an amazing way w/o being oily. Terrific stuff!!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item, I had the expectation that I could use it right away.  However, when I received it, the shea butter is hard as a rock.  I have no idea what to do with it now.  Throw it away??</li>
    <li> Excellent butter works well on skin and hair and excellent price for the amount that you get Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I loved this product. The item shipped when it was supposed to arrived when it was supposed to. I used it to make whipped Shea butter for relatives in my family with natural hair. Item was effective and I even had some left over to use on my body and hair.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter was very creamy and easy to work with. I made several skin care products with it and they all turned out great. I made lotion bars an body butter. I even used the recipe on the side of the jar. Would definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> This is definitely more refined than many raw shea butters, yet not refined to the point of no longer being raw. Great product</li>
    <li> I use it in my mane and on the bottom of my feet and EVERYWHERE in between. It is truly worth the try. I love the stuff.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working okay for eczema still has some itching. Not completely controlled by the shea butter.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels on windy days. it keeps my skin from getting chapped. it kind of smells like play dough, if you spray some perfume on top of where you applied it makes it better. I just used it the way it was, I didn&#x27;t make anything out of it. I like it and would order it again. I just need to adjust the smell, it&#x27;s not that bad. I just don&#x27;t want to smell that.</li>
    <li> Very cool product and purchased Recommend</li>
    <li> I love to use shea butter for the base of many home made hair and skin products.  This one is nice, not and overly powerful shea butter smell and is creamy. Mixed easily with my other products.  Love the container...many shea butters come in a plastic bag that is messy and leaks. This one is in a plastic container with a resealable lid.</li>
    <li> My skin tone is more evenly toned and I&#x27;m ash free.</li>
    <li> This product is greasy and grainy. It does melt after rubbing it into your hands for a few seconds. The product came in a container that wasn&#x27;t sealed properly it is bright yellow and from what I understand from researching the description of what real unrefined organic shea butter is suppose to look like the color should NOT be yellow. There is a sticker on the container that says 100% authetic organic but I DON&#x27;T THINK SO!! Will not be ordering this product again from this seller! NO WAY!</li>
    <li> i got it completely damaged and broken ..  here the link of the picture of damaged butter after i got it    [...]</li>
    <li> This comes hard as a rock. I&#x27;d imagine you could microwave it and obtain a liquid which would be much easier to apply, but I have not done so. It claims to be effective on rashes and other skin lesions, well, after 3 application, rash on my right leg and right arm nearly disappeared completely. I&#x27;m very pleased with this butter and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this shea butter, especially since I got it at such a good price. A little goes a long way! This container should last me a while. I mixed it in with some coconut oil, olive oil, and tea tree oil to use it as a hair and skin moisturizer. It really makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I use this authentic African Shea Butter on my hair and skin. It feels great. I also love the way it smells. Its nice to have all natural products free of chemicals. I can definitely see the way my body and skin responds. Nice size too. Should last me awhile.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have been using it for about 2 years now. I have very delicate skin, a condition where my hair follicles that don&#x27;t produce fast enough that I have mild pimple like areas on my upper arms, and eczema.  Ever since I started using this African Shea Butter my skin is really soft and that pimple like areas on my arms are gone and it helps keep my eczema under control don&#x27;t have as much break out with the eczema.  I would recommend this product for anyone that has ruff dry skin. It also has other benefits one of them is that it is a natural UV protectant (sunscreen) and many other benefits.  Buy it so you can see the things that it can help .  I did buy this product from amazon and I LOVE IT.  You have to use it long term to see results. The best thing of all is that it is organic.

    <li> The product is ok, it arrived in a broken container.  Just be aware that there is white shea butter and anything you make with this bright yellow product will be yellow.</li>
    <li> I am still using my shea butter. Whether it&#x27;s made a bit of difference I cannot say yet but I can say that this product is just as advertised. Got it not long after I ordered and overall I am very pleased with everything.</li>
    <li> The only thing I want you to think about, look the size of the container and the price compare to other shea butter on the market.&lt;br /&gt;One might think that cost does not mean good but in this case the size and price tell you what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased shea butter before but this one is mixed with something I don&#x27;t really know what it is. There is no returned and every purchase is final according to the seller  even-though there is a paper stating how to return the product if you are unhappy. Just be careful with what you are baying I will not commend this seller with his &amp;#34;shea ...&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after my family continued to have ongoing issues with dry skin and hair. After reading about all of the benefits shea butter had to offer, I decided to purchase it. I chose this vendor due to the overwhelmingly positive responses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was a good substitute for the petrolatum, lanolin, and mineral oil based products were we using in my household. However, the positive affects began to wear off after about a month of use. I noticed dry areas returning for myself, my daughter, and my husband. I did more research to figure out what the issue might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real issue is that this product is not pure, organic, unrefined shea butter. It has been filtered, and refined. Additionally, some type of oil has been added to it. Oil, in most cases, does not moisturize. The molecules in oils are too large to permeate skin and hair shafts so they usually just sit on the surface. Shea butter is an emollient. It has sealing abilities as well as moisturizing abilities. Therefore, adding oils and refining it reduces its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend only using this product in place of vaseline or some other non-moisturizing product. If you are looking for all of the REAL benefits of shea butter, purchase from a fair trade, certified organic website that guarantees unrefined, organic, un-tampered with shea butter.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional and easy to use.  Great for hands used in farmwork. Prefer over the unfiltered shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;The container lid was broken because the product was filled to the brim.  Product appears to be in good condition. Packaging could have been more shockproof.</li>
    <li> I should have shopped around more for a better price and the containers were dirty.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS ALL THE TIME. I SOFTEN IT BY  SITTING A SMALL BOWL OF IT IN ANOTHER BOWL FILLED WITH HOT WATER ON MY BATHROOM COUNTER. LIKE A DOUBLE BOILER METHOD. I TAKE MY SHOWER AND BY THE TIME I AM DONE SHOWERING THE CREAM IS NICE AND SOFT AND GOES ON SO SMOOTHLY  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. I DON&#x27;T CARE FOR THE SMELL, ITS NOT A BAD SMELL, JUST DIFFERENT.BUT AGAIN ITS ALSO NOT FULL OF PERFUMES AND CHEMICALS,AND THAT IS A GOOD THING!!. THE SMELL DOES  DISSIPATE AFTER ABOUT 5 TO 10 MINUTES,</li>
    <li> I live in a dry environment and found this recommended in a health magazine.  It does work very well especially with itchy skin produced through dry conditions. Recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shea butter. It has a strong nutty aroma. Some folks really don&#x27;t like the aroma, but it&#x27;s really not stinky. It&#x27;s very good for scalp, face &amp; hair. I use it as a base for my overall conditioner. It lasts a long time too. A bit greasy feeling, but my scalp, hair &amp; body do absorb it pretty quickly. Unless you have dry skin on your face, you might want to use it sparingly there to avoid breakouts. I will definitely order this again. Great size for the price. It lasts for months.</li>
    <li> I would definitely order this again.  This is natural shea butter that has been filtered of the bark or shells you normally see when buying raw shea butter.  The price for the 32oz tub was cheaper than what I have found in local stores.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is a great moisturizer, it feels amazing on the skin and works great as a hair conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It *does* smell. Not good. To me, it smells like old clay. It&#x27;s not a horrible smell, it&#x27;s just not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to whip the shea butter up with a little coconut oil and a nice smelling essential oil to improve the scent and make it a little easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little gritty when you first feel it. If you&#x27;ve ever played with &#x27;moon sand&#x27;, you will understand. But it melts quickly and smoothly in your hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 out of 5 stars, and considering that it smells the way it does only because it is organic and natural, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have even subtracted one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product that I will be recommending to family and friends :)</li>
    <li> I looked for Shea Butter and found it in the local health food stores for around $8.00 for 8 oz.  I was astonished when I looked on Amazon and found this seller has 32 oz for less than $20.00 including shipping!  The product arrived in a plastic tub that leaked only slightly into the box because it was 90 degrees here on the day it was delivered.  No harm done.  Since then, I have used this product in a homemade beeswax lotion which has been wonderful on the skin, even the face, I have had no problems with breakouts, so it seems to be non-comedogenic, at least for my skin!  Also have used it in my Cold Process soap recipies with great results.  Highly recommended and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now and I am glade I have. It feels great on my skin. I have very dry skin, and this helps with that. I really glade I decided to switch from high priced brands lotions to this!!</li>
    <li> I have not received the shipment He said I received . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I order this product regularly. It has worked wonders on my son&#x27;s mod-severe eczema. No more steroids or irritating creams and ointments. His dermatologist was impressed and said all natural is the best way to go. There so far has been no OTC cream to match the level of moisturizing that the Shea butter provides. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The amount is enormous!! Worth the money and works on every thing from hair to skin!!! Will purchase again but that will be at least a year from now!!</li>
    <li> This is very nice i just didn&#x27;t smell the usual cocoa smell that usually accompanies the product, but overall its good.</li>
    <li> what you get is a chinese food soup container filled with this stuff. i call it stuff because every time i order it, it could be plain ivory shea butter, or yellow (simpson yellow), african butter. you just never know. they both work, but the yellow one can stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;while smooth (and each formula comes out smoother every time i get it), the stuff smells terrible. it&#x27;s a part of the process, and i understand that, but it still has a moldy smoky smell to it. so i can&#x27;t use it on my face. but it works fine for feet. while they say a small amount is all you need, its too hard to spread and you wind up using a butter knife to spread it on. for the price this is the way to go. it takes me a year to use up one of these things.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased shea butter, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it is as advertised.  It&#x27;s smooth, smells good, softens my skin, and I intend to make up a batch of body butter soon, so I can spread it around. LOL!</li>
    <li> Authentic Organic African Shea Butter Filtered &amp; Creamy is so amazing. I melt it in the microwave for 20 sec. It looked like rich heavy liquid gold. I couldn&#x27;t believe the texture. It was heavy, thick, and rich. Nothing like the fake shea butter they have out on the market. It smelled like medicine. I never seen or touched shea butter so pure and rich before. This is a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The only complain I have is the packaging.  The plastic container was cracked on the side and the lid as well.  The shea butter didn&#x27;t split out.  Other than that, it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this item before and was concerned it would smell horribly based on some of the reviews. Thankfully it arrived with very minimal smell and is wonderful for the skin.</li>
    <li> this product realy works i use it every day i will be buying it again and telling my friends thank you</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve reviewed this product before. I love it for custom body butters and hair conditioners. The smell is ok for me, but some folks don&#x27;t like it. I add essential oils to mask the nutty smell.</li>
    <li> I have come to rely on Shea butter for my hair and body. This product is a big enough container to last me about four months. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Received on schedule.  Everyone used this at the pool this summer.  My sister made lotion and added the shea butter too it.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> love nothing to add on this one my your skin smoot5h soft make you fill pretty try it/</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is in the form that allows me to be creative with other ingredients, or just use it like it is.  I&#x27;m not too sure about the creamy characterization in its raw form, BUT it does become creamy and more liquid after rubbing in hands or rubbing on skin.  The only thing that I did not care for was not in regards to the product itself, but the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> I would love to give this five stars because it&#x27;s great for my skin. I bought three of them, since It is so nice and creamy, and it really helped for my dry feet and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;But I thought that shea butter could be mixed with regular hair oils, etc. But both my daughter&#x27;s and my hair broke off badly after using the hair oil mixed with this.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it‘s just our hair type, but this had to be the reason, since it&#x27;s the only thing that we did differently.&lt;br /&gt;She mixed a small amount in her African Pride hair oil, and I mixed a little in my hair food.&lt;br /&gt;We will continue to use it on our skin though.</li>
    <li> This product was the worst item I have ever purchased.  This product was dry and the smell was disgusting not what the vendor described at all.  I don&#x27;t recommended this at all.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter and will continue to purchase.  Great price for the quality!!  Thank you, Cherry Tree Lane Soap Company</li>
    <li> This product is the worlds best moisturizer but that&#x27;s not all it does.  I am 53 and have been using Shea butter for well over 10 years.  It keeps my skin super moist and even now people will stop me and compliment my on skin and even ask if they can touch it.  All that was well and good but the real proof came when my sister, who was a life long sufferer of ezcema, started using it.  I remember as children her skin being visable rough and always itchy.  Our mom used all types of treatments both perscribed and over the counter with no real results.  My sister began using Shea butter in December and I recall us going on vacation in April and sitting on the beach one day.  I looked over at her and realized her skin look smooth an normal like mine has for so long.  I excitedly asked her what she had finally found to help after so many years.  She said \\&quot;that shea butter you use\\&quot;.  I was floored and have told this story more times than I can count.  It has a distinctive odor which does not last but the results surely do.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and love it on my hair.  My hair was dry from wearing dreads and from not moisturizing it correctly.  I tried this after putting a bit of leave-in moisture conditioner and my hair was wonderful.  You only need a little and it goes a long way.  It is great on my skin as well.  Especially on my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have been using shea butter for my hair and body for 3 years now and I love this product. I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of it (real thick), so I pop it in the mircowave for a couple of seconds and then it is fabulous. Not a liquid or a hard solid...perfect. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used shea butter but never creamy.  I mixed it with some more oils and made a moisturizer for my hair and skin.  I love it more than before.</li>
    <li> I have always known about shea butter, but. I have only been using it for 2 months! I love this stuff. I&#x27;m brown skinned, and I have eczema, acne scars, and my feet are dry, but every since i started using this with ( black soap)  I do not have acne anymore. My feet are smooth, my acne scars and dark spots are gone. I&#x27;m telling you that nothing has ever worked for me like shea butter and black soap. I mix my shea butter with topiclear to make it creamy, but everything is just beautiful rt now. I wear foundation. I would never let people see me without make up, but now it&#x27;s OK! My skin is clear and gorgeous. I went to get my toe nails done, and the lady doing my pedicure talk about my feet like they were beautiful. My husband never! Ever! Compliments me, but yesterday he said, \\&quot; omg \\&quot; your skin is so pretty. I feel like i reversed my aging process. I getting carded at the local stores. They want to know if I&#x27;m old enough to buy beer. Before they would just sell it too me! All my life my completion has been 3 different shades of brown, but now it&#x27;s just glowing, glorious, and beautiful!I use it all over my body. I take baths with black soap. I love! Love! Love! Love! Love this stuff. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase anything else anymore. Only shea butter, black soap, and baby wipes. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it and try it.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems fine, but I ordered this in August, which was a terrible mistake given the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a deli-like plastic container which easily cracked open. About 1/3 of it melted out all over the rest of my order and even through the cardboard box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was left with an oily sink, counters, and other purchased items that I had to clean up. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save ordering this one for the wintertime unless they fix their packaging.</li>
    <li> it came in damaged. the packaged wasn&#x27;t packaged well and scooping the shea butter out so i can place it in containers that i had to go out and buy was difficult because the shea butter is very thick. and since the whole bottom was broken during transit i lost a lot of shea butter to the floor while trying to scoop it out. so again i love the shea butter but hated the cheap packaging.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Some people have said it is grainy, but you just have to rub in between your hands until it melts and then apply it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, good price, shipped quickly. I&#x27;ll be back for more when I run out. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product itself is good but the packaging is crap... it was cracked and I was happy that it was not summertime or my product would have been all over the box and bubble wrap.  Definitely better packaging is needed.</li>
    <li> For my natural 4c hair, shea butter is a necessity when I&#x27;m just rocking the fro. This large package is keeping me from looking homely. Yay!</li>
    <li> Great buy...great product.  Keeps my skin from drying out  in the harsh winter wind.... helps protect it from the sun...in sunny Florida.</li>
    <li> Ok... So this Shea Butter is GREAT!!! :) I use it on my childrens&#x27; skin and hair. Smooth. Creamy. Melts well when rubbed between hands. Massages in well. Helps heal eczema on my hands. GO FOR IT!!! :) I&#x27;ve shopped around and this is the best deal... 32 oz. for  $16 and change. The first 32 oz. tub I bought from Saaqin only cost me $6 and change... Guess they&#x27;ve become well known for quality and so the price went up, but still a fraction of the price from other companies and I prefer this Shea Butter. It is filtered, but not processed and stripped of it&#x27;s natural nourishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I had was w Amamzon&#x27;s packing. They didn&#x27;t pack my tubs of Shea Butter very well and one came open due to being bounced around. Good thing I ordered 2 because one was a gift... I still had one sealed to use as the gift. I am using the broken open tub at home.</li>
    <li> This is now my second purchase. I love it because it&#x27;s removes my marks on my skin, it keeps my skin moist all day while I work in a/c office and it doesnot have a loud scent. I called this my miracle product. I&#x27;m also convincing other friends and family members to use it cause it good for the skin and do not contain any chemicals. I think thats the most important factor for my continuous use.  It&#x27;s a must have product but the only problem I encountered is that the package came damaged. The seller needs to improve on this.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend introduced me to this product almost one year ago and since then I&#x27;ve developed a strong liking for it. I much prefer this in its raw state as opposed to lotions etc which are processed. This really leaves my skin feeling smoother, richer and it&#x27;s as if I have an added layer of protection from the sun. I love the smell and texture of it; it has a subtle fragrance and it is soft enough to apply (in the event that it gets a bit hard I can simply microwave it for about 10 seconds to loosen it).I use it everywhere - on my face, in my hair and on my skin. It really does make your skin look and feel healthier and for the size, you&#x27;re really getting your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> It keeps my dry hands and feet moist, great to use in the shower as well.  I have recommended to my family.</li>
