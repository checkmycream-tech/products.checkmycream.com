<li> So I don&#x27;t think this is for long turm use.</li>
<li> This is helping with my chronic dry eye.</li>
<li> I have dry eyes, and I use this ointment every night.  </li>
<li> The Dr. gave me a couple of samples because my eyes are naturally dry.</li>
<li> So soothing for chronic dry eye.</li>
<li> In less than a second I can have a mess.&lt;br</li>
<li> Her eyes get very dry but the Refresh P.M. gives them moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend and will always keep purchasing.</li>
<li> I have very dry, itchy eyes and this product</li>
<li> So I use it only on my blind eye which really needs the overnight moisture.  </li>
<li> ointment is fairly thick so don&#x27;t plan on reading or trying to see the television or computer clearly.</li>
<li> My mom has a problem with her eyes due to an illness.</li>
<li> It requires only a small amount of ointment to do the job.</li>
<li> If my eyes are especially dry</li>
<li> I think it takes me a month and a half to go through one tube.</li>
<li> I can use a small drop in the daytime.</li>
<li> Not much better than gen type.</li>
<li> tube is very small and I have small hands.</li>
<li> I would have known that since it was an ointment it would be very thick.</li>
<li> Hated this stuff, could have stuck Vaseline in my eye for less $</li>
<li> Worst investment -_-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pricy, but they work well.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging. Love how well it works throughout the night. Instant relief from long day. I&#x27;ve had lasik and my eyes don&#x27;t close all the way while sleeping- this solves the problem.</li>
    <li> So soothing for chronic dry eye.</li>
    <li> This is helping with my chronic dry eye. It was suggested by my eye doctor.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, itchy eyes and this product used nightly is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! I apply liberally before bed, and my eyes feel great in the morning.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that using this night lubricant eye ointment would help with my dry eyes.  However, I cannot tell a difference when I use this product and when I dont.  For me, I am better of just using eye drops during the day as needed than using this product</li>
    <li> The idea of using an ointment which will not run down my face, is a good one.  However, the entire next 24 hours I struggled with blurred vision.  So I use it only on my blind eye which really needs the overnight moisture.  This isn&#x27;t the only product which left me with blurred vision the next day, so it&#x27;s not a mark against the product.</li>
    <li> These really helped my chronic dry eye at night!  My eye doc told me to buy these, and I was unsure about them.  I am happy to say that I am very happy that I did indeed buy this product!  My eyes and I thank you!</li>
    <li> Best PM medicine for dry eyes, it really works.</li>
    <li> The best, dramatically cured my dry eyes. Nothing like Refresh.</li>
    <li> Use it just before your head hits the pillow.  It&#x27;s an ointment so your vision will be blurry for a while after you apply it.</li>
    <li> Love this eye ointment.  Not as thick as others and being  more fluid it feels better in my eyes.  Also I can see pretty good with it in  while others that are more gooey, can&#x27;t see worth a darn.</li>
    <li> I have dry eyes, and I use this ointment every night.  It works very well for me.  I have used this product over twenty years.</li>
    <li> Good product, much cheaper than buying it locally</li>
    <li> I was using this after lasik as I had complications with healing and had a corneal tare. It worked well but then it made me feel a pain in my eye each morning, once I stopped using it was fine. So I don&#x27;t think this is for long turm use.</li>
    <li> Made my I feel better and it work. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> A great help for my eyes at night since my surgery.  My eyes do not dry out.</li>
    <li> great product! arrived on time!</li>
    <li> This product is good for keeping eyes moist for long periods of time.  It requires only a small amount of ointment to do the job.</li>
    <li> My father uses this product and it is just what he needs to keep his eyes lubricated during the night while he sleeps.  He highly recommends this product and wouldn&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> doctor recommended so I use it all the time</li>
    <li> I found this product when I had my first cataract removed. The Dr. gave me a couple of samples because my eyes are naturally dry. It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I would have known that since it was an ointment it would be very thick. It is!  It obviously blurs my vision but since it&#x27;s for nighttime use, that should be o.k. EXCEPT that my vision is still a bit blurry in the morning!</li>
    <li> OK if you don&#x27;t need to see.</li>
    <li> I am intolerant to preservatives and this product is preservative free.  It also does not cloud my vision as much as the other ointments.  If my eyes are especially dry I can use a small drop in the daytime.</li>
    <li> Hated this stuff, could have stuck Vaseline in my eye for less $</li>
    <li> Very good, longer lasting, great relief.</li>
    <li> It actually made my eyes drier than they were. I always woke up with headaches. Worst investment -_-</li>
    <li> Use this all the time. The perfect gel for folks with seriously dry eyes</li>
    <li> Perfect! I use this eye ointment as suggested by the Optometrist! I would not change to another brand!!</li>
    <li> Excellent, good product!</li>
    <li> My eyes tend to open while I sleep. My ophthalmologist recommended it after surgery to keep my eyes from drying out overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ointment is fairly thick so don&#x27;t plan on reading or trying to see the television or computer clearly. I think it takes me a month and a half to go through one tube. Sometimes getting the ointment to stop coming out of the tube is a feat unto itself. There have been several times when I unscrew the cap, set it on the counter and then realize that there is a stream of ointment hanging from the tube. In less than a second I can have a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is very small and I have small hands. Plus you have to make sure not to touch your eye with the point of the tube.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  Good product.</li>
    <li> My mom has a problem with her eyes due to an illness. Her eyes get very dry but the Refresh P.M. gives them moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend and will always keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> WORKS &amp;CHEAPER DOESN&#x27;T, BEST WITH REFRESH GEL</li>
    <li> I use this at bedtime and it seems to be working  quite well.  I like it better than the drops, which burn slightly and drops run  down side of face.</li>
    <li> Not sure that this is any better tha my clear eyes solution</li>
    <li> Not much better than gen type. For conveniences of applying, I&#x27;d pick a gel type.</li>
    <li> This really works well</li>
    <li> it is nice but doesn&#x27;t last the entire night</li>
    <li> excellent!  just as described! rapid delivery!</li>
