      <li>Another satisfied customer!  </li>
      <li>It holds my hair up well and looks elegant!  </li>
      <li>It would probably hold all my hair if I was more adept at styling it!</li>
      <li>and I already know I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
      <li>Vendor is top rate too!</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product!  </li>
      <li>Very fast delivery and very good quality..Have purchase quite a few...great product</li>
      <li>My hair is one length almost to my waist but very fine.</li>
      <li>And the seller included a lovely free gift of another kind of hair stick, which is really lovely!</li>
      <li>This is my first curved fork, and I&#x27;m super impressed with how well it functions.  </li>
      <li>This is a beautiful hair fork, and it really keeps my hair in place.</li>
      <li>It is pretty and the quality seems great.</li>
      <li>what more could you ask.  </li>

      <li>I LOVE my hair fork.</li>
      <li>and I hope to buy more from this seller.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and holds better</li>
      <li>It has a nice smooth finish</li>
      <li>I love the wood.</li>
      <li>Lovely and functional .......</li>
      <li>Recommend :)</li>
      <li>So much more ladylike than a plastic clip.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
      <li>Make sure to get the correct size though.</li>
      <li>(I use volumizing hair products and hair spray (use hair products BEFORE inserting stick to prevent damage to stick&#x27;s surface) to create more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; when using the hair stick.</li>
      <li>The seller even included a hand written note and a free aluminum fork to sample!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m always looking for better options.  </li>
      <li>I plan to purchase more and might request a special fork with my own design.</li>
      <li>I have long fine hair and this hair stick fits perfect,</li>
      <li>I have just above the waist-length fine smooth hair and the length of this hair fork is perfect to keep my hair secured in a coiled bun.</li>
      <li>The gentle curve fits nicely with the shape of my head and the length of the prongs are perfect in length as if this was custom made for me personally.</li>
      <li>I have waist length curly but fine hair that rips and gets damaged easily.</li>
      <li>This one is the PERFECT size for my hair, which is about down to my hips and of medium thickness.</li>
      <li>Add to that, they shipped it quickly, too!</li>
      <li>All this said, the seller did give me a free hair stick as well, and I like it.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am so happy with this purchase</li>
      <li>The seller is both prompt and attentive.</li>
      <li>The shop sent me a free hair stick along with it.</li>
      <li>Beautifully made, quick shipping, and even threw in an extra as a gift.</li>
      <li>The small fork works perfect.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to both new and experienced users of hair sticks.</li>
      <li>Will only have good things to say about product and the kindness from JWL Hawnkoa.</li>
      <li>Beautiful and great quality fork but a little too heavy for my fine hair, should work good on bigger hair</li>
      <li>It has such a fine smooth finish, and appears to have been sealed for hair-friendliness.&lt;br /&gt;I am already starting to fear the inevitable day when I lose this awesome stick, so I&#x27;m buying one or two more right now.  </li>
      <li>I like how it&#x27;s curved to lay along the curve of my scalp, and the wood is so pretty and so smooth.</li>
      <li>I will definitely order more products from this seller!</li>
      <li>This one completely fits the bill, works well, and is aesthetically appealing.</li>
      <li>No burrs or rough spots to catch in the hair, and the wood had a nice smooth finish to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a variety of wooden hair sticks from this vendor, and I&#x27;ve liked them all.</li>
      <li>This is such a nice hair pin...</li>
      <li>I also love the curve on the fork, it feels much more secure than my other one which is straight.</li>
      <li>length is perfect for a low-profile look, as the sticks don&#x27;t stick out far past the hair</li>
      <li>I think the person making these should pay very close attention to the grain of the wood, and be absolutely certain that it is as smooth as glass.  </li>
      <li>My only note: I would love to see more 3 prong forks and slightly wider spacing for more styling options.</li>
      <li>for fine long hair this size works fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m back for more.  </li>
      <li>My white hair has never looked better.</li>
      <li>Remember that you don&#x27;t need to make your hair into a super-tight bun, that just puts too much pressure on your head and the stick!</li>
      <li>The aluminum one is nice but a little harder for me to use, I think because it is straight unlike this which is nicely curved.</li>
      <li>and it is just so convenient and gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>As always, the quality of the product is impeccable--smoothly finished and gentle on hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>The seller was very understanding and sent another one promptly.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Total comfort and secure in wearing this pin.</li>
      <li>I love this and the other sticks I ordered.</li>
      <li>It took me a few tries to get it right, but I get fairly secure and very comfortable buns with this.</li>
      <li>I also like the little curve that makes it fit more snugly against the back of your head.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re good for securing long locs into buns and other updos without damaging my hair.</li>
      <li>The seller seems very eager to make things right as quickly as possible, and to please the buyer.</li>
      <li>And it does keep it secure without slipping or having to keep redoing it all day.</li>
      <li>The wood is treated very well for use in hair, and it&#x27;s pretty obvious that this wood will never splinter.  </li>
      <li>I have hair a few inches past my shoulder, and this holds a French twist up wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>They even included an aluminum hair fork just in case this wooden one ever broke, though I&#x27;ve had wooden hair sticks for years and they will last a long time IF they are taken good care of and not stressed</li>
      <li>wow</li>
      <li>I use both this size and the longer ones frequently.</li>
      <li>However, I think the curved 4.5&amp;#34; sticks are my favorites so far.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but very long (down to waist).</li>
      <li>If you have any other type of hair, you will absolutely adore this and wear it all the time!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I keep meaning to review this hair fork, because I wear it all the time. It&#x27;s great. Simple, well made, pretty, holds my thick hair. The shop sent me a free hair stick along with it. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great quality hair fork! Make sure to get the correct size though. I have tailbone length thick hair (4.5 in.  Pony circumference) and my 4-5inch fork will hold a half-up. It would probably hold all my hair if I was more adept at styling it! The protective updos still elude me! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and great quality fork but a little too heavy for my fine hair, should work good on bigger hair</li>
    <li> I LOVE my hair fork. I had never owned one before and was a little unsure of the price, but it was totally worth it. I have waist length curly but fine hair that rips and gets damaged easily. I have been using it for months and it is just so convenient and gentle on my hair. I keep it with me in my purse to use when needed. It doesn&#x27;t catch or rip my hair like clips or ponytails do. It took me a few tries to get it right, but I get fairly secure and very comfortable buns with this. The seller even included a hand written note and a free aluminum fork to sample! The aluminum one is nice but a little harder for me to use, I think because it is straight unlike this which is nicely curved. Overall, I am so happy with this purchase and I hope to buy more from this seller.</li>
    <li> These hair forks are a great buy. I&#x27;m back for more.  They&#x27;re good for securing long locs into buns and other updos without damaging my hair. I use both this size and the longer ones frequently. I like the selection of different types of wood and sizes, the quality, and the price. My only note: I would love to see more 3 prong forks and slightly wider spacing for more styling options. I definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> My first one arrived, broken in shipping.  The seller was very understanding and sent another one promptly.  The second package actually had two in it.  One of them broke upon me trying to use it in my hair.  Actually, it had a rough spot on it where it looks like the grain of the wood was of poorer quality.  This part snagged on my hair, breaking it, and I was unable to insert it into my hair any further.  So, I took it out and inspected it, and it was actually partway broken at the rough spot.  The other is intact, and I think I can use it.  I think the breakage problem lies in &amp;#34;knots&amp;#34; in the wood, and poor packaging.  I think the person making these should pay very close attention to the grain of the wood, and be absolutely certain that it is as smooth as glass.  Any tiny bit of roughness will break hair, and could also be a weak point in the fork.  All this said, the seller did give me a free hair stick as well, and I like it.  The seller seems very eager to make things right as quickly as possible, and to please the buyer.</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful. But, if I get it tight enough to hold my hair, it gives me a headache. If I make it loose enough to not give me a headache, my hair slips out.</li>
    <li> I received the package a couple days after I ordered, consider that I live in the northeast, this is expected. The wood is a little darker than in the picture but this is expected because this is a natural wood product. It is beautifully simple. It has a nice smooth finish and I found this specific hair fork to be far less painful to use and keep in for a long day than the plastic coated metal ones. I will definitely repurchase these soon.</li>
    <li> I get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> The quality of the workmanship of this hair fork was great. No burrs or rough spots to catch in the hair, and the wood had a nice smooth finish to it. It&#x27;s not too heavy so as to be uncomfortable, but not too flimsy so as to break easily. I also like the little curve that makes it fit more snugly against the back of your head. I have just above the waist-length fine smooth hair and the length of this hair fork is perfect to keep my hair secured in a coiled bun. And it does keep it secure without slipping or having to keep redoing it all day.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the hair forks...they are of good quality, workmanship and color. My hair is one length almost to my waist but very fine. The small fork works perfect. Recommend :)</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but very long (down to waist). This hair fork works perfectly for me, but someone with thicker hair may want a longer fork. They even included an aluminum hair fork just in case this wooden one ever broke, though I&#x27;ve had wooden hair sticks for years and they will last a long time IF they are taken good care of and not stressed (care instructions are included with packaging as well). It is good quality and finished well so it doesn&#x27;t snag hairs. I am very pleased with it. Would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Total comfort and secure in wearing this pin. The gentle curve fits nicely with the shape of my head and the length of the prongs are perfect in length as if this was custom made for me personally. I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice hair pin...it holds my hair - most of the things I&#x27;ve tried will push out of my hair within 20 mins</li>
    <li> Beautiful and easy to use. I love it!! I have hair a few inches past my shoulder, and this holds a French twist up wonderfully.  So much more ladylike than a plastic clip.  Remember that you don&#x27;t need to make your hair into a super-tight bun, that just puts too much pressure on your head and the stick!</li>
    <li> Lovely and functional ....... what more could you ask.  Vendor is top rate too!</li>
    <li> Very nice hair stick.  It holds my hair up well and looks elegant!  Thanks for a great product!  I love the wood.</li>
    <li> It was beautiful and well packaged. It arrived in a timely manner. It worked wonderfully for the two days I had it but it fell out of my hair at work while I was shoveling snow and I haven&#x27;t seen it since</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair fork, and it really keeps my hair in place. I like how it&#x27;s curved to lay along the curve of my scalp, and the wood is so pretty and so smooth. Add to that, they shipped it quickly, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a variety of wooden hair sticks from this vendor, and I&#x27;ve liked them all. However, I think the curved 4.5&amp;#34; sticks are my favorites so far. Even though I have long, very thick hair (and used to buy the 6&amp;#34; sticks), the 4.5&amp;#34; length holds very securely. As always, the quality of the product is impeccable--smoothly finished and gentle on hair and scalp. The seller is both prompt and attentive. I wish all businesses would be run this well!</li>
    <li> for fine long hair this size works fine. maybe go with 6&#x27;&#x27; if you have thick hair. i got it to give my hair some rest from pulling and tugging of metal and plastic. started using only natural bristle wooden brushes few month ago and wooden hair sticks&amp;forks. wow what a difference! you can learn how to use forks and sticks on youtube. next time im getting 3 prong one. this fork is very sturdy, a little curved to the shape of the head.</li>
    <li> Will only have good things to say about product and the kindness from JWL Hawnkoa. Very fast delivery and very good quality..Have purchase quite a few...great product</li>
    <li> I love this and the other sticks I ordered. Beautifully made, quick shipping, and even threw in an extra as a gift. Definitely will order again!</li>
    <li> I am a hair stick aficionado, and have waist length, thick, fine hair, so I definitely put sticks to the test.  I&#x27;ve experienced the worst of the worst when it comes to sticks (breaking in my hair, wood splintering and pulling out hair, etc.) so I&#x27;m always looking for better options.  This hair stick has become my all-time favorite, and I hardly use my other hair sticks anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The length is perfect for a low-profile look, as the sticks don&#x27;t stick out far past the hair it&#x27;s securing.  The two forks mean I can wrap all of my hair into a bun, and secure it all day long with only one item.  This is my first curved fork, and I&#x27;m super impressed with how well it functions.  The wood is treated very well for use in hair, and it&#x27;s pretty obvious that this wood will never splinter.  It has such a fine smooth finish, and appears to have been sealed for hair-friendliness.&lt;br /&gt;I am already starting to fear the inevitable day when I lose this awesome stick, so I&#x27;m buying one or two more right now.  I highly recommend to both new and experienced users of hair sticks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite hair fork! Lightweight and holds better then my other hair forks do because of the curved shape.</li>
    <li> Another satisfied customer!  I have made several purchases for hair sticks and hair forks from JWL and have never been disappointed.  Each product is well-made, looks great in buns and twists.  Each package included a personal note from the owner.  I plan to purchase more and might request a special fork with my own design.</li>
    <li> I just received the fork today and it is already is in my hair. I love it!! I watched a you tube on how to use a wooden hair fork. My hair is in a beautiful twist. I will also use it for a cinnibun hair style. It is pretty and the quality seems great. My white hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this fork because I have one that is a couple of inches longer, but I hate how it sticks out so much when I use it to make a bun. This one is the PERFECT size for my hair, which is about down to my hips and of medium thickness. A woman that has very long and very thick hair would want a slightly longer fork, but for shorter hair, or hair that isn&#x27;t too thick this is perfect! I also love the curve on the fork, it feels much more secure than my other one which is straight.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair and this hair stick fits perfect, Looks good and comfy! I&#x27;m hooked on hair sticks.</li>
    <li> Awesome seller. Got these within days and they are beautiful quality!  This is my second purchase and I already know I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this design in a hair stick for a very long time. (Years) This one completely fits the bill, works well, and is aesthetically appealing. My problem is my hair is baby fine and thin - so it&#x27;s a little hard to get the stick to stay put. The smoothness of the wood makes it easier to slip out of fine, thin hair such as mine. If you have any other type of hair, you will absolutely adore this and wear it all the time! I&#x27;m keeping my hair long enough so I can use the stick and keep my hair up. (I use volumizing hair products and hair spray (use hair products BEFORE inserting stick to prevent damage to stick&#x27;s surface) to create more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; when using the hair stick. That seems to help a lot. And the seller included a lovely free gift of another kind of hair stick, which is really lovely! I will definitely order more products from this seller!</li>
