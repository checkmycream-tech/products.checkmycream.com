### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>with best regard     farideh  Vasseghi</li>
      <li>burns with excellent results.  </li>
      <li>It has to have the bio-dyne in it to work the best!</li>
      <li>One eye reacts especially strong here.</li>
      <li>35 years ago I was told that Sperti&#x27;s Bio-Dyne was great for burns</li>
      <li>I am so happy to find prep h with bio dyne.</li>
      <li>Incredible product better than any cream out there.</li>
      <li>I had tried the US Prep H and had some good results, but read that there is rebound from its ingredients - so I tried the Canadian.  </li>
      <li>but I purchased this product because I read somewhere that this is good for puffy eyes, and bags under the eyes.</li>
      <li>The formulation is superior to the USA brand</li>
      <li>Also, it is awesome for its original use for hemorrhoids.</li>
      <li>and I think my eyes look better within minutes!</li>
      <li>Love the stuff!</li>
      <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the prepsration H alone, or a combination of under-eye treatments.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this kind of Preparation-H for years as an under eye puffiness cream &amp;</li>
      <li>If this is what the US formula can do, it would be amazing to see what the original from Canada would do!</li>
      <li>it was okay.  </li>
      <li>look more baggy.</li>
      <li>SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.</li>
      <li>I look much better without the bags.</li>
      <li>course, the Bio-dyne version makes a better hemorrhoid treatment, too.</li>
      <li>Thank you :)</li>
      <li>I have no idea why the FDA removed the bio-dyne from the USA version, because it makes the product a hundred times better.</li>
      <li>I try to take good care of myself, eat right, drink lots of water, but still time was taking a toll.  </li>
      <li>I do however, always use it a week or two before an important event.  </li>
      <li>The product is available as a cream or an ointment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So So happy, i&#x27;ll bring LOTS of the Canadian formulation back to the US when I return...</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>I went to order it on line and found that the special yeast ingrediant was banned by the FDA but was available in the product from Canada.  </li>
      <li>I gave it two stars instead of one, because I assume it still works for its originally intended purpose.  </li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m really overtired (which is most of the time)</li>
      <li>I feel the skin tightening and shrinking (which, if you think about it, is exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do if you use it in the area you are supposed to use it!</li>
      <li>I used it on my face with some success.  </li>
      <li>I tried this with the Bio-dyne and it was a hundred times better, in fact a little dab in and around my &#x27;hole&#x27; after my morning shower, makes me comfortable and problem free the whole day.</li>
      <li>My wrinkles and puffiness under my eyes had subsided so much that co workers were commenting how fresh my skin was looking.  </li>
      <li>First of all I used this for cosmetic reasons..</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>it really works; I&#x27;m 60 y/o now!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use the product from Canada that much and except for the odor</li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>But if you are like me and have chronic allergies that keep your eyes swollen with seemingly no solution - I am not kidding, this stuff really helps.</li>
      <li>Again, I may be crazy, but I think it works and that makes me happy!!!</li>
      <li>Although the original Sperti&#x27;s had a distinct odor as did the Preparation - H, the odor of the product from Canada was different, less strong, but I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
      <li>And, oh yeah, the smell will definitely remind you of what the creme is originally intended for...at what price beauty, ladies?</li>
      <li>When Preparation H was first developed in the U.S., it contained Bio-dyne, discovered to aid wound healing and signs of aging.</li>
      <li>Just prior to receiving the order, my wife found a very old tube of preparation - H which had the special yeast ingredient.  </li>
      <li>I tried all the &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; creams, some highly recommended by famous actors and at a high cost of over $200 for a small jar.  </li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m not seeing any of the anticipated results--Will provide an update after a little more use.  </li>
      <li>I live in Canada</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also using Dr. Perricone&#x27;s Advanced Eye Therapy, and am now starting to use sunscreen daily.  </li>
      <li>Once I got past the idea of using butt creme under my eyes, I was pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>Truthfully, it has a nomimal effect on my puffiness, but it is actually starting to lighten up my hereditary dark circles, and believe me, I have tried just about everything (now, I can add butt creme to my list).  </li>
      <li>I really do look years younger.</li>
      <li>some days, not everyday, because of this I didn&#x27;t see anything diffrent befor.   </li>
      <li>WOW.</li>
      <li>I purchased this cr&amp;egrave;me for my under eyes bags since I read an article that said the models useS it for the same reason and the one sold in the united states would not be the right one to buy as it does not give the same results as the Canadian ph. got it and it does not do any thing for the bags.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still a little concerned whether it is ok for long term use, but hey, Retinol can also be harmful if used continuously as well.  </li>
      <li>and I will never go back to using the new, \\&quot;improved\\&quot; ineffectual product again!</li>
      <li>I am lucky that I don&#x27;t get the large swelling and major bleeding like some people do, but I am still plagued with itching, and burning and a little spotted bleeding occasionally.</li>
      <li>Years later, the company discontinued the product but the manufacture said you could get the exact same product in their Preparation - H.  </li>
      <li>Apparently, movie stars frequently used it.</li>
      <li>I use it daily on my face and everyone comments on how young I look!</li>
      <li>Retinol based products were at the top of the list, but I found they were very harsh, causing dryness, redness, with not much results.  </li>
      <li>This particular product takes care of the loose skin around the neck.  </li>

<li> This particular product takes care of the loose skin around the neck.  </li>
<li> Still not completely convinced, I stopped using it and within about a week, I noticed the wrinkles slowing coming back.  </li>
<li> (I know, strange use).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been cursed or bothered with minor hemorrhoid&#x27;s for a lot of years.</li>
<li> Noting has EVER worked liek this, not by a long shot.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have enough experience with it to recomment it one way or the other.  </li>
<li> I have trouble with one eye in particular and after an application of this cream the under eye area is smoother and less puffy.  </li>
<li> so I picked up a tube for less than $10 at the local Pharmacy.  </li>
<li> So be careful about getting the correct product.</li>
<li> Still smells fishy like the US version, But is is helping with the wrinkles and also has helped heal some rough skin on my hands.</li>
<li> I had absolutely no results with this product.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also been looking into long term use as there is little data on using on the face</li>
<li> However, it is not as unpleasant as having my under eye cut open, fat removed, and sewn up again, and a good deal less expensive.</li>
<li> /&gt;The Bio-dyne version can be found in Canada and other countries.</li>
<li> I have suffered years of increasingly baggy eyes due to allergies.</li>
<li> and I have not found any product that tightens the skin under the eye and reduces dark circles like this product.</li>
<li> , anyway, tried it been about a week now, I can tell no difference in my eyes or rest of face, it leaves a weird feeling sort of oily, I really don&#x27;t like it, It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my eyes or face feel firmer or less puffy  at all</li>
<li> I had read a lot about the Canadian preparation H with Bio-dyne as being a solution to puffy eyes, but I had trouble believing it.  </li>
<li> I have mistakenly bought that version in the past.</li>
<li> I my upper eyes lids are puffy and I also sometimes have puffiness below the eye because of allergies or bad sleep.  </li>
<li> After a week, using just a small amount on the wrinkles under my eyes, I couldn&#x27;t believe the results!!  </li>
<li> I moved to Toronto and they got WAY worse for some reason.</li>
<li> I tired Preparation H with Biodyne</li>
<li> When I use this product, it does seem to plump out or fill in my thin wrinkles around my mouth &amp; eyes.</li>
<li> I give it a thumbs up even though it was expensive.</li>
<li> As for the smell: yes it has an unpleasant smell.  </li>
<li> Afterward, my face was quite burned and painful.  </li>
<li> I may be crazy, but I think it works!  </li>
<li> At 58 years of age, looking at myself in the mirror was getting very depressing.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried the preparation h cream sold in the stores here in the USA, and for me it was worthless.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Hello  I am Farideh  Vasseghi  I used this item (preparation H ) some days, not everyday, because of this I didn&#x27;t see anything diffrent befor.   Please let me know how can I use as (face skin cream).      with best regard     farideh  Vasseghi</li>
    <li> Sometimes my eyes develop bags under them and sometimes the bags go away.  I look much better without the bags. After reading reviews on Amazon, I tried the Canadian Prep H cream to see if it could reduce the size of the bags.  Yes, it does.  I have trouble with one eye in particular and after an application of this cream the under eye area is smoother and less puffy.  As for the smell: yes it has an unpleasant smell.  However, it is not as unpleasant as having my under eye cut open, fat removed, and sewn up again, and a good deal less expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this same cream from ebay,(from Canada) It smells like (it was made to put on your rear end) Can&#x27;t quite describe it, anyway, tried it been about a week now, I can tell no difference in my eyes or rest of face, it leaves a weird feeling sort of oily, I really don&#x27;t like it, It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my eyes or face feel firmer or less puffy  at all, I see it may be working for some people, but not for me, (I won&#x27;t buy it again) (I paid $15.00 for it on Ebay..&lt;br /&gt;so if you want to try it, for heavens sake don&#x27;t pay too much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yuck!!(not 4 me) Oregon</li>
    <li> Once I got past the idea of using butt creme under my eyes, I was pleased with the results.  Truthfully, it has a nomimal effect on my puffiness, but it is actually starting to lighten up my hereditary dark circles, and believe me, I have tried just about everything (now, I can add butt creme to my list).  To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the prepsration H alone, or a combination of under-eye treatments.  I&#x27;m also using Dr. Perricone&#x27;s Advanced Eye Therapy, and am now starting to use sunscreen daily.  And, oh yeah, the smell will definitely remind you of what the creme is originally intended for...at what price beauty, ladies?</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m not seeing any of the anticipated results--Will provide an update after a little more use.  caf</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this kind of Preparation-H for years as an under eye puffiness cream &amp; it really works; I&#x27;m 60 y/o now!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find prep h with bio dyne. I have been an esthetician for 15 years and I have not found any product that tightens the skin under the eye and reduces dark circles like this product. My friend uses it on her entire face and it looks as if she had a face lift. Also, it is awesome for its original use for hemorrhoids.</li>
    <li> First of all I used this for cosmetic reasons..Not hemroids.  Since it is said to help under eye bags.  Tried this product for about 4 weeks.  Did nothing at all to improve my bags.</li>
    <li> I had read a lot about the Canadian preparation H with Bio-dyne as being a solution to puffy eyes, but I had trouble believing it.  It really works.  I realize that the product was not intended for this purpose, so I try not to use it if I don&#x27;t need it. But if you are like me and have chronic allergies that keep your eyes swollen with seemingly no solution - I am not kidding, this stuff really helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cursed or bothered with minor hemorrhoid&#x27;s for a lot of years. I am lucky that I don&#x27;t get the large swelling and major bleeding like some people do, but I am still plagued with itching, and burning and a little spotted bleeding occasionally. I&#x27;ve tried the preparation h cream sold in the stores here in the USA, and for me it was worthless. I tried this with the Bio-dyne and it was a hundred times better, in fact a little dab in and around my &#x27;hole&#x27; after my morning shower, makes me comfortable and problem free the whole day. I have no idea why the FDA removed the bio-dyne from the USA version, because it makes the product a hundred times better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cr&amp;egrave;me for my under eyes bags since I read an article that said the models useS it for the same reason and the one sold in the united states would not be the right one to buy as it does not give the same results as the Canadian ph. got it and it does not do any thing for the bags. the say its the biodyne that tightens-up the skin and reduces the appearance of the bags well thEY must have forgotten to add that ingredient when they made the batch for sale cause all this did was made my under my eyes look more baggy. GUESS THIS ONLY TIGHTEN THE HIP AREA SINCE THIS IS WHAT IT ACTUALLY FOR. SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.</li>
    <li> I my upper eyes lids are puffy and I also sometimes have puffiness below the eye because of allergies or bad sleep.  I had tried the US Prep H and had some good results, but read that there is rebound from its ingredients - so I tried the Canadian.  I had absolutely no results with this product.  I am very disappointed.  I gave it two stars instead of one, because I assume it still works for its originally intended purpose.  I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, so I haven&#x27;t tried it for that.</li>
    <li> When I use this product, it does seem to plump out or fill in my thin wrinkles around my mouth &amp; eyes.</li>
    <li> Actually, it does just as well on swollen eyes as it does on itchy butt bubbles (aka hemorrhoids) so go out and grab some today (the cream, not the butt bubbles).</li>
    <li> 35 years ago I was told that Sperti&#x27;s Bio-Dyne was great for burns and I used it on a number of sun burns with excellent results.  Years later, the company discontinued the product but the manufacture said you could get the exact same product in their Preparation - H.  Recently, I underwent a 17 day Efudex treatment for pre-cancerous keratosis.  Afterward, my face was quite burned and painful.  To help in my recovery I remembered Sperti&#x27;s.  I went to order it on line and found that the special yeast ingrediant was banned by the FDA but was available in the product from Canada.  Hence, I ordered the product from there.  Although the original Sperti&#x27;s had a distinct odor as did the Preparation - H, the odor of the product from Canada was different, less strong, but I didn&#x27;t like it.  Just prior to receiving the order, my wife found a very old tube of preparation - H which had the special yeast ingredient.  I used it on my face with some success.  I didn&#x27;t use the product from Canada that much and except for the odor it was okay.  I don&#x27;t have enough experience with it to recomment it one way or the other.  I definitely didn&#x27;t use either product for hemroids.</li>
    <li> Just what I had requested, even tho I had to get it from Canada as the US doesn&#x27;t have this product.</li>
    <li> I have suffered years of increasingly baggy eyes due to allergies. I moved to Toronto and they got WAY worse for some reason. One eye reacts especially strong here. After a year of air filters, cleaning, rinsing, sealing doors, etc etc, etc....I tired Preparation H with Biodyne (Shark Liver Oil 3.0%, Bio-Dyne 1%). WOW. Noting has EVER worked liek this, not by a long shot. Puffiness GONE. Preparation H thank you and PLEASE continue to make this formultion!! So So happy, i&#x27;ll bring LOTS of the Canadian formulation back to the US when I return...</li>
    <li> ...but I purchased this product because I read somewhere that this is good for puffy eyes, and bags under the eyes. This one has an ingredient that you can&#x27;t get  in U.S. so I had to get the one from Canada.  I may be crazy, but I think it works!  When I&#x27;m really overtired (which is most of the time) I put this under my eyes I feel the skin tightening and shrinking (which, if you think about it, is exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do if you use it in the area you are supposed to use it! ;-) and I think my eyes look better within minutes! Again, I may be crazy, but I think it works and that makes me happy!!! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as an undereye cream. (I know, strange use). After reading reviews on the web, I noted that the Canadian cream is the only Prep-H with Bio-dyne. Still smells fishy like the US version, But is is helping with the wrinkles and also has helped heal some rough skin on my hands. I give it a thumbs up even though it was expensive. Ah, the price of beauty!</li>
    <li> I started using Preparation H on my face nightly 6 months ago. It has shrink my pores and eliminated wrinkles. If this is what the US formula can do, it would be amazing to see what the original from Canada would do!</li>
    <li> For reasons unkown to me, this product cannot be purchased in the USA.  The formulation is superior to the USA brand and I will never go back to using the new, \\&quot;improved\\&quot; ineffectual product again!</li>
    <li> When Preparation H was first developed in the U.S., it contained Bio-dyne, discovered to aid wound healing and signs of aging. Apparently, movie stars frequently used it. But years later, the FDA discovered clinical-testing irregularities in the product and would not approve Bio-dyne&#x27;s use unless clinical testing was done all over again. The company couldn&#x27;t afford it, so it began producing the ointment and cream without that ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bio-dyne version can be found in Canada and other countries. BUT Canada also sells Preparation H without Bi-Dyne. I have mistakenly bought that version in the past. So be careful about getting the correct product. Those people who saw no results may have made my mistake. The product is available as a cream or an ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the Bio-dyne version makes a better hemorrhoid treatment, too.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product to use for cosmetic purposes to tighten wrinkled skin.It did not appear to have any effect at all.</li>
    <li> I use it daily on my face and everyone comments on how young I look! Love the stuff! It has to have the bio-dyne in it to work the best!</li>
    <li> At 58 years of age, looking at myself in the mirror was getting very depressing.  I try to take good care of myself, eat right, drink lots of water, but still time was taking a toll.  I tried all the &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; creams, some highly recommended by famous actors and at a high cost of over $200 for a small jar.  Retinol based products were at the top of the list, but I found they were very harsh, causing dryness, redness, with not much results.  I read about using Preparation H and thought, hey, I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  I live in Canada so I picked up a tube for less than $10 at the local Pharmacy.  After a week, using just a small amount on the wrinkles under my eyes, I couldn&#x27;t believe the results!!  My wrinkles and puffiness under my eyes had subsided so much that co workers were commenting how fresh my skin was looking.  Still not completely convinced, I stopped using it and within about a week, I noticed the wrinkles slowing coming back.  I am totally convinced.  I&#x27;ve been researching Bio-dyne and it is also proven as a healing tool for burn victims.  I&#x27;ve also been looking into long term use as there is little data on using on the face so I don&#x27;t use it continuously.  I do however, always use it a week or two before an important event.  I&#x27;m still a little concerned whether it is ok for long term use, but hey, Retinol can also be harmful if used continuously as well.  So far so good.  I really do look years younger.</li>
