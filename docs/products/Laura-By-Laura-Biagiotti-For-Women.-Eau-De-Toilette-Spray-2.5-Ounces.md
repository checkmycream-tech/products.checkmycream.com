      <li>This seller apparently is diluting the perfume.</li>

    <li> The product I received smelled great! I believe it&#x27;s the original one. Being an eau de toilette it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the perfume though...but it does last for one day for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to any of my friends</li>
    <li> My mother in law purchased this perfume a few years ago in paris and ever since then she has not been able to find it anywhere. I was very excited to have found it on Amazon and surprise her for mothers day. I had no idea what it smelled like and I wanted to know why she LOVED this perfume so much. All I can say is: classic... it smells very nice. not too strong, not too soft. I would definitely recommend it...</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my sister as she has worn it for years!! She cant find it easily in England so its always extra special when she gets it. 80)</li>
    <li> The box was dirty and completely damaged. I did not had the time to send it back and the days passed, but I was surprised to receive a merchandise in such bad condition.</li>
    <li> That is what my friends and I call this perfume.  It&#x27;s a huge hit with men and women.  Light and feminine, I always have atleast 2-3 bottles around just in case I run out.  I&#x27;ve never gotten more compliments on any of my scents than with Laura.  I hope they keep making it forever!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume !! and has also a very good price compare to the one in stores.</li>
    <li> This fragrance&#x27;s creations dates back to 1994 ans is one of most successful creations alongside the Roma fragrance. Laura is classified as a gentle floral, not at all overwhelming her personality. Fresh top: peach, lychee and watermelon, floral middle: freesia, violet and iris and ambered top note with sandalwood, vanilla, vetiver, amber and musk. It&#x27;s a very summer eau de toilette, excellent for daily use and recommended with the shower gel and lotion for a more intense effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume for years.It&#x27;s light, fresh with delicate sweetens.  It&#x27;s kind of hard to find it in stores , so I was very glad to get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I first saw this perfume while teaching in Estonia but the price was too high - so glad I can get it at home for an excellent price! Didn&#x27;t take long for delivery, either!</li>
    <li> i love this scent.  it does seem to me to be lighter....less lasting than my previous bottle, which was purchased in germany.</li>
    <li> First, there was no cellophane around the perfume box, and second, the smell of rubbing alcohol is so strong. I can hardly smell the perfume, and I&#x27;ve had 4 bottles previously-not from here. I immediately tried to return it to Amazon and it states I can not return it because it is a flammable liquid? They can sell it to me but refuse to take it back! I&#x27;ve been anxiously awaiting my perfume and I feel completely ripped off!!!</li>
    <li> so nice an unobtrusive, I have been using it for years and get tons of complements on it - love it!</li>
    <li> BEWARE!! This seller apparently is diluting the perfume. My wife is from overseas and has bought this many times from reputable shops. Obviously not the same strength. My wife has noticed it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all before the scent has dissapated.The perfume level was lower than normal and the box was not wrapped as another reviewer pointed out. Nothing about this product felt right or retail. When your gut instinctively tells you this is not the same product you&#x27;ve bought a dozen times before, trust your gut. Unfortunately, we are just out the cost, but you don&#x27;t have to be. MOVE ON. DON&#x27;T BUY.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box of Laura Eau de Toilette, I found that the liquid was&lt;br /&gt;about three inches from the top of the bottle.  Looked like a used bottle&lt;br /&gt;and smelled *old*.  I have a friend that wore *Laura* and it smelled really&lt;br /&gt;good.  I noticed when I purchased this bottle of Laura that there were other&lt;br /&gt;scents with this name.  I was very disappointed in this product but perhaps&lt;br /&gt;the other scents of Laura are better??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Jones</li>
    <li> This is my fifth bottle.....can never get tired of this scent! Arrived quickly too.</li>
    <li> Great product and prompt deliver</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Have worn it for over ten years. Very unique  and smells very different on each person yet is still identifiable. difficult to explain but sure anyone would love this scent!</li>
    <li> My Grandma purchased this perfume for my mother, whose name is Laura, over in France years and years ago.  It is now one of my Mom&#x27;s favorite perfume&#x27;s.  Very elegant and subtle smelling.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product without ever seeing or smelling it.  I do not like the scent.  The bottle is only 3/4 full; it looks like it has been used.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately for me I only read the reviews after I&#x27;d ordered 2 bottles and smelt a rat! I have been using Laura for years and usually only buy it whilst on holiday abroad - I know what it should smell like! TOTALLY AGREE DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!! I AM SO ANGRY!</li>
    <li> My wife is using Laura for years. We always bought it in Europe. We can not find it here in any store. So we ordered it. What a mistake. Even the plastic wrap around the Box is not original and so poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume it self has hardly any smell only alcohol with something!?!!!??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT BY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine brought this to me, from Canada, as a gift years ago and I have been using it ever since.  I just love the light scent.  It is really hard to find and it is never carried in any of the stores.  Amazon always comes through and at a reasonable price.</li>
