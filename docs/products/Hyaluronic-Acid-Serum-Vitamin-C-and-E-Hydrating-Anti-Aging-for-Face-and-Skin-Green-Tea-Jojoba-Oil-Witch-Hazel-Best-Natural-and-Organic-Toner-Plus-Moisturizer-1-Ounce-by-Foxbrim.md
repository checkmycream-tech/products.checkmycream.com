<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Please see my previous review of Vitamin C serum by Foxbrim. Both are equally effective and I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My eyes have fewer lines, and my laugh lines too.  I can put it all over my eyelids, without making my eyes water all day.  I&#x27;m hyper sensitive there.  Doesn&#x27;t take but a drop or two. Works better than higher priced items I&#x27;ve tried.  Downside, has a small shine to it. Have to use powder to cover.  But my favorite tool in my makeup box.&lt;br /&gt;My little secret :-)</li>
    <li> I was a huge skeptic of these types of serums and wasn&#x27;t convinced they&#x27;d be effective. After receiving this product I am blown away! My face feels immediately tighter, healthier, and overall great. Id highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 days now. I am very pleased with this and all things by the Foxbrim Company. I highly recommend their products. This one I thought would be greasy since it is a serum, but that is not the case at all. It even smells good. It was very light weight and left my skin feeling and looking much younger and softer. Foxbrim is a company you can trust and grow to love.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product, I am 51 years old and have never followed a consistent skin care regiment. A few drops covers the whole face and results are seen in just a few days. And the more you use, the better it gets!! Pores are smaller, the small broken spider veins around my cheeks and face are fading, no more breaks outs of adult acne and my skin is so soft and smooth to the touch! I love telling people how old my children are and having them say I look too young  for kids that old and must have good genetics!</li>
    <li> I have great expectations for this product.  So far I can see some lessening of lines around the eyes.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is very a versatile product. You can use it for so many things from healing scars and burns to hydrate your skin and help aging. I use this daily for a lot of things. It is high quality and over all amazing product. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great product to cover a ton of uses! It also shipped quick!</li>
    <li> Takes a lot to do any good and this is very high priced.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t taken miracles away yet.</li>
    <li> Bought for spouse, did not like it.</li>
    <li> Another great find!  This product has worked well so far!  It&#x27;s made a believer out of me.</li>
    <li> Makes skin look smoother and look healthier!! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I can tell a big difference in my my skin and my daughters have noticed also. They ask what I&#x27;ve been using because my skin looks so much more smoother and youthful.  Now they are using it and love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product does not cause irritation or acne... Moisturizing and freshness .. but the size of a small bottel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a while now and I love the way it makes my skin feel. Makes it feel young (I mean, granted, I&#x27;m only 23, but at my age I&#x27;m only growing older not younger), soft and beautiful! It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. It is not sticky to your face at all when you apply it. Like I said, it absorbs pretty quickly leaving you with the softest of soft face! This serum also leaves your skin feeling and looking more even and gives you a perfect glow. I absolutely love the smell of this serum; it is one of my favorite qualities of this serum.  It has a rose petal smell to it which I absolutely adore! Just smelling it makes me feel super relaxed and after I apply it to my face I feel a calmness while reaping the benefits of the hyaluronic serum. This serum is great too because it has a perfect consistency. If and when you buy this, you will notice that this serum is thick and has value to what you paid for; it is not watery at all!</li>
    <li> I do like this serum. I do notice fine lines are gone, and deep ones are smaller. Love :Love it.  Jenny</li>
    <li> I love the Hyaluronic Acid Serum!!&lt;br /&gt;After a few applications my face feels smooth and looks very healthy with a glow all over!&lt;br /&gt;I am also using the product with a vitamin C  face cream.  I will definitely order more and keep using the product!</li>
    <li> seems to be working. people ask me about my face....how smooth my skin looks, and what is your secret?</li>
    <li> good item, will order again, great for the face, great price</li>
    <li> I recently purchase the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and although I am new to this product I can already see a difference in my skin...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really noticed any changes on my skin, I&#x27;m on my third bottle now, not sure why, still hoping I guess.</li>
    <li> Works so well. I love how it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
    <li> Several weeks ago, I received a bottle of Foxbrim&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum to review. I must admit, I was initially a bit leery to try any product with the word acid in it!  But, after doing a bit of research on the ingredients, I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression of the serum is from the product packaging. The bottle is made of a thick glass and the serum is dispensed via a dropper. I have used products packaged similar to this, but this particular product packaging was a bit higher in quality. At one point, the bottle even slipped out of my hand, and the bottle didn&#x27;t even chip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you open the bottle, you will find a little dropper, which dispenses the serum almost perfectly. I was a bit concerned the serum may be runny, sticky, too fragrant, or hard to apply - but, it was none of those! The serum is light-weight, but not too runny so that it&#x27;s hard to apply. It does have a bit of a fragrance, but that disappeared after the serum dried on my face.  The serum also absorbed into the skin rather quickly, and left my skin feeling quite soft. I initially was only using the serum in the mornings, after I applied toner, but recently started applying at night as well, followed up by a bit of moisturizer (I have skin that is slightly dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as whether all this product claims to do is true or not, I can&#x27;t quite say, as I have only been using it a few weeks. But, I have noticed my face is much softer, clearer, and my under-eye circles are less noticeable! I will definitely continue to use this product as part as my beauty routine - plus, with the company offering a 100% money back guarantee, you can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note: As with all skin care products, I would advise performing an allergy test first**</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I have used several other Hydraulic serums before and I expected this to be about the same. It was so highly recommended that I decided to try it. Boy was I surprised. This is far superior to others I have tried. My skin is so much pumper, brighter and softer.It is not just Hyaluronic Acid... There&#x27;s so many additional potent ingredients that make this Serum unique and effective. I am very pleased with this and will continue using it instead of any of the others I have used in the past. This is thicker too and makes it so much easier to apply eavenly.</li>
    <li> I love this serum - it&#x27;s made out of essential/high quality ingredients for healthy skin. It absorbs nicely and does leave my skin feeling smooth and soft. The applicator is easy to use, too.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!!  I can see the difference in just a few applications, Smoother and Softer.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid with Vitamin C and E. Now I am sure you are thinking what is vitamin C? Well it is commonly found in orange juice. Vitamin E is commonly found in nuts and green vegetables. Green leafy greens are an excellent source of Vitamin E. Now we have found what is in this product. Let&#x27;s find out a little more how it worked on my skin.  I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!&lt;br /&gt;You can see the bottle is in dark brown a lot of the reason for this is. When you put a product in a dark bottle the sun light can not get to the and age it.&lt;br /&gt;Fox Brim is right on how the packed this serum. You don&#x27;t have to turn a bottle over hoping to get some or not too much. They provide a syringe bulb. You squeeze this the bulb for the amount you want to use. I used a half for the face and not quite another half for the neck area. As we age like myself I want to make sure I am protecting there. I might be using a little too much but better be safe than sorry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this serum. I love the way it leaves my skin and I love that I was able to get it while it was on promotion. I love that I found something that I will always use and love. i definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Price very reasonable.  Shipping quick.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product it absorbs into my skin quickly it does not smell bad like a lot of products. I have been using this product and my skin feels more soft and looks more radiant and smooth, it actually gives you that lovely glow to your skin and people notice. I would recommend this product to anyone that asks and I will defiantly be using it for my facial care.</li>
    <li> no difference after 2 weeks, great customer service</li>
    <li> This begins to work immediately!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was so excited about trying this product.  I used it faithfully for a month but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this serum is absolutely useless.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and do not see any effect on even the slightest of lines. The only good thing I can say is that I didn&#x27;t spend a small fortune for it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine what it does. Three days and no results yet.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim can do no wrong so far (I&#x27;ve reviewed a quite a few of their products now from promotional codes).  This serum will seem smaller than expected from the photo, but it lasts a long time.  A little goes a long way with this Hyaluronic Acid, even for thirsty skin like mine can be.  The texture is thick and not subtle.  Although this is a natural product, I would say proceed with caution.  It can be intense, so try it out on a small area first.  I mean you will physically feel your skin tightening.</li>
    <li> We both recently began using Hyaluronic Acid since reading that it has been shown to reduce wrinkles.  This particular serum was very nicely packaged and as described on product page.  We purchased this serum in a promotion for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;We have noticed that our skin feels more moisturized, or hydrated.  We like that the serum contains no harmful synthetic ingredients, additivesor fillers !</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s a great product, so glad I got it!! :)</li>
    <li> What I love about this Hyaluronic Acid serum is that Foxbrim has combined it with Vit C and E as well as Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel , Green Tea and Jojoba ... and THEN added MSM which not only reduces inflammation but acts synergystically with all the other ingredients ... so all the ingredients are that much more potent and available to the body. Scent free, easily absorbed and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is with the eye-dropper ... which is a little awkward to use ... I&#x27;d prefer a pump but the &amp;#34;inconvenience&amp;#34; is minimal and the superior nature of the product outweighs the nuisance value of the dropper.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and my skin looks amazing. Not to brag or anything..:) I&#x27;m using it with foxbrims retinol cream.</li>
    <li> I am pleased to say that I have been using this product for only 4 days and I can already notice a difference in fine lines  around my eyes.  When you hear the word acid in a facial product you first assume that it will burn or damage your skin. Not the case at all. It is a very gentle serum and feels light weight on your skin. I cant wait to see the results in the next month of two.</li>
    <li> I have problem skin to say the least. It doesn&#x27;t help that I work outside so no matter how much moisturizer I put on, I still have dry, flakey skin. I didn&#x27;t think this serum would help but figured it was worth a try. I was wrong! After the first few days, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much smoother my skin was and not a flake in sight. I have only gotten these results from going to a spa and getting a $75 facial! I will definitely be buying this again and highly recommend it to anyone else with dry, winter skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this product.  After only 3 days of using this product I&#x27;ve noticed a remarkable change in suppleness of my skin.  I use everyday after washing my face and so far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> Makes me break out and has not improved my skin whatsoever</li>
    <li> Love it! I actually got for my dog because he has an infected oil gland on his face. Easy to put on dries fast and showing results!</li>
    <li> Great product! Saw results within a couple of days!</li>
    <li> Not a big fan, had to mix heavily with my daily moisturizer. i have sensitive skin, so this was a bit harsh for me.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend and she liked it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.It is really good in all types of skin.It makes your skin smoother and brighter.</li>
    <li> I soft jelly like consistency (which is my favorite for serums). It doesnt have a tacky, greasy feel to it like some serums. Its dissolves really quickly, it doesnt leave behind a film of stickiness. It smell good, not overwhelming. It feels amazing on the face, very moisturizing. It leaves the face feeling nice, smooth, and silky. I liked it a lot. My only wish is that it came with a pump rather than a dropper.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> A very nice light, healing, and brightening facial product.  I noticed results in the first few days, I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend wanted to try this and she has been very happy so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She mentioned that other past products were more watery and that this seemed to her to be more of a thick serum which she says delivers better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also she said that the addition of the vitamins and being VEGAN friendly was important to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a win.</li>
    <li> The thing I love most of my serum it s the consistensy, it s not liquid, it s like a gel. Easy to use. Since I begin to use this product I use less moisturizer during the day (I have combination skin), and I have less oil in my t zone. And I love too that almost all the ingredients are organic.</li>
    <li> love this product, leaves my face soft, radiant , , softens, nice smell, smooth to the touch, easy to use, no rash , it softened my wrickels around the eyes and around the mouth, not oily, or heavy on the skin, or sticky. thank you for letting me try your product</li>
    <li> I have only been using this serum for a short period of time. I have noticed my skin is softer to the touch. On another note however, my skin looks blotchy and irritated. I also get an itch to my face when I first put it on. I have no known allergies but maybe something in it is irritating my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this product was received with the intention of a review**</li>
    <li> Quality Serum, arrived very fast, very well packaged, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Thank you for such wonderful item</li>
    <li> I have had lots of trouble with dark rings under my eyes for a few years now and I have tried a few different Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C treatments. First of all  alot of other serums are more watered down and runny. I really was impressed that this serum was thick and easier to apply to areas without running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the circles under my eyes are showing signs that they are disappearing. Although they have disappeared all the way, However, I think with more applications I will see more signs of improvement. My skins feels more smooth and nourished since using the serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for 10 days now and although I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, I did hope to see some kind of result. Maybe it&#x27;s too soon and I need to give it a while longer, which I will. It is easy to use, sinks right in, and leaves my face feeling soft. You only need a pea-size amount for the whole face. I apply it to my damp face and then follow immediately with my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great serum! I&#x27;m very impressed with these FoxBrim products! As I stated in my review on the Peptide Complex Serum, I&#x27;m glad that I was able to try both of the products and use them together! I also like to see that this product utilizes vitamin C AND MSM (this is so important as a cell-communicating ingredient!) This product truly soaks into the skin, leaving you with hydrated, dewy skin---while completely absorbing---and I can feel the quality of the product! I&#x27;m truly excited to try more! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and I can truly tell a difference in the way my face looks and feels. My skin seems softer and clearer. I haven&#x27;t noticed many changes with the fine lines around my eyes yet, but I will continue to use at least for the other benefits.</li>
    <li> I had never used a serum before so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I love this! FoxBrim sent usage instructions beforehand - which I appreciated. I love using this product. It is refreshing and makes my skin look and feel fabulous. I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply tinted moisturizer over - but no problems at all. I trade off using this with another FoxBrim serum I bought at the same time and also love - the Peptide one.</li>
    <li> Have used just a couple of times and like the results - quick results, lesser fine lines, but will continue to use for continued results.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but smells good and feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> not bad.  keeps skin soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, I can not use any fragrances, soaps, or detergents. It&#x27;s hard for me to even find lotion that I can use. I started using this as the weather got dry and it has been keeping my skin moisturized all day.  I no longer have those dry patches and I feel like my skin is looking nicer. The serum is thick and only takes a few drops, I even use the excess on my hands on my elbows and knees. I am happy that I had a chance to try this product out.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for around 2 weeks now and I can tell a huge difference in my skin. My face was really dry, but it looks and feels so much more hydrated now... more moisturized. My face glows now! I will definitely keep using it and can&#x27;t wait to get the FoxBrim Vitamin C serum to use along with it!</li>
    <li> its okay. don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> Love this thick serum. Will buy again!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Let me just start off by saying how sensitive my skin is. I have dry plus or oily (combination skin)... Use this product as follows:&lt;br /&gt;after washing my face or showering applying witch hazel as my astringent then I apply the FOXBRIM hyaluronic acid. Allow a moment to air dry then finish with foxbrim vitamin C lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing results hasn&#x27;t broke me out and is clearing my existing breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product when a friend told me about the benefits of vitamin C on your face for helping with wrinkles and as an antiaging serum.&lt;br /&gt;Now I will be using it for all benefits helping with breakouts and antiaging</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel moisturized and smooth.  The product disappears into my skin within seconds of application.</li>
    <li> Love it, my face feels great and looks great too!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Did not do a thing for me. Used entire bottle and skin is still dry and wrinkles still prominate. Expensive mistake. I don&#x27;t think its what it says it is at all.  Snake oil. Rip off cheat. Take your pick</li>
    <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;Useful Products</li>
    <li> I was hoping to have a good response with this serum but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction with it. bumps all over my face and eyelids and an open sore under my eye.  maybe this was too strong for me.  they generally make good products though. I will be contacting the seller to see if they have any suggestions.</li>
    <li> The product is thick so the eye dropper doesn&#x27;t really work that well.  Have only had the product a short time, so have not experienced any WOW results. It was a good price, so I am willing to give it a whirl.  Nothing objectionable--just don&#x27;t know, yet.  But if I do experience some WOWNESS, I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase, I like the thickness of it and it feels good on my face. I plan on ordering again when I run low, hopefully at the same affordable price.</li>
    <li> very happy with the results will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This hyalironic acid serum is simply perfect. I have tried literally thousands of different products and have really troubles skin. I even started making my own face masks and serums but haven&#x27;t a tried making this yet. The bottle is a generous size and the price is great for the product quality. It smells Sooo fresh and lite and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky at all. You can tell just by the scent that these are top grade pure and natural ingredients. I use this serum every nigh after I use my derma roller and it soothes the redness and doesn&#x27;t burn or sting or irritate&lt;br /&gt;My sensitive skin. It&#x27;s simply the best. Fast shipping great price and great product. A must try for anyone with sensitive nature or acne prone skin. I&#x27;m in love! Will repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Been using it for several weeks now and have noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> Great product. Since adding this to my daily routine, my skin is a lot healthier and smoother feeling. Love it :)</li>
    <li> Moisturizes very well! After a few days my skin feels and looks better!</li>
    <li> I like it. very easy to use. thicker consistency. Dries up fast.</li>
    <li> Goes on great and super hydrating!</li>
    <li> I have purchase several Foxbrim products and LOVE them. I was looking for a natural face care line that was affordable and produced results.&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim is all that plus. My skin is sensitive and I often develop a sensitivity to products over time. That has not happened with the Foxbrim line. I feel my skin is hydrated and resilient looking. I think it even glows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is excellent too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a natural, down to earth product, please try Foxbrim.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging for an excellent product. I have only used it a few times so far, but I can already notice the different in my face. It all looks so much smoother and my pores appear so much smaller. I think it is wonderful! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using Foxbrim&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum for one month now and I LOVE it!  My face feels so hydrated and softer than ever before.  I apply the serum to a freshly-washed face and neck in the morning as well as the evening.  Then I apply Foxbrim&#x27;s Ocean Mineral Lotion.  There is no scent to the serum and it absorbs into your skin fairly quickly.  I have very sensitive skin, but Foxbrim&#x27;s products are gentle.  I highly recommend if you want to add more to your face care regime.</li>
    <li> Bought specifically for my mature hands. Didn&#x27;t help. Perhaps better for other parts of the body. Owner is super involved and stands behind his products. 5 stars for that. Would buy from him again in a heart&#x27;s beat.</li>
    <li> It works, however it is only a temporary fix.  If you stop using it the lines and wrinkles return in a week.</li>
    <li> Good product.  But a bit strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing natural product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff buying a new bottle now love love love</li>
    <li> used it once so far and seems to be doing its job. will be using daily!</li>
    <li> This serum is much thicker than the other serum on the market.  A little bit of this will be enough but the texture is a little sticky. My skins feels more hydrated after using this.  I like it that it has vitamin C and E so it can brighten my skin. So far, I like this serum and will update on my skin condition later!</li>
    <li> Well, what can I say. It does make quite a noticable difference in my skin. Worth the price? Definitely, because it has the effects of an expensive skin care product.</li>
    <li> I recently received Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid. Despite being young, my skin isn&#x27;t great. I already have wrinkles and my skin just looks blah. I tried the acid and wow it really works! My face feels great. It is smooth and just looks brighter. I am glad I got to try this acid!</li>
    <li> I really liked this stuff. It has no scent which is wonderful.It tighten up my skin in places that needed it.</li>
    <li> I very very like it,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Used for 4 wks no noticeable difference like with similar products.</li>
    <li> I liked the product for the reviews and the ingredients. However I couldn&#x27;t use it after my 3rd time. I broke out in little pimples. The company is fantastic. They wrote me asking how I liked it &amp; when I told them I had problems with it they refunded my money without me having to return the bottle. I would def look into buying other things from them because of how nice they were. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out for me but I&#x27;ll try other kinds from them..</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it is very dry. I have been using this product off and on for a couple of weeks. Over the last couple of weeks I have noticed that my face has more of a glow than it previously had. I think I may have seen an even better result if I had been consistant in my use of the product. I will continue to use this product. I tried this product because I got it with a promotional code making it super cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a week and it is great. I wish I had taken before and after pictures. My face looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 3 months now and I do notice that my skin is softer and my hyperpigmentation is lighter.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I purchased the hyaluronic acid from foxbrim. Needless to say it did not work. The serum is too thick and lumpy. I have puffy eyes and I&#x27;m looking for a product to help me. I have tried several brands so far and this one is the worst by far. There is no tightening effect at all. None. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Gel like serum feels watery after putting it on the face. it comes with a light scent which i love a lot. Along with the Vita C serum i used on my face, it feels amazingly hydrated and smooth. Can&#x27;t stop using it now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 y/o, and have been using this serum in conjunction with Vitamin C serum from the same company for about a month now. I have several wrinkles of medium depth on my forehead and between the eyes, and not much elsewhere, and have not noticed much change in these after using this product. However, I have noticed a very significant change in the texture of my skin. I&#x27;m prone to getting dry patches on my cheeks, and some redness areas throughout my face. Since using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed a definite reduction in the dry spots and redness, and overall improvement in texture and tone of my skin. I use the hyaluronic acid along with vitamin C (I mix the two in the palm of my hand and spread all over my face) morning before makeup and evening after cleansing. The product comes with a dropper/pipette that is easy to use: each dropperfull is probably 2-3 doses of the product. The mixture goes on smoothly on my face and has a pleasant scent--I have used the two serums individually as well, and liked that application process as well, but find that it is simply faster to mix the two. The hyaluronic acid has kind of a cloudy/jelly-like consistency (not sure how to better describe it) and the serum soaks in very quickly into the skin, leaving a perfect canvas to then apply whatever cream or foundation you may choose. I plan to try using this product along with a dermaroller, as I&#x27;m hoping that way it may actually make its way into the skin as opposed to sitting on top.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I have to mention is that my skin tends to totally  freak out when I change my routine, and breaks out in acne occasionally, particularly in the oily spots. I did not notice anyting like that whth this product, which was a great relief, as it seems to be actually providing quite a bit of moisture.</li>
    <li> This works really well to lighten dark spots and blemishes.  I have only used it a little while so far, but in that short time, I do notice a lightening of dark spots and blemishes, which is primarily what I wanted it for.  Years of tanning and surfing left my skin a little sun damaged, and this seems to be working just fine.</li>
    <li> I received my Hyaluronic Acid Serum just three short days ago and already (yes I&#x27;m telling the truth) I see results.  My pores are already decreasing in size and my skin feels firmer.  I originally ordered three different products from the Foxbrim Site after doing research on natural skin care treatments.  After ordering I received an email with a discounted offer on this Serum as a bonus for giving a review.  This review has not been affected by the offer.  I highly recommend this serum to anyone who is looking to have firmer skin, less visible pores and a decrease in fine lines.  I will continue using this serum and recommend that you try their products.  I am 55 years young and have sensitive skin which has not shown any signs or symptoms of problems from the Foxbrim products.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive so before trying this product, I appied a small amount on my hand to test if I&#x27;m sensitive to any of the ingredients . The next day, I applied it to my face since I didn&#x27;t get any skin problems on my hand and noticed a better looking and glowing skin after almost a week of using it. At present, this applying this is part of my daily night time routine.</li>
    <li> I love hyaluronic acid serum and Foxbrim is a wonderful choice!  It plumps and moisturizes my skin and I even use it on the back of my hands.  This product is great value for the money.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  There is no fragrance, and it is very unlikely there could be an allergic reaction to it.  If your skin is as dry as mine, I encourage you to try this product.  If I could have only one serum, this would be the one.</li>
    <li> I happen to stumble on this item while searching for another product on Amazon and thought I would give it a try. I really like it, for my skin, it is just as effective as higher priced serums. It is more a gel than a liquid and can be difficult to get only 3-4 drops - be careful not to dispense too much.</li>
    <li> This preforms like an expensive brand, only better!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for long, but so far my skin feels really soft. I&#x27;m excited to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom and she loves it. Says her skin feels nice and smooth after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this at a promotional price. My review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definately made a difference in the texture of my skin. I use it in the morning and before I go to bed at night and I am happy with the results so far.</li>
    <li> This brand has great skincare products. This has helped me reduce the appearance of fine lines under my eyes. I just turned 35 and I am beginning to panic a little, but this serum does help diminish the appearance of those fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I also have other skin care products from the same brand. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it! Love that this hyaluronic acid is made in the USA and contains vitamin c + e and msm! it comes with a dropper and smells slightly like aloe. It absorbs quickly. I use it after I use my derma roller for maximum results!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin and leaves it feeling moisturized without being sticky. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and see results that I&#x27;m loving! My skin looks and feels so much better!</li>
    <li> This is one of 4 Foxbrim products that I use.  I am a 25 year old male that has some skin issues, and after just 14 days, I am seeing real results.  My skin feel more full and tight.  With continued use, I can only imagine the results in the months to come!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am using my second bottle. I love the natural ingredients and this is very easy to use. It makes my skin plumper, diminishing lines and wrinkles, and I feel like my skin looks brighter, more hydrated. People at work have even asked me what I am doing differently with my skin! I highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> Seems to irritate my face. I prefer my hyaluronic acid from clarity brand.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I received an email offer to buy this product at a reduced rate for a review on Amazon. I will state first that this review does not in any way reflect this offer but instead is based on the performance of this product. In just three short days since receiving this product I have seen a reduction in the size of my pores and a softening of the fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lines on my face. Upon application you feel an immediate &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; of the skin, and a just a few drops works for the entire face area. I have sensitive skin and this has not caused any breakouts. I&#x27;m so glad that I got the email offer and decided to take them up on it! I will continue using this product for years to come. Thank you Foxbrim!!</li>
    <li> Much thicker than other similar products I have used, which makes it harder to extract through the dropper.</li>
    <li> I have been using this morning and night since I received it and I really like the way it leaves my skin on my face feeling and it looks so much smoother and hydrated. I also use on back of my hands and they are starting to look so much smoother and softer. I also like that it is a thicker serum so it doesn&#x27;t drip when I apply it to my face.</li>
    <li> great product really helped my face also seemed to heal a spot that wasn&#x27;t healing. I definitely recomend</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this serum did not work any wonders for my skin as it did for most.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about a week now. I use it before bed or under make up. It feels smooth and light when applied. Since it&#x27;s only been a short time, I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything different with how my skin looks. Not sure if it really will make a difference but it&#x27;s a nice beauty product overall.</li>
    <li> Burned my skin. Would not endorse.</li>
    <li> This review is the same for all the Foxbrim products I bought. The directions say to use a cleanser, then a toner, serum, lotion, and the night cream. I purchased them all to get the real experience. I first used the the mud mask. I did a patch test on the back of my hand first. I rinsed it off and it left my hand noticeably smoother. I put it all over my face, let it dry, then rinsed it off. I rinsed it off in the shower so I could cleanse my easier. I use Olay fresh effects &amp;#34;shine, shine go away&amp;#34; as a cleanser because of how sensitive my skin is. My face already felt so soft and smooth. I sat down with some cotton balls and started with the toner. I don&#x27;t like the smell. It feels kind of like rubbing alcohol without the burn. I have never used a toner before so I don&#x27;t know what to expect. Next I used the serum. I used the dropper on a cotton ball and rubbed it all over my face. I don&#x27;t like the smell of the serum either. My skin felt great and clean. Last I used the anti aging moisturizer and the night cream. I should have stopped at the moisturizer because the night cream was way too moist. So far I don&#x27;t have any breakouts or redness. My skin was great until the day after when my skin felt back normal. Out of all of the stuff I liked the mask the most. All together my face felt fresh and clean but that night cream is for someone with dryer skin. I hope this helped :) I can&#x27;t think to say anything else about it.</li>
    <li> I am really into finding and trying Hyaluronic Acid vitamin C serum from&lt;br /&gt;Last few months. By the passage of time, as we get older our skin needs more attention, care and ingredients to stay healthy, look young and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many Vitamin C serums in the past. But nothing seems to work as good as this serum is working.&lt;br /&gt;This serum has best infredients which helps the skin to moisturize, look younger, fade the wrinkles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;For serums keep in mind that these dont show the results over night. It takes couple of weeks to show the result.&lt;br /&gt;I was so worried about the finelines around my eyes which were really visible with or without makeup. Nothing was helping me to even hide them. This serum is doing miracle for me. I have noticed big change in my finelines.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;Im 100% satisfied with this serum. I would highly recommend it if you out for trying some great product and get rid of wrinkles, finelines and enjoy beauiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional discount to give my unbiased opinion. Im glad to avail the opportunity.</li>
    <li> Bought this yesterday for a great deal and I am really excited to try it! I have very sensitive skin and I hope this works and I don&#x27;t get a reaction to it!</li>
    <li> Small bottle. But serum is good.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing agent and one that I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use. I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase and I&#x27;m sure I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about 2 months now. Unfortunately, I have not seen any improvements/differences at all since I started using it. I think I will stick to my Sea Buckthorn Oil which works better for me.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum is fabulous on older skin like mine ok well not THAT old but still I am trying to repair some issues with sun exposure over the years etc.  I do find consistent use makes my skin look better overall - plumper and tighter and the texture seems finer.  I will keep using this daily as a regular addition to my skin care.  Love that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> this is my first time to try this product. I am actually afraid to try on any products for my face since I got a sensitive skin. But since I got this product on a discounted price, I told to myself, ok I want to try this one on me... and later on try it on my husband&#x27;s face too since he has lots of wrinkles, fine lines and creases to work on to... After using the mud mask, I put this one on my face, I am honestly amazed on how the liquid looks and feels on my face. it actually looks like just water but when it absorbed on my face, I was like, wow.... until now while writing this comment my face still remains supple and soft! really amazing.... and I didn&#x27;t feel any adverse reaction when using this.. I also used the Ultra lift night cream which are a good combination! I live in Arizona and the heat today is so bad!!! I need a lot of moisture for my face but with this one I felt like I am injecting moisture into my face...And I am glad to have this one!! Definitely would love to put on my husband&#x27;s face later tonight. Foxbrim is definitely providing good products!! The mud mask, this one and the night cream are really good.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality Hyaluronic Acid. My wife had used some other expensive brand names and this one is up to par! I gave this to her for mothers day and she loved it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several items from this brand because I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and have been revamping my skin care routine.  This product is so gentle and effective, and the price is truly unbeatable.  I use this product after my toner step (so, first I wash my face, then apply toner, then THIS SERUM, then I moisturize) and it absorbs beautifully into my damp skin.  Even in the mornings, I use this step and it doesn&#x27;t negatively interact with any of the following produts (primer, makeup, etc.).  I highly recommend this product.  I use it all over my face, even on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCLUDES:&lt;br /&gt;+ Hyaluronic Acid- Unparalleled in its ability to hold in moisture (1000x its weight in water)&lt;br /&gt;+ Organic Aloe - Supplies oxygen to skin cells while softening skin&lt;br /&gt;+ Vitamins C &amp; E - In concert with Hyaluronic Acid, these essential nutrients enrich and fortify damaged and under-nourished skin&lt;br /&gt;+ Witch Hazel - Reduces inflammation, controls skin oil and locks in healthy moisture&lt;br /&gt;+ MSM - Aids in maintaining youthful and healthy skin&lt;br /&gt;+ Green Tea - Exceptional anti-inflammatory agent with antioxidant properties</li>
    <li> This is not just your average Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Key ingredients you need to know about that pack a punch to your beauty regimen.  They include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Hyaluronic Acid- Unparalleled in it&#x27;s ability to hold in moisture (1000x its weight in water)&lt;br /&gt;+ Organic Aloe - Supplies oxygen to skin cells while softening skin&lt;br /&gt;+ Vitamins C &amp; E - In concert with Hyaluronic Acid, these essential nutrients enrich and fortify damaged and under-nourished skin&lt;br /&gt;+ Witch Hazel - Reduces inflammation, controls skin oil and locks in healthy moisture&lt;br /&gt;+ MSM - Aids in maintaining youthful and healthy skin&lt;br /&gt;+ Green Tea - Exceptional anti-inflammatory agent with antioxidant properties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a bottle of witch hazel in my bathroom because it has many great uses. Most of us that want to turn back the hands of time know how beneficial green tea and vitamin C are to our skin.  This serum works great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*received for testing and review</li>
    <li> This was definitely thicker than I expected it to be, but I really liked it! I also really liked the extremely light scent, which is almost aloe-like. It sinks into the skin very quickly and feels very moisturizing but not heavy or oily. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I got this in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> It is helping to fade the dark pigmentation I got while pregnant but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the lines around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 4 days, but honestly believe I can see a smoother skin - and definitely softens.  I use it at night and under makeup but always use moisturizer over the serum.  So far I&#x27;m very happy, hoping the progress continues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I&#x27;m ordering another bottle for travel bag because I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s working just as well as the Estee Lauder $90 bottle I bought.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel so refreshed throughout the day. It is also helping me with my deep wrinkles on my forehead. While I still have wrinkles I seems to plump up the area a little minimizing them.</li>
    <li> I did some research on Hyaluronic Acid Serum before agreeing to try this product. Anything with the word Acid automatically gets me thinking it will be harsh but  I found out that Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring protein, The compound works by binding with moisture in the air and retaining it for long periods of time, resulting in firmer looking skin. I also learned that it is quickly absorbed by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this along with other my Vitamin C serum  and could really feel that my skin was well moisturized all through the day. I love the fact that the 2 products were able to be used at the same time to maximize my skin protecting and repair. And no harsh scent, or burning feeling( just wanted to make sure I added that in case you were scared by the word acid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a pea size amount to cover your face since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to see the benefits. which is always a plus in my book because get great results and my product lasts longer.</li>
    <li> great product love the way it feels on my skin!</li>

It also has a firming to it that I&#x27;m not accustomed to as I&#x27;ve never purchased a moisturizer or serum for that need yet.It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mask or make me look like I&#x27;ve been sweating.  I love it for ridding my face of the embarrassing flakiness that keeps me from wearing foundations and powders. Highly recommended.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM77e2853289c6ad18bffd5dbc6e18b59e\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;.

    <li> Girlfriend uses this all the time, says it makes her look younger, seems to work!</li>
    <li> Like all hyaluronic acid serums, this one has a thick, gel-like consistency, and hydrates really well; but what makes this HA serum my favorite is the absence of any discernible smell and how WELL and QUICKLY it absorbs... Seriously! It&#x27;s almost immediate! No sticky residue that requires I wait before I put on my sunscreen and makeup - I just put it on and ta-da! I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
    <li> amazing results and gentle for sensitive skin, my new GO TO! Love it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it, but this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a week but I&#x27;m starting to notice a little change.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it is beneficial</li>
    <li> Before applying my makeup, I applied Foxbrim&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum to my skin. I use the product twice a day to help firm and rejuvenate my face around the clock (although you don&#x27;t have to). The product is a pure, potent and powerful. My face and neck feel tighter and I have noticed that my color is getting more even. I noticed a significant difference the first time I used the product and in the evenings right after using my facial scrub. The product works great with my oily skin and also contains vitamin D and E. I would definitely recommend both products for those looking for something refreshing to add to their skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I recently had the opportunity to sample a new serum from Foxbrim. This particular facial serum contains hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, MSM (methylsulfonylmethane). jojoba oil and green tea. Also of particular importance is the fact that this formulation contains no additives, fillers or parabens. And this product is NOT tested on animals. All good things indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is very certain of its consumers satisfaction with this product. They are guaranteeing your satisfaction, or they will refund your purchase price 100%. That is an offer that you don’t see very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of a facial serum is to moisturize, clarify and brighten your complexion by infusing it with vitamins and nutrients. It acts a base over which you can add your daily moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Foxbrim Hyaluronic Serum for a few weeks. It has been incorporated into my nighttime cleansing routine. First I wash my face and remove my makeup. Next, I use a toner to remove any traces of extra dirt, oil or cosmetic product. After my face is dry, I apply a small amount of the Foxbrim serum to my face and neck. Then, after a few minutes to let it soak into my skin, I apply my nighttime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product was more like a gel than a traditional serum. You use an eyedropper to dispense the product from the glass bottle. It very easily absorbed into my skin. There was no stickiness or residue. Also, there was no detectable fragrance to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I found that it was a really nice formulation in texture, and it makes my skin look great. The texture of my skin looked more even and bright. I would have no hesitation in recommending this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

    <li> after one month to used this Acid Serum I don&#x27;t feel any changes on my skin.</li>
    <li> have seen difference in 10 days  very easy to use  am and pm</li>
    <li> Really love this serum, seems to brighten my face after I use it and I also notice my skin feels a lot smoother the more I use it.</li>
    <li> This works very well. glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive. This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is gentle. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I’ve always shied away from products like Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I suppose it was the thought of putting acid on my face that had me concerned- it just sounds scary! However, after reading up on the ingredients I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things I noticed was that it was not watery but a nice thick serum.&lt;br /&gt;I’m glad I gave it a chance! After using this product for a week, I can see a visible difference in the texture and evenness of my skin. I do think my face is more bright and glowing than it was before. And more even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a combination of not only the hyaluronic acid, but the other ingredients, including vitamin C, vitamin E, green tea and jojoba oil. I feel that with long-term use it will definitely help fade any dark spots that show up and help keep fine lines at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that they offer a money-back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly; not greasy; works to reduce appearance of sun spots; made my skin softer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum! It is easy to apply and it works! I have been using it for about a month now, and I notice my chest where I have the most sun spot damage is lightening up and much more soft. Also have been using it on a cut that would have turned into a bad scar. This Vitamin C helped the scar not become very visible, and it made it softer and just completely helped to blend it. I also use this product on my face, around my eyes, on my neck, shoulders, and as mentioned before, my chest. I have started to use it on my legs, just to see if it makes them any brighter or softer and it has! Every single part of me is just so soft now that i am always touching myself to feel my soft skin! lol</li>
    <li> My skin is hydrated and not oily.  I also see a more even tone on my skin using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Foxbrim.  It is really thick, so it&#x27;s super easy to apply.  I feel like the Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Foxbrim Review also gives great coverage over my entire face and neck with one dropper.</li>
    <li> The hyaluronic acid serum is more jelly like than vitamin C serums.  This makes application easier because you don&#x27;t have to worry about dripping. Again with this product, a little bit goes a long way.  The amount shown above is enough (one dropper full) to cover your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt; just love the way this product makes my face feel.  It leaves my skin feeling firm and soft and keeps my complexion bright and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool thing about this product is that the FoxBrim company offers a 100 % risk free money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with their product.  (I don&#x27;t think you will find an issue with it though).</li>
    <li> As an esthetician, I highly recommend. Hyaluronic acid is amazing for the skin. It plumps the skin and hydrates.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure if my expectations were right on with this serum. Other serums I have used had almost a syrup-y feel to them. This one is very thin, almost seems just a bit thicker than water.  It does feel okay on my face and I don&#x27;t notice any fragrance.</li>
    <li> Wife: I purchased this product in June 2015 based on the reviews. I have pimples/acne that always form under my chin area for years, could be something to do with hormones and my age (40). However, with using this product 2x a day, morning and night, before my moisturizer, i noticed my pimples/acne have disappeared. I hated that area because it left stubborn marks that wouldn&#x27;t disappear so my face looked blotchy. But this serum made them disappear. And the pimples were gone.&lt;br /&gt;The serum consistency was like real maple syrup, not too thick at all. It was thin enough to spread. It lasted me 2 months. I just purchased another bottle and the serum seems to be a little thinner than my last one. I hope it doesn&#x27;t effect the outcome because i really saw a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews that said they got their product on a discount/free for a review. I received no such thing as discounts or samples. I hope i do soon :)</li>
    <li> I recently got to experience Foxbrim&#x27;s hyaluronic acid. This is a skin care product that is safe for all skin types, and is made to make your skin glow, and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. The serum ingredients include hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, jojoba and green tea. y impression of the product is that it has a cute logo, and a pleasant scent. The product is a little sticky at first but quickly blends into the skin. You can use it under makeup, so it&#x27;s good for everyday. Although I&#x27;m partial to a pump bottle, the dropper top on this bottle is just as easy to use. The hyaluronic serum is all natural and I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects it has on my skin. As of now my skin is clear and soft. This product has so many wonderful natural ingredients that I&#x27;m sure it can have many positive effects on my skin. I love the idea that there are no harsh chemincals. .</li>
    <li> I used to get a perscription hyaluronic acid until they stopped carrying it. It was a wonderful product. This is just as good and has the Vitamin C in it. I want more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to make it clear, I NEED DEFINITE treatment as I live on the coast.</li>
    <li> great product, i love it</li>
    <li> After using this product I noticed an increased softness to my skin. I also noticed that my sensitive skin was not irritated by any of the ingredients. There was no wait time to notice the difference in my skin after the first application I could tell my skin felt different. Soft like baby skin. Normally my skin is dry. I like that there is also the vitamins C and E.  I like to apply my skin care items directly after the shower as the skin is exfoliated and ready to apply moisturizer. Applying makeup after applying this to the skin worked fine. Makeup application was as normal. Other ingredients such as aloe, witch hazel, green tea, and Geranium Essential oil are also natural ingredients that I love.  The smell of the serum is really nice. The serum itself is clear and a gel like consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not familiar with MSM so I looked up the benefits. MSM has also been shown to benefit skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, rosacea, dermatitis, acne, and dandruff. I have psoriasis and at times the skin around my hairline becomes very dry and looks like thick dandruff. Its difficult to apply my creams to this area because of the hair. Applying thick cream to a hairline just doesn&#x27;t work. A serum like this could soothe and moisturize that area without making my hair look greasy or funny. Overall I was pleased that my skin was so soft and the results were immediate.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS GREAT ON MY OILY SKIN!</li>
    <li> Nice consistency.  Not watery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time, less than a week, but I love the effects so far. I would like to know if you have a moisturizer that would be compatible. I am looking forward to seeing how this product performs in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> Dry skin? Who needs it right? i have literally been searching forever to find something that helps to keep my face moisturized throughout the day and guess what? I found it! or It found me i should say? Anyhow, i was given the chance to review this product and i must say, it’s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my skin is much brighter and less dry as the day goes on. Even after showering, i still have a glow about my skin that i didn&#x27;t have anymore. Maybe lack of sleep or poor food choices caused this. Age more like it. I am extremely pleased with this product and plan to continue with this as a part of my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product this week.  So far so good.  A little serum goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum sounds intense, but I promise it makes you skin feel amazing. I began using this immediately after I received it for testing and reviewing purposes, and boy I have noticed a major difference in the clarity of my skin. I have always had those problem areas, some are super oily others are dry and flakey. Guess what they are gone now, my face has never been so clear. I think this is a magical potion. I suggest if you are having problems with your skin you try it out!</li>
    <li> When I opened this, I was intrigued at the thick gel formula. Almost all of the Vitamin C serums I have tried so far are either runny or a bit thick and cloudy. This however has the consistency of a gel, transparent but not sticky and easy to spread onto skin. I have dry skin so this is right up my alley. I tried to skip my usual moisturizer one night to test this if its gonna stay up to par for a whole night. And voila, I woke up the next morning, ran my fingers through my face &amp; discovered that it has the same effects as my moisturizer. Not only that but I definitely noticed its brightening power around my eye bag area where it could really crease and be dull. I apply this every night and morning after I wake up for a refreshing feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, if you are worried that it might be hard to reach the product around the curves of the vial, then don&#x27;t fret because the dropper can still suction most of the products. I know I was a bit worried at first but I noticed that it is doable &amp; that I can still use the best out of it.</li>
    <li> What I like about Foxbrim&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum is that consistency is kind of thick but not heavy. Many serums tend to be thin like water, the consistency of Foxbrim&#x27;s serum makes the serum very easy to apply and keep it in the areas that you want it without dripping. This serum does have a faint scent to it, but it’s not overpowering, and you won’t notice it after a few minutes. I can&#x27;t really attest that this product works a 100% because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but I have noticed that my skin is much softer,smoother, and more moisturized. Another great thing about this product is that the company offers a 100% money back guarantee if for any reason you are unhappy with their product! You can’t beat that.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed moisturizing until I began using this. It&#x27;s been about 2 and a half weeks of use and I am getting compliments. Could have used this years ago. Better late than never.</li>
    <li> like the product and have used for three weeks with significant improvement in skin texture and firmness.</li>
    <li> This serum, in case you&#x27;ve never tried one of them, comes out a crystal clear gel that melts to almost a water like texture on your skin.  It&#x27;s an interesting formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also, however, exactly like one of the other versions, as far as ingredients, word for word the same, only the other comes in a two ounce bottle for only a dollar more.  The other also seems to spread further, as tho maybe there&#x27;s more water in this product, (the first ingredient).  This serum seems to reach the water consistency just a bit more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the ingredients are great and it seems to be a very pure product!</li>
    <li> I love this product and how it works on my sensitive skin! I love the fact that it has no paraben and no harmful chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> This serum is the best. I&#x27;ve used it for some time, and am always getting  compliments on my skin which at age 72 barely has any lines.</li>
    <li> I love FoxBrim products! I&#x27;ve been using the Hyaluronic Acid for the last few weeks and can feel a difference on my face with each application. I feel like it&#x27;s tightening my skin without drying it out. Combined with the eye cream that I use before bedtime and I&#x27;m really enjoying the way it&#x27;s working on my face.</li>
    <li> Light weight and quick absorbing. Good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I was given the chance to try the  Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum and review it for the company. This serum was so much better than a lot of the others that I have tried out. Most are pretty watery and take a while to dry, but with the  Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum it was the perfect thickness and applied very well and left my skin feeling great. This is really one of the best serums that I have tried in a long time and will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Please allow me some time to use the product so that I can review it I gave it one star only because is not allowing me to submit my request so I will give it a few weeks and then I will submit how I feel about it...</li>
    <li> Recently I&#x27;ve been testing hyaluronic acid serums.  In general I really like them as I feel that they restore a lot of moisture and suppleness to my skin without making me feel greasy or oily.    Foxbrim&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid is no exception.  It has a gel texture (thicker than others I&#x27;ve tried) and comes in a bottle with a dropper.  It&#x27;s clear with no scent but contains jojoba, msm, vitamins C and E and green tea; all of these are ingredients that are good for keeping wrinkles away and restoring moisture.  As Foxbrim promised with their 100% money back guarantee, my skin was not dull and felt very moisturized.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and is said to be great for sensitive skin as well.    After using it for a few weeks I can see how hyaluronic acid should be a part of my anti aging regime. I love it under a moisturizer and as a make up base.</li>
    <li> Product came as described and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I love this , this was my first tryat this product or any like it and I will never spend another penny at Wal-mart or Kmart or Avon ! this and others like it do work ! I am so allergic to everything I can not use a lot of things , this works great on my skin , and my crows feet are getting better ! my skin feels softer and I think I just might not look 34 ! that makes me very happy !</li>
    <li> Foxbrim is a great quality company, and everything I&#x27;ve used from them is golden!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hyaluronic Acid is no different! Feels great and works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels smoother and more moisturized after application.  Its perfect to use under makeup like BB cream or under an additional moisturizer at night.  This is a key product to own in dry climates.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Not as thick of a serum as I was hoping for, more watery, but I&#x27;ve had phenomenal results so far. I mix this with their vitamin c formula</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin</li>
    <li> This formula is a thicker, true serum-- not watery like a lot of Hyaluronic acid treatments. This makes it much easier to work with. Plus, this has a fantastic, herbal type scent that I love! The scent is very light and it dissipates quickly. It has several herbal ingredients including aloe and witch hazel. I am loving this serum on  my skin!</li>
    <li> I never  moisturize without first using a serum.  This serum is not sticky, melts into my skin and is perfect for my sensitive skin.  Plus the packaging is too cute!</li>
    <li> This product comes very well packaged. I was so happy when I recieved the chance to review it and was not disappointed at all when I recieved it. It is much bigger then I expected. It came wrapped in bubble wrap so I did not have to worry that when I pulled it out of the box it would be broke. I have only got to use this a few time but can already see a difference in my skin after just the few times of using it. I feel like my skin looks younger then it has in a long time and just love the way I feel already and can not wait to continue using this and seeing the long term results that will come from it. Definitly a product I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try a hyaluronic face product for quite some time as I know it is tried and true and seriously good for your skin. It is known to keep your skin plump, soft and dewey. No, it isn&#x27;t acid--not harsh and drying. I am so glad I chose this serum as it also contains Vitamins E and C. It is a light serum, non-oily. When you first put it on, it feels tacky. No worries, it dries within 30 seconds and I can immediately feel my skin is softer and smoother and non-greasy. It does have a very light fresh floral scent which dissipates quickly. I suffer from allergies and have extremely sensitive eyes, but haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse symptoms, i.e. no burning, red or tearing eyes and no sneezing or sniffling. This is a winner. I have used it about a week, twice per day, and am looking forward to keeping my skin soft and plumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> love it..after 2 weeks spots are clearing up and skin is starting to feel supple!Will be ordering more..</li>
    <li> I received this product free to try in return for a product review. I was a bit skeptical about serums like this. So I was glad I was able to test it and find out myself! I got it with a 100% discount coupon code and received it 2 days later. It was packed in bubble wrap and held up well while being shipped. The bottle is a small glass bottle with an eye dropper to dispense it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some in my palm rubbed my hands together a bit and rubbed the serum into my skin on my face. It wasn&#x27;t too thick or thin it was a little bit sticky but that goes away as soon as it is messaged into the skin. It felt nice and gave just the right amount moisture with out being greasy and did not dry my skin in any way. I started noticing at about the 4th day of use a difference in my skin! My skin is starting to look a lot more even, less imperfections and a reduction of the dark circles under my eyes. I would have to say it keeps getting better! Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> This product is great for my fine lines and wrinkles. Made my face look fresh and hydrated. I believe in just a few days some lines have diminished.</li>
    <li> I was sent the  Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum to review and I am now a HUGE fan!  I love Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum and it is forever a staple in my skin care routine.  Since using the serum my skin has become softer, smoother and more hydrated and even more supple!  LOVE THIS STUFF! :)</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP85a043c333ecb3f3c0518ca74e92abbd&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 33, I have recently become fond of vitamin c, retinols and hyarulonic serums this is the third one I have tried. A few of the things I like about Foxbrim are, the ingredients and how familiar I am with them. I also like the thickness of this serum in comparison to others it is thicker and easier to apply without risk of spillage. As with most Vitamin C serums it is a bit sticky at first but dries leaving your skin fresh , soft and revitalized. The smell is floral which is pleasant however i prefer not to use fragrant face product. I have started to use this on my chest and hands and like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM85a043c333ecb3f3c0518ca74e92abbd&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Not bad hoping its working</li>
    <li> This product hasn&#x27;t done much for me in terms of helping soften my 71 years of wrinkles. But it feels good on my face so I&#x27;ll use it up but won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> Just got this item and was excited to try it.  It feels great on my face and to touch.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Was very simple to apply. Just a few drops went a long way and it left my skin feeling hydrated, soft, and smooth. Made me feel a bit younger after a day or so of using it! LOL Some added pluses for me is it can be used under your make-up and it&#x27;s NOT tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Love this product... the seller is fantastic!</li>
    <li> The thing I love this product the most is it&#x27;s natural/organic ingredients, which gives me totally confidence to use the product without worrying about chemical residues at the end of the day.  Secondly, I love this product because the combination of the ingredients very well hydrates my facial skin and make my face feel fuller, brighter, and sensational.  I&#x27;m glad to be introduced to this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this serum! It comes in an amber glass bottle with a glass eye dropper! It&#x27;s very good quailty and a little goes a long way! It&#x27;s a little thick and has a very clean and refreshing smell! I also like that it&#x27;s made in America and not tested on animals! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more! *i received this with a promotional discount*</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy. Also doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes like a lot of serums. Its light and blends well. I have been able to tell a difference in my dark circles and under my eyes are plump. Ive been using morning and night and have seen a considerable difference in the short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product works great!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Makes my skin feel great. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it burns my eyes for a minute or two after using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a week now and I am very happy with it. It is a very thick serum that keeps my skin looking hydrated. I don&#x27;t know if it can actually get rid of wrinkles, but it sure makes my skin feel soft and my wrinkles less apparent. It is also a good value compared to similar products.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome serum.  I like that there is vitamin C in it.  Ladies.... Over 40 this is for you.  Product works as advertized.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently visited my home country and the weather over there is much more humid and hot compare to here so after few days my face was covered with acne and due to my bad habit of scratching they left blemish so after I came back here I started to find a ways to get rid of my blemish and acne so I decided to give Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C a try.I have to say my dark spots are fading and my skin is looking good, my acnes are clearing up but I can&#x27;t vouch for acne as it may be clearing because of weather.So I would recommend this product along with Vitamin C followed by good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> honestly, it&#x27;s hard to tell at this point. I think I need to use it long term, but using it every night did make my face peel (although it is the middle of winter). im optimistic but can&#x27;t report anything definitive quite yet.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C serum I have used. I believe it is more effective than Clinique&#x27;s Laser Repair!</li>
    <li> From the second input this on my face I felt hydrated. Hyaluronic Acid worked wonders for my dry face. Even lasted over night while I slept. Woke up to a nice moist face. Perfect for all skin types. A must try.</li>
    <li> I was scared at first to put this on , so it sat on a shelf for a few days.  When I did open it the first thing I did was smell it and I swooned,  swoon being the only thing to describe the reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I whipped the bottle around to see what that heavenlyness was,  all natural ingredients,  and I quickly washed my face to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It went on like silk and my favorite part was that there was no sticky,  dry mask feeling that I typically get after using facial treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I am already delighted.  I needed something that would make me want to take better care of my skin and this was it!&lt;br /&gt;If I have less wrinkles or improved complexion,  I will buy stock in the company!!!</li>
    <li> Just received this item and only time will tell if it helps.   So far my skin seems more moist and smooter.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week now and I really enjoy this serum. It is so easy to absorb and it absorbs quickly. It has very little scent and I enjoy the experience. My skin has felt so fresh and so bright after using this serum. I don&#x27;t think I will need my heavy moisturizer anymore now that I&#x27;ve started using this. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to look younger but I&#x27;m looking forward to that. I&#x27;m sure with all this moisture it is inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this is ALL NATURAL, no fillers, nothing just straight Green Tea, Vitamin E, Jojoba Oil &amp; Witch Hazel</li>
    <li> I was really grateful to know about the benefit of  Hyaluronic acid serum for skincare. I think every women, after 20s, must try a good based of Hyaluronic acid serum for the daily skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;After dropping the serum on my hand, it looks like gel kinda thick serum.After rubbing it on the hand,it looks like water which absorbed on my skin well. It is not so fast absorbing but still it&#x27;s great for my skin. One drop is enough for my entire face and neck which I really like about it. I think it has rose essence in it- the only scent i can smell in this serum; very soothing and refreshing!♥ I feel like it does brighten up the skin because after applying this serum I have noticed the glow of my face (if you tried it, let me know it does for you or not!!)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for a week, and my skin already feels healthy and supple.It is just makes your skin so soft, smooth and hydrates so well.It has the youthful formula that prevent aging!&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I just only apply the serum and leave my skin bare to see how it feels. Surprisingly it is also moisturized as well without using any cream after neath!&lt;br /&gt;I use a lots of serum on my skin, like 5 times a day. You know, I have to pray my &amp;#34;Salaat&amp;#34; and for that I have to wash my face five times which makes me apply more serum to prevent dryness. I am sure I&#x27;ll finish this serum soon!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also cute, I specially love that fox sign- so adorable!! Comes with a dropper which is easy to use. It&#x27;s a glass bottle which sometimes i fear, I&#x27;ll break it, lol!! Overall, I am loving this amazing Serum from &amp;#34;Foxbrim&amp;#34; and I highly recommend this to anyone. I guess it works for all skin type☺</li>
    <li> good serum. smells like cucumber although i did not see any in the ingredients. thick consistency and easy to apply. Absorbs quickly.  My skin has not been dry at all since using this product.  My skin definitely likes this serum.  Lasts a long time as i only use about 3 drops for my entire face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a dermaroller to aid in younger looking skin and it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as noticeable without Vitamin C serum.  I&#x27;ve tried some that leave a sticky residue or that seem to sit heavy on my skin but this serum does neither.  I notice a firmness that I&#x27;ve been missing for a few years.  The fountain of youth may not exist but I&#x27;ll certainly try duplicating it&#x27;s effects with this!</li>
    <li> Noticed immediate difference in my complexion, skin more radiant and lifted.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about 4 days, so I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve seen results, but my face already feels so much better.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product.  Has my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Bought two, one for myself and the other for my girlfriend who has always taken care of her face with expensive creams. She at first was hesitant, but I had her read reviews and after that she used it everyday since and loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I myself find it wonderful, I&#x27;m not as committed, but definitely notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The company keeps in touch and really do want to hear from you to see if there is anything they can do.</li>
    <li> easy to apply, a little goes a long way.... great product!</li>
    <li> Great product, I recently received this product for review and after a few days of using it I am pretty impressed the product is nice, the dropper makes it easier not to spill a lot into your hands, the product also smells pretty good which I am glad I hate strong smelling products. After a few days of using in on my face I noticed small skin dry patches that were dry on my face started to smooth out actually, my makeup was less noticeable in those areas which was even better, so far I like this product I hope the results continue.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and put their vitamin c lotion over the top.  It works great for me.</li>
    <li> I was not familiar with hyaluronic acid serums before I was provided with a sample of this product for testing and review purposes. I was a little hesitant at first as it sounded like something full of chemicals. However, this serum contains only (or mostly) natural ingredients so I decided to try it. My skin gets really dry and itchy during the cold winter months (I&#x27;m sure, many of you can relate to that!). I&#x27;ve been using this product for several days and I can tell that my skin got so much smoother and fuller and it&#x27;s no longer inching. I no longer need to use a face cream daily and I love it as they are thick and can be sticky. I think this product will also be great during summer to use after a day at the beach to restore hydration to your skin. I&#x27;m excited to keep on using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this and I got it for an awesome deal!</li>
    <li> Just came today and already used it! My face feels soft and clean. Its still too early to eeally see results but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Love it! I have used a couple different kinds and this is my favorite can&#x27;t wait to see how I look after the whole bottle</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but can&#x27;t wait</li>
    <li> due to my dry skin ive had trouble finding certain things that work well for me and dont bother my skin. This is one of those that helps my face tremendously. The combination of vitamins, green tea, jojoba and witch hazel has helped the bags and dark spots under my eyes (i dont sleep very well so have severe bags all the time). Whenever i have this problem i will turn to this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I apply to face and decollete after cleansing or showering. Dries quickly. It feels great and I think it&#x27;s the perfect addition to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  The company is great.</li>
    <li> My good friend talked me in to serums, and I&#x27;m SO GLAD she did. Definitely hooked now! Especially because it&#x27;s all natural stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using g other brands and this one is now my favorite! No oily residue!</li>
    <li> So far has been a great product. All of the different parts of the product are great for the skin. I am already seeing a difference and loving it.</li>
    <li> this serum is very useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s greatly pleased for me</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Keep my skin nice and smooth. Not oily at all. Kept my skin fresh and radiant. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look and feel great. I would recommend this product if you not happy with the appearance of your face. I starts working instantly and improves the look even more over time.</li>
    <li> Great for your skin, makes it smooth and soft and it also doesn&#x27;t burn! Definitely beneficial</li>
    <li> I apply this before my other facial items and its helping my appearance.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin that my -so much cheaper- aloe gel does already.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different for sure</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for people looking for natural alternative for skin care. I think that this is the best for a more youthful looking face.</li>
    <li> just got it, unfortunately it sat in my very hot mailbox for the weekend before I realized it was there. I usually get my mail at my p.o. box. I hope this won&#x27;t affect the product. It will take some time to see if it does what it claims.I hope the heat didn&#x27;t ruin it. I&#x27;ll let you know if it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I have many of the products in the Foxbrim line and all of them are&lt;br /&gt;great, I&#x27;m so happy to add this product to my skin routine.  This does not&lt;br /&gt;burn or turn your skin red, but I can feel it working to smooth out my fine&lt;br /&gt;lines on face and neck.  I highly recommend all the products in the Foxbrim&lt;br /&gt;line.  Reviewed for amztrader.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me or my skin</li>
    <li> Has been great for my complexion. I have been using a regimen of witch hazel and aloe vera, and this product is a great one-step alternative with other added benefits.</li>
    <li> First time trying a product like this.  So far I like it</li>
    <li> I love how it stretches your skin and makes you look ageless :)</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Would buy again!!!! (:</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom because her eyelids droop really bad. She&#x27;s been using this for about a week and you can see a huge difference! She is extremely excited to see how they look after using this product for longer! This also shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> It was a good product, i don&#x27;t think I will buy again… just not really for me.</li>
    <li> I was able to grab this at a steep discount and I am very glad i did It is wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> I have almost used both bottles that came with the order; however, no noticeable results as of yet.  Still waiting.  I&#x27;m hoping it will do what it claims to do!!  I will give it another week or so, at least until the bottle is empty, and then I will be able to see if there are noticeable results...</li>
    <li> This is a light serum. It spreads easily and leaves your skin feeling soft. I like that there&#x27;s a dropper so you can control how much product you need. And you don&#x27;t need much to apply for the whole face. I like this serum and it&#x27;s affordable as well because you don&#x27;t need a lot at all for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Just started using these but I like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> It´s not bad but I wish that my skin felt more moisturized.</li>
    <li> I just recently received this product, and haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give it a full product review.</li>
    <li> Awesome product....it was very nicely packaged.  This serum is amazing!  Already noticed a nice glow to my face.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Good products</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it on my face under moisturizer. It seems to even out skin tone and my recent red marks seem to be fading. I did not give it 5 stars because I felt the level of product was a little low in the bottle.</li>
    <li> My review: I am always concerned about the moisture in my face. The older I get, unfortunately, the dryer it gets. Also, all the other imperfections that come with age is mind blowing….. lines, wrinkles, dark spots…..dark spots being my personal nemisis. I don’t have a lot…just one….but it’s enough to put me in tears most days. I’m willing to try anything to get rid of it… and have. I have been using this for about 10 days now and haven’t seen big changes but I like it enough to continue use. It makes my face softer and looks brighter. It, also, hydrates my face and I need that on a daily basis. I will go on using it for now.</li>
    <li> This is very soothing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom who is very sensitive to serums and lotions and she is very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Good product will buy again</li>
    <li> so moist and I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;texture is so dense that it is hard to use spoid.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Omg, my skin is so soft!!!  When made up my skin looks flawless, even without !  Can&#x27;t wait to get the Vit C as well.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. This serum works great. My skin (face) feels so soft and smooth and looks so much better since I have started using this product. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different serums for my face to keep it looking good and youthful. Most serums are pretty watery and while trying to apply them a lot of the liquid just runs down your fingers and you end up losing a pretty good amount of it. Foxbrim is one of the few companies who have addressed that problem and made the serum a little thicker so it’s a lot easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the people might be scared off by the fact that it’s called “Hyaluronic Acid” but it’s actually a substance that is naturally present in the human body. It is found in the highest concentrations in fluids in the eyes and joints. The hyaluronic acid that is used as medicine is extracted from rooster combs or made by bacteria in the laboratory. The serum is actually natural and organic and has got no parabens, no additives and no fillers in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a couple weeks and it’s working good. The best improvement I’ve seen is that my usually dark under eye circles have reduced and my skin just seems deeply moisturized and somewhat more fuller. If you haven’t tried this product yet then you should, it’s natural and makes your skin look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> This is a great product and makes my skin feel and look wonderful - especially for a woman in her 60&#x27;s!!!  The price is right, too--not like many other products out there that cost a fortune and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Skin is getting better.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell but it feels wonderful and now I have to find out if it is truly hydrating my skin, which is dry</li>
    <li> This product works great!!! Fast and awesome service!!!</li>
    <li> Thicker than most.  Feels nice on skin.  Very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid is not absorbed through the skin topically..Only by injection.</li>
    <li> using it for three weeks and do not see an noticeable difference yet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it for a couple of days now, but I think I see some results.  I am really hoping to see big changes around my eyes as their is a lot of drooping.  Fingers crossed that this works as promised and like it has for so many others.</li>
    <li> Nice packing and fast shipping . I have been using for about 5 days in the morning with another product from this same company and so far I&#x27;m happy and skin seems softer . Have to wait and see .. Still to early to tell if it&#x27;s going to help fade my dark spots. I will update if any changes.</li>
    <li> This is my first week using this product. I do like the way my skins feels so far. I have noticed my DARK circles have faded some.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this product as I know it takes longer than just a week to get the full effects.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  I am using this and the Peptide Complex Serum together, one in the morning and the other at night.  I&#x27;ve noticed a great improvement in my skin... it&#x27;s firm and smooth!</li>
    <li> I recently received a bottle of Foxbrim&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum to review. I was initially very weary to try out this product, because honestly anything with the name acid in it kinda of scares me! However, after reading the ingredients I decided it was definitely worth testing out. After testing it out for the last few weeks, I am here to give you my thoughts on this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum ~ Find your radiant skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• You&#x27;ve found the BEST Anti Aging, Anti Wrinkle and Anti Dull Skin Solution.&lt;br /&gt;• Dramatic Results Can Be Yours With Immediate Use. In Days Not Weeks!&lt;br /&gt;• Get Your Confident Glow by Making Dark Spots, Fine Lines and Wrinkles a Thing of the Past!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum includes Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, MSM, Jojoba Oil and Green Tea. I also see on the bottle that it has aloe and witch hazel in it. A pretty impressive list of ingredients, if I do say so myself! I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this serum on my face and see if it lives up to its claims!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of this serum is from the actual bottle of product, it is thick glass with a glass dropper that squeezes out tiny perfect sized drops to be used. The serum itself is thick and not at all watery, which I have seen in past face serums. The consistency makes the serum very easy to apply and keep it in the areas that you want it. The serum is clear and smells faintly of witch hazel, which I happen to love. Once rubbed into the skin the scent fades almost completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly the texture. I was extremely worried that the serum was going to be sticky and leave my skin feeling greasy, as I have faced with many serums. However I need not worry as the serum is not sticky at all, it is light-weight and absorbs into the skin very quickly. It actually leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft. I only use the serum at night and I only use a few drops on my face each time, as a tiny bit goes a long way! I have very oily skin and have not seen an increase of oil in my face in the morning! I especially like to pat this into the skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I can&#x27;t completely state whether all of the claims are indeed true after only using it for a few weeks, however I do know that my skin is softer and has a healthier look to it. I can&#x27;t wait to see if my dark spots lighten up with use, but I do know that my dark under eye circles have diminished and hopefully after using this for awhile longer they will fade completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best yet, the company offers a 100% money back guarantee if for any reason your are unhappy with their product! You can&#x27;t beat that, but my guess is that you will never take advantage of it as the product is superb!</li>
    <li> I used this item for about 2 weeks and so far I do enjoy the results I am getting. Its very thick which makes me think its working while I sleep. I felt good on my skin and I have noticed a difference in my texture and appearance.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels.  I recomm this to anyone regardless of skin type -- mine is fair, sensitive and over 60!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Soaks into the skin, non greasy, light. I ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> This serum leaves my skin feeling so smooth, hydrated, and soft. I have sensitive skin and always have to be careful of the products I use and I am very happy with the way my skin responds to this product. I notice this product keeps acne at bay, and some of my friends use it for anti aging and it seems to work for them! I will be back to purchase more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a product or skin makeup junky so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to. I was looking for something that was light and would not make my face feel like it was being smothered. This fits the bill. It&#x27;s really the first anti-aging product I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m 43, no wrinkles or age spots &amp; figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to do preventative care. I&#x27;ll definitely continue using.</li>
    <li> My skin has improved drastically after using this my pores have shrunk and my skin is smoother more luminous I&#x27;ve noticed my fines lines and wrinkles are diminishing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on this stuff! Within a week I saw a noticeable difference in the deep creases and wrinkles between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;But not only that my skin looks and feels firmer, I feel like I&#x27;ve had a face lift and my skin is so clear and even that I have stopped wearing foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 3 months and will continue to do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, compared to another hyaluronic acid serum that I used by different brand, I prefer this one because it comes in a sort of gel instead of a liquid and it does not have a strong scent to it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I had heard so much about Hyaluronic Acid. I did some research after it was delivered, quickly, I might add, and found that the acid molecules are too large to go into the skin.  As a serum, however, before applying my moisturizer...I use argan oil...I feel that the product has made my skin smoother to the touch.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice serum. It&#x27;s light on the skin and does not have any stickiness like some other products I&#x27;ve used. It smells like very natural spa-like scent that is not overwhelming and very pleasant. Skin looks and feels very smooth and moisture after using..so far I will be adding it to my daily regiment.</li>
    <li> My friend uses this serum all the time and when I asked her about advantages she gave me 2 bottles to try. I was very surprised how my skin reacted to this serum and my acne gone after 2 weeks. Also my wrinkle ane not so visible as it was. I&#x27;m very glad that my friend advised me this serum.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Even the first night I used this product I woke up the next morning with softer skin. Also, the ingredients are so wholesome, so I can rest well knowing I am putting good stuff on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the was this goes on..I believe it will take time to decide if this product improves the look of my skin..It absorbs well though and I will continue to use it as I truly believe these acids are the best way to remove dead cells on our skin and mostly because they are safe for most.</li>
    <li> GREAT, NOT GREASY AND BRIGHTENS MY COMPLEXION WITHOUT LOOKING HEAVY.</li>
    <li> Just received this so still waiting to see how it works over tome but so far pleased.</li>
    <li> My first time using this type of product and I was more than surprised as to how much I liked it. I spend a lot of time in the sun year round so I need to take extra care in products I choose to use. This is an A product.</li>
    <li> This sucks !  I read all of the reviews and almost all were positive ones . I bought it for my mom and she said it does absolutely nothing, so I myself tried it. She was right . So I&#x27;ll definitely not be buying this Ever again -_-</li>
    <li> Hey Everyone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last several months, I have been trying out a wide variety of Vitamin C serums with hyaluronic acid. I have had moderate success with these products until I got a chance to try out Hyaluronic Acid Serum by foxbrim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It has a semi-thick texture to it, and it applies evenly. I paid particular attention to applying it to my forehead, as that is where most of my wrinkles stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After a few days of use, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far. You can literally feel the skin tighten after applying it. It is not sticky and absorbs nicely. The competition out there is harsh for this type of product and maybe I’ve jumped the gun early on my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However, that is the way it is. Unless someone else comes along and produces a better product, this one will stay at the top of my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; xoxox&lt;br /&gt; Sia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I started using this product as soon as I received it about 10 days ago.  I can already see a noticable improvement in my skin.  It goes on so smooth.  Living in South Florida I&#x27;m very particular about what I put on my face because some lotions and oils tend to make your face &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; (gross).  This doesn&#x27;t.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I can feel this working on my fine lines. It feels great going on. I use it one in the morning and once at night. It doesn&#x27;t take much so this one bottle will last for a while.</li>
    <li> Great product - rejuvenates and hydrates my skin. I use it every night before bed. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t express how awesome this serum is. It does exactly what it says and then some. I love putting this on my face, I actually have to refrain from using it too often because I just love it so much. The consistency of the serum is spot on, far from watery..but just enough to glide over your face. AND it&#x27;s cruelty free!!</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid definitely seems to be the latest craze sweeping the beauty and anti aging industry. But at least it&#x27;s a craze that seems to really deliver on all of the promises it makes! Upon application, I can immediately feel my skin tighten like it&#x27;s really softening and smoothing any wrinkles or age spots. This particular serum also has the perfect texture - not too thin or too thick. It feels very pure and natural and I would highly reccomend this product to anyone in need.</li>
    <li> As usual, a wonderful product - Thank you Foxbrim!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 3 days now,  but in can see a difference my skin. It looks amazing and clearer.  Its not a miracle in a jar but it is a wonderful product.  The only problem is that I&#x27;m already 1/2 way through the bottle, so I can see where this could be very expensive.  The product is thick and thats the reason by I believe it wont go as far. I use 1 dropper each time.  I apply it on morning and night. I believe long term use may be even more beneficial, however I cant afford to buy a bottle each week. How long should this bottle last?</li>
    <li> This hyaluronic acid serum from Foxbrim is lightweight and gentle. My skin feels smoother, and I like the appearance of complexion lately. My skin feels refreshed and firmer. The serum is good if you’re battling dull, dry skin because it moisturizes, softens, and brightens skin. I like that it keeps my skin hydrated without making my skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a gel-like consistency, making it easy to apply. There are no drips, and the serum absorbs quickly, allowing it to go well under makeup.</li>
    <li> Use it 2-3 times a day following the vitamin  C serum best combination I could do and the after affect is awesome</li>
    <li> I like this serum, the dark spot on my face is gone, my face  skin changed to a newly skin,.others observed how I look young, it&#x27;s  because of this serum. Pls try guys, buy it now.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this! Super fast shipping and I was able to use it right away.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I am able to receive excellent products to try through deals and discounts.&lt;br /&gt;Try yours today, you WONT be dissappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for close to a week, and my skin already feels softer.  Works great for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and my skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been trying various Hyaluronic Acid and Vit C serums, over the past few months.  This one has just the right consistency.  Not so thin, that it drips off my face, as I am applying, and not so thick, as to feel like my skin is not breathing.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, to to be able to spread across my face and neck area.  This one, is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Delivery and service were great only been using product short time but I really like it leaves my skin so soft will keep using and watch for more benefits</li>
    <li> Great buy. Love the non-sticky light texture. The bottle is great too. It moisturizes the skin well, without any heavy oily ingredients.</li>
    <li> This serum was really nice and refreshing. In the jar it looked like a jell, but on the skin it felt like water. I&#x27;m looking forawrd to trying more products from this line!</li>
    <li> My face is clearly smoother after using this product!  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I keep trying to order and it keeps asking me the same question over and over again. Good items but why so hard to order</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve always shied away from products like Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I suppose it was the thought of putting acid on my face that had me concerned- it just sounds scary! However, after reading up on the ingredients I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance! After using this product for a week, I can see a visible difference in the texture and evenness of my skin. I do think my face is more bright and glowing than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a combination of not only the hyaluronic acid, but the other ingredients, including vitamin C, vitamin E, green tea and jojoba oil. I feel that with long-term use it will definitely help fade any dark spots that show up and help keep fine lines at  bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that they offer a money-back guarantee. I always prefer to do business with companies that stand behind their products!</li>
    <li> I like that all the ingredients are natural and won&#x27;t harm your skin. I also like that the product does what it says it will do. This doesn&#x27;t always happen with companies. Foxbrim stands behind their products because they know they work. This product makes my wife&#x27;s face softer and brings back the youthful/healthy look to her skin. Don&#x27;t buy expensive beauty products, when you can buy this Hyaluronic Acid and get better results. My wife loves the products she receives from Foxbrim because they really work.</li>
    <li> Company claims that no more effective moisturizing agent on the market today. Hyaluronic Acid Serum promises a fresher, brighter complexion and NO parabens, NO additives, NO fillers, and it’s NOT tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I had used that serum for a month and have to admit that natural ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel ,Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Jojoba Oil and Green Tea make wonders to my skin.  I noticed that my sensitive skin was not irritated by any of the ingredients. Normally my skin is dry and having all organic ingredients also the vitamins C and E from day one I felt different in condition of my skin. It’s felt very hydrated and rejuvenated.  I had use serum at morning under my makeup and found that my makeup holding all day prefect without any greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;Serum has dripping bottle and I had no problem to have right amount of gel to my hand. Consistency of gel is right as well with very nice light scent.&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Foxbrim very powerful and effective. A little goes a long way with this highly concentrated product; just a tiny bit every day will make skin look fantastic and revitalized.</li>
    <li> I have really liked using this serum. It&#x27;s not watery like some serums are and I have really seen some results under my eyes and on my forehead. It is filling my skin in and making it softer.</li>
    <li> Well..I&#x27;ve used this for over a month. One, it stinks. Horribly. It really smells awful straight out of the bottle. Like citrus super-glue. I hesitated for a few days before I finally put it on my skin--I was worried it would burn.  No burn.  I do not have the issue with this one that I did with the other--the skin sensitivity in the sun.  So it&#x27;s more gentle.  The smell does dissipate quickly, but you really have to get over that initially. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said theirs did not smell--perhaps they are used to chemical smells or harsh smells from their facial products. Mine stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, I used this during a particularly rough break-out period (what is it about being in your 30s that means wrinkles and acne?!), and it seemed to clear up quicker than usual. So that&#x27;s pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it&#x27;s not too expensive (it&#x27;s currently on sale for $17), and since you only need a very small amount for your entire face, it&#x27;ll last a while.  I think I&#x27;m going to try it next on my hands, and see if there is any improvement.</li>
    <li> feels great! I will post another review later after i hopefully see results, too soon to tell!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I see a difference</li>
    <li> Have not seen much improvement yet.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for 4 days. I am rating it only because it is advertised as showing immediate results and I have not seen any change in my skin. It feels good, and is quickly absorbed, but a little has NOT gone a long way! And although I like the ingredients, it has many more than the label suggests and the Vitamin C +E are near the bottom of the list. The Hyaluronic Acid is the 5th ingredient!! I fear that this bottle may not last more than 2 weeks. If I don&#x27;t see results by then, I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 weeks and I&#x27;m in love. This Hyaluronic acid syrum isn’t harsh or skin-stripping. My skin feels hydrated giving me a younger, fresher, more supple look. I&#x27;ve even noticed scars on my face appear lighter and my pores are smaller. I will definitely continue to use this product as it has proven results.</li>
    <li> I’m excited to share with you my “Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum Reivew!” Its not exactly everyday that you get the opportunity to show off radiant skin. Since as we age it tries to show through our skin. However we don’t have to just set back and let it happen. Thats whats so cool about the Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It will give you back radiant skin while effectively moisturizing your skin! On top of that his serum is for all skin types, even sensitive skin can have results for anti aging, anti wrinkles and anti dull skin solutions. Enhanced with hyaluronic acid, vitamin c, vitamin e, mdm, jojoba oil and green tea you know you’ll get results. Plus I just love how good it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this the past few weeks and I really like the way my face feels and looks - I was warned it might dry my skin out, but it did not - I have very oily skin and wrinkles and so this is a great product for my skin type and many others - it smells OK, it goes on smooth and soaks in fast so I can apply a moisturizer over the top - I use it in the morning and at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this and let it dry and then add a moisturizer and make-up in the day time and then at night I just skip the make-up.  I am 45 and my skin is aging - I like this product and would recommend it to everyone - because like it or not you are going to age - you think you might get away with out aging think again - everyone ages - its life - but this can help slow down the process - give it a try today!!!</li>
    <li> We all need something to reduce signs of aging on our skin because we deserve a shinny skin in any age. A lots of products are in market but which is is better and match our needs?!One of the products I have tried recently, is &amp;#34;Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum&amp;#34; which includes Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, MSM, Jojoba Oil AND Green Tea, all together in one serum!Wow! How great! What I like about this serum is, this is neither watery greasy. It is really thicker than other brands I have tried before. I noticed it has great texture, lightweight and most of all it absorbs quickly and left my skin smooth, silky and shinny. The brightness of my skin is noticeable and I like it. It looks healthier and hydrate.</li>
    <li> Ok. Nothing to greet excited about</li>
    <li> Really liked the feel on my face. It seems to help with my wrinkles quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Good to use to give skin a rejuvinated look.</li>
    <li> Immediately make skin feel more hydrated, but I have very dry skin and still have to add additional miniaturization.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! The serum feels great on my skin and it smells good.  Although, it works fine, the dropper that delivers the serum may not be the BEST delivery system because the serum is rich and a little thick. Overall, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not oily at all. Helps with dry spots.</li>
    <li> This is my first Hyaluronic Acid Serum I have tried but it seems to do all that it claims. I have been using it in the morning and in the evening before putting on moisturizer. This serum does a wonderful job at moisturizing my skin. It feels great and smells wonderful. Compared to many other hyaluronic acid serums on the market, Foxbrim seems to offer one of great quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this HAS. I have tried some other ones, but they were thinner than this brand. I like that it&#x27;s more thick and goopy because it spreads more evenly than the thinner brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot. I fill the dropper and just drop a few drops into my hand and it&#x27;s enough for my entire face and neck. I use a retinol moisturizer on top of it. If you do use something over the top, make sure it dries completely before you add anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might feel slightly tight after you apply it, but once it completely dries it does not feel hard or uncomfortable at all. My face looks really nice and smooth. The packaging is really good, too!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. It comes in glass bottle with dropper that allows you to control the amount. You only need 1-2 drops of the non-greasy lightweight fluid. This serum has no scent and is easily absorbed by my skin. I am hooked on this serum. Adding hyaluronic acid serum to my nightly routine has done great things for my skin. It really helps my night cream to work better since it captures and keeps all of that hydration into the skin. It&#x27;s very lightweight and absorbs rapidly. After only a few days wrinkles become less noticeable and my skin looks lighter. I am so pleased with the results. My skin is radiant, glowing, and firm and my complexion had evened out!! My self-esteem has tripled and I feel so much more confident! I even dare to leave the house without makeup now and don&#x27;t give it a second thought. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle of Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum today. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it because this is my first hyaluronic acid serum I have ever tried. Upon opening there is no unpleasant odor or strong scent of any kind. A little bit of product went a long way and covered my face and neck generously. It absorbed quickly and OMG my face was soft and subtle just after the first application!! I will do another review after a few more weeks and give it time to do some justice to my 42 y/o skin;)  I received this bottle for review.</li>
    <li> After several week of use now. I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best? thank you</li>
    <li> Tested on right and left hands over weeks and notice a define difference. Soaks right in, leaves no tackiness, &amp; seems to have lightened age spots slightly already (or is this just wishful thinking/viewing...?).</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! I usually use a moisturizer for my skin after I wash my face. But I started using this and it did not make my face greasy nor did it burn my eyes. My skin was left dewy and moisturized and did not leave a dry patch anywhere. Definitely going to buy more when I run out!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. very good!!!</li>
    <li> it work grate, I love it and recommended to a friend</li>
    <li> Only been using for 2 days and it has already made a difference in my dry skin.....I love it.  And recommend buying it..it also smells pretty good</li>
    <li> Love this! Its a really great product and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Only used it once but what a great product</li>
    <li> Love love love! My face feels so supple and smooth. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I get this all the time I love what it does for my skin</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after using this just a few times.  Delivery was fast.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I got this product through Coupon Clipinista 3 days ago.  I have used each day and am absolutely in love!!  Great scent, goes on easily and makes my skin feel tightened.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Skin is noticeably smoother and softer almost immediately.  Reduced appearance of fine lines.  And a plus it is an excellent natural lip plumper.  Put a little on my lips overnight and I noticed  they looked fuller and pressing them together I noticed they felt fuller.  An excellent product and the price is extremely reasonable.</li>
    <li> This serum works really well, doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell, and I enjoyed using it. Easy to apply, and simple process. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other products I&#x27;ve used, which is a great bonus. My skin felt fresh and new after I used it! Definitely a product worth the buy. I got a discount on it, but I&#x27;d pay full price any day!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and specifically from this brand and this formulation. I love that it has vitamin C and E in it so I don&#x27;t have to purchase separate serums for that, it absorbs so easily and feels hydrating and smooth on the skin. I have absolutely noticed a big increase of moisture since starting using this, I use it on my face, neck, decollete and on the backs of my hands. It comes in a nice amber bottle to protect from oxidation and I will be purchasing the larger size once I run out!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using www.tomoson.com, regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe in.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful . This product is the best  one I&#x27;ve ever used....&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase again.  Results noticeable almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Love it !!!! 5 stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve had people comment on how great my skin looks. I recently purchased the nigh cream and face wash and I love them too. I&#x27;ve tried very expensive stuff  in the past in hopes that it will work better than the more affordable stuff but is not always the case.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I hope this company will be making wonderful products for year to come.</li>
    <li> Works great on my skin, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts and good size that lasted a while.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Leaves my skin feeling so good ! Smells good also !</li>
    <li> bought as gift no complaints</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft an smooth! I love the difference it has made on dark spots on my skin. Will definitely continue to use!</li>
    <li> Good quality, easy to apply on face.  My skin become smooth and not dry any more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice daily since receiving it. I am so impressed by the moisturizing benefits and feel a much healthier glow. The product soaks into skin within seconds and leaves no unpleasant film or stickiness. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to maintain healthy looking skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this because it&#x27;s not drying at all.</li>
    <li> Time will tell if this works! But so far it moisturizes great and feels great on my skin . There is no heavy fragrance or heavy feel!</li>
    <li> I think it is okay.  I was hoping for better results.</li>
    <li> My poor skin went through it during and right after pregnancy. As a licensed Esthetician, I knew the benefits of hyaluronic acid, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on some.  My skin immediately felt the difference after the first use, but 30 days later I was beaming! I was very pleasantly surprised by how hydrating and brightening this serum was and have recommend it to family, friends and clients. **Just a tip: Keep it in the fridge for an amazing cooling effect**</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with product. Met all my expectations that I had planned. Would buy again definitely!</li>
    <li> great made my skin look brand new</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! Works great, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my bathroom drawer, which is ALWAYS a plus!</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel firm and soft when I put it on. It contains great stuff -hyaluronic acid serum, vitamin c, vitamin e, aloe, witch hazel, green tea, geranium. The smell that pick up is a combination of things but more like geranium but not too strong. I put this on after my toner and top it off with my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> LOVE it!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!  So moisturizing and leaves skin so soft. !  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it !</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I use it and almost immediately you can see the fine lines fading. I use in the evening after I wash my face. I also use in the morning, if I remember. I am excited to see the long term results.</li>
    <li> Leaves your face feeling sticky. No noticeable changes after over a month of  use.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommend you give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> So far I love it! It has only been a week and I honestly feel like I can see some difference in my fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
    <li> For just less than 3 weeks， I see the result！ Love it！</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid Serum twice a day for about a month. I love the fact that this serum is glycerin-based. Its thicker, gel-like formula instantly makes my dry skin feel more comfortable and more hydrated. My skin looks a bit plumper since I started using it, too. It has become one of my favorite skincare serums, and now that the heat is back on for the fall/winter, it is a necessity. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My eyes had such dark circles, I felt like a racccoon and nothing could cover it up. This made a real difference!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know how this will work, I use serums w/hyaluronic acid and have for about 2 years. This is thick and clings to the dropper. It goes on smooth but you have to roll the dropper over your fingers to put it on.I don&#x27;t expect any problems-hopefully in time I will see a difference.</li>
    <li> I am loving the Hyaluronic Acid Serum Vitamin C Serum. It leave my skin feeling moisturized and I saw a change in my skin after the first use. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product, and it makes me feel like the reviews are fake (like other reviewers have stated).  Did absolutely nothing for my skin. Total waste.</li>
    <li> This product is not magic but it definitely does tighten the skin by 50 percent IF you really slather it on and double up or triple up on the amount.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying this.  If you go without makeup and apply a LOT of this product, you will look 15 years younger.  That is why I use it.&lt;br /&gt;At night, I usually apply a normal amount. I have only used this product for about a week, so it is too early to know the results of long term use.</li>
    <li> Definitely a difference.  I&#x27;ve learned through beauty salons and skin experts that you can not actually&#x27;shrink&#x27; your pores. However,  you can make them appear smaller.  The only time I have accomplished that is,  going to a salon and paying high prices for cleaning procedures and this serum.  Not only does this serum accomplish the look of smaller pores but my skin has a shine to it, like the young elastic look my children have.  The only thing is you have to follow their instructions on using it twice a day or the effects wear off.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks...with vitamin C.  Def corrects your problem skin!</li>
    <li> Loving how my skin looks &amp; feels since using this!  Much softer &amp; smoother!</li>
    <li> kinda thick cant get the rest out of the bottle unless i dilute it and dont want to do that</li>
    <li> I love this product, since using it my face has smoother and more even skin. My dry patches are gone. This isnt watery like others. I&#x27;m  definitely ordering more.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It is thick enough to go on easily, spreads smoothly and absorbs quickly.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and I see an improvement in the fine lines I have around my eyes.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on my face. I have used some stronger acids before where you need to clean it off your face afterwards. This one is nice because it is much faster for every day use. The ingredient list is perfect.</li>
    <li> I oddly find this product drying which is odd as it is touted as being &amp;#34;the product&amp;#34; for keeping skin moist.</li>
    <li> I used 1 bottle and I can tell the difference already. I&#x27;am so happy with this product. I have bought 4 more bottles.</li>
    <li> My skin is much softer and I feel like there are fewer fine lines since using this product for the last few weeks.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Took me awhile to actually start using it. I wish I had started using it right when it arrived. I didn&#x27;t expect to see any noticeable improvement at least for a few weeks but after a few days of using it I noticed my skin was a lot more smooth, soft and the lines on my forehead seemed to be less visibile. My skin actually feels a lil more plump too. So I am pleasantly surprised and happy with this product and am about to purchase another bottle for back up!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Makes my skin feel extremely smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really works in my face. Everyday i feel my face much brighter.</li>
    <li> My face feels and looks younger. It hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin or made it too oily.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product thanks so much</li>
    <li> I really like how this works. A good product to have in caring for your skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in using it but I will continue to an update in the future.</li>
    <li> I have some trouble on skin so i bought this product. good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I tried this one as I&#x27;d been looked at several different brands and formulas for Hyaluronic Acid serums. I really like that this one adds Vitamin C, Jojoba oil, and Green Tea. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;m impressed with the change in the way my skin looks and feels. There&#x27;s a noticeable difference right after application in the smoothness of my skin. And overall, my skin looks more even, brighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this irritates it a little bit.  Gave it to a friend and she loves it, though.</li>
