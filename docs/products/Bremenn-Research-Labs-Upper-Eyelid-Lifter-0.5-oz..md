      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
      <li>The time between Botox injections has increased by months I am thrilled &amp; this product works.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if this is helping or not.  </li>
      <li>However, to it&#x27;s benefit, this seems like a nice, soothing, moisturizing eye cream.</li>
      <li>and I liked it so well that I decided to find it on line.  </li>
      <li>I know many loved ones who have had the blerophasty successfullly..</li>
      <li>What I liked best was that it did not irritate my sensitive eye areas like a lot of products do.  </li>
      <li>Great product for a quick lift.  </li>
      <li>Very good eye cream at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Great discovery, and one that I will take with me into my \\&quot;golden years\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>but this is not &amp;#34;Plastic Surgery&amp;#34; but for a product that is so easy to use , I love it!  </li>
      <li>Of course, being at my age, 60+, I have tried many eye products trying to find that miracle one.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and i pray that it never gets discontinued.</li>
      <li>It absorbs better and can&#x27;t interfere with makeup)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD</li>
      <li>so I have tried many products.  </li>
      <li>I noticed I can SEE better.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I notice more drooping if I haven&#x27;t used it for a week.</li>
      <li>The product has ,in fact, satisfied my need.</li>
      <li>My eyes do look better.</li>
      <li>I wld love to give this a go again..</li>
      <li>and I started noticing that my circles were much more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I really love this.  </li>
      <li>Having said that, I was wondering if anyone had a problem with a leaky top?  </li>
      <li>Love it!I think it works,and can see a difference in the appearance of my eyelids.</li>
      <li>Puffed out eyelids as it should but just caused that to droop over lid more.</li>
      <li>This is the safe, cheaper way to correct the problem.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok not a miracle cream.</li>
      <li>my aging eyelids are smoother allowing eye make up to go on better.</li>
      <li>The advertisement said &amp;#34;Not a surgial eye lift, but pretty good.&amp;#34;  It wasn&#x27;t good at all.  </li>
      <li>best eye cream, really lifts your lids, I have tried others that dont really do anything.  </li>
      <li>but you cannot believe everything you read is a very true statement.</li>
      <li>I have used the Upper Eyelid Lifter product for about two years and have seen very good results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my eyes if I happen to get some in them.</li>
      <li>can see the difference when applied  after many uses no sagging of the upper lids great  </li>
      <li>I strongly urge you to spend your money elsewhere.</li>
      <li>This is the first one that has been effective.  </li>
      <li>The seller was fine - I received my order when and as promised.  </li>
      <li>This product works and works quickly!</li>
      <li>important thing :: you must wear it every day</li>
      <li>When you get older you need something like this to help you look better!  </li>
      <li>But the product is still very effective, so it is not a big deal.</li>
      <li>My confidence has increased tremendously and little things like wearing eye shadow again is great!</li>
      <li>It was worth the investment for me, I will use this faithfully because I notice the difference!</li>
      <li>I do not see a significant change yet, but I am hopeful.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money .Great!</li>
      <li>The positive reviews I read of Bremenn&#x27;s product led me to try it, and I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased this product because I was noticed that my eyelids were becoming wrinkled and droopy.  </li>
      <li>The cap was full of the cream upon arrival, so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>The tubes are full of air making it look like you are getting a full tube at their already exhorbitant price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m finding if I first apply a strong serum with Vitamin C and Hydraulanic Acid</li>
      <li>I have tried other products that claim they are great but they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>Then, it turns out only the very top of the tube is full of cream.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone for a quick repair and savings.</li>
      <li>I have to be fair and say that it may be too early to really know how this cream is working.  </li>
      <li>This product not only healed the area, but I look more bright-eyed and youthful than I did before the work was done!</li>
      <li>When I pumped it the first time, it expelled air and flattened out with only the very top of the tube full of cream.  </li>
      <li>After a few weeks of using this product twice a day I noticed a great improvement.  </li>
      <li>do not feel this product is worth the price as it does not combat sagging and drooping. .</li>
      <li>upper lid kind of lifted...</li>
      <li>it soaks right in/</li>
      <li>It does go right into your skin - non greasy.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I have used it 2X daily, so it&#x27;s cost effective as well.</li>
      <li>Most likely with buy it again.</li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing!</li>
      <li>Have tried MANY creams and this one actually DOES help.</li>
      <li>I took a chance buying this product, and sure enough it doesn&#x27;t do anything whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I used this product for 6 months and can say that it really works!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice a day since the day I wrote the first part of this review</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet but hope it does a better job than the one I am currently using.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy with this product!  It actually works better than other products I have tried!</li>
    <li> This has helped my upper eyelids enough that I am on my second tube and plan to continue to use it.  There wasn&#x27;t an overly dramatic change, but enough of an improvement that I was satisfied.  Since plastic surgery isn&#x27;t on my options list I feel like this product has suited my needs.</li>
    <li> Love it. The only product that does lift my upper eyelids.</li>
    <li> I have to be fair and say that it may be too early to really know how this cream is working.  So far I am not sure if there is any change or not.  If so, it is minimal, but I have only been using it for about a month.  I will keep using it and I will post later if I see any results.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical before buying this product but my eye lids sagginess wasn&#x27;t too severe so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and I am in LOVE! My confidence has increased tremendously and little things like wearing eye shadow again is great!</li>
    <li> Sorry this did nothing new for me. Same as several other eye products I have tried, some costing more and some costing less. Did feel good on and dried fast, but nothing difference. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I just bought it and started using it a few weeks ago so I&#x27;m not sure if it works or mot. I hope so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the upper eyelid lifter for over a year and am now buying my second tube. I notice more drooping if I haven&#x27;t used it for a week. It is definitely worth the price as it lasts for a very long time - one tube for over a year. I&#x27;m over age 60, slightly overweight, have modest eyelid drooping, and want my eyes to show well. I&#x27;ll keep buying the lifter.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product.  I am giving it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the consistency of it, however - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to oily/creamy/gel-like - it seems to have separated.  And the applicator does not squeeze out an even amount of the product so sometimes it is hard to control the amount it dispenses.  However it appears to do the job of diminishing the upper eyelid wrinkles and is not overly greasy to use.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have baggy eyes (hereditary) and feel like it really ages me. I am 59 (young in my opinion!) Have tried MANY creams and this one actually DOES help. I;ve only used it 3 days but I can tell a difference.  It&#x27;s not like surgery ....I&#x27;m not doing that anyway...but it definitely tightens and lifts some. I even have one eye that is worse than the other....seems so baggy it&#x27;s affecting my vision. I noticed I can SEE better. I am impressed and will continue to use this cream!! Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I saw no results with this product.  Company states you need to use for atleast 30 days before you see any improvment.  I recently went to Beauticontrol Home Spa party, and I&#x27;m hooked.  Their Tight Firm n Fill product are GREAT(!!!) you will see instant results that lasts for hours, and it&#x27;s a 90 day supply . The Beauticontrol products also cost less.</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive but worth it, in my opinion. I had puffy, droopy upper eyelids upon waking in the morning. I don&#x27;t know if my upper lids were actually sagging from age or if they were puffy from water retention due to salty foods. Anyway, after just a few days i saw a drastic improvement. And now, about 2 months later, my eyelids are like they were 10 years ago and my once-thinning brows are thicker, so it seems like the ingredients in this product must have something to do with that. At least that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m assuming. I love this product and i pray that it never gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> This product arrived with the box smashed,no seal on the container,and the tube appeared to have been not full. I sent it back and I am still waiting for a refund.(several weeks later)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two years and I love it. It lasts for months and it truly tightens the upper eyelid. My friends all ask me if I had blepharoplasty but the only thing I have done is use this product!</li>
    <li> This product works very well for me;.</li>
    <li> for the $50.00 price tag on such a tiny tube I expected to see results immediately, but after 3 weeks, no noticeable improvement!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I&#x27;ve been using for a week or so now and I feel like it&#x27;s working! One of the only products out there for the upper lid!!</li>
    <li> I have used more than half of the tube with absolutely no results.  Very dissapointing&lt;br /&gt;since I was hoping I finally found a product for over eye puffiness, instead of most&lt;br /&gt;products being for under eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> I wld love to give this a go again..Unfortunately I misplaced my other eye serum and an using.this..maybe it isnt so terrible..I&#x27;m finding if I first apply a strong serum with Vitamin C and Hydraulanic Acid...wait for it to dry..massaging it in a bit..then apply a dab of Brennens..it works very well..I wld buy another one..but it is so expensive..if they want to use me as a guinea pig for free..I&#x27;m out here contact Amazon for my address etc..and I&#x27;m on board..I know many loved ones who have had the blerophasty successfullly..but i will exhaust all until tried all!!!</li>
    <li> I needed very little help. So thought this might do the trick. It did nothing. After a month of use, there was not a bit of difference in the eye lid. I would not use it again. And for someone with a more serious lid problem, it would not be enough. It would be better to see an ophthalmologist and have a blephroplasty done to take care of the serious eye lid droop.</li>
    <li> The one that they mailed to me is last year version, not the same as the picture. But the product is still very effective, so it is not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Do Not waste your money. I have been using this product day &amp; night and there are absolutely no results. Would not recommend. Wish I had my money back!!!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0033EWRSI Bremenn Research Labs Upper Eyelid Lifter(TM) 0.5 oz]]I have extreme droopy upper eye lids.  I have used Bremenn Upper Eyelid Lifter twice a day for about 25 days and it really works.  FYI: I am well over 60 years.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work any better than the current generic product I&#x27;m using from Wal-Mart!  Very disappointed in the results.  I was expecting a mini eye lift.  Minimal change in appearance of upper eye area after use.</li>
    <li> this was a total waste of money&lt;br /&gt;saw no difference after a week&amp;#34; nothing&amp;#34;&amp;#34; notta&amp;#34; !!!&lt;br /&gt; would not waste my money on this&lt;br /&gt; wish I had read a review  before purchase</li>
    <li> I give this 3 stars because you can get the same thing at Walmart.com for around $24.00. Walmart sells clinical, but this is the same stuff I got for $24.00. I&#x27;m really ticked at myself for not being more careful. Go to Walmart.com. You&#x27;ll save like $12.00 dollars!!</li>
    <li> NO MORE UPPER SAG brings up those sagging spots  can see the difference when applied  after many uses no sagging of the upper lids great  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I think it helps, but I am now 67, and I&#x27;m not sure I can expect it to do the same job it did even several years ago.  I remain, however, always hopeful!</li>
    <li> I do not see a significant change yet, but I am hopeful.  I use it daily and follow the directions.  Will review again when the tube is finished.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and was considering upper eyelid surgery until I discovered Bremenn&#x27;s Upper Eyelid Lifter.  This stuff really works!  In the 60 days I&#x27;ve been using it, the little bit of crepey skin I had has all but gone.  A bargain at $50.00 and an absolute must in my makeup purse.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet but hope it does a better job than the one I am currently using. I doubt it is going to provide any dramatic lifting but if it helps a little. that&#x27;s about all one can ask of a cosmetic product.</li>
    <li> Used it regularly for many weeks, and there was no difference in appearance whatsoever.  Perhaps it is just because of my advanced age--too late for any help.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what others expect but this is not &amp;#34;Plastic Surgery&amp;#34; but for a product that is so easy to use , I love it!  As I put it on I can feel the uplift on my lids!  When you get older you need something like this to help you look better!  It was worth the investment for me, I will use this faithfully because I notice the difference!</li>
    <li> Have only used it for a short time, but already noticed a difference in my eyelids.  Plan to continue using.</li>
    <li> I am just this side of 60 and have tried many other products.  This is the first one that has been effective.  I used this product for 6 months and can say that it really works!  There was a noticeable difference in the tightening of the upper eyelid area.</li>
    <li> Was rated in magazines so highly I thought I would try. Was advertised to help with drooping eyelids. Puffed out eyelids as it should but just caused that to droop over lid more. Don&#x27;t know how you would apply to avoid this. Expensive</li>
    <li> Used the whole tube and absoultly no change. Don&#x27;t waste your money! Time for surgery. I used on upper eyelids only.</li>
    <li> It was a gradual lifting of teh eyelid.  Not immediate improvement, but a good product.  Would order the product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a month now, and the wife says she can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s helping much.  Just be careful not to get it in your eyes because it burns.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Have used it only a few times, but it seems to do what it was advertised to do. Most likely with buy it again.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing! I had hope this would help but it was a complete waste of time and money - doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me, I won&#x27;t be reordering</li>
    <li> I took a chance buying this product, and sure enough it doesn&#x27;t do anything whatsoever. I strongly urge you to spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> is still early to tell, but I had 2 problems with the product: I bought 2 boxes and one of them came sealed but empty and the other, the tube came with a hole</li>
    <li> The product could be good, however, I received looking used products, half empty tubes with the traces of cream on the tips of the tubes and traces of dried cream inside of the lids. Returning the product.</li>
    <li> only one that works for upper lids.</li>
    <li> Save your money. This stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything. I saw and felt no difference at all after using this product.</li>
    <li> Made no difference whatsoever - there was no visible &amp;#34; lift&amp;#34;  Very disappointed - don&#x27;t waste your money - not worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this eye cream. Since I started using the first tube I&#x27;ve noticed my aging eyelids are smoother allowing eye make up to go on better. The droopiness I was noticing is visibly improved. I am very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve achieved in three months of using this product.  It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my eyes if I happen to get some in them. Very good eye cream at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say that it has improved anything.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and I have not noticed any upper eyelid improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel this product is worth the price as it does not combat sagging and drooping. .</li>
    <li> I DO NOT recommend this product. I used it faithfully over 30 plus days and there is not even the slightest change. This makes me wonder if the reviews that say it is great are not paid reviews. This product is bunk.</li>
    <li> I am a very young (ha! ha!) 60 year old, and the area right under my brows is just starting to get the crepey appearance.  This cream worked the first time I used it.  I use it in the morning and again when I use my night cleansing routine.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot - the size of a piece of rice.  It does go right into your skin - non greasy.  If this came in vat sizes, I&#x27;d use it from head to toe.  Having said that, I was wondering if anyone had a problem with a leaky top?  The cap was full of the cream upon arrival, so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  The product is very good, but the tube leaking was a bummer!</li>
    <li> The seller was fine - I received my order when and as promised.  However, the product doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s just another overpriced empty promise.  Too bad, because if it had worked I would have reordered it.</li>
    <li> Absolutly no effects - Expensive - Disappointed</li>
    <li> Although some people rave about this, I do not see any change. However it does not irritate my sensitive skin so I suppose that is something.</li>
    <li> I had used this product for a little over a year, then tried another upper eyelid lifter that I had heard was good and was less expensive.  It did not work at all.  I went back to Bremenn and immediately my eyelids appeared much less droopy.  I don&#x27;t intend to use anything else ever again.  This product delivers on what it promises.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not a miracle cream. It works as well as Olay does.  Not a must for your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this product. I think I need to use it a little longer, but I will buy it again, it seems to work.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;(Like it claims.)&lt;br /&gt;IT MADE MY EYES SWELL AND ITCH THOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible stuff! A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have just found myself with droopy upper eye lids and it is very distressing. I have tried a couple of different products and this works pretty well, but you can&#x27;t use any makeup after applying.  I usually apply moisturizer, a light tinted sunscreen then this before putting on my mascara.  I will probably order again.</li>
    <li> This really works/I have no allergic reaction to it/it soaks right in/I use it before bed and again in the morning before makeup.It has made a very noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> So far it works like everyone says it does.</li>
    <li> Can tell a little  different! Not sure that I would pay that much again for the product!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years. It does work. You only need to use a little and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I believe this really works.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now.  Walmarts carried it for awhile and that&#x27;s where I found it first. They stopped carrying it and I liked it so well that I decided to find it on line.  I really like this product. Wish they made a neck firmer that worked as well as this does.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have noticed my upper eye lids seem to be a little less droopy.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks and don&#x27;t see results yet, so it&#x27;s not completely a negative review because I am giving myself 2 months... Stars could increase or decrease.. Stay tuned</li>
    <li> You can tell a difference almost immediately.  It really does work.  And you just need to use a small amount, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It works. I don&#x27;t have horribly droopy lids, but at age 45, there is a little sagging. It definitely smooths out the upper lids. I will buy another tube when this one runs out, but you just need a drop- 1 tube can last  for 5-6 months.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products to help my sagging eyelids. This product works and works quickly! I use it every morning and the difference is remarkable. I hope it continues as I age since this is easier,cheaper and obviously less painful than a surgical eye lift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old, and my skin is oily, so I have very few lines or wrinkles, but my droopy upper eyelids give away my age, unless I use this wonderful product.  I need only a tiny dab of it on each droopy eyelid to open my eyes up and shrink the puffy skin.  I would say the cream undoes about 10 years of ageing. There are NO side effects at all, and the cream does not sting.  I&#x27;m allergic to a long, long list of drugs and cosmetic products, but I have no problem with this Eyelid Lifter.  I absolutely love this product and I will keep buying it as long as they make it.  I have tried myriad other products which were supposed to shrink my puffy upper lids and I had no results at all from any of them.  The positive reviews I read of Bremenn&#x27;s product led me to try it, and I am so glad I did.  I use it every day, not just when I&#x27;m going out, because it&#x27;s just such a psychological boost to see those bags recede and see my youthful face again.  I highly recommend it--it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and at a reasonable price.  I have spent so much money on more expensive products that were useless that the Bremenn Upper Eyelid Lifter seems like a true bargain by comparison, and it works!  It works!</li>
    <li> Does not do what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product because I was noticed that my eyelids were becoming wrinkled and droopy.  After a few weeks of using this product twice a day I noticed a great improvement.  My eyelids look much smoother and my eye makeup goes on without showing creases and wrinkles.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought a tube of this stuff.  When I pumped it the first time, it expelled air and flattened out with only the very top of the tube full of cream.  I took it back to Dillard&#x27;s Dept.store for an exchange.  I pumped the second tube at the store.  It flattened out.  The tubes are full of air making it look like you are getting a full tube at their already exhorbitant price.  Then, it turns out only the very top of the tube is full of cream.  Isn&#x27;t there a law against that?</li>
    <li> Have only been using for a few days, so I have no opinion yet. Just had plugs put in my lids for excessive dryness. If this cream doesn&#x27;t help, I&#x27;m going to have to see a plastic surgeon because my lids are so droopy.</li>
    <li> I saw this advertised and ordered it.  It arrived promptly and as described.  I like it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, does not work</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money.  After using it for over a month, I saw no difference.  The advertisement said &amp;#34;Not a surgial eye lift, but pretty good.&amp;#34;  It wasn&#x27;t good at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This creme really does what it claims-lifts eyelids. I have very delicate eyelids and sensitive skin; more so now that I am in my 50s. I had permanent brows applied, and a waxing to remove the strays underneath that left my eyes (particularly the lids) swollen and the skin loose and sagging. This product not only healed the area, but I look more bright-eyed and youthful than I did before the work was done! Amazing results in just a couple of weeks. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I have used it 2X daily, so it&#x27;s cost effective as well. Great discovery, and one that I will take with me into my \\&quot;golden years\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This feels soothing going on skin but I do not see that it lifts or tightens skin around the eyes. However, to it&#x27;s benefit, this seems like a nice, soothing, moisturizing eye cream.</li>
    <li> I am 57 years old. I have been using this cream for just over 2 weeks now. The difference is amazing. I now have my eyelids back and all the creapiness I had on my eyelids has vanished. My overall eye appearance looks at least 10 years younger. I will continue with this cream and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great item. I used it twice a day. It does tighten the the upper eyelids. Could see results within a week.</li>
    <li> This product does not lift anything. It moisturizes, but I can moisturize with a variety of products. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed in this eyelid lifter. Doesn&#x27;t help one bit, expensive, and the tube feels like it wasn&#x27;t even filled that much, so I doubt I got what I was supposed to.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference when I use it.</li>
    <li> It seems like its working ....upper lid kind of lifted...thanks</li>
    <li> Quick fix, doesn&#x27;t last long.  Not totally a quick fix.  It is average.</li>
    <li> I actually see results on the upper eyelid.  Not dramatic, but noticeable. It also has not caused any eye or eyelid irritation.</li>
    <li> Zero stars for zero results.  Do not waste your money.  Does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  I went on the reviews....but you cannot believe everything you read is a very true statement.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I have used the Upper Eyelid Lifter product for about two years and have seen very good results.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has a bit of a problem with droopy lids.</li>
    <li> Not dramatic results, but have seen steady improvement, not only in the crepiness of the lid, but also in firming.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference. no results at all.</li>
    <li> Great product for a quick lift.  What I liked best was that it did not irritate my sensitive eye areas like a lot of products do.  Worth the money .Great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now, and definitely see a difference.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, so the eyelid area can be very problematic and I&#x27;ve tried several products. This is the first product that I&#x27;ve used and  really seen a difference.</li>
    <li> J&#x27;ai vu une amélioration juste après quelque jours d&#x27;utilisation 2 fois par jour matin et soir, j&#x27;adore ce produit.</li>
    <li> I used it but I didn&#x27;t see any of the results it was supposed to produce.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I&#x27;ve used for 2 years (off and on) as needed.  you should notice an improvement in appearance in about 3 week.</li>
    <li> I have used for about 6 months. I have tried many eyelid serums &amp; creams &amp; this is the first one that has actually worked. I have a hereditary predisposition to very droopy eyelids. My mothers was so severe that ins paid for her eye lift because of the potential of the eye lids affecting her vision. My eyes &amp; eyelids are very similar to hers. I have gotten Botox in a area that creates a faux eyelift. In between injections, as the Botox wears off I use eyelid lift products and this product out performs all the other very expensive products I have experimented with. The time between Botox injections has increased by months I am thrilled &amp; this product works. I am 53 &amp; will eventually need a eyelift similar to my moms but this product is putting that surgery off for now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the eyelid lifter.  This is the first time that I&#x27;ve come across a product that does what it says that it will do. I&#x27;m 74 years young &amp; my lids are really getting droopy.  I have tried other products that claim they are great but they aren&#x27;t.  I ordered 2 tubes but when I get low, I will reorder.  I have used this product since 2/22/2014.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time and it actually works.  My eyes do look better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this last year and was delighted that it actually worked. Unfortunately I am out of work, but once I get a job, will order Again..</li>
    <li> My eyes are a little heavy on the top but really just look like a deep set eye.. The skin has loosened a little so I thought I would try this product. It did nothing but moisturizer the area..Do not waste your money!  Considering the price it did no noticeable difference at all..shame on them..</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I&#x27;ve  been using it for a couple of weeks now and already see a difference!  I use a tiny dot  on each eyelid, twice a day - there&#x27;s no burning, nor does my vision get &#x27;blurry&#x27; like with other eye creams.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;m no youngster, and this stuff took 10 years off my appearance .... like magic!  I HIGHLY recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; It&#x27;s now November and I&#x27;m still using the eye cream with magically amazing results!  Last September, I celebrated my 50th birthday. A few days ago, I passed for &amp;#60; (less than) 40. (My cheeks are aching from a perpetual grin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important thing :: you must wear it every day - the effect is temporary.  Slacking off a day or two may cause eyelids to droop again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been several months now and I&#x27;m using it every 24 hours.  (Use it at bedtime with a mask.  It absorbs better and can&#x27;t interfere with makeup)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are now on the cusp of 2016 ... and I still use this eye cream every night, like clockwork.  I get a big kick out of the expression on someone&#x27;s face when I&#x27;m admitting my true age ... 55!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wholeheartedly recommend this cream, and suggest you start using it before you need it.  Prevention being the key to the &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product for awhile and feel it does what it&#x27;s suppose to/&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that for those that order this regularly we should be get a price reduction of some kind.</li>
    <li> Of course, being at my age, 60+, I have tried many eye products trying to find that miracle one.  Well, this is the closet one I&#x27;ve found.  It really does lift that droopy eyelid and tighten that skin.  I would recomend  it to anyone with saggy eye lids before they even consider plastic surgery.  This is the safe, cheaper way to correct the problem.</li>
    <li> I really love this.  It is the only cosmetic treatment that I&#x27;ve found that actually does tighten droopy upper eyelids.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergic eyes either.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this product before giving it a try. I am sure that it probably works on someone younger. I am in my 60&#x27;s and it hasn&#x27;t done a thing for my droopy lids.</li>
    <li> This product works well will put off surgery in the near future,It is absorbed quickly and not oily. Only a small amount is needed.</li>
    <li> Wife satisified with product , if wife happy I&#x27;m happy. Says very good product and was well worth the buy</li>
    <li> After a couple of weeks this began dispensing as half liquid, half product.  It feels pleasant going on but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference after a couple of months of use.</li>
    <li> This product comes in two different types of dispensers, the pump top as shown and a squeeze tube.  The product itself is very effective, as it should be for the price, but if you are shopping for it, make sure to get the squeeze tube and not the pump.  Why?  Because with the former, you can control the amount of product that comes out and with the latter you cannot.  It is expensive, and the pump top leads to waste. I&#x27;d hate to think the manufacturer planned it that way. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the product has an unpleasant smell. With the tube, the quantity squeezed out is so small you don&#x27;t notice, but with the pump top there&#x27;s enough that you do.  I will only reorder this product if I can find it in tube form.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t perform as expected</li>
    <li> Great service,best eyelid lifter I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> May favorite product, can not go without!</li>
    <li> Disappointed that product was past its shelf life!</li>
    <li> Love it!I think it works,and can see a difference in the appearance of my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local, every town/city store, for $15-$20.  It took a bit to get use to and it does not work miracles,&lt;br /&gt;but while it is on my eye look brighter and may sag some but they they do not look droopy and tired as without the cream.  I have not used this cream long enough to know if the effect last when the cream is not on.</li>
    <li> best eye cream, really lifts your lids, I have tried others that dont really do anything.  This does what it says it will do.  Although harder and harder to find.</li>
    <li> The product has ,in fact, satisfied my need. Theere is no reason why I should keep it to myself and not  recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I am stunned. I have used this product twice--once this morning and once tonight. And it truly does lift the droopy, puffy area above my eyes, under my eyebrows. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it really does make me look less tired. Amazing. (I&#x27;m 55 years old.)..........And I&#x27;m back--adding to this review a month or so later. I am ordering my second tube. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day since the day I wrote the first part of this review and I am still delighted. There is no lasting improvement from this cream, but without any doubt, my upper eyelids are far droopier and puffier before I apply it each time, and they stay less puffy for most of the day after I use it. I can&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought it yet</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best I have used.  I can&#x27;t afford eyelid surgery so I have tried many products.  I am 50 years old and have been told I don&#x27;t look it.  Coincidence or not, I will never stop using this product.</li>
    <li> does what I expected it to do&lt;br /&gt;use it at home it helps&lt;br /&gt;the product works well&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the product is good</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference, but perhaps my eyes are too far gone! Saggy eyelids that only surgery would fix? Possibly. I&#x27;ve found nothing that works to lift eyelids.</li>
    <li> Works well to lift above the eye</li>
    <li> Worked well and a bunch cheaper than an eyelid repair.  Would recommend to anyone for a quick repair and savings.</li>
    <li> A very gentle cream that you apply to the upper eyelid and above. In a few minutes you can see the lifting of the skin; you look younger and more awake. By the way, I have used Avon&#x27;s Clinical Eye Lift, CVS eye lifting serum,DermaSilk 90 second eye lift and NONE of these products remotely approach how effective Bremenn&#x27;s Upper Eyelid Lifter is at taking away puffiness and lifting and opening the eye. NOTHING. I will never be without this product again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if this is helping or not.  (The fact that I&#x27;m not sure tells me it probably isn&#x27;t making much of a difference!)  I have been using it now for exactly one month, every morning and night, exactly as directed.  I think maybe it helps some when I first use it, but if it does it wears off within a few hours and then my upper lids are sagging big time again.  Definitely not a dramatic improvement. And when I started using this, I stopped using the eye cream I had been using for a few years (drug store brand that costs about one third the price of the Bremenn cream).  Since this cream is only for upper lids that meant I wasn&#x27;t using anything under my eyes and I started noticing that my circles were much more noticeable.  That tells me my previous cream was working, at least to some degree, on the circles, and it may have been just as effective or ineffective as the Bremenn cream on the upper lids.  Bottom line: I will continue using this until it&#x27;s gone, but it&#x27;s probably not worth the $40+ price and I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  Meanwhile, I have returned to my old cream for under my eyes and will probably resume using it on my upper lids too when the Bremenn is gone.  One tip: the Bremenn cream tends to separate and become rather runny, so I recommend kneading and/or shaking the tube before using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that nothing will ever lift my upper eyelids except surgery, which isn&#x27;t going to happen as I&#x27;m in my 60s and have better things to do with my money than intentionally have surgery.  There is maybe a little difference in the past month that I&#x27;ve been using it (I took a before photo), but not enough to pay the price for it again.  I&#x27;ll continue with my drug store brand that saves me money.</li>
</ol>
