### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent price.</li>
      <li>Awesome Product.</li>
      <li>Smells great!</li>
      <li>Anyhow, this product is awesome, it makes your hair shiny and stops the frizz in its tracks.  </li>
      <li>My Daughter loved this Product!!</li>
      <li>Controls the frizz and smells awesome as well.</li>
      <li>The best thing I find with this product is that you can spray it into frizzy hair and it kind if soaks into the hair to reduce frizz and increase shine.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this !</li>
      <li>The oil is exceptionally light, so it does not cause a great look.</li>
      <li>I liked that the oil didn&#x27;t lay on the hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or grimy and comes out in a nice spritz.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never received more compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve discovered this product.</li>
      <li>(Love how is a spray and not a serum.)  </li>
      <li>It does mostly go away once the oil dries.  </li>
      <li>I even tried using more, but still Nada.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this.</li>
      <li>I should have shopped on Amazon as the price is much better.  </li>
      <li>it really works great with her hair.</li>
      <li>Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>we love it...</li>
      <li>Pretty good stuff</li>
      <li>It smells good and it&#x27;s very lite.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly because the first time I used it and liked it was when I used the blow dryer after,</li>
      <li>I have fine, wavy hair</li>
      <li>and I have always had a huge problem with frizziness.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even been a couple days since I shampooed and finished with this product, and it still feels light, smooth, and silky--but not greasy--today.</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of the fragrance, which is more perfume-y than fresh.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I just bought another bottle!</li>
      <li>Yet, three finished product is dry and fly away.</li>
      <li>I do not have curly ethnic hair like most of the positive reviewers of this product</li>
      <li>It was great to apply after my parched hair was sprayed lightly w/ some water to re-hydrate and then followed w/ a few sprays of the Kukui oil.</li>
      <li>I can touch up as needed the next day by touching up bed head with and blow dryer and spraying on more oil.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with results which can be seen in a very short period of time.</li>
      <li>it smells very pretty.</li>
      <li>great oil, doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
      <li>Keeps frizz down and does a great job of protecting it from heat</li>
      <li>This stuff works great to remove frizz and isn&#x27;t heavy at all.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend purchasing this if you have fine hair because it&#x27;s so lightweight.</li>
      <li>I spritz it all over my head right after coming out of the shower</li>
      <li>(though I do still swear by Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Gel, it isn&#x27;t always the right</li>
      <li>For the past year I&#x27;ve been using BB Curl Cream and it&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>Also, for me there is a VERY fine line between just enough and too much of this oil!  </li>
      <li>I am really glad I bit the bullet and tried it, though, because it has actually worked!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smells like a tropical paradise &amp; keeps my hair shiny &amp; pretty all day.</li>
      <li>By spraying my hair with kukui several times over a period of hours and brushing with a natural bristle brush, my hair becomes smooth and silky, almost exactly like the straight hair of many of my friends.</li>
      <li>I was so taken the first time I used this product because I thought I had found the miracle oil for my frizzy hair, but I think it was more like a placebo effect more than anything else since the product states that the oil is &amp;#34;an ancient Hawaiian secret used for its humidity resistant abilities and creates a barrier to help your hair repel humidity&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this out of the other products available because of what it reads on the front label &amp;#34;Indulge your tresses with this exotic blend of kukui nut oil, an ancient Hawaiian secret used for its humidity resistant abilities, creating a shimmering gloss to smooth texture and repel humidity, making every day a &#x27;good hair&#x27; day.&amp;#34; And on the back it says &amp;#34;Why</li>
      <li>It has rehydrated my fine, wavy hair after using an entire bottle.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>You can never use too much of it either because it&#x27;s so lightweight.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really lite oil, like a mist because it&#x27;s in a pump.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very fine mist that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.</li>
      <li>No amount of gel, pomade, flat ironing, smooth serums or hydrating conditioners would make these hairs stay down, and my hair always looks frazzled and unkempt even though it was healthy.  </li>
      <li>and then I use a fair amount of it in the morning when my hair is dry, so it works great on both dry and wet hair without making my hair sticky or stiff.</li>
      <li>but it leaves my hair a little crunchy and doesn&#x27;t always look good the next day.  </li>
      <li>Even mild shampoos on their own leave my hair dry, but sometimes conditioners are too heavy.</li>
      <li>It has a great smell and it helps keep my thick, wavy hair from being frizzy and gross during the humid summer months.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I felt for it, but the oil is not bad, is just not great either.</li>
      <li>It dries on your hair almost instantly and makes hair super duper soft.</li>
      <li>Maybe it wasn&#x27;t the right product for what I was looking for, but this definitely is.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because my hair is also fine and has a tendency to go limp, I was really hesitant to try this product.  </li>
      <li>You might be pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>I thought this would likely be too much for my limp fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Amazing stuff, just a small spritz goes a long way, really helps tame my frizz.</li>
      <li>Now I do only four sprays when my hair is still wet: one on the left, one on the right, one in the back</li>
      <li>I spray it on damp hair before blow drying and a little spritz after I blow dry to calm the hair.  </li>
      <li>I have virgin (untreated/uncolored) Caucasian hair that gets wavy when wet and is mostly straight when dry.  </li>

<li> It has saved my scalp and my hair is soft and shiny, and having back hair that is not easy to get.</li>
<li> Only thing it did was make it a little softer, but only for a short while.</li>
<li> (my hair is long) and one on my hands which I then run through the hair at my temples (the frizziest hair on my head).</li>
<li> I tried using it on dry and wet hair to see if I could get different results, but no luck.</li>
<li> I use it on wet hair then blow dry and use it again when I&#x27;m done styling.  </li>
<li> Then I comb it through with a wide tooth comb.</li>
<li> You can use it on wet hair and it helps define curls and reduce frizziness as it dries (I use a hair dryer with a diffuser...</li>
<li> I noticed that after the second use, my hair became a little oily and a little crunchy.</li>
<li> My hair is thick, dry and frizzy....</li>
<li> i just use spray it in my hands and rub my hands together to heat it a little and just evenly distribute it throughout my hair</li>
<li> few things I noticed:  </li>
<li> Does nothing for my hair that just plain water won&#x27;t do.</li>
<li> Using it on damp hair resulted in an oil slick.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Tried everything but nothing works as well as this product. Very pleased with results which can be seen in a very short period of time. For those who have any hair texture that meets with the challenge of daily frizzing, you should give OGX Anti Frizz Hydrating Oil a try. You might be pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this. Controls the frizz and smells awesome as well. On my second bottle and will defintely keep using.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff, just a small spritz goes a long way, really helps tame my frizz.</li>
    <li> It is not working for my hair</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s so lightweight and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I spritz it all over my head right after coming out of the shower and then I use a fair amount of it in the morning when my hair is dry, so it works great on both dry and wet hair without making my hair sticky or stiff. You can never use too much of it either because it&#x27;s so lightweight. It dries on your hair almost instantly and makes hair super duper soft. It has rehydrated my fine, wavy hair after using an entire bottle. I love it so much that I just bought another bottle! I will continue to use this stuff to help tame my morning hair and to help keep my hair hydrated! I highly recommend purchasing this if you have fine hair because it&#x27;s so lightweight. It will keep your hair healthy, it&#x27;ll give your hair lots of shine, it&#x27;ll make your hair soft and easier to style, and it will tame frizz (sort of - it&#x27;s not a miracle de-frizzer, unfortunately).</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to remove frizz and isn&#x27;t heavy at all.  I spray it on damp hair before blow drying and a little spritz after I blow dry to calm the hair.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like how it makes my hair feel, but not too keen on the smell.  It&#x27;s too flowery for my liking.</li>
    <li> I love this ! It has saved my scalp and my hair is soft and shiny, and having back hair that is not easy to get. Id buy from this seller again as well.</li>
    <li> great oil, doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair. I have fine/straight but a lot of it. it smells very pretty. What i do is i just use spray it in my hands and rub my hands together to heat it a little and just evenly distribute it throughout my hair</li>
    <li> Keeps frizz down and does a great job of protecting it from heat</li>
    <li> I was so taken the first time I used this product because I thought I had found the miracle oil for my frizzy hair, but I think it was more like a placebo effect more than anything else since the product states that the oil is &amp;#34;an ancient Hawaiian secret used for its humidity resistant abilities and creates a barrier to help your hair repel humidity&amp;#34;. Ok, so I felt for it, but the oil is not bad, is just not great either. I noticed that after the second use, my hair became a little oily and a little crunchy. Hmmmm... I tried using it on dry and wet hair to see if I could get different results, but no luck. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly because the first time I used it and liked it was when I used the blow dryer after, but I rather avoid the heat on my hair so I don&#x27;t use the blow dryer often. I will finish the bottle to see if I can get different results but for now, this is my review.</li>
    <li> It has a great smell and it helps keep my thick, wavy hair from being frizzy and gross during the humid summer months. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or grimy and comes out in a nice spritz.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for my hair that just plain water won&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really lite oil, like a mist because it&#x27;s in a pump. It smells good and it&#x27;s very lite. I wish they had made the pump tube shorter because some of my oil spilled out  before it was delivered to me.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> My Daughter loved this Product!! it really works great with her hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair &amp; in the morning I spritz my hair with some water &amp; spray this on it. It&#x27;s smells like a tropical paradise &amp; keeps my hair shiny &amp; pretty all day. I&#x27;ve never received more compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve discovered this product.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this from Ulta for 7.99 plus tax. I should have shopped on Amazon as the price is much better.  Anyhow, this product is awesome, it makes your hair shiny and stops the frizz in its tracks.  It&#x27;s a very fine mist that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy. (Love how is a spray and not a serum.)  I use it on wet hair then blow dry and use it again when I&#x27;m done styling.  Smells great! Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum from this same company on my hair. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t the right product for what I was looking for, but this definitely is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy hair. Even mild shampoos on their own leave my hair dry, but sometimes conditioners are too heavy. I don&#x27;t want to use a greasy oil on my hair (and therefore against my skin) and I don&#x27;t like crispy, flaky sprays and gels (though I do still swear by Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Gel, it isn&#x27;t always the right thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this out of the other products available because of what it reads on the front label &amp;#34;Indulge your tresses with this exotic blend of kukui nut oil, an ancient Hawaiian secret used for its humidity resistant abilities, creating a shimmering gloss to smooth texture and repel humidity, making every day a &#x27;good hair&#x27; day.&amp;#34; And on the back it says &amp;#34;Why we love it...it&#x27;s an indulgent blend that defines the curves of your curls while eliminating frizz and adding bounce and shine that lasts!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation, this product actually makes me feel like I have *screen-worthy* hair! It&#x27;s even been a couple days since I shampooed and finished with this product, and it still feels light, smooth, and silky--but not greasy--today.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair and I have always had a huge problem with frizziness.  For the past year I&#x27;ve been using BB Curl Cream and it&#x27;s great but it leaves my hair a little crunchy and doesn&#x27;t always look good the next day.  This Kukui Oil has been even the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for.  You can use it on wet hair and it helps define curls and reduce frizziness as it dries (I use a hair dryer with a diffuser... Haven&#x27;t tried air drying yet).  But!  The best thing I find with this product is that you can spray it into frizzy hair and it kind if soaks into the hair to reduce frizz and increase shine.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff but would not say that it &amp;#34;hydrates&amp;#34; my hair!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, dry and frizzy....i&#x27;m  east indian living in a tropical climate. I thought this would help my frizz, after reading the reviews...did nothing for it. I even tried using more, but still Nada. Only thing it did was make it a little softer, but only for a short while.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Bought this product at Walmart. It was great to apply after my parched hair was sprayed lightly w/ some water to re-hydrate and then followed w/ a few sprays of the Kukui oil. Instantly my 4B coils were soft and felt hydrated, even after the water dried in my hair it was soft. I liked that the oil didn&#x27;t lay on the hair. I could run my hand over my hair and not see a greasy film. I would give it 5 stars but I&#x27;m still trying it out.</li>
    <li> I have virgin (untreated/uncolored) Caucasian hair that gets wavy when wet and is mostly straight when dry.  When I turned 20, my hair changed texture - individual hairs here and there became frizzy and curly.  No amount of gel, pomade, flat ironing, smooth serums or hydrating conditioners would make these hairs stay down, and my hair always looks frazzled and unkempt even though it was healthy.  I even tried the brand name products (the one with &amp;#34;Frizz&amp;#34; in its name) and they didn&#x27;t do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is also fine and has a tendency to go limp, I was really hesitant to try this product.  I do not have curly ethnic hair like most of the positive reviewers of this product describe themselves as having, so I thought this would likely be too much for my limp fine hair.  I am really glad I bit the bullet and tried it, though, because it has actually worked!  My flyaways and frizzies are 90% gone even after blow drying.  Woo hoo, finally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I noticed:  I am not a fan of the fragrance, which is more perfume-y than fresh.  It does mostly go away once the oil dries.  Also, for me there is a VERY fine line between just enough and too much of this oil!  Using it on damp hair resulted in an oil slick.  Now I do only four sprays when my hair is still wet: one on the left, one on the right, one in the back (my hair is long) and one on my hands which I then run through the hair at my temples (the frizziest hair on my head). Then I comb it through with a wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> IF you have kinky, frizzy hair, you may agree with me that it is a miracle. I moisturize my hair in the shower with conditioner and add leave-in conditioner and heat protection before blow drying. Yet, three finished product is dry and fly away. By spraying my hair with kukui several times over a period of hours and brushing with a natural bristle brush, my hair becomes smooth and silky, almost exactly like the straight hair of many of my friends. I can touch up as needed the next day by touching up bed head with and blow dryer and spraying on more oil. The oil is exceptionally light, so it does not cause a great look. You can also use it to soften your skin after showing.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product. Excellent price.</li>
