<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works okay but does not hold for a long time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for a great price! So simple to use and easy to place in your purse, in your car door or just about anywhere. It is easy to fill with almost any bottle of cologne/perfume.</li>
    <li> Does not leak. Super dependable. Perfect size (tiny, but holds a lot of perfume!)</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I live in a very hot and humid area and even the best perfume just vanishes after an hour so you&#x27;ve got to spray again. Keep in mind though, try your best not to use one for more than one perfume. Other than the fact that the smells combine (even though you can use a refillable bottle filled with water to almost clean the first spray), the smell of the second perfume kind of changes. I guess it has to do with the chemical composition.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these devices I&#x27;ve purchased.  My wife liked the first one so much she took it from me. As advertised, they are very easy to use, highly portable and pack nicely.  The smallish capacity means they are only good for about six days of travel, but at this price you can carry a couple</li>
    <li> I disagree with previous reviewers that have said that the perfume leaks out of the container.  I have had this for about half a year and I have not seen any evaporation.  It is very easy to use and great for travel or taking to work.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very imaginative and comfortable, suitable for dating, improves the smell of sex meetings. It gives a sense of the size, a small bird.</li>
    <li> This little product works as described, it&#x27;s super easy to fill and doesn&#x27;t leak.  Much better than carrying a large expensive bottle of cologne or perfume around.  I&#x27;m a commuter and this fits perfect in my messenger back.  Not much larger than a stick of chapstick.</li>
    <li> It leaks. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN  ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE PERFECT FOR WHAT I DO.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS NATURAL COSMETICS</li>
    <li> This little gadget is pretty cool after all.. i bought it as a what the heck kind of buy... And it&#x27;s really useful... you can carry it almost anywhere and use it really discretely. I recommend..A++++</li>
    <li> I bought one of these.  Easy to fill, and perfect for travel.  Keep mine in my jacket in case I need a little refresher.</li>
    <li> Very easy to fill and convenient. But sometimes it leaks. If you have the ability to keep it in an upright position it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great to carry around in your purse or pocket</li>
    <li> I really like it. Comes in handy.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these.  The are definitely useful for travelling. I took off one star because the clear rubber piece (that you put on top of the cologne nozzle) at the bottom of one travalo  fell off so that travalo is not useful anymore.  It fell off during its first use. I experience no leakage on any of the trips I took these on.</li>
    <li> Super easy. Very convenient.  I used to carry the entire bottle of cologne with me on trips.  I have no idea why I did this.....it&#x27;s the little things in life! haha.</li>
    <li> What more is there to say, I love this thing.  It fits in your pocket, car, wherever you need.  Its just great!</li>
    <li> I love this refillable perfume atomizer.  It is really easy to fill and fits perfectly in my purse.I would buy it again for a present.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product but like so many others, the cologne I put in it evaporates VERY QUICKLY.  I was confused for some time, as there was never any spillage anywhere.  Nothing was wet or sticky and the backpack I kept it in never smelled of it.  But no matter what, my expensive cologne evaporates every time, and it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to do so.  I&#x27;m going to try to find a different product.  So bummed.</li>
    <li> filled for a trip and it leaked onto other travel items so I wouldn&#x27;t use it again, nor would I recommend it. fail</li>
    <li> Worked great on my last trip.  We just took a cruise to the eastern Caribbean and this was the perfect size and the great thing it doesn&#x27;t leak like some of the others I have tried.  One thing to keep in mind is you have to have the little nozzle on your cologne or perfume bottle (on the top of the bottle that you can remove to attach this and fill it.)  Some perfume and cologne bottles won&#x27;t allow you to use this to fill because they don&#x27;t have the standard spray nozzle on the top of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Traveling North to see my girlfriend and god forbid I don&#x27;t have my cologne. Saved me from being able to carry my nice cologne with me and not have to purchase more in a smaller bottle. Works great, very easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times for traveling. I never had trouble filling it, but it won&#x27;t stay filled. On the last trip, from which I just returned, it leaked completely out on my first flight. The good side was all my stuff smells great, including my suitcase. Bad news: this product is a fail. I&#x27;ll replace with something better. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> This is a great design and it was great for a month. I used it daily and kept with me during the entire day when the cologne would wear off. The fill up design is really easy and no mess or leaks experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem I had with this item is the quality appears to be lacking. A little over a month of use it is coming apart in the middle. (See photo attached). This causes the cologne to leak out a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a great concept. It&#x27;s a snap to fill with a nice little window to show you how full it is. However...I filled it only slightly full to see if it leaked and threw it in my purse. It didn&#x27;t seem to leak out, but somehow over the next month or so, the liquid started to go away and I could smell the perfume. I would say use it for short term use, like a week vacation, but don&#x27;t plan on using it for carrying around long term.</li>
    <li> This item comes without the original package, and there is no &amp;#34;Trevalo&amp;#34; label on a bottle. So, it is not good.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service from Perfume and More and great little product. It does just what it says it does!</li>
    <li> Loads cleanly, has a good spray. Definitely keep it in a plastic bag during travel, as pressure changes do cause very slight leaks.</li>
    <li> This perfume dispenser really works without liking all over..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to keep some perfume in your car.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just perfect for my use!</li>
    <li> The perfume drips out of it</li>
    <li> I picked this up as a way to have a small amount of cologne available for travel. I got sick of buying and traveling with an extra bottle for that purpose. This is cost-effective and easy. I love it. No spills.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was that the box was very banged up and there were no instructions. Go back to the product page for directions on how to fill it.  Also, it leaks.  It&#x27;s not bad, but the seal at the top is not what it should be.  Expect for a little to get on your hands when you remove the cap.  All in all, I probably would not buy it again.  Pay a little extra and get a better model.</li>
    <li> This is seriously one of the most mundane yet useful things I have ever purchased. I always carry perfume but hated carrying heavy bottles. This is a perfect way to carry small sprays of perfume without having to carry the heavy packaging/bottle. It&#x27;s also very discrete and can be carried in any size bag. The only downside is that if you have a modified/artsy perfume bottle where there is no spray-top, you cannot mine perfume from it. This device requires an open spray top only. But that&#x27;s a small pricey to pay for such a useful device. I recommend this product and seller to everyone!</li>
    <li> This product did not work. I wanted to take my favorite perfume with me on vacation so I ordered this. I read the instruction and did as it said. After pumping and pumping AND PUMPING there was a very small amount inside. By next morning all perfume inside this mini spray bottle was gone. Either it spilled out or it evaporated- either way was not good.</li>
    <li> travel necessity. safely and easily stores perfumes with no leaks! great quality. so easy to feel. love the window on the side. having perfume on hand is definitely a luxury so if it&#x27;s too much of a hassle i can deal without. this that added luxury completely effortless.</li>
    <li> My Travalo was great for the first three weeks, and then it spontaneously started to leak (I hadn&#x27;t refilled it either).</li>
    <li> I travel pretty frequently for work and hated buying small colognes because they are pricey and not offered in all scents, so I bought this little guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Easy to fill up. Simply take the nozzle of your perfume/cologne and put this on top then pump it up.&lt;br /&gt;2) Looks good and is small&lt;br /&gt;3) Quality - No leaks so far and I&#x27;ve had it filled up for many months now&lt;br /&gt;4) Price - it is cheap and has saved me the purchase price from buying tiny bottles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any cons yet, but since it is made out of plastic, I&#x27;m sure if you keep it in your purse and let it bang around it would probably break and leak over time</li>
    <li> Small but just right for the purse or car.  Easy to fill but you must pump perfume bottle while filing.  It lasts a decent time.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great, love it, will buy another!!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a Christmas gift.  Have never personally used it.  But the recipient seems to enjoy it well enough.Gif</li>
    <li> Works great! Excelent item tu carry in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> the perfume dosent last because it evaporates very quick and when you refiell it, this thing drops like 80% of the product</li>
    <li> I bough this item thinking it was the original authentic item like the boxes are pictured here.&lt;br /&gt;Also paid the legit price to assure I was getting legit item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I recieved the item box did not have any branding on it whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap barcode with the item name on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give it a try and of course mi assumption was correct.&lt;br /&gt;Item does not work whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY. FAKE ITEM SENT.</li>
    <li> I love these!  I may have to buy a few more.  I have a suuuuuuper large bottle of Chanel Eau Premiere and cannot travel with it (it&#x27;s like 5 ounces, seriously), but with this I can take just enough with me everywhere I go.  It is ridiculously easy to fill, just pop the top of the sprayer off your bottle and press it against the bottom of the Travalo.  It never spills and the perfume does not evaporate.  Looks pretty, too.  A new fave.</li>
    <li> I really like how it is small and I can just put it in any bag. I&#x27;ve read the reviews and some people have problems with it leaking. I have not experienced any leaking.</li>
    <li> You are the best always</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these perfume atomizers.  They sell for $12 at outlets so these were a great deal. I fill them with my favorite perfumes and they are small enough to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> Works very well. This product does what it is supposed to do, and is nice.</li>
    <li> Absolute Junk. Broke after trying to use it for the first time.</li>
    <li> use this daily... not that i smell bad or anything :/</li>
    <li> Worked great. Prevented me from wasting a nice cologne.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one of these bottles at a perfume store. I purchase one for me and one for my friend.  We loved them.  I hate carrying&lt;br /&gt;large perfume bottles when I am traveling, so I purchased more so that I can wear different fragrances each day if I so choose.  Filling it&lt;br /&gt;is sooooo easy!  The best!</li>
    <li> leaks and some did not work</li>
    <li> While the actual product may be good (I do not know, I suspect I got a knock off) do not buy discounted one from RJCE Trading Co. The product arrived in cardboard boax (no retail packaging) and as far as I can tell is not made by Travelo. The top was disconnected and when I tried to reattach, the entire middle portion disconnected. This is unusable and I will return and try to find a real Travelo.</li>
    <li> I just cant fill with my perfumes, i don&#x27;t know if is that i&#x27;m not doing it in a correct way.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to fill. Really wish I had found this sooner. I travel a lot and it is perfect!!</li>
    <li> so cute. i am so happy i found these little things. i have alot of different perfumes and wanted to carry the fragrance of whatever i was wearing in my purse. i ordered 4 of them. it is very EASY to put your perfume in it. :)</li>
    <li> So I have about 30 different perfumes, given as Christmas gifts over the years and leftover from my stint at Bath and Body Works. However, I never wear them as I can never seem to get to them in the morning. Buying this was the solution I wish I had known about years ago. I haven&#x27;t noticed any leaking, and it&#x27;s easy to fill this up with both cheap spray perfumes and expensive Macy&#x27;s perfumes. It makes it easier to spray on perfume at a moment&#x27;s notice, and it&#x27;s so light I never even notice it in my purse. I&#x27;m giving one to all my female friends this Christmas!</li>
    <li> Faulty product. Constantly leaks.</li>
    <li> they are hard to fill, they leaks during the filling process and after they being filled, they leaks until they become empty.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my hubby, and it worked great.  No leaks, easy to pack, and makes him happy, enough said.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t overthink this one. These are really handy - got one for my wife as well. Easy to fill, and easy to use. I&#x27;ve been traveling with mine for a few years, so they are also durable.  The only minor nick I have is that due to its small size, the limited air volume and short pump stroke requires some practice to control how much you spray.</li>
    <li> This was not what I thought it would be!  They have to be filled from another spray bottle.  I had hoped they could be filled from any bottle of cologne or perfume.</li>
    <li> Perfect product easy to travel with leave in car or on vacation without lugging the big bottle around..and so so easy to use.....</li>
    <li> I only gave this refillable spray bottle 3 stars because when you spray, it leaks so you are wasting perfume.</li>
    <li> I have lost more money in expensive cologne than this poor can be worth. It leaks in an amazing short time.  I had high hopes that his would solve my problem for a complete shave kit.  Very disappointed.  Can&#x27;t fill with anyhing other than pump fill, won&#x27;t work with quality.</li>
    <li> Durable and Ideal for what it is designed for.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these. One for my daughter and two for me. I started using them immediately on my business trips. They work great. Highly recommend for those that travel and want to bring along some cologne.</li>
    <li> When I started using it, it was fine but now after two months it started to leak!</li>
    <li> Easy to fill, easier to wedge into an airline travel bag, and it didn&#x27;t leak. You need to have a pump spray perfume/cologne or body spray bottle to fill, but filling the reservoir is easy. I didn&#x27;t have any leak issues. Just take your time when filling and remember not to overfill, and this product works very well.</li>
    <li> Great little thing, does exactly what it was supposed to do. I have refilled it twice since I got it and I haven&#x27;t had any leak issues as others reported, hopefully it stays that way :-)</li>
    <li> Mine leaked and I found that very disappointing.</li>
    <li> good product for a gift.  arrived as expected. thanks!</li>
    <li> My son loves this. It is great for when he is traveling</li>
    <li> This is a quality pump action sprayer, extremely easy to load with your perfume or cologne of your choice.  The cheaper &amp;#34;knock-offs&amp;#34; are just that, cheap knockoffs that will leak and break, leaving your purse or backpack a lovely scented mess!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 Travalo bottles, one in black and one in silver. I filled them with 2 of my favorite perfumes and threw them in with my liquid/gel bag for my overseas vacation. Sadly, by the time the 7-day trip was over, both of them had leaked completely, with the leak source being from the top part under the lid. They were fine when sitting upright, but the product claims to be great for travel and leak-proof. My friend who recommended this product to me has never had this issue--maybe I just got 2 defective products? I would be willing to buy this product again in case it was a fluke, but my experience thus far has not been positive.</li>
    <li> This is the actual Travalo brand, not a knock-off. The only downside is that it was not black it was pink. Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> -I got a different one than the picture.&lt;br /&gt;-Absolutely terrible quality.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t work all cologne bottles.&lt;br /&gt;-Crazy leaks.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T GET THIS THING!!</li>
    <li> This works just as advertised and I have been traveling for work with it for about 2 months.  I haven&#x27;t had any leaks or problems with it.</li>
    <li> Small enough to satisfy the TSA - Thousand Standing Around, and large enough to hold a few days worth of spray. That&#x27;s a subjective statement, because if you spray constantly, like your trying to hide the fact you haven&#x27;t showered for a few days, this may not last for you. But for normal use, I can go a week between refills. Refills by the way are very easy. Just take the atomizer off you perfume or cologne bottle, insert it into the bottom of this Travalo, and pump a few times to fill up. Kind of like refilling a lighter with butane. But for God&#x27;s sake, make sure you are not using Butane. In fact, I&#x27;m surprised there is not a warning against using Butane. You know, there are lawyers out there just waiting to take on that case. I can see the late night ads now...&amp;#34;Have you been injured in a car wreck, slipped in a store aisle, pumped Butane in your Travalo?&amp;#34; Anyway, works good for cologne or perfume, just don&#x27;t try to light your cigarette with it.</li>
    <li> Super cute and easy to use. Pricy though. Also hope to have more cute colors.</li>
    <li> this is the most perfectly designed product I have ever bought.  Really.  BMA</li>
    <li> These work as advertised, but it seems that my cologne has evaporated quickly. I would recommend not filling these up unless you know you&#x27;ll use all the contents on a trip.</li>
    <li> The Travalo that I purchased as worked very well so far! I have had it filled with some of my cologne for a month now and has not leaked. It was extremely easy to fill and also kind of fun, heh. I have yet to travel with it on a plane, but will be in a month from now and will update my review!</li>
    <li> We couldn&#x27;t get the bottle to fill without excessive spraying and wasteful loss of cologne.  It was very messy.  We thought we had received a defective unit, but the second unit wouldn&#x27;t fill properly, either.  Very nice presentation, but didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I dropped a bottle of very expensive perfume and bent the spray nozzle (which could not be detached from the bottle).  In an effort to save $150 worth of perfume, I purchased this product with high hopes.  The refillable travel sprayer works great and despite what other reviewers have said does not leak.  And now I am able to carry my perfume with me in my purse, an added bonus.  So in short the product does what it claims and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> A travel must for anyone that has had to deal with not wanting to carry clunky perfume or cologne bottles. I actually bought this for a trip and have ended up keeping this in my purse because it&#x27;s such a convenient size and so easy to refill. It does NOT leak. It&#x27;s easy to fill. Every time that I pull it out to use it someone ask what it is and where did I get it, and I have ended up purchasing more for Christmas stocking stuffers. Great product.</li>
    <li> fantastic product.  it&#x27;s small, refillable, and doesn&#x27;t leak</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on YouTube. Everybody was gushing about it so I decided to give it a try. What ian amazing and innovative product.  It&#x27;s the perfect size and last a long time. Would definitely order again and probably will.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these travel size atomizers and was so excited to use them. The first one I filled and it leaked through the top slowly after being filled all over my bathroom counter(this was standing upright too). The second one lasted for a while, but on its second airplane trip, it also began to leak and by the end of the three day trip had leaked in my makeup bag. I tried refilling it after cleaning it up and checking for any possible leak points. I also don&#x27;t know if mine are defaults, but my friend&#x27;s has never leaked.... was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> great product. Have bought several</li>
    <li> I was dubious, figured it&#x27;d be a big mess.  Works great, super easy to get the cologne in the tiny bottle, and I&#x27;ve been carrying it around with me in my luggage for months now.  Just to be safe, I do keep it in a small plastic bag.  But no leaking so far.</li>
    <li> This really is a great travel piece.  Very easy to refill from a cologne bottle without spilling.  I&#x27;m a little worried the fill window (handy for knowing level) creates a vulnerability but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Needed a solution to use for constant air travel for work. This is garbage, it leaked upon initial fill. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.&lt;br /&gt;I filed for a return but as I&#x27;ve already loaded it with cologne (that&#x27;s worth more than this piece of @#$%) the refund is essentially worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* 3/14/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Travalo directly who apologized for the unfortunate product experience and followed up immediately by sending me a replacement spray AND included a gift box of several cologne samples and a leather business card holder. All this done without any proof of purchase from Travalo directly.</li>
    <li> Which Genius invented this!!!! I love this Product! No more messy refills, no more wasting time getting it right! I was able to fill it in a matter of seconds! I am going to buy a few more for my Summer Vacation and now I don&#x27;t have to choose which of my favorite perfumes to bring on my trip, now I can just bring them ALL!!!</li>
    <li> This thing works great once you get the cologne in the bottle. It does leak a little from the sprayer. Always keep in ziplock when traveling.</li>
    <li> Use it for travelling. Great for emergency when you want to spray your favorite perfume when you on the go.</li>
    <li> So far so good, NO LEAKS and does what its designed to do....the only problem is How would u clean this thing?  Any suggestions because its atomizer only.</li>
    <li> This is a great gadget. Not having to travel with a huge bottle of lotion is ideal and best of all, there is no waste or spillage.</li>
    <li> Horrible...leaked slowly....complete water of money not only on the item itself but the loss of expensive cologne.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, the only problem I found is the instructions how to load with the perfume, i had to find it by myself using youtube/google</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  I LOVE the size, it is the perfect size to travel around with and you can put it in your purse, travel bag, or make up bag.  However, when I go to put my perfume in the bottle it leaks and doesn&#x27;t all go into the travalo... :( I wish this wasn&#x27;t the case because I really like the idea and size of this product... but I don&#x27;t want to waste my expensive perfume by having half of it leak out while filling it up.  The perfume DOES stay in the bottle once I am done filling it up, but it is still an issue.</li>
    <li> Easy to carry. Just one problem, it can only suck a little amount of perfume by one press. So I have to press a lot to get the bottle full.</li>
    <li> easy to refill, don&#x27;t leak and works great.</li>
    <li> This thing work great. No leaking and easy to use. No complain with this product and great design. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Leaked. Leaked over a period of days and leaked over a flight.</li>
    <li> Small, compact and easy to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a couple of these...&lt;br /&gt;Really luck on the draw in terms of quality.&lt;br /&gt;Used when I need quick fixes when I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it would leak and the bottle would empty itself in my pouch.&lt;br /&gt;Got Flo Refillable Perfume Atomizer instead and it works so much better, except it is a little big for my taste.</li>
    <li> If you travel and want your cologne or perfume, this is the ticket. I&#x27;ve purchased 2-3, and they keep getting taken by friends.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered another. They are very easy to fill and the meet all the TSA &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; requirements. Buy 2, your spouse or other will &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; it and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Excellent for taking perfume or cologne on a trip. Don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> This thing is great for traveling.  You can bring your cologne without worrying about getting it through the checks.</li>
    <li> My husband appreciate immense.</li>
    <li> Really worked out a little smaller than the regular size</li>
    <li> As a male its impossible for me to hold a perfume bottle with me at all times, this is the easiest, smallest product to hold with you at all times.  Does not leak, does not need any brains on how to operate.  I bought 2 more after my wife saw it.  Recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> These are so awesome to take when traveling or in a purse. They fill so easy with your perfume. or cologne spray.  Hubby is a pilot &amp; fill/uses his all the time.  Only thing is you have to use the same perfume...not sure if you could ever clean it for another smell.</li>
    <li> i first ordered one of this. it filled and worked like a charm. then got two more. one of them didn&#x27;t fill up. the perfume just bubbled over the top. i thought it was a freak defective piece. okay, so i used the other two and loved them. then they needed to be refilled and the same problem - they just wouldn&#x27;t fill up and bubbled all over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/3. something&#x27;s wrong with the way this thing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i finally got the one with the built-in funnel at one end.</li>
    <li> I had already ordered one of these (from Sold by: CLASSICAL FITNESS &amp; HEALTH), came in box, worked nicely (5 stars), labeled Travalo on it, etc, and decided to order another.  This time it came (from Sold by: LOW POKE) without box, without labeling in a cheap plastic wrap.  Without opening the wrap I could see the top was very loose and it was obvious that this time I received a knockoff.  I didn&#x27;t even open the plastic wrap because I knew immediately it was going back.  Be careful to get the original.  I suspect those that have leaked have received knockoffs.  I contacted seller to return this item and will re-order only when I know I&#x27;m getting an original.  I found another seller (Sold by: Luxie Lush Inc.) that says they ship only originals so placed the order today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:  LOW POKE responded:  \\&quot;Hi, Im sorry for this misunderstanding. All of our products are 100% authentic. Thanks for bringing this concern to my attention. I will investigate this matter further. regarding your purchase, I have just refunded you for this order.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I am awaiting instructions from LOW POKE on returning the unopened item.  Changed rating to 3 stars as there appears to be a knockoff and genuine out there so averaging the two--no other way to do it.</li>
    <li> Small, portable way to travel with your perfume - or any aerosol for that matter. Allows you to travel light - plus keep below TSA limits.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to use.  This is perfect for those trips in which you don&#x27;t want to check in luggage.</li>
    <li> I just bought this item and after filling it, it began to leak.  To the seller&#x27;s credit, he offered to replace or refund the item.  However, due to the relatively small cost for the item, it does not make sense to return it.  I will just buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> works great and am constantly refilling it. holds about 25 pumps which is quite impressive for its size. I think these will be great gifts.</li>
    <li> It is really good! Easy to carry and easy to refill, doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> My mom doesnt usually travel but i gave this to her anyway. two years later, she took it with her on a trip. yay! and she loved it &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a mini bottle spray and found this brand when I was on a Princess Cruises cruise and they sell it for $17 onboard! I looked for it on Amazon as soon as I got back from my trip because I know it&#x27;ll be cheaper. I got 2 for $10 each, one for me and for my friend. It was great until the rubber at the bottom came off. I can still put it back but it won&#x27;t stay, so it&#x27;s hard to refill the bottle. My friend told me hers started leaking too but hers leaks from the top part. I really like this and hope that I only got defective items.</li>
    <li> These are functional and easy to use and fill.  Has a good form factor; easy to fit rectally if you are going into a prison type situation.</li>
    <li> The first time I filled this item it all leaked out on my dresser (damaging the wood).  This is a wonderful idea, unfortunately this product is useless.  Unfortunately I had to throw this away because it was such a mess, or I would have returned it in hopes for a refund.  Save your money and buy travel size cologne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, but I travel a lot and saw this in the American Airlines Magazine and thought it would be a cool way to take my cologne with me.  It fills super easy and is easy to use and seems to last a while, but I just got it so I&#x27;ll have to get back to you on that one.  Overall, it&#x27;s pretty cool.  I&#x27;m guessing women would love it for their purse.  It&#x27;s also great for douche bag guys who always where cologne and need a little lift for the evening.  :-)</li>
    <li> This is definitely not original Travalo product. Made from plastic but not from aluminium. Just compare it with pictures from Travalo web site.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this because of all the hype it got. I filled it up and kept it in my car. A couple days later, I went to use it and there was nothing it it! (I hadn&#x27;t even used it yet). I figured it evaporated or something due to the heat in my car. So I filled it up again and put it in my purse. Once again, after a couple days I was to spray some. Nothing was in it! Keeps leaking and I don&#x27;t get any use out of it. What a waste of perfume! :( Even though it is a great idea, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this spray bottle to carry with me at work and it performed well.  No leaks, and its pretty simple to fill up.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and refill and does not change the smell of the fragrance also its small and suite for handbags..</li>
    <li> It leaked!! From the first day I tried it, it leake too much. I refilled twice but I disappointed. I will try another one</li>
    <li> Compact, easy to fill, durable, the perfect thing for a lady on the go. I bought several in different colors to go with my various scents, and it is perfect for everyday use in your purse or in your carryon for travel.</li>
    <li> Leaked all out within 2 months!</li>
    <li> I used this for about 7 months of heavy travel and loved it...then it stopped working.</li>
    <li> Really amazing idea and product, easy to carry and to use as instructed. for sure value for money. the only thing that you  should refill it with water to clean it if you wish to switch to different perfume.</li>
    <li> Lousy product.  It leaked all over my carry-on bag on the airplane.  For months, my carry-on smelled great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this device for over a year and just really appreciate it. It&#x27;s great to buy my fragrance In large reduced quantities and refill it every month. for on the go, at the gym, traveling and even after a smoke at work.</li>
    <li> the travalo wasn&#x27;t in its original packaging on delivery, and its refill nozzle can&#x27;t fit on all perfume tubes. Learned that the hard way. Good concept, but would i repurchase? probably not.</li>
    <li> Easy, inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for. The filling action was easy and did not require any pouring like others do--simply insert regular size perfume without lid into the bottom and press like normal to fill. Did not experience issues with leaking as others have mentioned.</li>
    <li> can only be used once, I bought two, one worked once the other never worked.&lt;br /&gt;you should not spend on this product is not good quality.</li>
    <li> If you want yo bring your favorite cologne or perfume with you in your carry-on luggage you should get this. It is easy to fill and spill-proof.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. Fill this up and overtime it will leak out all of the perfume into the atmosphere and your bag.</li>
    <li> Works and no problem filling or leaks. I keep mine in a pocket with cologne for use anytime anywhere</li>
    <li> Never managed to get it to woork properly, always wasted more perfume than I managed to get in.</li>
    <li> I love it.This bottle works exactly as advertised,with this I have something travel size and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Got this to put my dior pure poison in and am very happy with my purchase.  A lot of people complain about travalos leaking but mine does not leak.  The black gets dirty and fingerprints easy though and I&#x27;m always cleaning it off... Otherwise I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and love it.</li>
    <li> I chose this product b/c I hate packing bottles of cologne!&lt;br /&gt;This allows one to take just enough with you (and plenty to last a few weeks even) in a tiny portable unit in your toiletry bag, center console of car, or even your pocket!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> The atomizer is pretty decent and the container holds a pretty good amount of juice. It has a nice metal encasement and is a nice small size for travel. It&#x27;s perfect for throwing in the backpack and reapplying on those longer work days.</li>
    <li> when you dont want to bring your bottles this is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a small and versatile bottle which can be taken anywhere you please. I can finally take my favorite cologne with me to work.</li>
    <li> These are exactly the same as the one purchased at a department store for $19.00.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to fill and the spray is great, a fine mist, not heavy.</li>
    <li> Make sure to align the tube with the hole otherwise it will be a mess.</li>
    <li> i bought this item and used it daily for maybe a week and it broke -- it stopped spraying.  I contacted the seller, asking for an exchange, but was told that, they would not exchange it and that they only refunded money if the item was unopened.  It is not a big deal -- the bottle is inexpensive, but the quality is very poor, i would definitely look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I always wanted something like this for my  purse without buying another small perfume.. Just as advertised; works like a champ! Arrived quickly and intact.</li>
    <li> i usually never travel without this...&lt;br /&gt;Only thing to note is that it can be difficult to switch perfume brands/type as the old perfume&#x27;s smell will stick there for a while even after multiple washing sessions (water/soap/alcohol...etc).</li>
    <li> Awesome! Works perfectly and is super easy to fill.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for traveling when you don&#x27;t want to carry a big bottle of perfume! Even when I come back from my trip, I keep my Travalo in my purse for a quick spray whenever I&#x27;m on the go! Would definitely recommend and buy again!!</li>
    <li> These were perfect for traveling, and I like using them at home too.</li>
    <li> So easy to use and holds a generous amount for traveling!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Much more easier to carry rather than a huge perfume bottle. It&#x27;s also very easy and clean to pump in the perfume. Would recommend to friend. Thank you. Shipping was asap.</li>
    <li> Useful for travel and to throw into your makeup bag for perfume applications during the day. It doesn&#x27;t leak like other travel perfume bottles I&#x27;ve tried and the mist that sprays out is perfect.</li>
    <li> I like the built and quality of this product. There is no leaking and very easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;The size is good enough to last more than a week</li>
    <li> The price on these can&#x27;t be beat.  Packaged well and just like the one&#x27;s you would buy in the store only cheaper.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I am very happy with the purchase and the price is pretty good. Easy to load and easy to carry, very practical and elegant.</li>
    <li> Awful. Didn&#x27;t work at all. Didn&#x27;t fill, leaked everywhere despite following directions</li>
    <li> LOVE these and they&#x27;ve made great gifts too</li>
    <li> This eliminates the need to carry an entire bottle of cologne. If you take several of this it will lighten your load and take up less space.</li>
    <li> I used this for 2-3 months 2-3 times a week at the gym. When it did work cologne evaporated so quickly that it was expensive to use. The valve at the bottom stopped working after a only using it a couple of dozen times at the gym. Great idea. Piss-poor product.</li>
