    <li> I only gave this 2 stars based on the sprayer not working after 2 weeks, causing me to throw it away. The scent probably would have rated 4 stars, if the sprayer performed.</li>

    <li> I really like the look of this and the bottle is very stylish. The scent itself is pretty good- not my favorite but a really good cologne for the summer. Not so much the winter- it kind of gives me a headache if i&#x27;m at school all day and it doesn&#x27;t really feel right. Very fresh smelling with a citrus feel and sometimes i noticed hints of flowers. A nice change from most that i own, but definitely best fit for the summer time.</li>
