      <li>It&#x27;s also a pretty big bottle and it looks very decrotive.</li>

      <li>She is six years old.</li>
      <li>but my little girl absolutely loves it!  </li>

<li> and I do not have a daughter, but I needed a change from all the other perfumes</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other Disney Princess fragrances.</li>

<li> She puts it on everyday and plays dress up.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I had the same issue as another reviewer.</li>
<li> my baby hated it, i think thats y she broke the bottle.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Ok, I may be a 32 y/o woman and I do not have a daughter, but I needed a change from all the other perfumes so I decided to try it....LOVE IT! It is very pretty, kinda crispy but soft and has a slight watermelon bubblegum after smell that sent my mood soaring like Jacques and Gus when the Fairy Godmother gave her magical wand a twirl and turned them in to horses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you do need to reapply this fragrance after a few hours it&#x27;s perfectly fine with me.

    <li> The scent is light and pleasant. The glass is sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what parents want to know about this and that&#x27;s all there really is to know. LOL&lt;br /&gt;My daughter LOVES it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and my girlfriend wears it often. It smells kind of fruity but it is not overpowering. Great packaging and container. Looks great.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my 4-year-old, so it&#x27;s more about presentation than the actual smell. Unfortunately, I had the same issue as another reviewer. The bottle looks nothing like the picture: very plain and more grown-up. Please update your picture, Amazon!</li>

    <li> We got this for our daughter on Valentine&#x27;s Day. She was very excited and felt it was a very &amp;#34;big girl&amp;#34; thing to get. The perfume itself is pretty good, not over whelming and gentle enough. It&#x27;s also a pretty big bottle and it looks very decrotive.</li>
    <li> my daughter &amp; I love this perfume. It is soft enough for a young girl and not strong at all. I totally recommend it</li>
    <li> My daughter was so so happy Santa left this in her stocking!  She even has to wear to school and anywhere we go!  Too cute!</li>
    <li> The little girl I sent this perfume to was so excited it was tremendous.  She puts it on everyday and plays dress up.  Just a great item.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas who loves Cinderella.  I really didn&#x27;t expect much other than a pretty bottle, which it is.  However, it actually smells pretty good!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 3-year old niece who loved it!</li>
    <li> 3 yr old daughter loved this for a Christmas present. Not too strong of a smell, just perfect for a little girl.</li>
    <li> The bottle of perfume looks absolutely NOTHING like this cute pink bottle with the crown topper. Neither does the box it came in for that matter. The box we received it blue, no picture of Cinderella on it. The bottle is clear with a very plain clear top. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> nice my daugther love it</li>
