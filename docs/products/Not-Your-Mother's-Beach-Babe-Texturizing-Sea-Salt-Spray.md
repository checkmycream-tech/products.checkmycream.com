<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair-something between 2b and 2c. I love this product, it gives my hair the extra oomph it needs so it actually looks curly/wavy and not like it&#x27;s stuck in purgatory. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because there&#x27;s some tricks to the application. I don&#x27;t suggest putting it in dry hair because it makes your hair kind of gunky and sticky, but if you put in damp hair it prevents that from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is ok, like coconut vanilla and something that reminds me of sunscreen? It fades by the time I wake up (I do my hair at night) which is what I prefer because I like putting solid perfume in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways,&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use it: after my shower I let my hair air dry until it&#x27;s about 80% dry, then I apply mousse all through my hair, and then I immediately follow up with this. I shake up the bottle really well (gotta mix it) and I&#x27;ll flip all my hair to one side and spray it liberally (I have long thirsty hair) then scrunch scrunch scrunch and repeat it on the other side and again with my hair flipped over my head. I leave my hair alone until it dries some more, and usually do a second round of this scrunching. I think that it takes a bit of product to make it work the way I want it to, which is another reason why it gets 4 stars but whateves it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and it might just be because my hair is dry. I like to finish my routine with a nice softening cream, as mousse and sea salt can make it a little stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> makes my hair really dark looking</li>
    <li> Cap fell off upon arrival</li>
    <li> Gives great beach hair,  and smells great.  Warning,  it does dry your hair.  Use a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Used only a couple times, too sticky and smelly</li>
    <li> Product works very good, does give you nice beach waves hairstyle. Bad bottle sprayer design. Doesn&#x27;t spray out good, no cap, and it leaks a little bit. Its cheap and does work.</li>
    <li> I use this product when I want the hair &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; to go down&lt;br /&gt;Hair spray is a similar product I used but I have sensitive skin so I tend to stray from hair spray products&lt;br /&gt;I like that it smells nice and that you can get a natural wave to hair or up do as a result. It leaves the hair feeling strawl like when styled down, but overall works wells. The product works well.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist with normally wavy, thick and dry hair. Many times, my hair is just a frizzy poofy nest that I throw into a messy bun on top of my head. There are occasional days where I let my hair air dry OUTSIDE without brushing it and it dries with a beautiful wave that isn&#x27;t crazy or frizzy, but that is a rarity. I get great beach hair, but every other day of the year, it&#x27;s just a mess. No more! All I have to do now is shower, spray this product in my hair and use a little of their Beach Babe balm to go with it and ta-da! Perfect beach hair! This product definitely works and you will see the best results if your hair is somewhat wavy or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, there is a catch. If you look at the ingredients, you&#x27;ll see that the first two are water and salt. That&#x27;s why it gives us beach hair! It&#x27;s literally salt water with some fragrances and chemicals added in. Salt water is very well known for drying hair immensely (the more porous the hair, the curlier it gets), hence how it works so well. So if you decide to use this great product, please be sure to use it sparingly, get regular trims, and do regular deep-conditioning to make sure your hair doesn&#x27;t become brittle over time.</li>
    <li> I have had other sea salt sprays in my hair and HATED the way they made my hair feel.  This has a nice smell, really does give you the nice added texture like you just left the beach.  My hair is still soft too!  That to me is the most important feature.  I do not like my hair feeling like there is product in it.  I will make sure to never run out, it makes the morning session easier.  I have wavy hair, not nice wavy hair frizzy wavy hair.  When I use this, it&#x27;s nice!  No more NEEDING to straighten my hair everyday and having all the heat damage.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite beach/sea salt spray. It gives amazing texture for those perfect beach waves without making your hair feel crunchy or sticky or even greasy. It even smells AMAZING, like coconut paradise! I have short/medium length hair, and I spritz a little after a shower, air or blow dry, and use a curling wand lightly all over, then spritz again and it comes out super cute. Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for the perfect beach spray!</li>
    <li> This is literally the worst hair product I have ever used. I was really excited about it, and even more so after I smelled it. It smells like the beach in a bottle. Kind of like coconut. However, my beach babe dreams were crushed once I sprayed it in my hair. It did nothing except make my hair sticky, dry, and completely tangled. I tried it every possible way I could imagine- on wet hair, on dry hair, with braids, using a blow dryer, etc. It was very sad. I do not recommend this, at least not if you have long straight hair like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, walmart has this product for 3.95 regular price and I&#x27;m glad I got it there and not here because I was able to return it.</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy/curly hair with lots of volume - if I just leave it to its own devices, there is just no telling how it will look once it dries. I try lots of different products in an attempt to control it, and I am really happy with how this makes my hair look, feel and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it doesn&#x27;t smell very beachy, but it does smell *delightful* (vanilla-ish). I think that&#x27;s the only thing keeping me from giving this five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does not make my hair crunchy, sticky, or dirty-feeling! A great change from tons of other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it really helped tame the natural volume of my hair and help my curlwaves relax into a normal structure. Cutting out volume is a huge plus for me - I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had that experience, and I have no idea if it would weigh down fine hair. But it was a great perk for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I have pin straight hair and it works well on my hair when it&#x27;s wet, once it dries I loose alot of the volume though but still have more than regular. My favorite thing is the smell! It smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product creates waves as promised and as an added bonus smells wonderful. My hair is neither curly or straight but this product made it extremely easy to have a quick summery hairstyle!</li>
    <li> First time using a texturing spray....... so far I like it... just need to experiment a bit!!!! love the scent!  I have thick wavy-ish hair naturally.</li>
    <li> This product performs as it says it will, and is super easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any sticky residue or leave your hair difficult to comb/brush.  My only issue is the price.  I recently found out that this is available in Target stores for $4.25, so needless to say, it&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll be shopping for this from now on.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my daughter, who has almost straight hair. She really wanted to try some waves, but I don&#x27;t want her to get in the habit of using heat styling tools. I purchased it at the big store where all the employees wear blue shirts (wink wink), &amp; I am glad I did. The price here is ridiculous. I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about it leaving hair oily. Those reviewers must have used much too much. The same for those who complain about their hair feeling really crunchy. I used it last night on my hair. It was freshly washed and air dried. I flipped my head over, sprayed from several inches away, and made sure I hit every area. The point isn&#x27;t to spray closely and coat the hair. Think of it as a lighter version of Aussie Sprunch Spray. I got really nice volume, without looking like a backup singer for the B-52s, and my wavy hair looks like I have careless curls without frizz. It&#x27;s not sticky, oily or crunchy at all. My daughter has waves and volume that is gorgeous. The scent is coconut, with a fresh sea feel to it...very slight vanilla. This fades to a clean scent. I am very particular and scent-sitive, and I have no problems. My daughter and I both receive numerous compliments on our very different hair types.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not the greatest beach spray I&#x27;ve used. It makes my hair somewhat static-y if my hair gets fluffed up. But maybe that&#x27;s just my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the price is high.  I found it at other store here in town that were almost $3.00 cheeper.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a store on sale for 4 bucks. I have fine hair half wavy half straight that usually sticks to my head, not a very flattering look. I washed my hair and sprayed this into damp/wet hair and let my hair air dry. My hair had so much wave and volume I was shocked. Plus the next day after using this I straightened my hair and it kept the bouncy volume. Worth a try, plus it was way cheaper than the one my hairdresser wanted me to buy. Would purchase again. Just not from amazon.</li>
    <li> Somebody recommended this to me for adding volume to my short hair, and it&#x27;s AMAZING. I spray it generously on my hair, dry or wet, and I run it through and soon enough, it&#x27;s got a lot of volume. It&#x27;s done the same for my roommate who also has short hair, giving it a lot of bounce and making it very soft, too. I don&#x27;t know the contexts of the negative reviews, but it works great on short hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to make my hair wavy but it did nothing to my hair. It barely has a smell; I guess I expected it to help hold the waves or make some beach waves but nothing.</li>
    <li> I like using this when I wear my hair curly, just shower spray and I&#x27;m ready to go. I also use it after a workout, smells good!</li>
    <li> Amazing Beachy Hair !!!!</li>
    <li> leaves an amazing smell but does not do the trick for my fine, greasy hair. Weighs it down and did not keep the volume for more than around 15 minutes. Tried to spray my hair and leave it overnight and it left my hair kind of weighed down instead, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product (I have fine, wavy hair) and this gives me much needed volume and that messy look. I use to buy the Bumble &amp; Bumble product (which is pretty amazing) however, given the BB price point I ventured out to find a cheaper alternative. This product hit the sweet spot for me. Works just as well, doesn&#x27;t smell as great, but for the price I was willing to overlook that. That said ... Ulta sells this product for $5.99 AND usually runs a promotion where if you buy one you get the second one for 50% off ... meaning, if you bought 2 you would be paying $4.50 for each. So yes, this is a great product, and yes, it&#x27;s much cheaper than Bumble &amp; Bumble, but really, unless you don&#x27;t have an Ulta nearby or are unable to shop Ulta online, then by all means pay more for it here.</li>
    <li> my absolute favorite hair product and it&#x27;s a part of my everyday routine. it makes your hair have volume but also makes it feel so light and airy. If you have thinner hair and want some texture, I reccomend!!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair that I can hardly ever get any body to it. This spray has made a world of difference for me in that regard. A small downside is that I feel like my hair now looks a little frizzy but I think that&#x27;s just the trade off for one with such fine hair.</li>
    <li> clean scent that is not overpowering.  I love to use this when I am in a rush.</li>
    <li> who doesn&#x27;t love tousled waves just like you left the beach!!? This is the beach in a bottle without the sand :) love, love, love it.  oh, and it smells soo good too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other salt sprays and I really like this one. Great smell. I wear my hair relatively short (2-3&#x27;&#x27;) and this gives enough tangible texture that I feel like my hair is thick and malleable after a full day&#x27;s wear. Helps with those sticking-up sorts of hairs dos.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very frizzy.</li>
    <li> It could be user error but I found that the spray makes my hair a bit sticky. I have thicker, wavy hair and have pretty much gone back to using mousse when I want to add more waves. Smells nice though!</li>
    <li> I loooooove the smell. I have a nice loose be beach curl. The spray does not weigh your hair down</li>
    <li> I suppose it helps with the waves, but because it&#x27;s a texturizer it also leaves a weird film type feeling on my hair and makes it into a tangled mess at times.</li>
    <li> not for my grizzy hair</li>
    <li> it hasn&#x27;t really worked that well and leaves my hair crunchy</li>
    <li> I Love this product. I have medium length wavy hair and have tried multiple products trying to enhance my waves with no luck...until I purchased this! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking wet, crunchy or greasy. It definitely enhances my waves, texture is great and it smells fabulous. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price either.</li>
    <li> I have tried many sea salt sprays...and this one unfortunately did not make the cut. It hardly added any shape or wave to my hair....not recommended. I really like TIGI Catwalk salt spray</li>
    <li> Just completed my second order for this.  Was looking for an alternative to the Bumble &amp; Bumble Surf Spray, because I figured there had to be other alternatives out there that did the same thing but for a lot less.  So I order a couple of different alternatives and this is the one that worked best for me, with long hair with waves I like to encourage, and need product to do that.  And with Not Your Mother&#x27;s Beach Babe, I found it.  I just added the Texturizing Creme to my order, figure that combined they will even do a better job.  Want to keep that beach-babe look all year round.</li>
    <li> My hair is pin straight. Doesn&#x27;t hold a curl at all. So far this product has been working very well!</li>
    <li> My hair is semi wavy to begin with (it&#x27;s more like half-straight half-wavy, which is just awkward), so I bought this under the recommendation of a beauty blog I like to kind of try and even my hair out. I didn&#x27;t expect to like it as much as I do. It smells FANTASTIC, first of all: oddly vanilla-y, which seems odd for a &#x27;beach&#x27; spray, but I&#x27;m not sure a scent I would expect (.. something like salt water, I guess, or the ocean) would be very popular anyhow. Second, it gave me really lovely waves/curls after letting it air dry, that actually held REALLY well despite a ride in a convertible later that evening. It never felt sticky or clumpy, either. It really did look like I had spent the whole day in the ocean. It might not work as well for people with straight or fine hair, but for thick, wavy or semi-wavy hair, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Product is great, cheaper at CVS</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair, but  I still use it daily for the smell.</li>
    <li> Great product for vacationing on the beach. No fuss hair and it holds all day</li>
    <li> This works for me. Will it work for you? Well everyone has different hair and we all style it differently as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my hair air dry( easy now that it is summer) to it is just faintly damp or just dry- then I spray this on from about a foot away and mush my hair around so it is distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then do dry roller sets with it. Because my hair is baby fine, the Sea Salt Spray dries in fast and the roller set only needs to be in for an hour to 90 mins for me to have curls/waves( depends how tight I make the sponge roller set).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is, I am trying not to damage my fine hair more than I have to and this product along with a dry to nearly totally dry roller set works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all beauty products- for face or hair, you need to give it a shot and see how it works for you. You may need to experiment on how much to put in or not put in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women with more body to their hair- or just plain more hair on their head, probably need more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Spraying this in damp hair( NOT WET)- then twisting your hair( depending on length) in a top not or something to pin it  up with for a few hours( if your hair is very damp) or until you feel it dry is probably the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you undo the top not or clip- you should at least see tousled waves.  Your hair type is going to vary the results.  Again- experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution: We have had a dreadful heatwave with record humidity where I am. My hair does great with this in air conditioned climates.  But the kind of baby fine, straight hair I possess has not yet met any product that will keep wave or curl holding when humidity is above normal range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be disappointed if you have hair like me and are in the a/c while doing your hair and then walk out into severe humidity( the kind where your glasses fog up!) and notice less than 5 mins later- your hair is pin straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not the fault of the product for people with hair like this.  It works- but all types of hair will react disappointingly to severe humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not many miracles around for this kind of hair, other than permanents/body waves.  For me?  I have success with this and when indoors in a cool, drier climates- my hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I know I have to go out in humidity- I prepare my hair with this as described- pin it or put it in a top knot and then only release it when I get to my destination where there is air conditioning.  You gotta get creative people.  :)or people with hair like this.  It works- but all types of hair will react disappointingly to severe humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not many miracles around for this kind of hair, other than permanents/body waves.  For me?

    <li> it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. it flattens your hair at the roots a little bit though which i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> i have fine, thick hair and this does wonders to texturize and help tame the frizz out of my hair!! after a few sprays after a shower, i can let it air dry and expect nice waves after it dries.. it&#x27;s got a nice smell too!! ur hair is a little crunchy afterwards but it&#x27;s salt, so it is to be expected</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel sticky, dry, gross ETC ETC ETC! I hated this product. I had read such good reviews but this product sucked. I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend this product to my worst enemy.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite product. Great for when you are in a hurry or lazy, or next day hair.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! I honestly didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work cause most products are not meant for frizzy hair like mine, but it works well with all types of hair, smells good and it looks good!</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight hair and saw no results from this. Such a bummer and disappointment. I was excited to get some waves in my hair.</li>
    <li> Even it&#x27;&#x27;s the same brand/line&#x27; the spray is not great at all. Not for me at least. This one leaves my hair super sticky, even my hands. I&#x27;ll be purchasing the texturizing hair cream again though!</li>
    <li> I was not at all pleased with this product. It did not make good waves, it did not provide body, it left my hair feeling stringy, and did not last even one complete day. It is very sticky, and becomes like dried glue in your hair.  I wondered if I had damaged my hair, it felt so bad. I do not recommend it, and will be tossing mine. I don&#x27;t want to inflict my bad experience on anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other much better products on the market. The absolute best I&#x27;ve found is Aquage Sea Salt Texturizing Spray. It is pricier, but to me, it is a miracle in a bottle, allows me to completely style my hair in about 5-10 minutes. It completely  eliminates the need for any kind of curling implement, which I had to use once or twice a day since the age of 12. I have baby fine hair that&#x27;s straight as a stick. Aquage gives me phenomenal waves/curls that everyone thinks are natural, and are shocked to learn that I get it from a bottle! It also provides wonderful body and looks thicker than it really is. Surprisingly, my hair looks better on Day 2, and even better on Day 3.  My niece also has had the same experience. Aquage is pricier and harder to find - which is why I usually get mine online. But it works amazingly well, and, in my opinion, is the best on the market. It is very easy to get a great look from this product. It&#x27;s fun to have good hair - which I get from the Aquage spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another sea salt texturizing spray is Oil of Morocco. It is better than Not Your Mother&#x27;s, not quite as good as Aquage. It costs more than Not Your Mother&#x27;s, but less than Aquage, and you can find it in the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea Salt Texturizing Sprays are a wonderful idea - but Not Your Mother&#x27;s is a poor example, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Too stiff &amp; drying for my hair!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used for beach waves. It smells awesome and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product but it didn&#x27;t quite deliver the beachy wavy hair I was wanting.  I have long, fine hair and it seems to only work for the first hour but after that my hair just looks tangled and dirty.</li>
    <li> I personally didnt like the product, doesnt help trying to make your hair curly or beachy, even tho smells great!</li>
    <li> This product has saved so many bad hair days! It smells of coconuts and summer. A small quirk I found with is your hair does get a little tangled, not like rats nests bad but to the point where you cant run your fingers through your hair without getting snagged. Its such a wonderful product and i cant wait to stock up! I reccomend this for anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> an amazing value compared to bumble and bumble! just wash your hand after cause it truly simulates a day at the beach!</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good beach spray for hair. You an spray on quite a bit and hair never gets stiff or sticky. It makes a slight wave. I&#x27;ve had better luck with other sprays, but I like the smell, the cost and the way it makes my hair feel. Just wish it gave more waves.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like my hair smelling like a coconut.  Also, it make it extremely &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;.  Hated that</li>
    <li> works just like the 30$ spray my aunt got me from the salon!</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel like I&#x27;ve been at the beach all day, really great product</li>
    <li> It smells great and is great when you need quick little waves</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Not Your Mothers brand! This texturizing spray smells so good and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stringy</li>
    <li> I love this product! It gives me the perfect beach waves without the beach and a ton of product and effort!! I have long, medium thick,  wavy hair and it is perfect! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Does nothing but make my hair look greasy. Nothing what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I was truly disapointed. Won&#x27;t ever by this again.</li>
    <li> the package was drenched in the product. It made my wavy thick hair feel gross and disgustingly dry. WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> I wish I liked this more. I have thick, wavy curly hair and it just made my hair sticky.</li>
    <li> This products works better and feels better on my hair than any other product I have tried.  I have short, thick, slightly wavy hair and I like to encourage the wave without adding any stickiness or heaviness to my hair.  This product does the job!  And it smells absolutely wonderful.  I spray it on my damp hair, push in the waves and let it dry naturally.  After my hair is dry, I spray the Beach Babe Texturizing Sea Salt Spray again, lightly, to create and hold additional waves. My hair is soft, wavy and touchable throughout the day.  An added bonus is that this product is cheaper than every other sea salt spray on the market.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to add waves or encourage natural waves in their hair.  And I have recommended it to many...even my hair stylist who now uses it on her clients!  I keep several spray bottles of it on hand at all times!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is baby fine and I have a very difficult time getting it to do anything.  This product adds great texture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read that some viewers suggest using it on wet hair and some on dry. I think it all depends on your hair type. I have thinner, slippery hair and this does nothing if I spray it on wet and then blow dry. But if I use it on dry hair, it gives great waves that last all day. I also use it when I&#x27;m putting my hair up because it helps it hold without slipping out.</li>
    <li> awesome, but makes hair a bit sticky?</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Not Your Mother&#x27;s spray! The smell is so serene and it works fabulous on your hair. It also doubles as a hair-spray but not in the potency of one. If your hair is wet or dry, it works just as well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product to use if you don&#x27;t have time to do your hair but want to add some texture really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is super straight and very feathery without any product in it so I always need to do something. This is good for when I&#x27;m running out the door or if I want a messier look.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair, and use this to product to give my waves some definition and hold. I like it, but I only use it when my hair is wet.  That way it doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;sticky and hard&amp;#34; when it dries.  I find that when I use it on dry hair my hair feels hard and crunchy.  If I apply it to wet hair, my hair feels soft to the touch.  I also like the scent.  It&#x27;s pleasant and not overpowering.  It would say it smells a bit like vanilla.  Overall, this is a good product and costs a fraction of what other brands charge.</li>
    <li> Came to my house broken at the neck of the bottle. (Doubled wrapped in plastic but not bubble wrap - did they expect this to happen?). Product smells great but my hair felt like straw after using the product.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this unless you want to feel like you should shave all your hair off your head AKA: your hair feels dry, damaged, and just plain awful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few brands of beach spray and this is not my favorite. I have oily hair and this product makes it worse. Might be good for drier hair but then why would you need it?</li>
    <li> Bobby L&#x27;s wife here.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is crap, my whole life I have envied my friends with thick, full hair.  Mine is thin and flat and requires upside down drying, volumizers and sprays to get it to look good, and that&#x27;s on a good hair day.  And I will admit to being a big hair person in the 80&amp;#34;s (that totally awesome straight-up bang section!), I gave that up long ago and just want my hair to not be flat against my head.&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done drying now, I lift up sections and spray this lightly and then shake my hands through my hair for a slightly tousled look and it really adds volume and texture.  It sprays with a very fine mist, which I like a lot.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has the same kind of hair, I told her to try it and she loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;I know there are other sea salt sprays out there, I might try a different one next time to compare as this is the first one I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter bought one at a CVS, and the sprayer broke pretty quickly so she just bought another here and is going to transfer the contents into the new one when it depletes. No problems with the other 2 we got, so it may have just been a fluke.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really good. My routine with it is to use it after a shower while my hair is still damp, comb it in to apply it evenly, then ruffle my hair with my fingers to get a messy/fluffly look. I like that this stuff adds texture to my normally straight and somewhat boring hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this on Amazon and considered buying it.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I waited to buy it here because I was curious about the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it because you&#x27;ll smell awful all day.  If your sense of smell is sensitive, like mine is, it&#x27;ll really bother you.  I bought it yesterday and I&#x27;ll be returning it to Ulta this week.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work in my hair. I didn&#x27;t get beach waves more of a tangled mess. The smell was terrible too. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have long been going to the beach and I&#x27;m always so sad when I have to go home and finally lose my beach hair until next time--Well, now, that&#x27;s not a problem! This stuff makes my hair look great (and I have fine, impossible-to-style hair), and it even leaves my hands soft after I touch it. Not a single complaint.&lt;br /&gt;KEH</li>
    <li> I have very long, fine hair. This helps to give texture to allow for doing and holding my hair. Also gives a very good, clean scent for periods of time.</li>
    <li> i have straight hair that was permed about a year and a half ago.  this creates a nice texture but i REALLY love the smell. not crunchy or anything.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy/curly and frizzy hair and this product does WONDERS, not to mention it smells great! I use it after I get out of the shower and have towel dried my hair a bit. Love it, don&#x27;t know how I went without it for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, PSA!!!!!! Walgreens and Walmart have this product for anywhere from $4-$6 a bottle. GO BUY IT THERE!!! :)</li>
    <li> Wish I had read the other reviews.  It really is just a texturizer and doesn&#x27;t add any curl.  Works well for styling an updo and getting some texture, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for wearing my hear down.  Other reviews said this. Wish I&#x27;d read them first.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  Used it when I had a pixie cut and it made my hair very easy to style when used before bed (spray in, let dry, then sleep in it, style with fingers in the morning).  I grew my hair out and now it gives me great beachy waves/curls.  I like the loose curls but if you like you can use curl holding gel afterwards  to make them more solid.  I use it daily--gives great natural-looking curls.  Some people say it dries out your hair but I&#x27;ve never experienced that.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for short and curly/wavy hair especially!  Super easy to use and works well for a quick style!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I use it almost daily because I love the way it makes my hair feel and I can just put it in my wet hair and I&#x27;m good to go. I will definitely repurchase this product.(:</li>
    <li> I have very straight, fine hair - it&#x27;s just past shoulder length and cut with a little layering around the front. I sprayed the product all over my towel-dried hair and used a diffuser attachment on my hair dryer. This produced some waves in my hair, but it was straight again by the time I finished doing my make-up, about 10 minutes later. Bummer because it looked great before all the waves fell straight! On the upside, the product does add a little body/volume and is lighter than other volumizing or root boost sprays I have used. For that, I&#x27;d buy and use this product again, but as far as its intended use, it fell short at least for my hair type.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair feel very dry and frizzy. I have oily hair and it really dried my hair out. If you have normal hair, stay away. There are definitely way better texturing sea sprays out there.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and straight hair, and some extra texture and volume makes all the difference. I played baseball as a kid and after games, with that combo of sweat and dirt in it, my hair just felt right. Stray hairs didn&#x27;t fly in front of the face and the hair didn&#x27;t move around too much, but it wasn&#x27;t greasy or weighed down with product either. This stuff achieves a similar effect, but it smells like vanilla and coconut. When it dries, it does cause your hair to tangle and stick some, which is kind of how it works. What I like to do is spray this stuff and blow dry lightly, then pull it back in a bun. It makes it look much neater with more volume, far fewer stray flyayay hairs, and holds better than without. Definitely worth a try</li>
    <li> ehhh.. I have used stuff a lot better (Adiwappa? Spelling?). Smells like vanilla though, that is a plus.</li>
    <li> Dolidnt really do much for my hair.. I didn&#x27;t shave an extra volume and seemed to weigh my hair down- I have thick, fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! It&#x27;s absolutely terrible, after putting this in my hair it instantly dried it out and made it feel like I rubbed a box of chalk in my hair! I would not recommend and will NOT be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was a miracle curl item. some reviews were good, others bad. i took my chances.&lt;br /&gt;First of all...it didnt work. i have fine hair. didnt even faze it. tried on my daughter who has very thick hair. still didnt work.&lt;br /&gt;it smells bad. it tastes bad...my hair few in my face and mouth and it was not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;a day later and i can still smell it.&lt;br /&gt;makes your hair feel weird and slimy. and if u are like me and run your fingers through your hair it instantly dries out your hands.&lt;br /&gt;would not buy again. stuck with the trusty ol ausie hair scrunch.</li>
    <li> Works really well for a couple of hours, but on my stick straight, thick coarse hair, it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> The smell is good and it does the job, but my hair ends up feeling dried out and not crunchy, but almost like straw.  It usually feels OK at first, then gets dryer feeling as the day goes on and the next day it&#x27;s just a mess that I can&#x27;t work with.  Once it is washed out, the dry feeling goes away.  Not as good as the Marc Anthony Beach Waves spray, which somehow curls even the straightest of hair, damp or dry and feels nice even the next day.</li>
    <li> Read about saltwater spray in a magazine and thought I&#x27;d give it a try for my naturally curly/frizzy hair on our family vacation to Florida.  Great product and loved the way it held my curls and didn&#x27;t make them frizzy!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I can not provide a review of this product because the cap broke off and all the fluid was soaked into the package upon arrival.</li>
    <li> Purchased this at Ulta a few days ago and im in love! I always loved the way my hair looked after a day of swimming in the ocean and this product has the same effect! Did I mention the smell?! Its amazing kinda vanilla thats light and fresh. I have natrually wavey hair that tends to just frizz and poof with almost any product that i pit in. With this stuff i get great curl definition with frizz control! Going back tomorrow to buy more while its on sale in anticipation of going through large quantities :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is an okay product. I have somewhat thick hair (kinda wavy, kinda straight) and I love the way it looks after letting it air dry, but there&#x27;s nothing like beach hair. So I got this as a texturizer, it works well for that purpose, kinda makes your hair feel like it needs to be washed. &amp; it really makes it hard to brush out. It has a good smell, but when spraying it i suggest you keep your mouth closed at all times because it really tastes like ocean.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall I guess I would suggest it if you&#x27;re looking for that beachy look. But if you have straight, thin hair, this isn&#x27;t for you. I would suggest it for wavy hair, and also don&#x27;t drown yourself in it.</li>
    <li> I like the Organix Sea Salt Spray a lot better. This brand made my hair greasy and it looked like I had not washed it in days by the end of the day. Going back to my Organix.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t do anything else.</li>
    <li> i was refered sea salt spray for staticy hair i used this on my 7 year old daughters hair when it was wet and as it dried it produced lots of waves which i thought was awesome being that her hair has been completly straight all her life.I really like this product and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smell like a beach. Not so good for the waves but oh well</li>
    <li> This product turned my hair into a clumpy crispy mess. It works great, if you were to use it as hairspray instead. I also didn&#x27;t realize this product was so literal when it stated \\&quot;BEACH waves\\&quot; on the bottle, your hair will feel exactly as if you had gone to the beach, which ironically I find that feeling gross. It also didn&#x27;t do anything to wave my hair, don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because my hair is long or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this product, and I must say it lives up to the hype! Received it two days ago and have already fallen in love. The scent is almost cookie-like, a little like almond extract; but it also has a slightly beachy smell. Tried it on both dry and damp (towel-dried) hair...I think it works more noticeably when your hair is dry. Great for creating tousled, wavy looks! It&#x27;s also very helpful for adding volume, more so than dry shampoo in my opinion. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> NOT for naturally wavy, thick, kinky or curly hair. This product is for people with naturally straight or fine thin hair that want to add wavy volume and texture. I&#x27;m not saying it is a bad product, although the smell is not great by any means, but it is not for anyone with anything other than straight hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair except make it feel nasty. Natural Brunette, &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; hair. The packaging that it was sent in was soft and the top was completely busted off which probably didn&#x27;t help much but even after replacing the top with a similar one it didn&#x27;t do anything except make my clean hair feel like I needed to wash it again.</li>
    <li> It smells good.  I don&#x27;t know that it does anything else, but boy oh boy does it smell like coconut goodness.</li>
    <li> Did Nothing for My Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight hair, and I wanted to give it a little texture so I thought this would be good for when I curled/waved my hair. It does help to form curls, but it also makes my hair sticky, oily, and extremely tangled. No matter how much or little I use I have issues with it making my hair tangled, and looking oily the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One good thing I will say about it is that it does have a very pleasant scent, and I like the spray bottle, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking to add TEXTURE to your hair. It smells great, like the beach with vanilla. But don&#x27;t get it on your lips, lol it doesn&#x27;t taste well. (Salty) it adds a nice wave and some volume. This will not &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; your hair, it&#x27;s more for adding texture and waviness. I use it after my shower, towel dry my hair and spray a bit. Then scrunch my hair until dry almost. Just be careful running your fingers through after it dries cause it will make your hair sorta dry and messy. But that&#x27;s what the beach does anyways!! Works as nice as &amp;#34;bumble and bumble surf spray&amp;#34; which costs WAAAYYY more. Plus it smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Smells beachy, but not sure that it adds texture</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I have long hair and for summer wear, spray it on damp hair, mess it up with fingers good to go!</li>
    <li> This product replicates beach hair perfectly.  Whenever I come back from Hawaii I say &amp;#34;I need to move to Hawaii just because my hair is great there!&amp;#34;..  Well, Now I can have beach hair in Oregon.  I did see some reviews where people didn&#x27;t like the texture/film.  Well, that&#x27;s beach hair for ya.  The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t care for is that it&#x27;s scented.  Not a beachy scent either.  Love it other than that!</li>
    <li> This is great to use for more hair texture. Just apply it to wet hair.  I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> I have very wavy, slightly frizzy hair with 2c/3a curls.  I like sea salt sprays for &amp;#34;2nd day hair,&amp;#34; where my hair is not shower-clean but I need to revive the curl.  Here&#x27;s what I do:  I spray my hair all over with water and finger-comb, then mist with a leave-in conditioner and finger-comb again.  I then apply a VERY LIGHT MIST of this to both top hair and under-layers, and scrunch.  It turns flat areas into waves and waves into spiral curls, and adds the perfect amount of texture and holds all day.  I think that people who have problems with this spray (or any sea salt spray) are simply using too much, or using it on dry hair.  I love the smell of this product but the price is a bit too high for regular use.  I use the L&#x27;Oreal TXT-it spray and have a small bottle of NYMBB for traveling.  They work about the same but this smells better.</li>
    <li> I have blonde color treated hair, that is straight.  I would say my hair is medium thickness.  This product does a good job giving my hair some texture and with alittle help from a few other products I do achieve a &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; tousled look.  Before applying this I apply a quick dry spray ( I can not remember the exact brand, but its called California Quick Dry) and I apply Aquage Root Lifter to my scalp and then apply this spray, I turn my head upside down and scrunch my hair then repeat as I am getting ready, until it has almost dried, once it has almost dry I will lightly mist my hair with hairspray.</li>
    <li> I have stick straight hair and was hoping for some sort of wave, but all this does for me is just put back a little oil in my hair when I&#x27;ve washed it. I only wash my hair twice a week for manageability so I can style it, and when I wash my hair it&#x27;s very fine and stringy. This adds some nice texture as if it were &amp;#34;next day&amp;#34; hair.</li>
    <li> I read that this product can dry your hair out but I didn&#x27;t expect just how badly. I have thin and fine blonde hair and this made straw out of it. My hair just broke to pieces every time I brushed it while using the product. Might work for hair that is polar opposite of mine though.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair way to heavy and gritty</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this.  I love the way it smells, and it gives me a more tousled look.  You can&#x27;t go crazy spraying your hair or it leaves a weird texture, that needs to be hand combed.  Overall it works for me.  I have shoulder length, frizzy hair with light waves.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this spray. It does not really give my hair many &#x27;waves&#x27; but I realize it&#x27;s a texturizing spray - not a magic wavy hair maker. I am very satisfied with it and love to use it in the summer so I don&#x27;t have to get so hot blow drying my hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this just isn&#x27;t compatible with my hair, or what the issue is, but this didn&#x27;t work at all for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of giving my hair texture, it actually made my hair softer, like super soft, as in so soft, a jaw clip or pony tail holder wouldn&#x27;t even stay in!  My hair is on the softer side to begin with, but this product somehow made it even softer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using this on wet hair, damp hair, and dry hair, and I I have tried letting my hair air dry and have tried blow-drying it while using this product.  Regardless of what I do, whenever I use this product, my hair ends up very, very soft and not at all beachy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummer, because the smell is AWESOME, a delightful coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Did not purchase through Amazon.  Purchased at local drug store.)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product! For me, though, it doesn&#x27;t really add much texture. Within a few hours, I just feel greasy and need to apply dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> Awful.  It left my hair feeling stringy and dirty by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Good service.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!  Very lightweight styling product. Great for easy going summer hair.</li>
    <li> I thought it would smell like the beach.  It smells like baby powder.</li>
    <li> My hair has natural wave… more curly underneath and less wavy in the front which has always been hard to manage. I spray this in when my hair is soaking after I get out of the shower and leave it in a towel after I have sprayed it with this sea salt spray. After doing makeup, I take the towel down and spray a little more. It air dries with perfect beach waves!</li>
    <li> Better on dry hair. Not fabulous. This product tastes nice, and feels somewhat gritty in your hair. It really feels like you&#x27;ve been at the beach rolling in the sand.</li>
    <li> If you have dry hair or dry skin avoid this product. Once sprayed in my hair it turned my hair into a crispy mess. I tried it several different ways on dry hair, wet hair and hair with smoothing products. Each and every time my hair again turned crispy. My hands also felt over dried when I did anything with my hair after it was sprayed. Also don&#x27;t think you can get a brush through your hair after you spray this in it cause you&#x27;ll end up with a rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
    <li> This spray works OK but nothing special.  It is another example of being taken in by a fancy name.  After I bought it, I also found out that it was $5.99 on drugstore.com.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time . I have naturally strait hair, buying I spray this in and scrunch my hair I have amazing lasting waves. These waves last for hours and hours at a time with this product . I think the reason most people have trouble with this because they fmdont scrunch their hair after applying it . If you don&#x27;t do this step your hair wil most definitely remain strait. It has the most amazing comilla smell ever .  I&#x27;ve had friends hug me and say that my hair smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this product and get many compliments on my hair when I use it. It smells wonderful, too. I gave four stars because the nozzle is not especially durable. It broke easily when the bottle fell over... Nothing a little duct tape couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
    <li> This product smells soooo good! I have naturally straight hair, and this doesnt bring out curls or anything but it does give my hair a beach look and makes it smell to die for. I sleep with my hair in a certain way to make it curly and use this after I shower and before I put my hair up for the night and it works great to create a more natural looking (but not actually natural) curl!</li>
    <li> I feel like a little hairspray in wet hair works pretty much like this does. I do like the way it smells. I don&#x27;t know that it does too much. I don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Ok so I have pretty wavy hair, but some of it is straight, so I got this to try to make all of my hair a bit wavier, and it works pretty well. I find that it&#x27;s wavier if you kind of scrunch it a little with your hands. It smells really amazing, kind of a combination of vanilla and coconut, which is good because I was worried it would smell bad with the seaweed it has in it. It also gives my hair a grittier texture, which I don&#x27;t mind, but if you want your hair to be soft you should probably get a different product. I haven&#x27;t noticed any clumping or anything like that. Overall, a good product</li>
    <li> I have long thick wavy/curly hair and this product works great! I can use it in place of a gel product and it does not leave your hair feeling heavy. I like to wash my hair every other day and this product makes it easier because it does not give you that heavy feeling and you can use it again the next day to give your curls a bump. I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers were talking about, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve written like 40 reviews already and my fingers are tired. so here i go... again... this product is really good... i really like it... it works... it smells good... its worth the price...bye</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair frizzy and at the end of the day a tangled mess. I have thin hair that curls easily. I would not recommend this product. I will stick with my gel and mousse.</li>
    <li> from previous reviews i expected this to be a better product.  it&#x27;s ok but nothing to get excited about--overpriced for the quality</li>
    <li> I have used so many other products to  boost and enhance my natural curly &amp; wavy waist length hair. This is hands down THE BEST products I have ever used. I use it in conjunction with the cream of the same name and it gives me gorgeous hair for days. People are always asking me what I use, and they laugh when I brag about this products name.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference with my hair with the use of this product. I bought because of magazine recommendation. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this product when I first heard about it.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t help my stick straight hair.  I&#x27;ve tried using it after shampoo; on dry hair; after shampoo and conditioner; after wetting hair; etc.  I&#x27;ve tried letting hair dry naturally, drying with diffuser, and drying with regualr hair dryer.  No matter what I did, my hair pretty much looks the same -stick straight.  I love the smell, so I use it on my hair to make me smile and remind me of the beach.  I did notice that if I use the product and then I curl my hair using a curling iron, it seems to hold the curl better.  I give it 4 stars because of the great smell and the extra hold.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Doesn&#x27;t feel like there is anything in it. I like to apply it with damp hair and let air dry and you get these beach waves. Also have tried on dry hair and developed a very similar result and loved it!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff and I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair looks, it really does remind me of my old beach hair but is much more healthy for it. The only thing was that at first it smelled like Play-Doh and coconuts to me, but I soon came to like the scent.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair naturally so I thought this stuff would help my hair be a pretty beach wave instead of it&#x27;s naturally messy wave. It really didn&#x27;t wave it much. I tried putting it on my hair when it was dry and when it was damp after a shower and neither times did it really work well. It definitely made it feel thicker because of the texturizing ingredients but the waves were really the same as if I had not put anything in it at all. I ended up just putting my hair in a ponytail the times I tried it.</li>
    <li> Great light texture for the beach look. Does not weigh hair down and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy fine blonde hair and this product does not work well for me. I live close to the ocean in SC. I already have salt in the air, but this product does very little to give me that amazing beach hair. My hair just gets heavy and flat when this is applied.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great! Will totally buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells incredible, and leaves a soft beachy texture in my hair that can&#x27;t be beat. I was incredibly skeptical of a hairspray that wasn&#x27;t organic or vegan or something. Honestly, I don&#x27;t tend to lean towards products of that nature, but when it comes to my hair I almost can&#x27;t tolerate anything but. My scalp is so sensitive! This is fantastic, though! I love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great! I spray it in my hair right after I get out of the shower and my hair looks great the rest of the day. It is not heavy or sticky at all. You do not even know it is there.</li>
    <li> I really like this texturizing spray smells great and works very well. I have fine thin hair and have had problems finding products that won&#x27;t weigh down my hair. This is perfect. I wash my hair, spray this, comb it through then drive to work with the convertible top down. By the time I get to work I have beautiful beach hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product -  the trigger pump is excellent</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. A little goes a long way! I suggest spraying some sort of Moroccan oil on the ends, since it dries your hair out a little.</li>
    <li> This product works great and it smells amazing. I love the texture that it gives my hair and it definitely gives my hair the beachy, wavey look.</li>
    <li> I curl my hair everyday and it holds the curl and gives it a great texture! Also love the smell!</li>
    <li> Best price I have see for this online and it beats paying so much for it in the store this Product smells nice and works great.</li>
    <li> I bought it to accentuate my natural waves in summer when I don&#x27;t want to style my hair or it&#x27;s too humid for that to be much use. This gives it a piecy, beach look. It dries easily and works best when I apply it to slightly damp hair that hasn&#x27;t been brushed through too many times.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for a product like this since my trip to Italy. I swam everyday in the Mediterranean Sea for 3 weeks and I noticed that my hair never looked so good! I wanted to bottle it and bring it home but that would make for a very heavy suitcase. I have medium textured hair with wave and curls and lots and lots of frizz. This product defines my waves and curls without frizz just like when I was in Italy. Never been so pleased with my hair. It does leave the hair feeling a little dirty but when you swim in salty water your hair feels the same way so I expected no less. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have full, wavy, long hair, I use little-none styling tools. I usually braid my hair when it&#x27;s wet to tame the slight frizz that occurs, then unbraid it to get a smooth wavy look. But with this product, I can skip the braiding and get the bouncy beach wavy hair (which is a little cuter than the tamed waves)!! What I do is brush my hair (dry) before I shampoo and condition, then I wrap my hair in a towel for about 15-30 mintues, then I take towel off spray all over hair (section, spray, section spray...) and that&#x27;s it! My hair air dries and it looks amazing. (I should also add that I trim my hair every six weeks and it&#x27;s all one length)</li>
    <li> Great product. Love the smooth hair it gives me. Smells wonderful (think beachy coconut). Makes my unruly hair a breeze to style. &amp;#34;Not your mothers&#x27;s&amp;#34; is a fabulous line of products!</li>
    <li> pretty awesome product for a quick hair-do</li>
    <li> This is a product that had a lot of hype to it. I&#x27;ve been wanting it for months now but had super long curly hair that just wouldn&#x27;t work with this. I recently cut my hair to a way shorter more trendy style and immediately went to the store to get this product. When I got home I curled my hair a &amp;#34;generously&amp;#34; applied this stuff as the bottle recommends. My hair looked great! But there are a couple cons that make me never want this product again: makes your hair utterly dry if used on dry hair (which the bottle says you can but didn&#x27;t include the fact that it would suck every drop of moisture out of your locks) and it smells like play dough. A lot of people say this smells like &amp;#34; the beach &amp;#34; but not to me, if you have a sensitive nose then I recommend to go for a different product. This will leave your hair smelling like new can of play dough for at least an hour. From what I&#x27;ve read, this stuff works better on straight thin hair, so curly thick haired people, this isn&#x27;t for you!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Gives a little extra body to flat straight hair &amp; it gives curls more definition with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Five Star Sea Salt Spray in my book!  And in my hair!  Yes, I truly love this product.  Have tried many others, some high-end, but I keep coming back to this one.  It has a mild pleasant, not-fake scent and leaves your hair soft with that beachy look that we&#x27;re all (or mostly all) after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is infused with natural dead sea salt + sea kelp and has very few ingredients, which I like.  I like the pump mechanism on this which is easy to spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another favorite product that delivers what it says it will, without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Very good! Smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> First of all, I adore the coconut scent. I like mixing scents so this mixes great with my more musky and base note essential oils that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I have a lot of very curly hair that is pretty much an afro but a lot of times the hair gets separated and fuzzed out instead of these big ol&#x27; curls and waves. It honestly makes my hair feel like second day hair without being actually dirty which is just what I was searching for! My hair is really thick and somewhat coarse so I tend to use super heavy products and this is about average heaviness that I am used to so I think this would not really work well for straight or thin hair.</li>
    <li> This worked well when I had my shoulder length, layered hair; however, it didn&#x27;t work AS well with my longer hair (about 4 inches past my shoulders).  It still gives you a great beachy style, but works best if you haven&#x27;t used conditioner that day.  Be wary to not use this every single day if your hair is naturally dry.  It does dry out my normal to oily hair just a bit.  I love the scent and the sprayer worked very well.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair the texture of having been in the ocean, but only in touch, not so much in how it looks. It makes my hair feel crispy and hard to brush, but it really doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;ve been swimming in the ocean or anything. I like the way it smells though. But the reason it doesn&#x27;t work for me might be because I&#x27;ve got thick hair? I don&#x27;t actually have a well thought-out but yeah. There you have it.</li>
    <li> It does actually work! However it leaves a bit of a hard, sticky texture in my hair after which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but from my own personal experience this just made my hair sort of tangled and rough. I do not care for it, mousse works better for me.</li>
    <li> Love this. Makes my waves pop.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I have very thick hair that usually is this weird in-between straight and wavy naturally, and this product gives me beautiful waves/curls. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Need this product if you want beach waves.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle in a bottle. I have the straightest hair ever. Nothing I used ever really made my hair wavy, until I found this baby. After I shower and shampoo my hair, I spray the product all over my hair after its towel dried damp and scrunch it up with my hands. My hair is always wavy and cute now that I use this product. I was nervous about trying it because most sea salt sprays leave your hair nasty, but if you spray it on damp hair, it will only leave your hair cute and wavy :)</li>
    <li> Product gave a boost to my hair - definite lift and body.  Smells good, too.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any wow factor from using this product. I don&#x27;t know if it is due to the product or due to my hair type. I have very thick but very fine hair. I get some natural waves from my hair, which I was hoping to expand upon with this product. But instead, my hair just stayed pretty flat and ended up just looking messy. I liked the product okay enough (especially the smell), but I just don&#x27;t think it was for me.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this for her semi straight hair and it gives her good body and good wave. She is a very picky 17 yr old and loves this product.</li>
    <li> So far good for adding some texture and does not make hair stiff but does not seem to last as long as I&#x27;dli k e.  I&#x27;m still experimenting though with using it when hair is at various stages of wet/dry to find optimal applications.</li>
    <li> Awesome love love love this product</li>
    <li> I was so excited to give my straight hair the volume it desperately needed, but when i sprayed this product into my hair, i could not run my fingers through it to save my life. This product made my hair:&lt;br /&gt;*dry&lt;br /&gt;*tangled&lt;br /&gt;*sticky&lt;br /&gt;*hard to manage&lt;br /&gt;*not shinny&lt;br /&gt;*not soft at all&lt;br /&gt;*smelly&lt;br /&gt;I will not be ordering this again because i like to be able to brush my hair!!!</li>
    <li> My sister loves this product but for me, not so much. It just tangled my hair and made it look very ratty.</li>
    <li> wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> I love this!  I have a LOT of fine fine hair... use this especially on my second day... instead of dry shampoo!  LOVE it and smells amaaaaaaaaazing.</li>
    <li> I normally use Organix FX Sea Salt Spray, but it wasn&#x27;t in stock on my last grocery trip so I purchased this product instead. This is my first NYM product, and I must say that I got it at a much lower price in the store than is listed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT ME&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and mostly very straight with a couple areas of very mild waviness and it&#x27;s grown out to a couple inches past my shoulders. I am not very fussy about my looks, but I do like to look nice. On average I spend about 30 minutes to an hour primping daily. (1 hr with shower, 30 min without.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STYLING&lt;br /&gt;My first morning I sprayed liberally onto my damp hair and used a blow dryer on low setting without a brush. I found I didn&#x27;t really care for the effect. I saw increased body, but it was paired with increased frizz. I saw some extra waviness, too, and it looked natural. I was forced to use an anti-frizz cream, applied just to the ends of my hair, after the drying and then I thought it looked pretty good. However, I felt that after about half a day of work in an office setting, it looked like I&#x27;d never put any product in at all. Staying power is definitely a weak point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used this product I dried my hair FIRST and then applied the spray. I like this much better! There is no frizzing problem with my quality of hair. The texture change was very subtle, made the locks more apt to separate into pieces but I would by NO means call it ropey. What I was really impressed with was the added body. It looked very natural and there was no product shine, a very nice matte finish, and my hair just seemed healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GENERAL COMMENTS&lt;br /&gt;I like the aroma of the product. It&#x27;s a little bit fruity but also pretty subtle. I have a sensitive nose and it&#x27;s just enough that you get a gentle hint of it from time to time. I also like the bottle. It takes a few pulls of the trigger but eventually you get a powerful and even spray from the nozzle. Also, although they don&#x27;t yet advertise on their bottles, NYM does not test their products on animals and they very rarely use animal byproducts. (One instance, and the animal is the silkworm.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPARISON&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned before, I normally use Organix FX Sea Salt Spray. I prefer the packaging from NYM, particularly the spray nozzle, and I like that NYM&#x27;s spray has less oil and feels lighter on the hair. (And NYM smells much yummier!) However, I feel that the trade off there is staying power. The Organix doesn&#x27;t last long, but you can sort of &amp;#34;re-activate&amp;#34; the voluminizing effects by scrunching your hair at the roots periodically throughout the day. NYM is just weaker, but if you don&#x27;t mind stealing away mid-day to reapply, then you shouldn&#x27;t have any kind of problem.yet advertise on their bottles, NYM does not test their products on animals and they very rarely use animal byproducts.

    <li> I use this every morning to achieve cute and effortless-looking hair.</li>
    <li> Just made my hair feel weird, did not work. I have really think dark brown hair that is already naturally curly.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. I returned it and got a prompt refund. Nothing is like John Freidas Beach Spray...the closest I found was Marc Anthony&#x27;s Beach Waves at Ulta.</li>
    <li> I dunno...I must be using it wrong?  My shorter layers sort of frizz up, while the longest layers just look a mess..not &amp;#34;carefree&amp;#34;, more like unwashed and messed up.  Even the more expensive brands just don&#x27;t do it for me.  Love the coconut scent though!</li>
    <li> Did not care for this makes my hair feel really dry and unhealthy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Makes your hair feel gross. Doesn&#x27;t give you beach waves and I naturally have wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for $4.99 at a local store (great price), wasnt expecting much so I was pleasantly surprised when I sprayed it on my damp hair and the most delicious tropical beach smell came out and onto my hair. Then when my hair did dry, it added great texture to my hair, adding incredible volume and sexy beach like waves. The tropical smell dissipates right away so it doesnt linger on your hair so you dont have to worry about being overpowering or anything. This is a must, adds great volume, beach waves, casual look effect. Would def recommend.</li>
    <li> This smells GORGEOUS - and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight hair naturally, and bought this mainly to add some body (everyone&#x27;s hair is getting bigger and bigger these days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, this added much more body than I thought it would, ESPECIALLY when backcombing. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget ladies and gents, salt dries things out. So if you&#x27;re going to use this wonderful spray frequently, just made sure you&#x27;re re-hydrating your hair by leaving your conditioner in for an extra 5 minutes on the ends, or doing an overnight treatment with the conditioner you use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Use - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Price - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this? You bet - To anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> it was fine, didn&#x27;t work on my hair</li>
    <li> Smells good, but didn&#x27;t hold texture. I bought it as a less expensive option of &amp;#34;surf spray&amp;#34; but it was a bust.</li>
    <li> I live in PA and only make it to the beach about once a year.  This product is awesome and gives your hair those cute beach waves without having to battle the crowds.  I like how the scent is also light and airy with a hint of coconut.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great. Not sticky. I prefer alittle more hold otherwise would give a 5.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair feeling dewy and gross...</li>
    <li> This is an ok product.  I have coarse hair and thought it would work better.  Smell is ok.  Not bad, not great.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a replacement for the John Frieda product for years, and unfortunately this is not it.  My hair is thick and wavy, and I use sea salt spray to perfect the waves.  This product smells great, but doesn&#x27;t keep the waves as well as some of the other products and makes my hair very dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> The bottle was broken when I got it, and the spray had spilled everywhere.  They put in a separate bag.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; works with your hair&#x27;s natural texture. I got beautiful beach waves.</li>
    <li> It really did nothing to help me achieve &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34;. Instead it left my hair with a weird texture. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME AMAZING HAIR!!! BEST PRODUCT FOR THOSE LOOSE BEACH WAVES WITHOUT GOING IN THE OCEAN. I USE MY DIFFUSER ON THIS AND HAVE NATURALLY WAVES HAIR- THIS INTENSIFIES AND MAKES IT LOOK SO GOOD. WILL BE ORDERING MORE OF THIS AND A MUST HAVE FOR ALL HAIR TYPES. MY FRIENDS WITH STRAIGHT HAIR COME OVER AND USE MINE AND IT LOOKS SO GOOD WITH THE LOOSE WAIVE.. IVE TRIED THE NEW TRESAME UNCURLED PRODUCT AND THIS PRODUCT WORKS SO MUCH BETTER AND WILL EVEN LAST YOU LONGER</li>
    <li> I tried this as an alternative to Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil Beach Wave product, as well as Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Beach Wave product. Josie Maran&#x27;s is by far my favorite, and this is the least. I need about 10 times as much to accomplish the same thing, and still doesn&#x27;t look as nice.  I think if you do the math, I&#x27;ll spend less on the more expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> Product was cheap ($4.99) where I bought it. Read the reviews that it smelled awful but took the risk anyway. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on it because it smells awful--like crayons or artificial/chemical smell, not beachy or vanilla. I&#x27;ll give it the benefit of the doubt that it may have smelled good at one point and the scent must have \\&quot;disintegrated\\&quot; on the shelf, because I can&#x27;t imagine anyone thinking this product smells appealing. Hope the manufacturer&#x27;s take care of this! Probably better making your own spray at home.</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, my hair smells, and looks fantastic it really looks like i have spent the day at the beach.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was just okay. I already have naturally wavy hair and found that this product, while does make my hair wavy, seemed to also make it a bit flat and stringy. Not as fluffy as I would like. Smells great though - lovely coconut smell.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff! Smells like coconuts, sun tan lotion and being at the beach. If I don&#x27;t have time to blo dry my hair I spritz this on, srunch my hair and go and it gives my hair a nice wave. Will definetly buy again!</li>
    <li> I smells nice and does add texture, but makes my fine hair super tangly and kind of rough to the touch.</li>
    <li> This texturizing sea spray was too sticky.  Made my hair feel like cotton candy.  Maybe people with thick hair would be better.  Not for fine hair at all</li>
    <li> This sea salt spray smells great and truly does give you that crunchy, texturized feel from the beach. The only downfall is that your hair can get knotted and pretty gnarly if you choose to brush it with the product still present. All in all, I like it because it smells good and works well for wavy hair.</li>
    <li> This product works well and provides just enough texture to give you that straight-from-the-beach look. It smells like vacation, so that helps too.</li>
    <li> Yuck. The scent starts out kind of beachy-coconut in a chemically way, but 10 minutes later morphs into something indescribably awful. I also didn&#x27;t see much texture improvement.</li>
    <li> I will admit I was hesitant after reading it dries out your hair. But, it is important not to put alot in your hair because it will also make your hair feel a little sticky. Otherwise with the right amount I think this product is great and I will buy it again! Makes my hair super volumnous! Love it!</li>
    <li> I used this after combing through my hair and was not impressed. It it just salty water. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, and I have naturally wavy/curly hair so I expected it to enhance my curls. Bummer!</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great. I put it in my hair just for the scent of it. My hair is really long and thick, so the texturizing wasn&#x27;t really there for me...but I&#x27;ll keep buying it because I love it.</li>
    <li> Made my hair flat. I have thin hair.</li>
    <li> The shipping and everything like that was perfect, but I was very disappointed when I put the product in my hair and it caused my hair to become extremely dry. I know that it works on some people, so it really matters on your type of hair. It smells amazing thought so every once and awhile I spray it in my rooms as an air freshener. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff!! I have wavy hair and if I let it dry on it&#x27;s own without anything in it it frizzes really bad. I spray this on damp hair and let it air dry, scrunching it occasionally until it&#x27;s dry. No frizzing problems and it stays soft. Doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or dirty. Highly recommend for days you don&#x27;t really want to mess with your hair too much.</li>
    <li> Love the product, great line BUT mine arrived half empty. I&#x27;ll only buy in store from now on.</li>
    <li> This gives my fine hair body but not necessarily curl, I really like the scent as well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the product.. but the bottle was damaged when I got it. The top is broken.</li>
    <li> Wanted a beach spray with a bit more sticky hold stuff so I could have the extra texture I wanted, but didn&#x27;t really have it.</li>
    <li> A favorite product of mine! Finally, non crunchy curls or waves!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my aquage sea salt texture spray. The price was great but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the performance as much as I was with my previous product. It works fine if I use a lot of it, but then it tends to dry out my scalp.</li>
    <li> Alas-- this seems to have no effect on my fine, wispy, flyaway hair. I figured it&#x27;d be perfect because the only time my hair ever has body is at the beach. But the product is fine, it smells pleasant, it&#x27;s easy to use and it seems to have worked for other people who recommended it to me. If your hair is of the eternally flat and lifeless variety, it&#x27;s worth a try, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up too much.</li>
    <li> Received broken. The trigger was broke I couldn&#x27;t use the product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, holds like spray but is 90% lighter and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair and I&#x27;ve always had trouble holding waves/curls. I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this for a while and after reading the reviews, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair was still damp, I sprayed it on very generously. The smell of the product is fantastic! Smells like coconuts and vanilla, very tropical. It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy while I was scrunching it through and it didn&#x27;t make my hair look oily afterwards. I blow dried my hair with a diffuser; when I was finished, I was left with touchably soft hair and beautiful waves. It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or stiff but my hair did feel as if there was product in it (not bad at all--like a light hairspray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, this product worked like a charm. True to it&#x27;s description, great price and it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> As a fellow former lover of John Frieda&#x27;s Beach Blonde, then follow up user of Sedu, I was totally disappointed in this product. It just goes back to, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the salt piles up on my hair. It looks dull after use, and my hair seems sort of dirty. It did not do previously-mentioned product&#x27;s great job of loose waves on my slightly wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to stock up on Sedu for this girl!</li>
    <li> this is like a light hair spray. it makes my hair feel dry, but it does give it the beachy look. but i have my hair previously in a braid before applying the product so it gives it more waves. it has a coconutty smell to it as well which i could live without, but its a good product.</li>
    <li> Smells great, adds awesome texture to wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Somehow can&#x27;t really re-create beach beautiful hair no matter what I try but this definitely adds a little natural-looking texture to my otherwise limp hair.</li>
    <li> Love love love, so good for your hair and really does leave it like you just went to the beach</li>
    <li> Came fast and worked the first time I used it, would definitely suggest using this product :) Worth the money I paid for ^o^</li>
    <li> First off, it smells good. To me, at least. And the smell isn&#x27;t overbearing after you&#x27;ve worn the stuff in your hair a few minutes. It smells a bit like coconut to me...&lt;br /&gt;As far as how well it works, I would say that it worked well for me. Beachy waves are what I naturally have (on a good hair day anyway) but in the winter, my hair flattens out because of the cold air. So I got this hoping to make my hair look the way it wants to in a sense haha... It does just that. It pumps up the volume a bit and redefines my curls/waves. It does make my hair a bit dry, but it&#x27;s not that bad. I plan on using this on days when my hair&#x27;s kinda oily because it hasn&#x27;t been washed in a couple days anyway. It doesn&#x27;t frizz up that much to me, but I sprayed my hair upside down instead of directly on top.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is pretty nice. The nozzle has a lock so you don&#x27;t accidentally spray after you&#x27;re done with it and waste product. Shipping was standard...I ordered it on a Friday, it shipped on Monday and I got it that Wednesday.ir&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this would work well with medium thickness hair, like mine. If your hair is really thin it might just dry your hair out and make it straw like, but you never know. If you have realllyyy thick hair, it will probably do next to nothing. Try it out, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s super expensive. I wish I could find this stuff where I live because it would be cheaper then... :/</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have fine hair and my stylist recommended a sea salt spray for adding texture and volume to my hair. I found this product at a local department store but they haven&#x27;t carried it lately. After searching local stores with no luck I found it here and promptly ordered it.  If you have fine hair and want to add texture and volume this is a great product. The fragrance reminds me of the tropics. A combination of coconut and flowers.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings on this one. I use different volumizing sprays and seem to get more &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; when drying my fine, straight hair with a diffuser. This smells good and leaves no residue, but I really don&#x27;t notice the beachy waves. Although this is much cheaper, I will probably just stick with my Bumble and Bumble thickening spray and scrunching it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting to get nocely textured waves, however it did quite the opposite. This spray had no effect on my hair whatsoever, all it did was make it feel dirty and grimy. I ended up making my own salt hair spray with sea salt, coconut oil and water and that worked out much better for me. Total disappointment</li>
    <li> This really works great! Use it on top of Not Your Mother&#x27;s Kinky Moves Curl Defining Hair Cream  and it provides soft beachy defined curls not a frizzy mess.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing I love it</li>
    <li> I liked it alright it does smell great i just dont like how dry my hair feels after i use it i hate anything sticky or weird feeling on my hair. Not bad though it makes your hair look wavy and beachy look for sure</li>
    <li> I do not understand all the reviews claiming that this product smells great. Maybe I received an old one or something, but I thought it smelled disgusting (I sprayed it on and could not stand it for the rest of the day). I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it out. To me, it was not a \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; smell as others claim, but rather something that I can only describe as \\&quot;bad chocolate.\\&quot; Additionally, it made my hair feel as dry and crispy as it&#x27;s ever felt, absolutely disgusting. My boyfriend hated the feel and smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those who have longed for the return of John Frieda&#x27;s beach spray, and this is definitely no replacement. I tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Beach Spray instead, and that one is much better (my hair is still soft and smells good).</li>
    <li> it says it&#x27;s supposed to make your hair wavy and beach looking it doesn&#x27;t do any of that for my hair</li>
    <li> Smells artificial and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This product works so well on my hair! It gives it an after beach look that&#x27;s not overly curly. Plus it has a coconutty smell which is lovely</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel dry doesn&#x27;t really wave it</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and this product definitely makes my hair more wavy to almost curly. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of complements on my hair when using this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great. It&#x27;s a lot  cheaper on other websites  or in stores. It makes your hair wavy but it takes away the soft silkiness</li>
    <li> Love this texturizing spray!!! My hair stylist recommended me this product and for sure I will continue using it. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> This really does smell like coconuts! I saw this on Pinterest and it described it as smelling like cocnuts and the beach and they were exactly right!</li>
    <li> I can wash my hair at night, spray it, go to bed, and wake up looking like I slept at the beach :) The vanilla smell grows on you. Just don&#x27;t get spray happy, because too much will leave your hair greasy!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local drugstore to try after hearing people rave about more expensive versions. I expected it would work well, but I ended up loving it so much that I almost never blow dry my hair any more. My hair is long and thick, but not straight OR curly. I spray this on damp hair and scrunch it around a bit and let it go, I end up with texture but not puffiness. I do still have a little frizz, so if I&#x27;m planning to go out I&#x27;ll add a little gel to the ends to keep them from getting too frizzy, but it works great alone too.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair, I wash it about every other day, and I rarely have time to blow dry or heat style. This product has not only helped me tolerate my second-day hair, but actually made it look better than the day it was washed! It plays up the waves and gives volume, and feels and smells great. I was curious about this type of product, so I bought this as a trial and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for a salon brand.</li>
    <li> Interesting product if you have fine hair with no volume. Great product. Strongly recommended. It cheap and makes your hair looks great. Strongly recommended for everyone.</li>
    <li> Wish I had more of it!! smells incredible and it actually works, it also sprays very well and never gets clogged! received the package on time as well.</li>
    <li> Curls are tricky. What works for one person leaves the next with a ball of friz. That said, this works perfectly for my hair. I put a little argan oil, a little of this spray, and my curls are light, bouncy, frizz free, and have a great texture. And it smells amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair with loose curls. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and alway looking for a new product and boy did I find a crappy one. I tried this spay out and I don&#x27;t think I have ever used a crappier product. It immediately dried my hair out and made it impossible to comb. I think I would have better luck brushing an old mop. If your looking for a product for DIY dredlock making this is definitely the product for you. The only reason I like this product is that it gave a reason to really clean my hair- it took me 2 showers before I completely got this liquid road salt out of my hair. I think this product should be used for treating the roads during a snow storm instead of road salt.</li>
    <li> Love it. Third time I have purchased it.  My daughter turned me on to it and she was absolutely right about it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. It does have a great smell. I have long naturally curly hair, goes to the middle of my back. It&#x27;s winter and really dry right now. Seems to make my hair kind of frizzy. I think this would be better for my after I get done swimming. Or if I add some gloss drops/serum may help.</li>
    <li> I read good reviews about this product, so I had high expectations...but they fell flat (just like my hair)!!  I have naturally wavy/curly hair that holds well with a lot of product (mousse, gel &amp; hair spray...then dried w/ a diffuser), but since my hair is very fine it doesn&#x27;t dry/hold well on it&#x27;s own.  When I went to Hawaii &amp; had ocean water in my hair, it held it&#x27;s curl perfectly without product &amp; I had high hopes that this sea salt spray would do the same.  I was wrong...it did not hold my curl/waves hardly at all.  At least it smelled great, though!!</li>
    <li> Words cant explain how amazing this product is. Hair is full! Hair is wavy. Smells great! Product is not tested on animals. What used to take 4 products to get my hair to do this.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine, blonde, straight hair.  It has some curve or wave to it naturally, so I was hoping this product would enhance what I have and hold it.  I would say it did hold my hair to look like I naturally air dried it, and eliminated the weird fuzzy ends that typically happen when I use nothing.  However, it didn&#x27;t enhance the wave, so my hair looked mostly flat and blah.  I have tried using it to add texture to my hair before I blow dry it though, and it helps with holding the shape after I round brush so that I don&#x27;t have to use any hairspray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sea salt texturizing sprays, some that cost way too much for a bottle of what is essentially fake sea water with some additives!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one comes in a large bottle (some others come with barely any and run out so quickly!) and a spray nozzle that&#x27;s easy to use and mists your hair pretty effectively, rather than squirting it on too heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell funky or have an overpowering perfumey scent and does what it implies! It texturizes and gives your hair that \\&quot;just returned from the beach\\&quot; look without feeling clumpy, sticky or stiff in any way. Sometimes when I don&#x27;t have time to flat iron or curl my hair, I&#x27;ll let it dry almost completely, spray some of this on until my hair is damp again, scrunch it up with my fingers and go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, past my shoulder-length hair that can&#x27;t hold a curl to save its life. This at least adds some natural messiness to it, the good kind (if you weren&#x27;t going for the slightly disheveled look, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be looking at this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also really great for refreshing style on unwashed hair. I used to always wear my hair the day after washing it. Now I spray a bunch of this on, tousle it up and voila! Good bed-head instead of I&#x27;m wearing a hat today bed-head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sticking with this one for sure - they also make a handy travel size!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this spray online ( I believe I got it at target on sale), but I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s a texurizing spray that adds body to your hair, without it feeling heavy or sticky. It smells wonderful, and as cliche as it sounds, it smells like the beach when you spray it on. It&#x27;s perfect if you have long hair and you want a textured sexy beach wave, but also if you have short hair (Like myself) and you want an egdy &#x27;umpf&#x27; to your regular style. Nice bottle, Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells good but makes my hair feel dirty rather than textured. Does provide some volume though, mostly just a messy look.</li>
    <li> Works on my hair perfectly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this spray before, with limited success. I bought it again the other day on a whim (It was on sale for $4.99 at Walgreens), and realized that I was completely using it wrong the first time I bought it, and I actually love this product. The way I use it is in damp/dry, or second-day hair: I separate my hair into two sections, spray with this spray, comb through, twirl both sections away from my face around my finger, and diffuse. Instant sexy hair! Personally, I like the smell, but I could see how some people might not like it, as it&#x27;s a bit coconut-y...to me it smells like the beach! Luckily, it dies down a lot once it&#x27;s dried. I love the volume and texture this product gives my hair. If you&#x27;ve tried this product and don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;d suggest trying it again, twirling your (dry or nearly dry) hair in sections and blowing it dry with a diffuser. It works just as well as Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Surf Spray!</li>
    <li> How can anyone give this a bad review! This is a great product and I love the smell, also the conditioner. Your hair does not get stiff like some reviews that I have read. Maybe they are mixing it with other hair products. I use this alone after the conditioner. By far the best sea salt texturing spray!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes your hair beachy without having to jump in the ocean water. Will definetly buy more. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff for my hair first. My hair is a little on the wavy side but I usually straighten it so my ends were starting to look fried. I love it, my hair curls and looks natural. It does leave a little bit of a \\&quot;crunch,\\&quot; but I like it. I haven&#x27;t straightened my hair for weeks. I started using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (they are 8 and 4 years old) and once again ...BEAUTIFUL RESULTS! I recommended it to about 3 people so far - they complimented my curls and I shared the secret!</li>
    <li> My first encounter with this spray met all my expectations. Easy to spray. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I had beachy waves all day. But after that initial use, it&#x27;s like the formula completely changed. My hair just feels crunchy and almost dirty when I use it. Instead of creating waves, it creates tangles. All I want to do is go home and wash my hair when I have this product in. I&#x27;m going to give it another go during the summer when that won&#x27;t really bug me (beach days or outdoorsy days) but I would not recommend for every day use or any time you need to look remotely presentable.</li>
    <li> I have long colored hair and this product just made it dry and sticky, not cute at all! I will not be buying again</li>
    <li> I have fine long  hair and this just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. Smells really nice, but just makes a mess of  my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hair looks amazing when I use!!! The best so far for beach waves ; )</li>
    <li> My hair is very wavy, so in the summertime I hardly ever style it; I just let it air dry. A couple years ago, I started looking for a good wave-enhancing spray to even out the parts of my hair that are less wavy than others. I started out using one that smelled great, but was more like a spray gel that made my hair stiff and crunchy, and the residue made my scalp break out. I mentioned that I wanted a good wave spray that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and my friend recommended this spray. I have to say, I&#x27;m in love! It&#x27;s an amazing spray that brings out the natural wave of my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it stiff or crunchy at all. My hair stays wavy and soft all day. It also smells amazing; the coconut smell reminds my girls of &amp;#34;the beach&amp;#34;, which is pretty perfect, given the name of this product.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well, my hair usually does not get any kind of curl in it but with this product it did a little bit.. Also smells good! For people with semi curly hair to start, this product would be for you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it was about half the price of other sea salt hair sprays. I believed it is moderately good at its job as a texturizing spray from the initial application, but I could not stomach the smell of it. It reminded me of the fluoride paste treatments I received from the dentist. It&#x27;s as strong as it is unpleasant, so I had to wash it out before I could find out how effective it is just as a hair product once my damp hair dried out.</li>
    <li> I got this yesterday ad the bottle was all wet cause it leaked all over, which isn&#x27;t really a product issue. but because it leaked all over, the smell of the product was obvious and it wasn&#x27;t good. I didn&#x27;t like it at all. I washed my hair last night and used it and it didn&#x27;t do anything that just plain water wouldn&#x27;t do. I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all; don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This beach spray is awesome!  Not only does it work well with my hair( which is thick and long) but it smells amazing too  I love that it&#x27;s a most and not a spray!</li>
    <li> Usually my hair is really soft. But after using this ( Perhaps i used too much)  My hair felt and looked dry... easily reversed with argan oil, but it was annoying. My hair is naturally wavy, but its one giant wave without seperation, for what i wanted this product to do ( seperate), it worked great. It also did define my waves. Packaging is adorable, and for the price, its only got a small kink in the fact it is drying. Smells like coconut and the beach shore, minus the smell of dead fiah. Haha. Really do reccomend getting some argan oil or rehydrator, though.[[ASIN:B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]]</li>
    <li> I really like it :) it gives a nice texture to the hair, and I actually think it smells like the beach.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t only smell good and look good but it works i have alomst pin straght hair and it gives it nice waves. The smell is of a beautiful coconut and will bring you right back to feeling like you just came back from the beach. Amazing product I never want to go without it again!!!</li>
    <li> But it doesn&#x27;t really work that well on my hair. I have super super straight and thick hair and I literally put a whole days worth into my hair. And it gave me a little frizz but not like complete beach waves.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it smells great and everything shipping wise was perfect! I just have very complicated and stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product as I have naturally curly hair and am always trying to keep it under control :) The application is nice, a good spray, and it does smell like the beach! Like salt (right, who would&#x27;ve thought?) It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy. Love the formula, it keep my curls separated and cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative is that the salt smell can be a little overwhelming, which surprised me as I&#x27;m not too picky about scents. Also, be really careful if you&#x27;re going to work out that day and have this in your hair. I sprayed it on in the morning and had an intense Zumba class in the evening. I could taste the spray; it was insane! It kind of reminds me of when you ate play-doh for the first time (and last) when you were little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, a great product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about time someone put out a product that doesn&#x27;t cost $75 for a 1oz  bottle. This spray smells JUST LIKE the beach. One reviewer said sunscreen and that is exactly what I would compare it to. It smells like you slathered sunscreen on your body and you&#x27;ve been laying out at the beach all day. While no product can compare to actually laying at the beach (remember, part of that tousled look is actual wind and the elements you are exposed to at the beach) this product comes very close. I didn&#x27;t go in to the product expecting my hair to naturally lift itself off my shoulders in a fit of glee and curl into spirals because I shot salt water on it, I expected it to look tousled and disheveled just like my hair does when I go to the beach. It did this. Perfectly. It stimulates whatever your hair looks like in reality when you go to the beach. For those of you expecting miracles, again, no product can stimulate ALL of the elements, but it really does do a great job of giving you that tousled look. I just spray it on after letting my hair air dry a little and then let it air dry again. Every time I use it, I like it more due to how soft and whispy it makes my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great product and I LOVE the smell since it feels like I&#x27;m at the beach. Now to take off work and go! :)</li>
    <li> Totally recommend this product... I was skeptical before buying it but I purchased it based off other peoples reviews and I have to say I&#x27;m extremely impressed. And yes it smells wonderful and it&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> This definitely gives you the dirty, gritty feeling. Maybe a little too much? I was used to using Phyto Organics Sea Swell which has been discontinued so I tried this. Not as impressed, but does do what it says, I just didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and no product has ever come close to giving my hair body, texture, and movement the way this product does!  I want to buy it in BULK quantities!!!  Great smell too!  It really I like having just back from the beach hair!</li>
    <li> I have tried many high end sea salt sprays and always returned them because they don&#x27;t work. This product works and smells great! I always start by spraying my entire head when it&#x27;s wet out of the shower then scrunch it up. I wait until it dries a bit more (get dressed/do makeup) then I spray a few times again and scrunch and I&#x27;m done. I get beachy waves without the beach and without heat styling.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I use this every day, I LOVE how my hair looks with it! Like I just got done swimming in the ocean. I use it as soon as I get out of the shower, by spraying it on my hair and then scrunching it and letting it air dry. Others use it on dry hair, damp hair, scrunched and not scrunched. It&#x27;s easy to figure out which way you like it best. It smells amazing, too!</li>
    <li> I always wanted to try a sea salt spray but was worried the salt would dry my hair out too much.  Not so with this product!  In fact, I think my hair my actually feel BETTER after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it has a coconut smell to it, but I don&#x27;t notice that much at all.  It goes on nicely and adds texture to my hair without the stringiness or frizziness you sometimes see in products.  My hair still feels soft the next day and there seems to be no affect of this salt spray on my coloured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try and will be ordering again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million different products for my half curly, half wavy, half frizzy hair. Anything made for moisturizing curls, like gels and creams, turned my hair kinda flat or made the curls not so curly. This product boosts the curl like crazy! I use it all over and then finish with my favorite oil on the ends, really helps amp up the volume and add bounce. It has a pleasant smell as well, kinda like cupcakes.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the smell of this product but it tangled my hair, I have thick hair so I think it&#x27;s best if you have thick hair to stay away from this product...</li>
    <li> Great product. I get better results when I use it when my hair is wet instead of dry. Def try this product!</li>
    <li> So bad it made me post a review.  It makes your hair feel dirty doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell though. My hair is thin and wavy I thought this product would make it I look more wayvy nope didnt notice any difference it felt yucky and it started irritating My skin (face) u know when u style your hair down it tends to get in ur face well yea it started irritating my face. Don&#x27;t buy this trust me!</li>
    <li> I have hair that is so thin and fine, I have to work hard so one can&#x27;t see my scalp. I was intrigued about this product at first, but after reading the reviews, I decided to try it as a volumizer rather than going after &amp;#34;beachy waves.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I followed label directions, washing my hair, toweling it to a very damp state, and spritzing liberally all over my head. Using a diffuser, I dried my hair. Boy, did I have a head of hair!! Not hair that I would want to wear out anywhere, but I had a huge head of hair. I styled as usual with my Babyliss straightener, and I have the fullest head of hair I have ever had, well, maybe since 1973 when I was young and had a Farrah cut. If you have fine, thin hair, give this a try. I gave the product 4 stars rather than 5 since I used it for a purpose other than its original intent.</li>
    <li> 1) It does what it claims: provide beach texture to your hair. Make sure you know what is beach texture hair, it&#x27;s not WAVE or CURL. if your natural hair has curl, so it&#x27;s ok, use this, and it will give you the curl. but I have straight hair so it does not make my hair curly.&lt;br /&gt;2) It has a great beach - coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;3) I know I am not comparing apple to apple, but if in cause you are like me, looking for product to create volume (because usually when you are at the beach, hair got more volume) I think this is quite good compare to other hair volumizer I had tried: L&#x27;Oreal, Vidal Sassoon, Tressemme, Pantene, bed head, Schwarzkopf powder.</li>
    <li> Like it, don&#x27;t love it. Leaves my hair smelling a LOT like salt and seaweed. To be fair, that&#x27;s what it advertises, but the smell is overwhelming at times. It probably my thick, super straight asian hair, but it doesn&#x27;t texturize like i thought it would. I&#x27;ve tried teasing my hair, blow drying it, adding other products, but at the end of the day, my hair is straight. The quest continues for a great texture spray.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product !&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I going to buy another one : ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tks.&lt;br /&gt;Vanessa</li>
    <li> i love this texturizing spray.  I have thick, mostly straight (it has body and tiny bit of waves but is frizzy if I let it air dry with waves) hair that does not hold a curl or wave without tons of hair spray.  With this spray however, my hair has full, soft waves without frizz, crunch or shine. I am obsessed and have told all my friends and my sister to buy this stuff immediately!  I have tried the Paul Mitchell version at my salon.  I did like the waves I had with that too, but it was a little stickier in my hair.  I will definitely be buying this again and again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and this spray gives me that tousled cute look without fuss.&lt;br /&gt;Just wash your hair and spray, finger wave and let it dry ...beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning you can just spray and finger wave and let dry ....looks great!!!&lt;br /&gt;It honest to goodness gives you that been to the beach look without the sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it smells wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I&#x27;m and old gal with gray hair...just in case you young girls think it is just for you :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic sent, great sculpting and overall fun product to use!</li>
    <li> My wife recently decided to get bangs and the salon tried to sell her overpriced product. She purchased this instead and is thrilled with it</li>
    <li> This beach spray rocks! I love the look it provides and still holds a fairly good wave! Great product and smells good too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fine with this product. I like the smell and how it gives body to my hair. I&#x27;m a former beach resident of many years, so the effect of course isn&#x27;t the same, but it&#x27;s close enough. Living Thousands of miles from the beach now, I&#x27;m happy to just see the bottle!</li>
    <li> not great. I was hoping for more. I followed instructions. if I go to bed with my hair wet and spray this on, I get a nice beach wave but messy. If I do it in day it comes out kinda limp. I have really long straight coarse hair so maybe its the length. I tried it, its eh.</li>
    <li> You can buy this at Walmart for 3 dollars. It&#x27;s great though.</li>
    <li> I love this salt spray! it is very light and smells so good. The item arrived very fast. I will certanly order again with this company!!</li>
    <li> Love the product but amazons price is way to high</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally wavy/ moderately curly hair, and I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I&#x27;m just stupid and cannot work a hair product, but it made my hair feel super dry and there was very little definition. I&#x27;ve tried other curl sprays before and they all worked better than this stuff. I ended up washing my hair right afterwards, (after i had just washed it before i applied the product). I have never written a review for anything before, but this product made me write one. The smell to me isnt that bad, when you first spray it it smells a little bad, like stale coconut, but after it dries (and dries out your hair) it doesn&#x27;t really smell at all.</li>
    <li> Love that beach hair look, and now a few quick sprays, and there it is without stiff, sticky hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> Salt is very alkaline and will dry out your hair. I would never use this product because it contains sea salt as a primary ingredient.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, try putting baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) on your hair and see what happens. Better yet, just take my word for it cause you will not even believe how bad your hair can look when you put something alkaline like salt on it. A lot of people here have claimed this product dries their hair and that&#x27;s what I would expect. Instead, I recommend Marc Anthony Dream Waves Beach Spray, which claims to be the #1 selling beach spray. Don&#x27;t buy it on Amazon because the vendor here is charging $25.49 for it which is exhorbitant and really a ripoff.  Buy it at Walgreens instead for just $8.99 for 4.2 oz. Technically, I don&#x27;t think it should be called a beach spray because it contains no salt, but it has changed my life.  I used to curl my ends every morning, put them in rollers and blow dry which took over an hour and flattened the rest of my hair out due to the weight of the rollers.  Now I just put some of this stuff on my ends, roll them around with my fingers and watch my ends go from ratty to pretty with soft waves.  The end result is not as nice as with rollers, but it takes me 5 minutes instead of an hour or more.  One of the best parts is the rest of my hair stays full and thick because I&#x27;m not using heavy rollers anymore.  This product does no damage at all to my hair, it doesn&#x27;t dry it or anything.  I even accidentally sprayed it on my sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother me. I love Dream Waves Beach Spray and think there&#x27;s a good reason it&#x27;s the #1 selling beach spray.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work on my hair at all. I&#x27;ve got medium thickness hair and all it did was make my hair dry and tangly. The ONLY plus was that it smelled amazing.</li>
    <li> bought this for my girlfriend because she wanted to do something different with her hair. Now she wears it down and this product really helps her hairs natural wave. great product</li>
    <li> Did not work very well--just made hair sticky and gross. My hair has natural suddle waves in it and the spray practically destroyed them.</li>
    <li> I have always had long hair, and bought this before I chopped off 9 inches. I was worried that this product would no longer be useful because of my short above shoulder length hair. But I love the texture it gives my hair!! Even on straight hair it makes my hair&#x27;s layers more defined. This is such a fun product, I can&#x27;t wait to try it with my naturally wavy hair!</li>
    <li> I love this hair product. I love the cost, the smell, the feel and the product.  I live in South Florida and I am outdoors often. I find myself constantly spraying this product on my hair to keep my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually not going to complain about the effectiveness of this product. I have thick, naturally wavy hair and this product compliments it beautifully. It adds the perfect, beachy texture. No, it doesn&#x27;t feel perfect and smooth in your hair, but it&#x27;s not supposed to. After a day at the beach, I doubt anyone&#x27;s hair is feeling lustrous. What I AM going to complain about is the smell. It. Smells. Terrible. And I was shocked when I came on here to read the reviews because the big majority are saying it smells wonderful. Maybe after so long it starts to stink or some of their products are defective. Either way, the issue needs to be fixed. I will be throwing this away based on the smell alone, which sucks because I like the texture it adds to my hair. Want to know what it smells like? Garlic. I&#x27;m sitting at work right now and all I smell is garlic and I can only hope that my coworkers won&#x27;t notice, they&#x27;ll think I binged on a garlicky meal last night and didn&#x27;t shower!</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice now and although it does create waves, they&#x27;re not as &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; as I would like.  My hair is naturally straight though so it would probably work better for someone with naturally wavy hair.  Smells great though!</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this because it had such good reviews. It ended up not working for my hair because it&#x27;s too thick to hold any texture :/ but it works for my sister&#x27;s thinner hair so it&#x27;s still getting used. And it smells good haha</li>
    <li> Gave these as gifts to my friends. They loved it! It smells like coconuts ❤️ overall, the best smelling saltwater spray I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local Target for cheaper than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, i have thick natural blonde hair, its half curly and half straight and is really frizzy until ive slept on it which calms it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product after misting/spraying my hair with water. I then scrunched and tossed my hair and left it naturally dry. It dried really soft and natural.&lt;br /&gt;I then wanted to add a little more on my now dry hair and then i saw what other reviewers complained about. Putting it on dry hair left it hard and sticky and very very dry. I love what the product did but only on WET hair NOT DRY.&lt;br /&gt;I would try using this product multiple ways to see what fits you the best before deciding that it doesnt work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it added some nice waves and curls and also smells really good!</li>
    <li> have this at  home and i love it .</li>
    <li> If you are looking for pretty curls this is not the product for you... but if you just want some added texture and good smells it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look fab. A real &amp;#34;straight from the black&amp;#34; look. I love it. Hope I can get it in England too.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. This dried my hair and made it stiff, and it doesn&#x27;t smell great nor does it keep my waves from frizzing. I&#x27;d spend extra and get the Unite Beach Spray or AG Beach Bomb if you prefer a cream. Also Organix makes a pretty good paste if you&#x27;re not willing to spend much.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It smells great, very beachy.  Although it doesn&#x27;t create waves in my very straight and fine hair, it adds tons of volume and texture.  I love the way it looks.  When I curl my hair this product helps the curls hold.  I find that it&#x27;s most effective applied to dry hair.  When I put it in wet hair and comb through like the directions advise it doesn&#x27;t seem to really make any difference. The only thing is that it&#x27;s much cheaper at Target and Walmart, so I would only order it off of Amazon if you can&#x27;t get to the store.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing but make my beachy waves stiff, smell like the beach and fuzzy. My waves do Much better with just a little mousse and hairspray than using this at all.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, curly, frizzy, nappy hair. This product is wonderful! I did have to use a good bit but there is no frizz, it&#x27;s in wonderful waves (not curls). I am addicted!!!! I will have beach hair in the winter lol.</li>
    <li> I love the product. I love the smell. However, the first bottle I bought came with a broken neck and I had to transfer to another spray bottle. The sprayer also broke on the second bottle I bought. So, while the product is good, faulty packaging makes it difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Super strong smell of coconut. Did nothing for my hair. I think you have to have some natural curl to begin with.</li>
    <li> Background: I have medium length hair that has never held a curl in it&#x27;s life. Long, short, any way I have it, my hair doesn&#x27;t curl. It does this nasty slight wave thing that is just awful. And it is so thick, a hot sunny day turns me into Mufasa from Lion King. I have been forced to straighten all these years, and even then on a humid day in Oklahoma, my hair freaks out back to it&#x27;s wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to do something else with my hair besides straightening every single day, I decided to grab this up at my local Target. I would&#x27;ve bought it here but it wasn&#x27;t on prime and it was only like $5 at Target. Morning comes and I wash (with John Frida Frizz Ease) and condition. put my hair in a towel for 15 minutes, and then spray this all over my hair and slighty scrunch. I blow dried on slow setting, kind of scrunching as I went. It wasn&#x27;t 100% dry, I let air do the rest. I added a middle part with my rat tail comb. When I got finished, I sprayed a little bit more for a good \\&quot;setting\\&quot;, and then flipped my hair and added a little hair spray for volume (kind of flattening out when I flipped it back up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT LOOKED AWESOME. Nice, fluffy, wavy waves! Not frizzy, not flat, and actually the cute kind of curly! I got so many compliments (I&#x27;m sure everyone noticed because I actually did something different!). I am no longer stuck in the straight hair rut. I can make my hair curly and cute, wavy and fun, without looking like I spent 3 hours on a curling iron date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use this again!</li>
    <li> This product worked well but it dryed out my hair so much. I could&#x27;nt stand it, it stripped any color that I had and it made my hair looks so very dry. It does smell good and it does give a wave but that dryness that it causes is awful.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while back, and it says apply to damp or dry hair, and blow dry. I&#x27;ve sprayed this is evenly, and it just makes my hair stringy and very dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a new, good sea spray.  My favorite is actually Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray, but $27 for a small bottle is a bit ridiculous. Especially because I have a lot of hair. I was looking for a cheaper alternative and this one had pretty good reviews. Well this made my hair feel gross, smell bad and look frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and could never find a product that actually defined my curls and separated them, only product that made it crunchy and half curled after I was done. I LOVE this stuff! I used the spray and them the texturizing cream and I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. Now, I&#x27;m fine with leaving my hair curly every now and then. I will be careful to make sure it doesn&#x27;t begin to dry out my hair... I heard that can happen???? Otherwise zero complaints so far. Awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this, as I have thin, not quite shoulder length, straight-ish hair.  I say straight-ish because if I don&#x27;t blow dry it straight to style it gets a weird kink to it and that&#x27;s not something I would leave the house with.  All summer I was sweating my butt off drying my hair and then I saw this at my local Ulta and picked it up.  I haven&#x27;t had much luck with the other two brands of beach spray I&#x27;ve tried so I was a little skeptical.  However I have to say that this does the job and finally I don&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair in the summer heat.  It leaves my layers looking textured and wavy and the three days I&#x27;ve used it I have gotten compliments on my new &amp;#34;do.&amp;#34;  I use a generous amount but I don&#x27;t over do it.  I haven&#x27;t had any dry or tangled issues some of the other reviewers have.  It has a nice clean smell too.</li>
    <li> Gives me the textured beachy look I love!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday! I love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It smells awesome and helps create gentle beachy waves.</li>
    <li> This is really awesome stuff!  But you have to want that beachy look.  You need the right weather for it to work also.  I have curly hair by the way.</li>
    <li> This is a fun product! The goal is to create the look and feel of just of the beach hair, and Beach Babe does just that. Adds texture and volume, with somewhat of matte finish. Great aromatics - contains sea salt and kelp extracts which mimic the smell of the ocean very well. Somewhat strong additional scent, but replicates a suntan lotion aroma. Head to the beach with this one!</li>
    <li> i bought this a while ago and don&#x27;t often use it. the main reason is that my hair is naturally slightly frizzy but the spray made it worse, and made my hair very dry. but it did give it a good wave. i think it works best when my hair is SLIGHTLY damp. this product is very long lasting, which is a good thing. but really its the frizz i get thats a deal breaker for me. i still use it ocasionaly but i think it would look much better for someone with thinker, speaker hair</li>
    <li> I like this product. My only issue was getting the tabby off of it to use it. And I kind of broke it but figured out how to work it anyways. The other con I have is it makes my hands feel salty after I have used it. Also, I have seen this product offered at Wal-Mart now as well for cheaper.</li>
    <li> Nice but not stiff enough for placement</li>
    <li> I received an empty bottle and wet shipping labels.</li>
    <li> Does what is says it will. Not crazy about smell. Doesn&#x27;t make curls just waves. Saw it at cvs for half the price.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, frizzy, long, and wavy hair naturally. I bought this product thinking it would help the frizz and make it look like that beachy wave because it says it on the bottle. I absolutely hate it, it left my hair crunchy and it also made it feel really dirty after I used it. My frizz was still uncontrollable and I immediately had to wash it again because of how my hair looked and felt afterwards. This product would be really good for people who have a little natural wave to their hair and want it to be more defined but for people who have really frizzing and curly hair this isn&#x27;t the right product to use. The only good thing I have to say about it is that it smells good.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, doesn&#x27;t work that great on wet hair, you can really tell its in there when you blow dry or have dry hair when spraying it on.</li>
    <li> I have fine, slick, straight hair. I mean STICK strait. It is also extremely thick. All of these factors combine to make it nearly impossible for my hair to hold a curl (especially when it&#x27;s humid. And I live in Alabama, so it&#x27;s almost always humid). My mom bought me a sample of this, I think just because she knew how much I would like the smell, and honestly I had no intentions of using it as a texturizing spray because I knew it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me. On a whim, I tried it one night when I had plans to curl my hair. I spritzed it on air-dried, clean hair and proceeded to us my curling iron. My curls looked AWESOME, but owing to experience, I assumed it wouldn&#x27;t last for more than an hour and a half. I went to an outdoor party and stayed for about four hours. By the time I got home, I STILL had perfect curls in my hair. I even slept on it and woke up with it looking nearly perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I didn&#x27;t use it explicitly as it is recommended, but for my hair type, this spray worked miracles for giving my hair the right texture to hold curls. And it smelled AMAZING. I wish I&#x27;d known about this years earlier.</li>
    <li> The people who are giving this product poor reviews perhaps didn&#x27;t use it with the intended purpose. This is sea salt texturizing spray. It&#x27;s meant to give your hair the same texture you get while at the beach. It&#x27;s not a scrunching or styling spray, it&#x27;s a *texturing* spray. If you have frizzy hair naturally, I would assume adding texture to your frizz would just cause a nightmare to style. And if you&#x27;re looking to get *curls* out of it, you&#x27;re going to be out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve said for years that I wish there was a way to take home beach hair, and my wishes were finally answered. This is truly the next best thing (cause, let&#x27;s face it, nothing really beats beach hair while at the beach... Especially with a margarita in hand!)... I first found this while scanning the hair care aisle of Walgreens for a dry shampoo. I had never heard of NYM&#x27;s brand, but the labeling caught my eye, and then I say this sea salt texturizing spray directly next to it and may have actually squealed out loud in the store. I was a little skeptical, but for $5, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my next shampoo, I gave it a shot. I sprayed it through my hair, combed through with a wide-tooth comb, tousled my hair with a dry towel to soak up excess moisture and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Then I blowdryed with a diffuser until mostly dry (just slightly damp). I didn&#x27;t use a brush, just tousled with my hands the entire time. I set my hair in place with my fingers, used a little hairspray to set it, and then used a tiny dollop of anti-frizz serum, and voila! loose beach waves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great texture spray, just use it for its intended purpose.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to pick up a bottle of this stuff whilst strolling through the isles of my local Walmart.  A few days before this, my hairdresser had told me that I should pick up a texturizing spray to give my hair some extra lift and volume.  I picked up this spray, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  Firstly, I am absolutely addicted to the smell.  It&#x27;s very tropical, yet somewhat vanilla-y.  If they made the smell of this beach spray into a perfume, I would probably wear it.  Now I will go through my routine.  My hair is extremely damaged because of all of the bleaching, dying, and straightening I&#x27;ve put my hair through throughout the years.  Because of this, my hair doesn&#x27;t have the same wavy texture that it used to.  I used to have thick, wavy hair but now my hair is thin, frayed, and lack-luster.  With this spray, I can finally wear my hair the way that it used to be.  If I feel like wearing my hair in beachy waves for the day, I&#x27;ll take a shower in the morning, towel-dry it, add some mousse (doesn&#x27;t matter which kind, seems to work the same with all of them), blowdry my hair for a minute or two, add some gel, blowdry my hair upside down for a few minutes, and when my hair is almost dry, but still a bit damp, I add this spray.  The spray acts as a hairspray by holding together the waves from the mousse and gel, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling crunchy.  It makes my hair soft, wavy, and it smells yummy!  It also makes my hair feel thicker and more volumized.  Just a warning, if you are going to be wearing your hair down, don&#x27;t apply this to the bottom layer of your hair (near your neck).  I find that wearing this spray causes my hair to get tangled more easily and if you aren&#x27;t careful, the back of your head can turn into a rats nest.  Other than that, the spray is great!</li>
    <li> When I first used this product I loved it..It smells really good and beachy when you first spray it on and it added texture and body to my hair..I didn&#x27;t even have to use hairspray it left softness with a boucy natural hold..This is the reason I will never ever use it again...I didn&#x27;t mind it drying out my hair a little that is what sea salt does..The wonderful beachy smell turns to a horrible strong chemical smell, alot like play dough! I even asked my boyfriend and he thought the exact same thing...So strong and nasty I can never wear it again</li>
    <li> i gotit quickly, but this product was pretty much as it says but i really was excited too use it smells great! but made myhair a little stiff i buit i don&#x27;t know if i put it on right but it worked</li>
    <li> This product has sea salt and you have to shake it up but it does make beautiful just from the beach hair.. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have shoulder length, dark, naturally wavy hair and it brings out the best in it! It is not too sticky at all and has a great coconut scent.</li>
    <li> I use this product like crazy. Gives me perfect beach like waves. So easy to use. I let my hair just air dry after and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> This spray is awesome.  I love the smell and the feeling.  I use it then let my hair air dry.  The next day I don&#x27;t wash my hair and then style it (with a curler or straight iron).  The shape holds for 48 hours!  I love this spray!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this sea salt spray (and I&#x27;ve tried Bumble+bumble and Lush&#x27;s). What a steal and smells amazing!</li>
