      <li>My mom loved all the varieties of creams you get with this.</li>
      <li>I wear gloves when I use this lotion, since it is scented AND fairly slippery, but it is also tremendously effective.</li>
      <li>Lovely!</li>
      <li>Nothing I ever purchased at the drug store ever came close to being effective.  </li>
      <li>IN MY FEET IS NOT SO EFFECTIVE</li>
      <li>i LOVE THIS CREAM I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 12 YEARS</li>
      <li>It is not greasy, and it works better than anything even prescribed by a doctor.</li>
      <li>I use it every day but more so in the winter.  </li>
      <li>Love this hand cream.</li>
      <li>After many winters of limping around with sore cracked heels I found this product.</li>
      <li>No-Crack Cream is simply the best.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of this product.</li>
      <li>I wish it were more widely available.</li>
      <li>The all purpose cream has a scent too strong for me to use, so I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness.</li>
      <li>I do recommend the FRAGRANCE FREE cream.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>There are none of these stores where I live now, so was delighted to find it on Amazon and at such a good price.  </li>
      <li>It REALLY works!  :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now started to use the unfragranced cream on my knees, elbows and heels with great success - I only wish they made an all purpose body lotion!</li>
      <li>I have tried many products that promise much , but do not deliver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this hand cream for years, couldn&#x27;t find the store where I usually got it, so was happy to fine it through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>With a job that requires lots of hand washing, there are days when it feels like my hands are more blood and cracks than skin, and the thought of getting near water makes me shudder.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different hand creams over the years.</li>
      <li>My brother in law gave me the first NC cream.</li>
      <li>BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS, GOT MY FIRST JAR OF NO-CRACK</li>
      <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>In fact this was used for a birthday gift for my girlfriend who loves it just as much as I do.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>I have used this before, used to be able to buy it here , the store that carried it closed.  </li>
      <li>It really works on my hands and my son uses it also.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin very soft and doesn&#x27;t give any allergies!</li>
      <li>It absolutely made a difference immediately, soothing existing cracks, and I have not had a new crack since I started using it regularly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every unfragranced cream on the market, but now that I&#x27;ve found it, I&#x27;ll never use anything but No Crack.</li>
      <li>My feel are as soft as a child&#x27;s again.</li>
      <li>It really does help for winter dry, cracked skin.</li>
      <li>It took almost a year to heal my feet completely, but it really works and I tried a lot of other products that did not.</li>
      <li>Got fast delivery but didn&#x27;t really want the other smaller sample items especially since I had to pay over $18.00 for a $4 hand cream.  </li>
      <li>I use it on a daily basis and it keeps my hands and feet extremely soft.</li>
      <li>It absorbs fairly quickly with very little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling (although I do tend to lotion just the tops and sides of my hands during the day).</li>

    <li> My brother in law gave me the first NC cream. Leaves my skin very soft and doesn&#x27;t give any allergies!</li>
    <li> Came when expected.  This is a great product. Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Best cream ever for cracked hands and feet!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products that promise much , but do not deliver. This product works and as a cabinet maker my hands take a beating.  This extreme cold weather we are having is brutal on my hands and No-Crack has been remarkable.</li>
    <li> this stuff was used by a neighbor so I found it online.  It really does help for winter dry, cracked skin.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS, GOT MY FIRST JAR OF NO-CRACK 20 YEARS AGO...... I USE THIS ALL THE TIME AND IT WORKS!!!!!! WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hand cream for years, couldn&#x27;t find the store where I usually got it, so was happy to fine it through Amazon.  It REALLY works!  :-)</li>
    <li> This is THE one my husband likes.</li>
    <li> This is the only hand cream that works.  I use it every day but more so in the winter.  I have used the un-scented No Crack Day Use hand cream for 2 years.  Bought it at a local family-owned pharmacy that was recently bought by CVS.  Now I can&#x27;t buy it locally so I ordered it online from Amazon.  Got fast delivery but didn&#x27;t really want the other smaller sample items especially since I had to pay over $18.00 for a $4 hand cream.  Just offer the individual No-Crack Unscented cream!</li>
    <li> I have used this before, used to be able to buy it here , the store that carried it closed.  It really works on my hands and my son uses it also.  In the cold winters here in Wyoming my hands dry out and crack, N/C cream is the only thing that I have found that keeps them from cracking or heals them if I forget to use some when I work outdoors.</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS CREAM I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 12 YEARS AND IT IS THE BEST FOR MY HANDS. IN MY FEET IS NOT SO EFFECTIVE BUT EVENTHOUGH I USE IT .BUT FOR THE HANDS IS THE BEST I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND I RECOMENDED  TOTALLY IT IS INCREDIBLE.</li>
    <li> It feels wonderful on my hands and feet. I use it on a daily basis and it keeps my hands and feet extremely soft.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  I usually have cracks around my thumbs or middle finger by this time in winter, but I dont have any now and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of this product.</li>
    <li> No-Crack Cream is simply the best. I wish it were more widely available. I was introduced to the product when I worked in an office environment, and everyone there swore by it, as the handling of paper all day, and the cold, dry winters wreaked havoc on the hands.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream. Have used it for a long time and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a miracle cream but it has stopped the cracking thumbs I was having; reducing water exposure by wearing gloves for dishes helps too.</li>
    <li> My mom loved all the varieties of creams you get with this. Got it as a gift for her.</li>
    <li> This is very nice cream. It moisturizes very well. Also, I took some of the unscented cream and put a couple of drops of lavender oil in it. Lovely!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different hand creams over the years. I found this product about ten years ago and have stayed with it. It is not greasy, and it works better than anything even prescribed by a doctor. For me anyway. I really like it. In fact this was used for a birthday gift for my girlfriend who loves it just as much as I do. Best thing around.</li>
    <li> Unlike a lotta of things advertised, this stuff does what it says.  I have really dry hands in the winter and this cr&amp;egrave;me has been immensely helpful with that.  I will undoubtedly buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> this cream is the best!!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of No Crack for years...it is a product I would purchase at Restoration Hardware stores.  There are none of these stores where I live now, so was delighted to find it on Amazon and at such a good price.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers, I suffer from dry, cracked hands in the winter. With a job that requires lots of hand washing, there are days when it feels like my hands are more blood and cracks than skin, and the thought of getting near water makes me shudder. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every unfragranced cream on the market, but now that I&#x27;ve found it, I&#x27;ll never use anything but No Crack. I keep a jar at home and another in my desk at work. This cream is thick and rich, with a faint scent of lanolin that quickly fades with no trace. For those other scent-sensitivity allergy sufferers and migraineurs out there, you can likely order this cream with confidence. It absorbs fairly quickly with very little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling (although I do tend to lotion just the tops and sides of my hands during the day). It absolutely made a difference immediately, soothing existing cracks, and I have not had a new crack since I started using it regularly. The night cream has a menthol scent, reminiscent of Vicks Vapo-Rub. I wear gloves when I use this lotion, since it is scented AND fairly slippery, but it is also tremendously effective. The all purpose cream has a scent too strong for me to use, so I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness. I&#x27;ve now started to use the unfragranced cream on my knees, elbows and heels with great success - I only wish they made an all purpose body lotion!</li>
    <li> Every winter I suffered from cracks on the tips of my fingers.  I started using this in late October and never had a single problem.  It was such a relief after years and years of applying lotion and bandaids which never really solved the issues.  Nothing I ever purchased at the drug store ever came close to being effective.  I already ordered a supply for next winter.</li>
    <li> If used regularly that would be each nite while watching tv it is abgood product.  No cracks at edge of nails.</li>
    <li> After many winters of limping around with sore cracked heels I found this product. It took almost a year to heal my feet completely, but it really works and I tried a lot of other products that did not. I do recommend the FRAGRANCE FREE cream. My feel are as soft as a child&#x27;s again.</li>
