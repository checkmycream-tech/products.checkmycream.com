      <li>I tried many many many different products and this one is the best.</li>
      <li>okay let me start of by saying i have wavy hair</li>
      <li>I love this product as I have used it off and on for years.</li>
      <li>I hope this helps :)</li>
      <li>however i have layers and the ends of my layers are more damaged and frizzy.</li>
      <li>This product received great reviews, including from professional stylists.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s that easy</li>
      <li>Such a great product to make sure you do have smooth and shiny hair.  </li>
      <li>and now my hair looks smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>This stuff is literally the best hair product I have ever used in my entire life, and trust me, I have used a lot from high end to cheapy cheap.    </li>
      <li>I use it on dry hair to smooth away frizz and fly</li>
      <li>After I apply this product, my hair is nice the next day as well, but I sometimes spray even more...</li>
      <li>good to use right after washing hair, make it soft and holds curls</li>
      <li>so I was glad to find it at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>This product helps corral my hair even on super humid days--which we have a lot of.  </li>
      <li>hair is fine  and naturally straight BTW.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re noew to flat ironing your hair or just looking for a new spray, this is a great one to start.</li>
      <li>Great to tame flyaways.</li>
      <li>I use this product mostly on the ends ...and throughout and the best thing is that it does not weight the hair down it just smooths it a little bit.  </li>
      <li>This is a very good flat iron spray that allows my flat iron to glide through my hair almost effortlessly.</li>
      <li>I was glad to be able to stock up and get a few at a time!    </li>
      <li>I bought my first can of this from my hair salon and gave much more for the same product.  </li>
      <li>I had been able to purchase this product at a local retail store.  </li>
      <li>This product is the first one that I ever found that works.  </li>
      <li>If you are a person who always use hot tools to tame the frizz, and style your hair, then this is a good product for you.</li>
      <li>works great on my rough course hair, when im done flat ironing its shiny and straight!</li>
      <li>It has such a strong, old-lady smell that I would have washed my hair again immediately if I had the time.  </li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s the product that really makes my day in a humid day, this experience would teach me to don&#x27;t look for something new, when the old stuff works perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>i would high reccomend!</li>
      <li>it really does seal the moisture out.  </li>
      <li>This product also helps seal in my straight hair for the rest of the day and makes it manageable.    </li>
      <li>it might be because of my hair, but this doesn&#x27;t help with my frizz too much.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t really matter, i never feel like i have too much</li>
      <li>and it is stick straight...</li>
      <li>it was so sleek and stick straight no joke..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pricey in the salon</li>
      <li>my hair gets really frizzy and curly in the humidity and nothing would ever work to control it.</li>
      <li>if to much is used.  </li>
      <li>It gives your hair such a sleek and smooth look immediately when you spray it on.  </li>
      <li>purchasing this on Amazon saved a whole buncha money.</li>
      <li>I have my favorite that consisted of mixing 2 together (matrix spray in the black bottle, along with the Biolage shine syrum.....</li>
      <li>For those who style curly or straight hair - this is a must product that does NOT spit when it sprays and leaves your hair natural looking no matter how you wear your hair &amp; it really defrizzes hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>it really does make your hair sleek and soft without being greazy.     </li>
      <li>mine gets really frizzy, but this stuff makes your hair so soft.</li>
      <li>so although it makes my hair soft and shiny, it doesnt really help with the frizz problems but</li>
      <li>I style my hair as normal, and spray this on at the end and run my fingers through to spead and work on the under-layer.</li>
      <li>It also helps tame my frizz and seal the ends of my hair when i&#x27;m blow drying my hair to make it look shiny and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Helps with frizz, but depending on humidity where you live, it isn&#x27;t 100% frizz proof</li>
      <li>Most other straightening sprays I&#x27;ve tried have a bit of stickiness to them, and I was skeptical, but it does a nice job &amp; leaves my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair, very frizzy, but I really want something to help me with the frizz without the need of hot tools, I don&#x27;t like to use them, my hair is already dry and coarse, so this product is not even close to what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I got this one as a sample from a rep and quickly stopped using my other products....</li>
      <li>and my straightener wasn&#x27;t enough to make it straight and smooth but a few sprays from this</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair feel really soft if I use it when i&#x27;m straightening my hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually complain, but I&#x27;m pretty upset right now.</li>
      <li>just spray it in the middle of my hair and ends and smooth down the frizz with my hands.</li>
      <li>But recently I found out that it isn&#x27;t in the places that I normally go.  </li>
      <li>I do small sections at a time, lightly mist and and then flat iron it--</li>
      <li>This same product is no less than $20-$25 in ANY salon.</li>
      <li>and I use it to blow dry sections straight and then straighten with a flat iron.  </li>
      <li>But the only thing that I would be careful of is don&#x27;t use to much as it could make thinner hair a bit oily</li>
      <li>My hair is very frizzy and a little wavy</li>

    <li> I have very thick, heavy, albeit fine hair. It is difficult to style and straighten. When I use this product, it s.m.o.o.t.h.s my hair so it is easily pliable and workable! Just like all good hair products, I hope this one stays around a while. OH! &amp; purchasing this on Amazon saved a whole buncha money. This same product is no less than $20-$25 in ANY salon.</li>
    <li> This is a very good flat iron spray that allows my flat iron to glide through my hair almost effortlessly.

If you&#x27;re noew to flat ironing your hair or just looking for a new spray, this is a great one to start. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just rediscovered this stuff, I had a can under my sink but hadn&#x27;t thought about it for years.  I have curly hair and I use it to blow dry sections straight and then straighten with a flat iron.  My hair stays straight and perfect for DAYS.  I&#x27;m on day 3 now and it still looks amazing.  it really does seal the moisture out.  Hiiiighly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I had been able to purchase this product at a local retail store.  But recently I found out that it isn&#x27;t in the places that I normally go.  So I did some research and found it on Amazon!    I was glad to be able to stock up and get a few at a time!    This product is amazing!  It gives your hair such a sleek and smooth look immediately when you spray it on.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or make your hair look oily!  And it has a wonderful scent!</li>
    <li> Good price got this for my wife</li>
    <li> I was just introduced to this product by my hair stylist. my hair gets really frizzy and curly in the humidity and nothing would ever work to control it. this stuff does! I style my hair as normal, and spray this on at the end and run my fingers through to spead and work on the under-layer. it&#x27;s amazing. i see others use it with a flat iron, which i dont use, but i can see how they would say it helps make the process smoother. it really does make your hair sleek and soft without being greazy.     AWESOME!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff! works great on my rough course hair, when im done flat ironing its shiny and straight! my hair no longer frizzes out either... and it sprays like a hair spray can... other bottles are like squirt bottles and dont give even coverage. swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> I tried many many many different products and this one is the best. I use it on dry hair to smooth away frizz and fly aways.&lt;br /&gt;I just spray it in the middle of my hair and ends and smooth down the frizz with my hands. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week. After I apply this product, my hair is nice the next day as well, but I sometimes spray even more... it doesn&#x27;t really matter, i never feel like i have too much on.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine  and naturally straight BTW. however i have layers and the ends of my layers are more damaged and frizzy. I use this product mostly on the ends ...and throughout and the best thing is that it does not weight the hair down it just smooths it a little bit.  I hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> okay let me start of by saying i have wavy hair and i dont straighten it in cold humid weather because it would always get nappy and wavy five minutes out the door and even in summer it will not stay staright...i was btowsing threw products and found this one and i was skeptic about trying something like a spray but OMG i sprayed on before blowdrying my hair and i noticed as i was straigntening with my flat iron it was so sleek and stick straight no joke..but i was like as soon as i go outside its not gonna stay will let me say ive been up and down all day and now im about to go to bed and it is stick straight...bottom line I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I have used alot of products...I got this one as a sample from a rep and quickly stopped using my other products.... I have my favorite that consisted of mixing 2 together (matrix spray in the black bottle, along with the Biolage shine syrum.....but this product seems to do just that...provides protection for the Heat and a very smooth shiny texture for after...love love love this spray...plus it smells yummy!!</li>
    <li> I purchased a product on 01/02/12 and also selected 1 to 3 shipping (which cost me $10), but the seller tells me that it&#x27;s my fault for not checking in earlier. Excuse me, I thought I would give it a day or two before contacting the seller before complaining....so somehow this is all my fault. I took my bad review off the first time thinking since the seller seemed serious and would make sure I would get my product by Tuesday 01/10, well guess what, it&#x27;s Thursday and still haven&#x27;t recieved my order. Meanwhile I&#x27;ve tried contacting the seller on 01/10 &amp; 01/11 and haven&#x27;t gotten a response regarding my item. I don&#x27;t usually complain, but I&#x27;m pretty upset right now. I&#x27;ve been ordering items from Amazon for years now and NEVER have had a problem like this! You would think with the way the economy is that you wouldn&#x27;t treat customers this way!! Most company owners want returning customers!!</li>
    <li> I really want a product to tame the frizzy hair, I thought this product would make it and I was totally wrong. If you are a person who always use hot tools to tame the frizz, and style your hair, then this is a good product for you. I have curly hair, very frizzy, but I really want something to help me with the frizz without the need of hot tools, I don&#x27;t like to use them, my hair is already dry and coarse, so this product is not even close to what I was looking for. I should saved that money and buy again Hair Milk from Carol&#x27;s Daughter, that&#x27;s the product that really makes my day in a humid day, this experience would teach me to don&#x27;t look for something new, when the old stuff works perfectly fine. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> it might be because of my hair, but this doesn&#x27;t help with my frizz too much. i ended up giving it to a friend who&#x27;s hair was a lot less of a mess than mine and i believe it worked well. mine gets really frizzy, but this stuff makes your hair so soft. so although it makes my hair soft and shiny, it doesnt really help with the frizz problems but that&#x27;s okay!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while now.  It&#x27;s very pricey in the salon so I was glad to find it at a reasonable price.  Great to tame flyaways.</li>
    <li> For those who style curly or straight hair - this is a must product that does NOT spit when it sprays and leaves your hair natural looking no matter how you wear your hair &amp; it really defrizzes hair.</li>
    <li> Works very good. After flat ironing my hair I use this product to help settle my fly always , smells good and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after I use it .. All in all I would recommend this product .</li>
    <li> Best out there for my hair type!!</li>
    <li> This product smooths my hair just as it describes!  My hair is very frizzy and a little wavy and my straightener wasn&#x27;t enough to make it straight and smooth but a few sprays from this and now my hair looks smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> Such a great product to make sure you do have smooth and shiny hair.  Helps with frizz, but depending on humidity where you live, it isn&#x27;t 100% frizz proof</li>
    <li> good to use right after washing hair, make it soft and holds curls</li>
    <li> My hair is thick course and frizzy.  This product is the first one that I ever found that works.  [...]</li>
    <li> Do not like this at all - smells terrible!!  will not buy again and it&#x27;s too bad for what you pay for it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is literally the best hair product I have ever used in my entire life, and trust me, I have used a lot from high end to cheapy cheap.    I have really thick naturally wavy hair that I straighten and blow dry almost every day.  This product makes my hair feel really soft if I use it when i&#x27;m straightening my hair.  This product also helps seal in my straight hair for the rest of the day and makes it manageable.    It also helps tame my frizz and seal the ends of my hair when i&#x27;m blow drying my hair to make it look shiny and healthy.  It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of nasty smell like some hair products do.  But the only thing that I would be careful of is don&#x27;t use to much as it could make thinner hair a bit oily if to much is used.  The price is usually around 15-20$ for this product but I got it on sale for 10.  I&#x27;ve had this product for around a year and a half and am now just staring to run out so it&#x27;s a good buy for a fair price! i would high reccomend!</li>
    <li> Works Great and Lasts! I still have this product years later and it still works great. As you can tell I do not regularly straighten my hair...but when I do this is the product I use and it is the best product I have tried!</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. I love this product as I have used it off and on for years. If you want straight hair, just spray a little and flat iron preferably with a ceramic iron.</li>
    <li> This product received great reviews, including from professional stylists.  I purchased it yesterday, tried it this morning, and returned it this afternoon.  It has such a strong, old-lady smell that I would have washed my hair again immediately if I had the time.  It&#x27;s been eight hours and I can still smell it.</li>
    <li> Love how this product helps to iron out my frizzes and gives my hair a shine that lasts for days.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few years now.  Gives a good shine without being overly oily.  Very light, and smells great.  Awesome for a quick touch-up mid-day too.</li>
    <li> I bought my first can of this from my hair salon and gave much more for the same product.  This is one of the best products I have used for my unruly, frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, product is what it&#x27;s supposed to be. my daughter has very curly hair and these products work great she says.</li>
    <li> This product helps corral my hair even on super humid days--which we have a lot of.  I use it to tame my hair before flat ironing.</li>
