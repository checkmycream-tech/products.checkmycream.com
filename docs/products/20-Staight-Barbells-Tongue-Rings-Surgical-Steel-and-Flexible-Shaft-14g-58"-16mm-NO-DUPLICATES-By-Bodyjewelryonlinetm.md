      <li>But overall it&#x27;s all good. :)</li>

      <li>They came in so quickly I was so excited.</li>
      <li>but they came in the mail and they are all different but In the picture they are all brightly colored but mine however aren&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick but did not get all 20 barbells...</li>
      <li>All were different &amp;very cute.</li>
      <li>It took long to come in the mail, but besides that I loved it.</li>
      <li>They are long lasting, the colors are always awesome, and the ones i have purchased have never broke!</li>
      <li>Some metal ones and some plastic ones pretty!</li>
      <li>They are very cute :) One of the flex bars was broken on arrival, but the balls were okay</li>
      <li>Had 2 duplicates other than that very pretty &amp; bright colored</li>
      <li>Shipping was pretty quick also😊</li>
      <li>But still good, other than that!!</li>
      <li>;)</li>

      <li>Only thing is I didn&#x27;t realize they all didn&#x27;t have metal bars, other than that they&#x27;re good.</li>
      <li>This is not exactly what I ordered, but they were okay.</li>
      <li>Several repeated pieces but cool 4 price</li>
      <li>Though they arrived in a decent time frame, I did not receive any of the tongue rings pictured.</li>
      <li>And different styles mixed in with them I would highly recommend these</li>
      <li>Not a single duplicate</li>

<li> Only giving four stars because I got one or two duplicates, also a really small barbell that couldn&#x27;t work for a tongue.</li>
<li> Some of the metal bars were a bit too long so had to try a few to find the shorter lengths.</li>
<li> Not worth the purchase</li>
<li> ( I soak them in half water half hydrogen proxide for about a minute or two ) and they all broke when I looked at them.</li>
<li> Seems like I got all the designs I hated, however it was fast shipping</li>
<li> From the bar to the ball broken.</li>
<li> I even got broken ones when I received my package.</li>

    <li> It took long to come in the mail, but besides that I loved it. All different colors. I loved it ! I&#x27;ll probably buy other things from this seller.</li>
    <li> They came in so quickly I was so excited. I picked the ones I didn&#x27;t want out and went to clean the ones I like ( I soak them in half water half hydrogen proxide for about a minute or two ) and they all broke when I looked at them. From the bar to the ball broken. Not worth the purchase</li>
    <li> Alll 20 tongue rings were different and some had a flexible bar that I like. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great! I got my package promptly, and they were good quality! Only giving four stars because I got one or two duplicates, also a really small barbell that couldn&#x27;t work for a tongue. Also, some of the bars are plastic, which I don&#x27;t use. But still good, other than that!!</li>
    <li> It has plastic ones in it with it</li>
    <li> Great designs hope to buy more</li>
    <li> This is not exactly what I ordered, but they were okay. I got a few that I liked out of it.</li>
    <li> Got all different 20 barballs. Some of the metal bars were a bit too long so had to try a few to find the shorter lengths. Also  the plastic bars really hurts because if you look closely at it, once you get the package, it&#x27;s not smooth at all. But overall it&#x27;s all good. :)</li>
    <li> there wasn&#x27;t any duplicates but there was some that looked the same but different colors but it came fast</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick but did not get all 20 barbells...</li>
    <li> Good assortment of colors and sizes , I&#x27;ve only tried one of them out and idk if it&#x27;s just this one or what but the ball seems to fall off the post in my mouth quite a lot . Still good tho for the the price</li>
    <li> All were different &amp;very cute. Shipping was pretty quick also😊</li>
    <li> Amazon is the only site i purchase my tongue rings from. Why? Well because they are cheap and come with a bundle of rings instead of 1-3 for $10.00 like at a retail store. When i seen that i could get 20 tongue rings for $6.00 i was so excited to make my purchase. They are long lasting, the colors are always awesome, and the ones i have purchased have never broke!</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price store quality</li>
    <li> They were okay.. the design came off within 2 days and none of them were cute. Seems like I got all the designs I hated, however it was fast shipping</li>
    <li> Several repeated pieces but cool 4 price</li>
    <li> Though they arrived in a decent time frame, I did not receive any of the tongue rings pictured. That was the whole point of the purchase. 😒</li>
    <li> i love them , got everything I expected</li>
    <li> Not a single duplicate</li>
    <li> I had asked for steel bars and plastic balls and instead I got a mix of both steel bars and plastic balls along with plastic barbell and plastic balls</li>
    <li> Some metal ones and some plastic ones pretty!</li>
    <li> I love all of them they&#x27;re great👍👍</li>
    <li> Very happy. I got different kinds and no doubles. I might buy more.</li>
    <li> Love them!!! Very pretty colors!!! And different styles mixed in with them I would highly recommend these</li>
    <li> Wish the paint wouldn&#x27;t chip off</li>
    <li> I only received 19 in my pack, but still an incredible deal for what I paid. There are metal bars and plastic bars, but all the balls fit on all the bars, so you can interchange them. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> They came faster than I expected. Only thing is I didn&#x27;t realize they all didn&#x27;t have metal bars, other than that they&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t wore them yet but they came in the mail and they are all different but In the picture they are all brightly colored but mine however aren&#x27;t. There are like 4 or 5 brightly colored ones.</li>
    <li> Not all the posts are metal, or the same gauge. Some are legitimately too big for my piercing. Also, many of the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; are WAY to big to talk around.</li>
    <li> Had 2 duplicates other than that very pretty &amp; bright colored</li>
    <li> No duplicates. Some metal bars some plastic. All and all I&#x27;m impressed</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved them</li>
    <li> Love them and the colors</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re all so cute, came super fast!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the designs but most of them break very very easy. I even got broken ones when I received my package.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I always buy from them. They have a good variety in their barbells. Will buy again and I recommend them to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great colors, all of them are different</li>
    <li> These got here pretty fast. They are very cute :) One of the flex bars was broken on arrival, but the balls were okay ;) lol</li>
    <li> Love all the assortment of colors matches almost every outfit that I wear !!!!!</li>
