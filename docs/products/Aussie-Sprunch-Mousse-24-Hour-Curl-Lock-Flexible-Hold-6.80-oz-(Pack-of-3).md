      <li>I came on Amazon and through no fault of their own, I received 9 cans of Aussie Sprunch mousse instead.</li>

      <li>Nice smell.</li>

      <li>so i bought this hoping it would do a better job.</li>
      <li>I have found over many years that for me there is no difference.  </li>
      <li>Works great whether I style curly or straight.</li>
      <li>Aussie is one of my most used brands because of price, scent and how well my hair reacts to it.  </li>
      <li>I love the Aussie brand.</li>
      <li>I love this mousse for her, because it gives some body and control as well as it makes it easier for her to comb through.  </li>
      <li>On days when I didn&#x27;t feel like blow-drying it, I&#x27;d pull it back in a ponytail, which, as you can imagine, is just so attractive!</li>
      <li>Her hair is much more manageable because of this product.  </li>
      <li>this is my favorite mousse</li>
      <li>9 more cans of Sprunch.</li>
      <li>I love this moose.  </li>
      <li>And nothing seemed to help make it more manageable.</li>
      <li>I had nice, smooth waves.</li>
      <li>It has no conditioning properties whatsoever that I have been able to tell.</li>
      <li>but after the first use I realized that it was amazing!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>If I want more of a hold, I use more moose.</li>
      <li>To me, this isn&#x27;t a super condense conditioner, and I&#x27;d say the mousse evens it out nicely.</li>
      <li>The most important thing is to keep it hydrated and this mousse does that with the leave in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>My hair is always super soft after using, and it smells incredibly</li>
      <li>I have almost shoulder-length wavy hair that is a fine texture.</li>
      <li>I have fine, fragile hair and this product works great for it.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the product I was expecting, but it still works very well plus it smells nice</li>
      <li>(fabulous product) or the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>This product is great for adding both wave and volume back into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to suck because of the light consistency</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it, nothing has ever made my hair look this healthy.  </li>
      <li>My curls look much better and the price is much more reasonable.</li>
      <li>I have used this mousse for years and am pretty satisfied with the curls that it creates.  </li>
      <li>When used with a dffuser to blow dry your curly hair it will look great.</li>
      <li>It might even look that way while my hair is still wet, but by the time I get my son to school around 7:30AM, after a teensy bit of tousling, my hair looks great.</li>
      <li>Thankfully it blow-dries straight pretty nicely, but that gets tiring after a while.</li>
      <li>It might even look that way while my hair is still wet, but by the time I get my son to school around 7:30AM, after a teensy bit of tousling, my hair looks great.</li>
      <li>I like buying it here on Amazon because the price is much more reasonable than what I can get it for in store</li>
      <li>Made my hair soft right after the shower and is very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Then, scrunch :) All done in a few minutes and my hair air-dries into beautiful soft curls.</li>
      <li>Amazon was kind enough to reship a corrected order.</li>
      <li>My curls air dry in well defined ringlets, and the light conditioner keeps the frizzies and static away.</li>
      <li>I found this product nice to use on my naturally curly hair as it gives my hair definition and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Apparently the powers that be at Aussie Products have decided that the only mousse on Earth that gave my wicked curly hair even a fighting chance at control and softness wasn&#x27;t enough of a best seller to keep in their product line.</li>
      <li>Makes my thinnish, dry, wavy/frizzy hair look smooth, full &amp; hydrated!  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>After the shower, I don&#x27;t comb out my hair but, once I take it out of the towel, I flip my head over, apply mousse liberally, then flip back upright, place my part and hair otherwise where I want them, then use a touch more product on the hair around my face.</li>
      <li>I now embark on a quest to find a mousse that is affordable and does the same magic as the Catch the Wave.</li>
      <li>I love have back ups of these if I start to run out.</li>
      <li>I am sticking with Aussie!!!sse liberally, then flip back upright, place my part and hair otherwise where I want them, then use a touch more product on the hair around my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s first moose I ever used</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used various kinds of mousse and find they work better than gels or sprays for defining my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She is pleased with the product and will actually use it!!!</li>
      <li>Thus I spent years blow-drying my hair every day because I could never get it to look nice while wavy.</li>
      <li>I get up at 5:30AM these days, and the prospect of getting up earlier than that just to be able to blow-dry</li>
      <li>The first time i sprayed it into my hand</li>
      <li>It shouldn&#x27;t seem like a tall order, but when your hair isn&#x27;t really straight yet isn&#x27;t really curly, it&#x27;s actually hard to find that happy</li>
      <li>My hair feels natural after a full day at work, but the style still somewhat holds together.</li>
      <li>Just enough to make my hair easy to style, and tangle-less.</li>
      <li>My hair is VERY dry and, regretfully, quite over-processed, &amp; this mousse makes it look and feel so healthy.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic, but I find that it is  solid compromise of the two products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always envied my mother&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s curly hair, but mine just never seems to curl as much as theirs.</li>
      <li>(The latter store mentioned sells a case of 12 for forty-eight bucks, which I just bought with free shipping plus a five dollar off coupon code.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great for summer hair. It leaves the hair held together, but not with that hard shell that most products leave. The added leave-in conditioner is spectacular too because who couldn&#x27;t use a little extra hydration?</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that can tend to be flat and straight, especially as it gets longer. This product is great for adding both wave and volume back into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two issues with this product: it contains dimethicone and dimethiconol, both of which eventually build up on hair, so I usually need to clarify my hair if I use this for several days in a row. My other complaint is the inclusion of propylene glycol, a common humectant--it pulls water into the hair, which can make hair frizzy, especially on more humid days and if you&#x27;re scrunching (which this is intended for). Other than that, I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thin fine hair that is constantly tangeling.  Her hair is fine and limp.  I love this mousse for her, because it gives some body and control as well as it makes it easier for her to comb through.  Her hair is much more manageable because of this product.  Best stuff I have found for her situation.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t provide a firm lasting hold, but the conditioner is good, and detangles. I have fine, fragile hair and this product works great for it.</li>
    <li> The product I was attempting to order was Aussie Catch the Wave Leave in Mousse and Conditioner. Apparently the powers that be at Aussie Products have decided that the only mousse on Earth that gave my wicked curly hair even a fighting chance at control and softness wasn&#x27;t enough of a best seller to keep in their product line. Shame on them. I came on Amazon and through no fault of their own, I received 9 cans of Aussie Sprunch mousse instead. Even though the product was clearly labed Catch the wave. Woe is me. I now embark on a quest to find a mousse that is affordable and does the same magic as the Catch the Wave. Amazon was kind enough to reship a corrected order. Guess what I got? 9 more cans of Sprunch. Since I don&#x27;t have a hazmat shipping permit, everyone I know got mousse from me. It worked out alright and Amazon could not have been nicer. Just label the products correctly please. My hair is still going through withdrawals. :-(</li>
    <li> I notices the difference after only one use. My hair is super soft,manageable and did not need round brush or iron to style it. It also smells very good.</li>
    <li> I love this moose.  It holds without being overly stiff. Let&#x27;s my hair still flow.  If I want more of a hold, I use more moose. I&#x27;ve tried other products and they leave my hair much too stiff.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely unmanageable; it&#x27;s thick, sometimes dull-looking, frizzy, &amp; utterly unexpected. It could be wavy one day, curly the next, &amp; despite how it may appear, there&#x27;s always straight strands. I&#x27;ve used so many hair products in the past, &amp; all mousses have left my hair really crunchy, hard, and weighed it down tremendously. I find that this mousse really emphasizes my natural curls &amp; provides me with bountiful volume, that other mousses lacked in giving me. Aside from all this, my hair feels incredibly soft after I use it. My hair is VERY dry and, regretfully, quite over-processed, &amp; this mousse makes it look and feel so healthy. The only thing that SLIGHTLY disappointed me, however, was the fact that I feel that for hair as frizzy as mine, it lacks in taming a fair amount of flyaways and frizzies. However, if you want an effortless, bouncy, natural look, Aussie Catch the Wave Mousse + Leave-in Conditioner, is definitely the right way to go. I honestly don&#x27;t see myself switching any time soon! For the best results, pair this up with either the [[ASIN:B001EO5X6M TRESemme Flawless Curls Hydration Lotion Creme, 6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]] (fabulous product) or the [[ASIN:B002RT71XG Redken Ringlet Curl Perfector, 6-Ounces Bottle]] (amazing, but pricey). I discovered (mixing either of these two products in with the mousse) this technique after I had purchased the Aussie mousse, &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the way my hair looks. I always apply one of these products in before using the mousse, &amp; get great results. Overall, I think you should definitely invest in this product!</li>
    <li> This product is great for curly hair. When used with a dffuser to blow dry your curly hair it will look great.</li>
    <li> This is a mousse and as such works acceptably as a loose-hold variety. It has no conditioning properties whatsoever that I have been able to tell. On the contrary, it has left my hair in sticky knots.  If you buy this primarily for use as a mousse, it might be OK, but I wanted a leave-in conditioner and unfortunately was therefore disappointed.</li>
    <li> this mousse is more of just a mousse, it had very little to no conditioner!! I had to use a leave in conditioner and another mousse and hairspray to keep my hair in control. i have super thick curly hair and im always looking for a good mousse, this is probably not one of them. so if ur looking for a good mousse that would keep ur hair on good condition, look for something else.</li>
    <li> Aussie Sprunch Hair Mousse + Leave-In Conditioner 6.8 Oz (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;Give your hair that little extra oomp it needs</li>
    <li> I do not think it does anything to help my hair&#x27;s health.Bit it definitely helps to create volume and keep it.It&#x27;s first moose I ever used so I do not have much to compare.As a styling product it&#x27;s good for light flexible hold but I don&#x27;t think it has enough conditioning properties to be called leave-in conditioner.Smells good.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but your prices are way to expensive.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely damaged. After bleaching then months later getting a really horrible perm, my poor locks were hopeless. I tried EVERYTHING. Cutting it off, conditioning treatments, hair masks, gel, mousse, hairspray, etc. And nothing seemed to help make it more manageable. The only thing keeping me from looking like an overgrown poodle was straightening it with a flat iron... Which keeps damaging hair yet helping me look semi-human. Then... I found this product. I shampoo &amp; condition with Aussie \\&quot;Moist\\&quot; then, immediate after I shower, I pat hair dry with a towel, finger through it, and then evenly distribute a tennis ball amount of Aussie&#x27;s Mouse/leave-in-conditioner. Then, scrunch :) All done in a few minutes and my hair air-dries into beautiful soft curls. This mouse with added leave-in-conditioner works SO much better than any regular old mousse. I swear by this product, it truly SAVED my hairstyle!!!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. It keeps your curls and gives your hair volume. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for mousse.</li>
    <li> I have almost shoulder-length wavy hair that is a fine texture. However I&#x27;ve actually got a lot of hair, meaning frizziness and flyaways are still a major problem for me. I&#x27;ve always envied my mother&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s curly hair, but mine just never seems to curl as much as theirs. (Thanks, Dad, for the wavy hair gene.) Thus I spent years blow-drying my hair every day because I could never get it to look nice while wavy. Thankfully it blow-dries straight pretty nicely, but that gets tiring after a while. Additionally, I don&#x27;t like the damage that it causes to my hair. On days when I didn&#x27;t feel like blow-drying it, I&#x27;d pull it back in a ponytail, which, as you can imagine, is just so attractive! When my hair was short enough (too long &#x3D; looks stringy instead of wavy), I would sometimes use mousse to keep it smooth while wearing it wavy, but I was never really satisfied with the way it came out. It was either too crunchy because I used to much product, or it was too frizzy because I didn&#x27;t use enough. I get up at 5:30AM these days, and the prospect of getting up earlier than that just to be able to blow-dry my hair is not exactly appealing. Thus I needed to find something to help me wear my hair wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist loves my hair&#x27;s texture and has recommended a couple of sea salt sprays that she thinks I&#x27;ll love. However I don&#x27;t want &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; hair. I want hair that&#x27;s wavy but not frizzy. It shouldn&#x27;t seem like a tall order, but when your hair isn&#x27;t really straight yet isn&#x27;t really curly, it&#x27;s actually hard to find that happy medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I went to the &amp;#34;bullseye store&amp;#34; and couldn&#x27;t find my usual, just-ok but not expensive Tresemme mousse. I found this Aussie mousse instead and decided to give it a whirl. I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck! As long as I used enough product, my hair did not frizz at all. I had nice, smooth waves. After the shower, I don&#x27;t comb out my hair but, once I take it out of the towel, I flip my head over, apply mousse liberally, then flip back upright, place my part and hair otherwise where I want them, then use a touch more product on the hair around my face. I have to use enough product to the point where regular mousse would make my hair crunchy. It might even look that way while my hair is still wet, but by the time I get my son to school around 7:30AM, after a teensy bit of tousling, my hair looks great. It&#x27;s not sticky or crunchy at all. The only downside is that because I use a lot of product, I go through cans of this stuff pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly since figuring out my tricks to using this mousse, I have a good hair day every day! It used to be that I would have one good hair day out of every three or four. Pretty sad. Also, my hair length is getting to the point where I used to have to either get it cut or start wearing it straight again because it was too long to wear wavy, but after discovering this Aussie mousse, I&#x27;m discovering that I can still wear my hair wavy as it gets longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problem up until recently with finding this mousse at the &amp;#34;bullseye store,&amp;#34; but lately it&#x27;s been out of stock (empty spot on the shelf). Maybe other people with wavy hair caught wind of a product that actually works. I&#x27;ve looked for it elsewhere but haven&#x27;t had any luck. It&#x27;s a little pricey here on Amazon, but I&#x27;ve also looked at other retailers&#x27; websites (one that rhymes with &amp;#34;Small-Cart&amp;#34; and also at Dollar General) and have found it for roughly four bucks a can. (The latter store mentioned sells a case of 12 for forty-eight bucks, which I just bought with free shipping plus a five dollar off coupon code.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To tide me over until my shipment of Aussie arrives, I bought Herbal Essences Tousle Me Softly mousse. It is so disappointing in comparison -sticky, and my hair is already frizzy at 8:30AM. It looks awful.

    <li> This is a beautiful product. I have long, fine, flat hair, so lately I&#x27;ve just been skipping conditioner and using this. I apply a dollop of the mousse through my hair, let it air-dry, and my nondescript straight/wavy limp locks are transformed into bouncy, healthy-looking hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have thick, fine hair, and frizziness, tangles, and stubborn hair are usually problems for me. Everytime I wash my hair, I put this on my wet hair - I have found it makes my hair INCREDIBLY more manageable! My hair is always super soft after using, and it smells incredibly nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the mousse and leave-in conditioner part everyone else is complaining about- I&#x27;d say it depends on how much you put in your hair. To me, this isn&#x27;t a super condense conditioner, and I&#x27;d say the mousse evens it out nicely. I would not recommend this for trying to hold curls (use hairspray..), and if you&#x27;re looking for just a leave-in conditioner that&#x27;s concentrated, I would try a different product. But for me, this product is the perfect in between. Just enough to make my hair easy to style, and tangle-less.</li>
    <li> They last a long time. Smells great, works fabulously. I love have back ups of these if I start to run out. The price is perfect.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair curly and feeling soft. Help control frizz.</li>
    <li> Use this product constantly.  Could not find in local stores</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the product I was expecting, but it still works very well plus it smells nice and it&#x27;s a great price</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair, love the 3 pack AND the price. This will last me a very long time. I love the Aussie brand. This mousse also conditions !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my thinnish, dry, wavy/frizzy hair look smooth, full &amp; hydrated!  I needed serious hair help when I moved to a humid climate, and Sprunch saved my bacon.  Works great whether I style curly or straight. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it, nothing has ever made my hair look this healthy.  I add Frieda frizz-ease serum for extra heat protection and shine, and if styling curly, a tiny bit of Sexy Curly Hair curling creme for extra definition, but Sprunch is the key - nothing works for me without that. The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I&#x27;ve found is that if I use too much Sprunch (like more than two palmfuls on my medium-length bob) it can get slightly stiff/built up.  It&#x27;s kinda hard to find, so hope they don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
    <li> I have chemically treated hair and this leaves it super-shiny and hydrated, which is almost impossible to get with any other product.</li>
    <li> Encourages curl.  Hair stays soft but holds.  Not stiff or brittle.  Gentle enough for kids hair.  Doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.</li>
    <li> This sprunch hair mousse and leave in conditioner is a great fit for my hair. It has great hold and due to the conditioner, washes clean and makes my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> very drying to the hair... don&#x27;t like the feel of it.</li>
    <li> In order for my hair to be how i want i had to use mousse, hairspray and a bunch of other stuff so i bought this hoping it would do a better job. The first time i sprayed it into my hand I thought it was going to suck because of the light consistency but after the first use I realized that it was amazing! It holds my hair in place that I can just put this on and have my hair looking amazing! Love it!</li>
    <li> Not as good as original but still better than others. Use it every day. Give body and soft hold. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> I have middle aged, dry, curly hair that tends to get frizzy. I can&#x27;t use conditioner very often because it makes my hair flat and greasy looking. I&#x27;ve used various kinds of mousse and find they work better than gels or sprays for defining my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aussie Catch The Wave mousse with conditioner works really well on my hair. I use a golf-ball sized amount on my shoulder length hair, comb it through and scrunch. My curls air dry in well defined ringlets, and the light conditioner keeps the frizzies and static away.</li>
    <li> I debated on buying yet another hair product for my daughters mixed hair. She hates it when products leave her hair crunchy, and this did not. She is pleased with the product and will actually use it!!! The 4 stars is because she does have a little bit of frizz in the morning, but it is substantially better than without this product. Good price as well!!!</li>
    <li> I adore this mousse.  It is the best stuff to seal in my curls and leave them soft.  I use it every morning and it holds my curls through out the entire day.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite mousse and it is very hard to find in stores now! So I have to order off here and its great for curly hair and isn&#x27;t to sticky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product from grocery store to the salon and this is the only product that holds my curls.  I get curls for 2-3 days out of one use.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a mousse to do the job without breaking the bank, then Aussie Sprunch Hair Mousse + Leave-In Conditioner is the mousse for you, Mate!  I have used this mousse for years and am pretty satisfied with the curls that it creates.  I apply it to just out of the shower wet hair and immediately diffuse my naturally curly hair.  I did use Loreal Texture moose for awhile, but when they stopped making it, I tried other more expensive salon brands and then ended up coming right back to Aussie Sprunch Hair Mousse + Leave-In Conditioner.  My curls look much better and the price is much more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack of three Aussie mousse/leave-in was great. Made my hair soft right after the shower and is very easy to apply. It did not leave my hair crispy or stiff, and there was no flaky. I think the leave-in condition part of it makes it not flake. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, it was a steal from the price I could get in the store. (I think $10 for 3 bottles?).&lt;br /&gt;I just got some for $3 a pop yesterday at the store, and this is up to $18 if you include shipping. Can&#x27;t get the same deals I used to get on Amazon, it makes me sad :(</li>
    <li> My favorite product and my local store was out of it, found a 3 pack on Amazon that I got in 2 days, Prime, and it was cheaper than my local wallyworld&lt;br /&gt;I love how its a leave in conditioner as well as mousse! not stiff, but holds well!</li>
    <li> I found this product nice to use on my naturally curly hair as it gives my hair definition and leaves my hair feeling soft. This product is priced nicely too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one for buying expensive hair care products.  I have found over many years that for me there is no difference.  Aussie is one of my most used brands because of price, scent and how well my hair reacts to it.  I have color treated, naturally curly, mid back length hair.  The most important thing is to keep it hydrated and this mousse does that with the leave in conditioner.  A little goes a long way for me and used in conjunction with [[ASIN:B003AYEFU4 Aussie Catch The Wave Sprunch Hair Spray]] my hair stays frizz free and with beautiful curls. I like buying it here on Amazon because the price is much more reasonable than what I can get it for in store and I can also get an additional discount using Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> Aussie Sprunch Mousse and Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair tends to frizz up when dry, and regular mousse won&#x27;t hold the hair together when it is humid. Gel and hair spray tends to clump up or harden my hair, and always feels crunchy or flaky after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprunch has some mousse and some leave-in conditioner. It smells fantastic, but I find that it is  solid compromise of the two products. It has some holding power, but I&#x27;d consider it weaker than regular mousse. My hair feels natural after a full day at work, but the style still somewhat holds together. I wouldn&#x27;t use this for radical hair styles though. It does not feel hard or crunchy, and doesn&#x27;t flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars</li>
    <li> Good product. Aussie seems to work for my thick, mostly straight but occasionally frizzy ends. Not heavy on your hair at all.</li>
