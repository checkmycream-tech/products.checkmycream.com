### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Also, not the best coverage of my gray hairs...</li>
      <li>And the absolutely best thing is that it did not stain my scalp or skin.  </li>

      <li>The scent was also pleasant.</li>
      <li>Never again will I attempt another dye besides my good ol&#x27; standards.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for squirting it into my hand and then applying as it didn&#x27;t seem like it did a good job of covering my hair where it was needed</li>

      <li>The packaging looked good and I&#x27;ve used EXCELLENCE for years</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!   </li>
      <li>the Sublime Mousse is phenomenal!</li>
      <li>But honestly, it felt the way my hair always feels after it&#x27;s been dyed, whether with any box dye I&#x27;ve ever used, or in a salon.  </li>
      <li>I liked the idea of the mousse</li>
      <li>I liked up and will be buying it again.</li>
      <li>and I liked the look of it</li>
      <li>Honestly the easiest hair dying experience.   </li>
      <li>must say the application was easy and the end result amazing!</li>
      <li>I have been extremely happy with how the color is true to the box and how my hair feels after I color.  </li>
      <li>It was very easy to mix, just swish the bottle and do NOT shake it.  </li>
      <li>I did not find it very easy to apply to the rest of my shoulder length hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame too, because it is so very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This dye was not messy at all and the pump worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I wish the result were better because I loved the ease of applying the mousse as it was easy to evenly spread the mousse all over my scalp.</li>
      <li>The foam was very easy to spread onto my roots, and to make sure I covered all of them.  </li>
      <li>Application verY easy  Scent appealing  Color when styled</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t read these reviews before I bought it.  </li>
      <li>It did a great job at covering the gray, and the product itself doesn&#x27;t drip, which is really helpful given the time required.</li>
      <li>There is nothing healthy about it.  </li>
      <li>Healthy Look\\&quot; about 2 months ago</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t expect perfection just more than the mousse did.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to massage it in well.</li>
      <li>I love the mousse as it doesn&#x27;t run or get all over the place.</li>
      <li>The color turned out great, very even, and no missed spots.  </li>
      <li>I would not receommend the Healthy Look Sublime Mousse at all.  </li>
      <li>Before I used this product my hair looked shiny and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I ended up putting more on in that area and on the hair by my ears.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal products for YEARS and have been extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>You could get better, more reliable results from a $3 bargain dye.</li>
      <li>You could get better, more reliable results from a $3 bargain dye.</li>
      <li>The color faded quite fast and the gray coverage wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>Most of the time when you dye your hair it feels softer after.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have gray hair, so I cannot speak to its ability to cover that, but I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>No so with Healthy Look Sublime Mousse.  </li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve missed any spots, but with this one, I knew I would love the color</li>
      <li>but I am sure it doesn&#x27;t help...</li>
      <li>This is more affordable, I like it.</li>
      <li>I have medium blonde hair and have used L&#x27;Oreal products very successfully.</li>
      <li>I loved Dream Blonde, but, of course, they discontinue the good stuff.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product because of the really easy and even coloring.</li>
      <li>Appication was easy and rinsing went very quick.</li>
      <li>and I could easily see if spots hadn&#x27;t been dyed.    </li>
      <li>Easy to apply-</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;mousse\\&quot; is easy to apply, but the gray coverage of this product is non-existent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, however I do find the odor a bit over-powering.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to spread easily at all here.  </li>
      <li>mousse formula does make it easy to use.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, my colleagues all congratulated me on the beautiful, deep and shiny hair colour i have.</li>
      <li>is the most pleasant of any previously used( have used many)!  </li>
      <li>Super easy to apply :)</li>
      <li>One of the best things about this dye was that while it did foam initially when I put it on, it didn&#x27;t stay foamy like the picture so at first I was worried.</li>
      <li>yeah balsam is fine...</li>
      <li>My hair feels fine now.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair at home for years, with pretty good success.  </li>
      <li>first thing you notice is how many precautions you have to take to use this product and how many steps you need to take to ensure the security of the bottle \\&quot;container</li>
      <li>Usually I enjoy added body after I color, but not so with this stuff.</li>
      <li>I used a Brazilian hair straightener treatment 5 weeks ago and it worked fantastic...</li>
      <li>I like the L&#x27;Oreal product better than Nice &#x27;n Easy, which I used last time</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t drip at all, and it was super easy keeping my bathroom clean as I did this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty healthy hair and scalp</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t pull my hair up into a ponytail, twist it into a bun, pin it up or even let it just hang without seeing patches of the original color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>even tho&#x27; during application these gray areas got special attention.</li>
      <li>My hair feels softer than after regular coulouring at the salon and to confirm my good feedback is not just result of my perception of the result</li>
      <li>I have tried other L&#x27;oreal Hair color and they worked great on gray coverage since I have lots of gray hair.  </li>
      <li>super damaged-</li>
      <li>a plus  Time will tell how it wears....whether it fades too quickly with minimum time.  </li>
      <li>I am a loyal L&#x27;Oreal customer.  </li>
      <li>I left this on for the 30 minutes indicated on the package and was very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>The application is easy, it seemed to rinse out well, but my hair is now medium brown and absolutely lifeless.</li>
      <li>If I concentrate very heavily on the parts where my roots are more visible, the color kind of gives them a light brown/blonde look.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many boxed colors and this is by far the bast for making hair FEEL wonderful and covering grey (finally!).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to experiment with my hair.</li>
      <li>The only thing I liked about this product is the scent.  </li>
      <li>Love this natural look it gives.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about having to leave it on for 40 minutes, but it did work.  </li>
      <li>the foam went away, right after application</li>
      <li>I have been dying my own hair for a long time, like 10 years.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Will never never use again. My hair is in horrible condition now. Completely fried it! Worst product I have ever used! Only gave it one star because I had to enter simethin. Would have given it a minus 10 stars.</li>
    <li> Appication was easy and rinsing went very quick. However, did not cover the gray; even tho&#x27; during application these gray areas got special attention.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply- it didn&#x27;t even smell bad! I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but this stuff was that great!</li>
    <li> Usually I read reviews before I decide to buy a product, but this time I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t! This is the best drugstore dye that I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used most of them in the store at one time or another.    First off, this dye ended up being a huge bargain for me because I have hair down to my waist so I always have to buy two boxes and with the more expensive dye that can get to be a bit pricey. Not so with this one! I only needed one box and the mousse covered all of my hair!    As far as applying the dye it was easier than any other dye I&#x27;ve used before. Usually I want to dye my hair, but I dread getting everything out, and making a huge mess. This dye was not messy at all and the pump worked wonderfully. One of the best things about this dye was that while it did foam initially when I put it on, it didn&#x27;t stay foamy like the picture so at first I was worried. But a short time after I put the dye on my hair it actually turned the color that it was supposed to be on the box! With the other dyes I&#x27;ve used, you have no idea what the color will be until you wash it out and you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve missed any spots, but with this one, I knew I would love the color and I could easily see if spots hadn&#x27;t been dyed.    And now for the color itself. It is a couple shades darker then the listed on the box, BUT I just dyed it last night and dyes always blend more after a few days of having them in. I fully believe that the color will lighten to that of the one on the box. I would like to say that I cannot comment about gray coverage though because I don&#x27;t have them, and was just trying to get back to my natural color and get rid of all the roots I have growing out from dying my hair so often.    So I can honestly say this is the best dye I have ever used and it got me back to my natural hair color which I have been searching for for so long. Even though I just dyed it last night, it doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. The color, although a bit darker right now is perfectly naturallooking. Love it!</li>
    <li> The only thing I liked about this product is the scent.  The mousse consistency was horrible and the colorant did not seem evenly dispersed as you dispensed it. I used one of the darker shades to match my natural dark brown color, and to cover some spotty gray hairs.  This hair color actually turned the grays (and my roots from coloring over three months ago) to a shade of burnt orange/brown.  It is so bad, even my husband was laughing at me.  I look like a clown, and will be having to get the color corrected.    Not a happy consumer.</li>
    <li> I just colored my hair with the new L&#x27;oreal Sublime Mousse.  I absolutely love it.  First it is absolutely no mess.  I did not have a single drip on my counter, sink  or floor.  It does not smell bad.  And the absolutely best thing is that it did not stain my scalp or skin.  It also rinsed out in about 3 minutes.  A couple of weeks ago I used the Clairol Foam.  Nightmare.  The Dark Brown shade turned my hair and scalp purple.  It stunk.  I rinsed that out in about 10 minutes because I was so scared by the purple.  Most haircolors take so long to rinse out and because my hair is not  thick I end up with a dark scalp and stains around my hairline.  Not so with the Sublime Mousse.  This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> I am a loyal L&#x27;Oreal customer.  I&#x27;ve been coloring with Preference and Excellence for the last 8 years or so.  I have been extremely happy with how the color is true to the box and how my hair feels after I color.  No so with Healthy Look Sublime Mousse.  There is nothing healthy about it.  My hair literally feels like straw.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen before.  I cannot stand to touch it.  It&#x27;s been a week since I colored and the texture is horrible.  Also, I purchased Iced Dark Brown 41 and it turned out black.  My hair is now jet black with no dimensional color at all.  I&#x27;ve not had to get any hightlights because with the other L&#x27;Oreal products, Preference &amp; Excellence, my grays are a little lighter than the overall color and it looks like I have low lights after I color.  I have naturally very dark brown hair and color with a shade or 2 lighter than my natural color.  My old colorist even says my hair has been looking \\&quot;phenomenal\\&quot; since I started using Preference &amp; Excellence.  I would not receommend the Healthy Look Sublime Mousse at all.  My hair feels horrible and I am really afraid I&#x27;ve damaged it completely.  The color is way too dark.  Big Fail, L&#x27;Oreal! (I&#x27;m signed in as my husband!  It&#x27;s not Christopher who uses hair color, lol)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my drugstore no longer carries the one I usually use(Loreal Healthy Look Gloss). Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you notice is how many precautions you have to take to use this product and how many steps you need to take to ensure the security of the bottle \\&quot;container may burst\\&quot; if you even shake the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is the fact that the product stinks to high heaven; you will want to be in a very well ventilated room to use. Once the color is on, you can&#x27;t take the gloves off and relax for 30 minutes (what happened to 10?) because you will need to continuously \\&quot;massage\\&quot; the hair to keep it from dripping like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making through the grueling half hour of chemical scalp massage, you rinse the product until the water runs clear; this took about 25 minutes and my hair is short and fine. Once you have it rinsed you will notice the hay or dead grass feel of your hair and immediately drench yourself with the Healthy Shine Conditioner (which also stinks to high heaven and somewhat resembles a vaseline/lard mixture)and leave it for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse that out and notice the water is no longer clear, but rinsing the colour of your dye again. Conditioner being out, you will again notice the dead/dry feeling in your hair. I immediately reached for the best conditioner in my arsenal and drenched, leaving it for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair conditioned (still feels hay-like, but not quite as bad) and towel dried I follow up with the blow dryer. After this entire debacle, I comb out my hair and look in the mirror. The results are nothing short of atrocious: The color is not brown, but BLACK and I&#x27;m talking a super fake jet black. It is also streaky and uneven, colours ranging from medium reddish brown to jet black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear, I have 20-something years of home haircolour experience under my belt and started with 85% virgin hair (ends were growing out, dyed med. brown) and extremely healthy when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone who cares at all about their hair. You could get better, more reliable results from a $3 bargain dye. Loreal should take this travesty off the market.to anyone who cares at all about their hair.

    <li> I have been dying my hair for a few years now and I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand in a drug store and a few in Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.   I purchased this one because I was honestly curious. I&#x27;m not afraid to experiment with my hair. I purchased the Iced Dark Brown color which on the box appeared as a very dark brown. Previous to coloring, my hair was a faded light brown.   I have to say, this dye is the easiest application hair dye. The mousse does not drip at all, it&#x27;s much easier to apply too. You don&#x27;t have to worry about sectioning off your hair or anything. Just make sure to massage it in well. The dye doesn&#x27;t smell either.   My only problem was that the brown dye had an undertone of red in it. The foam looked reddish and then when my hair was rinsed and dried, it was a dark brown and black with a lot of red in it.   It just wasn&#x27;t what I was going for.   I recommend this product because of the really easy and even coloring. Honestly the easiest hair dying experience.   We&#x27;ll see whether or not the color fades.</li>
    <li> Application verY easy  Scent appealing  Color when styled is the most pleasant of any previously used( have used many)!  Texture a plus  Time will tell how it wears....whether it fades too quickly with minimum time.  Hope not. Love this natural look it gives.   Thanks for the improvement.  I used one of the blond shades</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night, and I love the color.  It&#x27;s a noticeable difference without being too drastic.  Next time I may even go darker, but I will stick with Loreal.</li>
    <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal products for YEARS and have been extremely pleased with the results.  I had a coupon for this new line and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It seemed strange how it was so DRY going on, even after massaging it into my hair.  I followed the directions to the letter and not only did it NOT cover ANY of my gray, it also didn&#x27;t cover my grow out.  I most definitly WILL NEVER purchase this line again, I&#x27;ll stick to Preference, which works GREAT!</li>
    <li> Last Friday, I purchased a box of L&#x27;Oreal Feria hair color got excited about coloring and found out the developer bottle wasn&#x27;t included. Called L&#x27;Oreal and they sent me a coupon. Went to a different store this morning and was disappointed with the L&#x27;Oreal selection overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally decided on this since a friend had highly recommended it. I was very disappointed. While it foamed as it was squirted from the bottle, the instructions didn&#x27;t make this clear so I thought it would actually turn into a foam in the bottle. I didn&#x27;t care for squirting it into my hand and then applying as it didn&#x27;t seem like it did a good job of covering my hair where it was needed and it never foamed in my hair as the instructions indicated so some disconnect there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept it on for 30-40 minutes and then rinsed. The grey which is mostly at my part at my forehead and some occasional strands along the part line was only slightly colored. I ended up putting more on in that area and on the hair by my ears. Waited about 10 minutes and it looks OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it didn&#x27;t really make my hair any blonder or update my roots and in general left my hair kind of blah. Maybe as the summer sun shines on it, it&#x27;ll get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a holdover so I don&#x27;t have to pay the salon so I don&#x27;t expect perfection just more than the mousse did.</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of the mousse but it was a big disapointment and it doesnt cover the grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;First,  the chemical smell is scary strong -- so much that it made me hesitate to go on with the job.  I was worried about what it would do to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I did finish applying the mousse to my grey roots... I did not find it very easy to apply to the rest of my shoulder length hair.  During the 30 minute ( ! )  wait, the dye was dripping down my cheek - I thought the mousse was supposed to prevent that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it did not cover the grey  -- more like it \\&quot;tinted\\&quot; the grey.  Dont waste you money on this product.  There are other brands that work better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2 weeks after using this product, the dye has completely washed out.  I need to start again from scratch.  Not happy as I fear over processing.</li>
    <li> I was 18 when my hair started graying, so I&#x27;ve had plenty of practice coloring it.  Tried Sublime Mousse to see if it was easier to get the back of my head and other places that can be easy to miss.  Will be going back to Excellence.    First, the instructions were clear and easy, but the gloves packed with the color were so thin and cheap I threw them away and used latex gloves purchased from the drugstore.    As previously stated, the \\&quot;mousse\\&quot; is rather thin and wimpy, and though it wasn&#x27;t hard to apply, as the bubbles gave up the ghost, I couldn&#x27;t always tell where I&#x27;d applied and where I hadn&#x27;t.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel better when I rinsed it out, as one reviewer stated, but rather felt dry and tangled before I used the conditioner.    The biggest disappointment was the gray coverage, or rather the lack of gray coverage.  My roots are obviously lighter than the rest of my hair, and I need to color it again, even though I just did it this morning.  If \\&quot;dimensional color\\&quot; means the lighter areas will still be lighter than the dark ones, they&#x27;re right.  Touble is, my light areas are my white roots, which are now blondish roots against my mid-brown hair.  Not a good look.    If you have a few grays (very few) it might work.  For more than a few, choose Excellence or Preference.  Sublime Mousse does not cover gray.</li>
    <li> Just on time. Works good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Sublime Mousse in two different shades.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, however I do find the odor a bit over-powering. No drips, stains, etc. However, it doesn&#x27;t even begin to cover the gray.  I used to have my hair cut and colored every 4 weeks because I like to keep up with the gray roots.  But, because of the cost, and the economy, I decided to stretch my color out to every 8 weeks, and touch it up myself every other month.  It does an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; job because I have a short cut and my roots don&#x27;t show very much because of this.  It gets me through to my next salon color, but barely.  If I concentrate very heavily on the parts where my roots are more visible, the color kind of gives them a light brown/blonde look.  But, no matter how much of the color I use on my short hair, there is lot of untouched gray if I run my fingers through the layers of my hair.  I would never use this product at all if it was the only product I was using to color my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried two different shades....#53 &amp; #50.  I think I may try a different brand next time.  It&#x27;s a shame too, because it is so very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use the Pure Black one... It turned my hair dark pink!!!! The foam was a breeze to put on, and I didn&#x27;t get any stains, but it didn&#x27;t work well at all!! I am never going to use a L&#x27;oreal product again, and neither will my friends and family...</li>
    <li> I read so many negative comments here, however was tired of not finding a good hairdresser to colour my hair for the last few years, so this month when my white roots were out and quite visible in contrast with my dark ends i decided to do it myself with the l&#x27;oreal mouse which i have purchased months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I must say the application was easy and the end result amazing! My white roots are covered and as i have purchased enough boxes of this product i got a good coverage and on the ends of the hair. My hair feels softer than after regular coulouring at the salon and to confirm my good feedback is not just result of my perception of the result, my colleagues all congratulated me on the beautiful, deep and shiny hair colour i have. I strongly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that i am with dark hair and if i was with blond i would never do this at home, because its quite risky in two aspects: getting the colour wrong, or if you achieve teh desired shade of blond your hair to be super damaged- but these are the risks of having blond hair colouing at home...</li>
    <li> Have just used the L&#x27;Oreal Mousse!  Love it!   The ease of Mousse application is an absolute Godsend!  I hated the old way, squeezing the application bottle, and adding another 20 mins. to the process to get the stuff on your hair.  I like the L&#x27;Oreal product better than Nice &#x27;n Easy, which I used last time, it had a horrible smell.</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair product I have ever used.  I chose Medium Brown the same as my natural hair color and it turned out a very dark brown, with black parts in between, with my natural color underneath!  It didn&#x27;t cover my gray hair at all, and has left my hair multicolored.  Also, unlike other hair dyes I have used it left my hair very dull and dry.  Before I used this product my hair looked shiny and healthy.  Very disappointed and will never use this product again.     Update:  I washed my hair every day for 4 weeks and it barely faded.  I went to a salon to have it fixed as I could not do it myself.  It cost me $150.  So mad about this hair color, should have gone to the salon instead then I would have saved $80 + $9.00 for crappy hair color.</li>
    <li> I used the # 30 dark brown color on my dark brown hair. It turned my hair almost black and I liked the look of it but my hair felt very brittle after the first coloring. The color faded quite fast and the gray coverage wasn&#x27;t great. I did a second coloring 7weeks later and started noticing abnormal hair loss. My hair feels like straw and they are now super thin. I am not sure if this hair loss is a direct consequence of me dying my hair but I am sure it doesn&#x27;t help...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for years, switching between the salon and using box dyes.  I thought I would give this a try since it looked easier to apply than the traditional squeeze bottle dye, and I was right.  I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t read these reviews before I bought it.  I don&#x27;t have gray hair, so I cannot speak to its ability to cover that, but I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  My hair is naturally dirty blonde, and I used Pure Black.  I only needed to do my roots.  The foam was very easy to spread onto my roots, and to make sure I covered all of them.  A bit after you rub it in, the foam-ness goes away, and it turns dark, so you can see where it hasn&#x27;t been yet.  This was a lot easier than using the squirtbottle that other dyes come with, as my hair is very long and thick.  It didn&#x27;t drip at all, and it was super easy keeping my bathroom clean as I did this.  The smell was a mild version of all other dyes.  The reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was difficult to spread it onto my lengths.  I didn&#x27;t need to dye them, but I always run some through at the end just as a touch up.  I&#x27;m sure glad I didn&#x27;t need to dye all of my hair, because that would have taken forever and a day, and probably 3 boxes total (I ended up using 2, which is typical for my hair length).  It didn&#x27;t seem to spread easily at all here.  The color turned out great, very even, and no missed spots.  I know other reviewers said theirs turned out darker than the box, so I also can&#x27;t comment on that since I go black.  As a bonus, the spots on my skin that were stained seemed to come clean a lot easier than other dyes I&#x27;ve used.  As some other reviewers said, my hair did feel dry after I rinsed.  But honestly, it felt the way my hair always feels after it&#x27;s been dyed, whether with any box dye I&#x27;ve ever used, or in a salon.  I used the conditioner that came with the dye, and also used a leave in conditioner afterward.  My hair feels fine now.   Overall, I will definitely get this again for future root touch ups.  If I needed to dye all of my hair, I would avoid this product unless your hair is shorter and/or thinner.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a fairly easy to use product, it&#x27;s definitely not as messy as some other hair color I have used in the past.  My main gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t cover grey well at all.  I have thick dark brown hair so my grey really stands out.  Even though I made sure I covered the grey areas fist and very well there are still a couple of spots where my grey looks almost white and I used #30 pure darkest brown.  Considering that they grey coverage is the reason why I color my hair in the first place, I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I wish the result were better because I loved the ease of applying the mousse as it was easy to evenly spread the mousse all over my scalp. The scent was also pleasant. I found the color was not as strong as traditional hair dyes and I have stubborn grays that need re dying about every 3 weeks and unfortunately this dye only seems to be lasting 2 weeks at the most. I also only wash my hair every 2-3 days to prolong the life of dyes as well as keep my hair moisturized. I&#x27;ll be going back to my Loreal Feria dyes after this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair at home for years, with pretty good success.  I thought I&#x27;d try this product since it&#x27;s new.  After I followed all the directions and rinsed it out, I could see that it barely covered my gray roots at all.  Some parts are barely covered, and some look just like they did before I colored it!  I won&#x27;t be using this product again, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my own hair for a long time, like 10 years.  I&#x27;ve dyed it all sorts of colors with all sorts of brands and this is by far and away the worst I have ever tried.  I&#x27;m naturally dark blonde and decided to go dark again.  The mousse didn&#x27;t really foam around the roots like the box claims and you can tell my roots are a lighter color and this is the first day I dyed it.  The mousse made precision dying around the edges of my hair difficult.  But the worst part is that my hair feels GROSS.  Its dull and totally damaged now.  I used to have soft hair and now it feels stiff and like straw.  Most of the time when you dye your hair it feels softer after.  I don&#x27;t know if the conditioner sucked or if the chemicals are harsher because it&#x27;s a mousse but either way my hair is really, really damaged now.  I&#x27;m really upset.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another product by L&#x27;Oreal! I am so displeased and dissatisfied! My hair is naturally a light blonde, but I wanted to go a shade darker, so I purchased Golden Medium Blonde (83).  After rinsing the product out of my hair, I realised my hair had turned brown! I had to go to the salon and the stylist told me the only thing she could do was do a color cleanse (bleach the hair with 40 vol) and highlight my hair.  The grand total was $250.  When I called L&#x27;Oreal, they said I should&#x27;ve called them rather than going to PROFESSIONALS at a salon.  They said they would&#x27;ve recommended washing my hair repeatedly until the colour came out.  (P.S., L&#x27;Oreal - that would take about a month of continuous washing!).  They said they would not reimburse me for my salon expenses, but would refund the price of the \\&quot;Sublime\\&quot; Mousse and send me coupons.  I told them I would like the refund but they could keep their coupons.  I will never by another L&#x27;Oreal product, hair nor makeup products!</li>
    <li> The box stated that it&#x27;s permanent, but it faded extremely fast. That&#x27;s about the only line of hair dye that doesn&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s shocking because Loreal does so well with facial products.</li>
    <li> I have tried other L&#x27;oreal Hair color and they worked great on gray coverage since I have lots of gray hair.  I thought this should be similar except it is a mousse instead of creme which I am used to buying.  It was very easy to mix, just swish the bottle and do NOT shake it.  It was hard getting use to when applying since the mousse was so airy and fluffy and was more of a brown instead of black color so I didn&#x27;t know if I applied enough. After finishing applying, it did turned black. It took 30 minutes to wait which was a LOT longer than other hair color products I use. It was quicker to rinse out the color. After drying, I noticed my gray roots were not as dark as the rest of the hair. It was noticeably like a light brown instead of black. This is not a good hair product if you want to cover gray hairs.</li>
    <li> I have medium blonde hair and have used L&#x27;Oreal products very successfully. I loved Dream Blonde, but, of course, they discontinue the good stuff. Feria is also very good but they seem to be phasing that out. Thought I&#x27;d try the new mousse. Big mistake. The application is easy, it seemed to rinse out well, but my hair is now medium brown and absolutely lifeless. Usually I enjoy added body after I color, but not so with this stuff. Limp, dull and dark. VERY DISAPPOINTED and wondering what is L&#x27;Oreal thinking with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair at home for over 10 years and this is the first time I use a mousse dye.  I used this product according to the instructions, even leaving it on longer than the designated time.  My hair was a medium brown from a different brand, and i used medium golden brown (#53) of the Sublime Mouse.  This dye did not even lighten my current color.  My roots were still my natural color.  I thought I would try this product because it seemed easier to apply than traditional hair color.  But it took the same amount of time to dye my hair.  Stick to traditional hair dye.  It might drip but it actually works, unlike this mousse.</li>
    <li> I first tried this color last year and was very unhappy with it as it did not color the roots at all.  Yesterday my usual brand was out of my color and this was on sale so I thought maybe last time was a fluke; I should try again.  BIG HUGE mistake.  If anything the results this time are even worse.  I am going to have to color my hair again this weekend - total waste of my time &amp; money.</li>
    <li> I experienced poor results when using this hair dye. I have about 15 white hair strands and instead of pulling them out, I chose to try and dye them out. No one around me sees the white strands, but whenever I look in a mirror they are all I can see.  I chose a shade that was about my natural color, \\&quot;pure dark blonde.\\&quot; I proceeded to follow the directions and my hair turned darker! It&#x27;s now a light brown, and all my white hairs are completely unchanged. The overall darker hair makes my white hairs stand out even more!  This product is a failure.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;mousse\\&quot; is easy to apply, but the gray coverage of this product is non-existent.  It turned my gray roots a horrible brassy color, so now they are even more noticeable than before.  My hair is now two different shades and looks awful.  Off to Sally&#x27;s for a toner, I suppose.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions accordingly and it covered what needed to be covered and it lasted and held very well. When I washed my hair it was still holding on, though it was getting close to needing a touch up, it was just that, a touch up only, but not a full cover. I liked up and will be buying it again. The price with the shipping and handling comes to about what it cost in the stores with the tax including from the stores, it&#x27;s a little more at there . This is more affordable, I like it.</li>
    <li> My hair is dark brown, I used 623 light brown, and after 40min, it did NOTHING to my hair! total waste of money...</li>
    <li> Tried this dye because I loved the color on the box. Unfortunately it died my light auburn hair jet black. Also, the chemical burned my ears and my hair feels like straw. I usually dye my hair every 2-3 months and typically my hair looks and feels healthier and shinier than before the dye. My hair is matte and crunchy now, yuk.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair and was attempting to go to medium brown using this new mousse. It did not even lighten or color my hair one bit. I think the foam is very weak and had no effect. Worst hair color I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair dye I have ever used.  My hair is damaged and the color is dark, dull and mousy.  The mousse was not easy to put on at all.  I cannot see how anyone likes it.  It takes TWO hands to pump the bottle when it gets all soupy and the mousse doesn&#x27;t get to the roots.  I was in this color up to my elbows trying to get it all over my head.  Never again will I attempt another dye besides my good ol&#x27; standards.</li>
    <li> The packaging looked good and I&#x27;ve used EXCELLENCE for years so I gave it a try.  BIG mistake.  I used \\&quot;medium golden blonde\\&quot; and it turned out orange and dried my hair out completely. Steer clear of this one.</li>
    <li> I have black hair with very resistant grey in the front and along the part. I left this on for the 30 minutes indicated on the package and was very pleased with the results. I&#x27;ve tried many boxed colors and this is by far the bast for making hair FEEL wonderful and covering grey (finally!). I love the mousse as it doesn&#x27;t run or get all over the place. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am deeply disappointed with this application. I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to home hair coloring. I&#x27;ve only used henna twice and didn&#x27;t like how orange it made my hair so decided to try coloring it. I&#x27;m a natural redhead, strawberry blonde, but at my age and with the multitude of perms (mostly bad ones) in my younger days, the color has been replaced by white for a dirty blonde. Although this was a bit too much, I&#x27;m not faulting the manufacturer (although supplying samples at the store would be very helpful). The chief complaint I have is the product&#x27;s lack of foam and lather. I was careful to follow the directions implicitly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not go on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;When the foam went away, right after application, I couldn&#x27;t get it to lather as was instructed. It became sticky.&lt;br /&gt;While I \\&quot;attacked\\&quot; the whitest/grayist part of my hair, the front, there are still tufts of blondish-white.&lt;br /&gt;I had help applying the color to the back since my hair is very long, and there are strands that look like they were never touched even though we&#x27;re sure they were well coated.&lt;br /&gt;The unevenness of color has no rhyme, no reason. I can&#x27;t pull my hair up into a ponytail, twist it into a bun, pin it up or even let it just hang without seeing patches of the original color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend nor will I buy and use the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Mousse haircolor again.</li>
    <li> There are two great items included in this packet. 1) the color covers grey like nobody&#x27;s business. I have corse thick hair and I am here to tell you this works down to the roots! This product provides consistency! You know what you are getting with this product each and every time.  2) the Sublime Mousse is phenomenal! It hydrates you hair after coloring and shampooing. L&#x27;Oreal makes sure we are satisfied by providing enough of this mousse to get you through until your next color on average 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I used to pay over $250.00 at the salon very 10 wks and was only satisfied with the color on occasion. I have been using this product for over a year. Anyone not satisfied may not have a need to cover grey or have hair that takes color easy. Thank you L&#x27;Oreal for providing a superior product that can be used at home.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time, and wanted a dark brown color.  In the past, because I frequently color my hair, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of dark brown colors turn my ends almost black.  But I really didn&#x27;t want any red this time so i took a chance with the Iced Dark Brown.  It is a gorgeous dark brown color!  Not black at all.  So I will definitely use this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I almost felt like one package wasn&#x27;t enough.  It was enough but I literally used it all, and I have shortish hair.  Also, not the best coverage of my gray hairs...they are already showing through after one week.  I know grays are hard to cover, but usually get better coverage than this.&lt;br /&gt;The mousse formula does make it easy to use.</li>
    <li> Covered my grey that no one dye will. I love how it&#x27;s not super &amp;#34;goth&amp;#34; dark. Will be buying again when needed! Super easy to apply :)</li>
    <li> I used a Brazilian hair straightener treatment 5 weeks ago and it worked fantastic...since then I&#x27;ve had to avoid any shampoo or conditioner containing salt/sodium chloride, I needed to do my roots today- and I just used this mousse...most of it is written in other languages it is hard to find the English...I can&#x27;t find ingredients on it at all nor for the balsam...so I googled and yeah balsam is fine...however the bloomin colourant isn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;it even says if you&#x27;ve used a straightener treatment to wait 2 weeks...but it should be clear that it contains the one ingredient that will ruin that treatment...lets face it- in a hairdresser they charge £150 for that treatment, so I think this product is rubbish!</li>
    <li> I have really dark hair (almost black), and a lot of gray.  I read the reviews, and someone mentioned that she called the company and the representative told her that in order to really cover gray, you have to leave it on for 40 minutes.  That&#x27;s what I did, and it worked.  I&#x27;m not crazy about having to leave it on for 40 minutes, but it did work.  It did a great job at covering the gray, and the product itself doesn&#x27;t drip, which is really helpful given the time required.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural dark auburn. I&#x27;ve used semi-permanent \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Healthy Look\\&quot; about 2 months ago and it was such a flattering and pleasant experience that I decided to dye my hair black again permanently. It was such a bad decision, it looks horrible, fake, with a hint of blue. Now, I get too much attention from trashy people on the streets, and very ashamed to put my hair down and wearing my sun glasses on my head to cover this disaster. But not only the color looks unnatural and inappropriate, the formula is really bad. I&#x27;ve always had pretty healthy hair and scalp and I&#x27;ve been using other hair dyes for lighter shades (non-L&#x27;oreal) every 2 months without any noticeable effect, but now it feels like my hair is falling out at a rapid pace...</li>
