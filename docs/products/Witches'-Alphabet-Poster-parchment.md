    <li> A Witch&#x27;s alphabet...not THE Witches Alphabet. This is called the Theban Alphabet..there are others. I prefer the Seax Wiccan Runes, a new name for the Anglo Saxon runes. Much easier to use  for sigils and place on candles and tools...easier to use for spell work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a poster..and you can go on the internet and get a collection of the different alphabets, for free.</li>
