      <li>okay</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;Out of Africa Lemon Verbena body lotion</li>
      <li>Very feminine and fresh, especially in warm weather.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>Very rich.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and soft and the scent is so calming and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>a fresh nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>The ingredients used are organic and cruelty-free, and the company also makes some other wonderful products.</li>
      <li>Not too sweet!</li>
      <li>I like the Out of Africa line of products in general, but this lotions is very good for moisturizing and it&#x27;s natural and it smells nice.  </li>
      <li>Ingredients do NOT list verbena, so probably not named accurately.</li>
      <li>Light scented yet scintillating enough that after a shower absoutely EVERYBODY comments on it&#x27;s great fresh citrusy scent.</li>
      <li>May buy again (still looking for a true lemon VERBENA that does not cost a fortune).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hydrating but not greasy, scent is true and it lasts.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this body lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion, especially for special ocassion use.</li>
      <li>I personally use the  Lemon Verbena and I absolutely love the scent.  </li>
      <li>I used to be able to find in at my local supermarket, but they phased it out.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of a lotion that I used to buy at Bath and Body Works called Limelight that they introduced when the store first opened.  </li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s new and full it will come out</li>
      <li>and when I use this shower gel, I don&#x27;t even need to apply lotion afterwards because the shower gel is so rich and creamy and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s is very lemon-limey.  </li>
      <li>This shower gel works well for me and leaves me moisturized for the whole day.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product, the quality and the smell</li>
      <li>Also, it really works on itchy skin.</li>
      <li>No wonder Lemon Verbena was such a popular scent back in the day when our grandmothers or great-grandmothers wore it.</li>
      <li>(everything I fall in love with eventually disappears and will usually get replaced with something that doesn&#x27;t work as well).  </li>
      <li>I have no clue why, but the picture attached to the shower gel on this page is that of some plastic looking action figurines.  </li>
      <li>Plus the moisture really does last for hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also all natural and vegan (if that sweetens the pot for you).    </li>
      <li>It is a bit expensive for me to use as my &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; lotion, but I love it otherwise!</li>
      <li>Very lemony, not much of the verbena.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, the lotion is sort of thin and the hydration is just so so, but I kept and didn&#x27;t mind sharing with my friends as a gift.</li>

<li> It was going to be my once in a while lotion, and it&#x27;s turning into my everyday lotion!</li>
<li> The lotion is just a little too thick making it difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
<li> I am afraid that I would not buy it again because that feature made it too annoying to use daily.</li>
<li> you can&#x27;t go wrong here</li>
<li> crazy cause</li>
<li> Someone wrote on here that they aren&#x27;t too crazy about the scent.  </li>
<li> and it lathers like crazy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This scent smells so nice.  My skin looks better. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I use this shower gel every day.  I used to be able to find in at my local supermarket, but they phased it out.  Now I buy the bottles on Amazon.  I stock up like crazy cause I don&#x27;t know when they are going to be taken off the market (everything I fall in love with eventually disappears and will usually get replaced with something that doesn&#x27;t work as well).  I have terribly dry and cracked skin and when I use this shower gel, I don&#x27;t even need to apply lotion afterwards because the shower gel is so rich and creamy and leaves my skin so soft.  These are pricy, but you need so little every time you shower.  I use a shower puff and I only need to apply an amount the size of a nickle on the puff and it lathers like crazy.  Someone wrote on here that they aren&#x27;t too crazy about the scent.  I personally use the  Lemon Verbena and I absolutely love the scent.  It&#x27;s is very lemon-limey.  It reminds me of a lotion that I used to buy at Bath and Body Works called Limelight that they introduced when the store first opened.  The scent lasted only a few months and then disappeared.  Back then, their lotions actually worked well, but over the years their ingredients have cheapened and they don&#x27;t moisturize like they used to.  But I digress.  This shower gel works well for me and leaves me moisturized for the whole day.  It&#x27;s also all natural and vegan (if that sweetens the pot for you).    PS.  I have no clue why, but the picture attached to the shower gel on this page is that of some plastic looking action figurines.  The bottle is a translucent brown color with a greenish yellow label that has an orange box in the center with a black giraffe inside of it and the words \\&quot;Out Of Africa\\&quot; in white.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very effective, goes on smoothly and has a light, pleasant fragrance. I also like the fact that it&#x27;s bringing a means of support to a group of women in Benin (West Africa) who also give part of the proceeds to education there. The ingredients used are organic and cruelty-free, and the company also makes some other wonderful products.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, especially for special ocassion use. It is a bit expensive for me to use as my &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; lotion, but I love it otherwise!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a wonderful aroma. Also, it really works on itchy skin. It is a bit thick, but I like that as it really covers well. It can be hard to get out of the bottle when it is near the bottom.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, the quality and the smell is a perfect lemon. No too sweet or strong.&lt;br /&gt;However, because the lotion is thick, it is impossible to get out of this type of bottle. When it&#x27;s new and full it will come out okay but once you are half way or less I am literally banging it on my hand to get the lotion to come out. You need to get a pump type of bottle for this lotion. I am afraid that I would not buy it again because that feature made it too annoying to use daily. Please re-do this in a different type of bottle!</li>
    <li> Got in the mail today and like it. Nicely emollient&lt;br /&gt;and a fresh nice smell to it. Not too sweet!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion!  I just wish the smell lasted longer.  But it sure smells good when you first put it on!  My husband loves the smell too.  He says he can smell it on me even after  a few hours but I can&#x27;t.  But I&#x27;m having it auto shipped every few months!</li>
    <li> Awesome fresh lemony scent, whether it&#x27;s the body wash (heavenly with shea butter softness) or the body lotion. Light scented yet scintillating enough that after a shower absoutely EVERYBODY comments on it&#x27;s great fresh citrusy scent. No wonder Lemon Verbena was such a popular scent back in the day when our grandmothers or great-grandmothers wore it. Very feminine and fresh, especially in warm weather. Yummy.</li>
    <li> This smells so good leaves your skin feeling like silk I love the body  wash the hand soap and the body lotion you can&#x27;t go wrong here</li>
    <li> The lotion is everything it&#x27;s advertised to be.  It was going to be my once in a while lotion, and it&#x27;s turning into my everyday lotion!</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift. I love the smell, the lotion is sort of thin and the hydration is just so so, but I kept and didn&#x27;t mind sharing with my friends as a gift.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this body lotion.  It&#x27;s luxurious, not overly priced and moisturizes without feeling greasy.  It smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Very lemony, not much of the verbena. Ingredients do NOT list verbena, so probably not named accurately. Very rich. May buy again (still looking for a true lemon VERBENA that does not cost a fortune).</li>
    <li> Fantastic....creamy....lemony....</li>
    <li> This lotion is incredible!  It makes my skin feel smooth and soft and the scent is so calming and beautiful.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have not tried this product myself but have been meaning to.  I gave it as a gift to my mother.  She really likes it but claims it is too small of a bottle</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! Smells so good! My hubby asked me if I&#x27;d been slicing lemons. LOL. Plus the moisture really does last for hours.</li>
    <li> very nice.  Love the lemon scent</li>
    <li> Very Nice and the Smell is wonderful I am getting more</li>
    <li> Nice, tangy scent. The lotion is just a little too thick making it difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Especially love the scent .... can be picked up on my clothing too!!  Terrific ... and I recommend it ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat:  Good thing each bottle was packaged in sealed plastic bags.  I ordered multiple bottles and the lid on each had flipped open and lotion leaked - I scraped it from the inside of the bags and used it anyway.  The Amazon packaging was far too loose for this product - no special cushioning - so I think it was an Amazon problem rather than a product problem.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I like the Out of Africa line of products in general, but this lotions is very good for moisturizing and it&#x27;s natural and it smells nice.  I buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hydrating but not greasy, scent is true and it lasts. LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;Out of Africa Lemon Verbena body lotion</li>
    <li> As with the tubes of hand cream, this product has a wonderful fragrance and the body lotion is gentle and enhances the smoothness of my skin.  Totally recommend</li>
