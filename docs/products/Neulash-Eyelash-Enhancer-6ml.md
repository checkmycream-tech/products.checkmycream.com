      <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to buy this product.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product to quickly grow long lashes.</li>
      <li>but Neulash is proving to be a fabulous product.  </li>
      <li>I used this product several years ago with great results, my lashes were thicker and longer.</li>
      <li>I was considering getting extensions for an important photo shoot, but didn&#x27;t get around to it.</li>
      <li>&amp; it really works.&lt;br /&gt;But to work effectively it must be used</li>
      <li>as good as the old &amp;#34;Revitalash&amp;#34; used to be.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The eyelashes did grow, but the eyes in general did not look good, so what is the point?</li>
      <li>They are so long and thick..Very happy</li>
      <li>I originally saw it on a friend (she told me about Neulash)</li>
      <li>and I was able to see fast results.</li>
      <li>love this product really works well</li>
      <li>It worked quickly and my lashes are longer and fuller.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, my lashes came back fuller, thicker and twice the length of my original lashes before the extensions.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a tough critic and super impressed.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;ve generally found Neulash to work well on my eyebrows, I have actually found Nutra Luxe Lash MD Beauty Eyelash Conditioner to be a better product for filling in my eyebrows (and a better price).</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>Neulash really works!</li>
      <li>LiLash will always be my favorite (I actually thought I would have to start trimming my lashes)</li>
      <li>After a month of consistent use, there has been no change.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a month now and definitely see that my eyelashes are becoming thicker.  </li>
      <li>My lashes are so long I may need to trim them! :)</li>
      <li>My new tube came right away.</li>
      <li>I have been using for about 4 years and it works great to keep my lashes from being so thin.</li>
      <li>I like it so much</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really need mascara.  </li>
      <li>and I really didn&#x27;t think it would work that well for me as well.</li>
      <li>I think because I have very curly eyelashes</li>
      <li>So it was kind of waste of money.</li>
      <li>I read where the original Rapid Lash had the same ingredient as Latisse but FDA</li>
      <li>This stuff keeps them looking real and natural.</li>
      <li>I used to get it at my local med spa, but they get a higher profit margin from selling Latisse.</li>
      <li>So, a few months later, having tried Neulash with great results previously, I tried it again.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see significant growth in lashes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since mid February, &amp; much to my surprise my lashes hv thickened &amp; lengthened...</li>
      <li>; disclaimer: I have really sensitive eyes.  </li>
      <li>the results are no where near what they used to be.</li>
      <li>It made my eye red, puffy, itchy and in general very irritated.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see results as quickly as I did when I used the product several years ago, but holy cow it&#x27;s just now starting to work after about 90 days, just as advertised.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an excellent product to quickly grow long lashes. I&#x27;ve even been asked if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It really works! My lashes are longer and thicker than they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Its amazing what it&#x27;s done for my eyelashes.  They are so long and thick..Very happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> No, this did not work.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years.  Am frequently asked if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I was using Rapid Lash for the past few years but it stopped producing results (lashes went back to original state).  I read where the original Rapid Lash had the same ingredient as Latisse but FDA required that this ingredient be removed but not sure of the ins and outs....Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been using Neulash for about two (2) weeks and have noted some improvement so I just bought another one.  Once lashes reach desired stage, the instructions state it can be used every other day which is allow it to go a bit further (I also started using it on my brows; didn&#x27;t see a need to purchase the one for brows since the ingredients are the same or at least I think that they are.).</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  Results took a good 3 weeks to see but I am more than a month in and I am very happy with this product.  I would definitely get it again.</li>
    <li> HOLY SMOKES!!! Amazing. I tried Latisse and eye lash extensions and this surpasses. I&#x27;m a tough critic and super impressed. It worked quickly and my lashes are longer and fuller. I originally saw it on a friend (she told me about Neulash) and I really didn&#x27;t think it would work that well for me as well.</li>
    <li> The best product I have ever purchased on line!!!  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and once again, the Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat. Im 49 years old and lashes are very short and thin. I was using latisse...(which works too) but when I began using neulash in its stead, my lashes became fuller. This size tube lasts me about nine months with daily use. Well worth the price and less expensive than latisse. I read product contents and neulash has ingredients the less expensive ones don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It made my eye red, puffy, itchy and in general very irritated. I used it for two weeks suffering through thinking that the reaction would go away, but it did not. The eyelashes did grow, but the eyes in general did not look good, so what is the point? The eyes stayed red for weeks. I&#x27;m afraid to re-start using the product. So it was kind of waste of money.</li>
    <li> I depend on customer reviews when buying items such as this,  Neulash and Neubrow are the only brands that have worked for me and I began to use them when I had no eyebrows and minimum lashes. I can actually go shopping without makeup now.</li>
    <li> Neulash really works!</li>
    <li> My new tube came right away.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve generally found Neulash to work well on my eyebrows, I have actually found Nutra Luxe Lash MD Beauty Eyelash Conditioner to be a better product for filling in my eyebrows (and a better price).</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product but the price was reasonable and I was desperate. My lashes have always been short so I decided to get lash extensions. But after a couple of times, my lashes broke and were even shorter. I bought this product and decided to give it at least 60 days, as recommended by another reviewer. But after two weeks, I noticed that my lashes were longer and fuller. It&#x27;s been four weeks now and they&#x27;re even longer. I put the serum on my bottom lashes as well because they are non-existent and those have also grown. This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really did notice a differance in my eyelashes lenght, not a huge one though. I think because I have very curly eyelashes they can only get so long but this product does work. I have been using for just over a month and will be ordering another tube.</li>
    <li> Magic!!!!!! Took about a month to begin to show results. My lashes are so long I may need to trim them! :)</li>
    <li> I used Neulash years ago with amazing results.  Then all of a sudden I was no longer able to find the product.  I assumed it was related to the Latisse lawsuits eliminating its competition.  I tried Latisse and discontinued using it because it burned my eyes.  I was so happy to find Neulash again.  I purchased it April 12th &amp; have applied it regularly.  I didn&#x27;t see results as quickly as I did when I used the product several years ago, but holy cow it&#x27;s just now starting to work after about 90 days, just as advertised.  So don&#x27;t give up because it does work.  I regularly see an esthetician for facials &amp; lash tints.  Yesterday was my appointment &amp; she kept commenting on my lashes.  She didn&#x27;t comment 4 weeks ago at my last appointment, so that is what I mean when I say the growth just kicked in all of a sudden.  I am so happy.</li>
    <li> I think this is the only treatment without prescription on the market that works. I used to have ordinary lashes now I can wake up and look like I have make up on. They actually brash against sunglasses and they are dark as if mascara is on. You know the lashes you used to have when a child? Fluffy, dark and long. This is what you get</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the difference this has made! My lashes are thicker and longer after using less than a month!</li>
    <li> Even though I read the reviews and the comments were excellent, I thought it was too good to be true.  I bought this as an experiment, I plucked my eyebrows and part of my left eyebrow had no hair in it.  I can now see tiny hairs pushing through.  I am glad I decided to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Love it in 2 weeks I saw a noticable difference! I would recommend this product! It&#x27;s life changing!👍</li>
    <li> Very easy to use &amp; it really works.&lt;br /&gt;But to work effectively it must be used consistently.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase of this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey, but does last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I often can compliments on how long my lashes are.</li>
    <li> I am very, very happy with my lash &amp;#34;gains!&amp;#34; They&#x27;re not 2&amp;#34; long, but at 64, I&#x27;m thrilled to have thicker lashes than I&#x27;ve had in years!</li>
    <li> love this product really works well and I was able to see fast results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.  I got no irritations from it, and it did enhance my lashes.</li>
    <li> I was using LiLash before Latisse started their lawsuits to stop all competition.  I LOVED LiLash but couldn&#x27;t purchase it anymore.  I reluctantly tried Neulash and have to admit I&#x27;m very impressed with the results.  BE PATIENT.  This can take 60-90 days before you see noticeable results.  LiLash will always be my favorite (I actually thought I would have to start trimming my lashes) but Neulash is proving to be a fabulous product.  I get my lashes tinted once a month since I have blond eyelashes and with Neulash I don&#x27;t really need mascara.  Again, it can take up to 90 days to notice the difference so don&#x27;t give up.</li>
    <li> I used this product several years ago with great results, my lashes were thicker and longer. Not sure if they changed anything but I&#x27;ve been using this product again for 3 months now and the results are no where near what they used to be.</li>
    <li> I have noticed such a difference using this!  I had been considering lash extensions but no longer need them!  Only very minor irritation on occasion which goes away within a few minutes; disclaimer: I have really sensitive eyes.  I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> This product does work and you will see a difference. In all my research it is best and safest on your eyes. If you want out of control long lashes then this product isn&#x27;t for you. If you want just a little improvement it does work.</li>
    <li> as good as the old &amp;#34;Revitalash&amp;#34; used to be.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see significant growth in lashes.  A friend has used this and her&#x27;s are long and thick,  Was told it doesn&#x27;t happen&lt;br /&gt;fast.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash enhancing serum I have ever used</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and definitely see that my eyelashes are becoming thicker.  Cannot wait to see what another couple of months of using Neulash will do to my lashes.</li>
    <li> Is realy amazing. I like it so much</li>
    <li> It takes a couple weeks but I totaly notice an increase in my lash length!!</li>
    <li> This item did not change or enhance my eyelashes whatsoever. After a month of consistent use, there has been no change.</li>
    <li> Buy this product and you will be amazed with the results.  My lashes were completely destroyed and broken off to little stubs after wearing lash extensions.  I needed to nourish them to bring them back and purchased and used the neuLash product.  This stuff is amazing, my lashes came back fuller, thicker and twice the length of my original lashes before the extensions.  I won&#x27;t be without this product ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 4 years and it works great to keep my lashes from being so thin. I have always had long lashes, but my thyroidism has caused them to fall out and be patchy. This stuff keeps them looking real and natural.</li>
    <li> This works! My lashes were so stubby last year, I had nothing to use my curler or mascara on! I was considering getting extensions for an important photo shoot, but didn&#x27;t get around to it. So, a few months later, having tried Neulash with great results previously, I tried it again. I get so many compliments. People at work have asked me if I have extentions. I used to get it at my local med spa, but they get a higher profit margin from selling Latisse. Not only is this cheaper, but it won&#x27;t change your eye color (mine are blue). Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, after using Latisse for two months.  My lashes are continuing to grow longer and thicker, and it is 1/3 of the price.  I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since mid February, &amp; much to my surprise my lashes hv thickened &amp; lengthened...luv it. Before this product, my lashes were next to non-existent...short as can be. Please keep producing this product,  &amp; keep your specs on the up &amp; up, unlike another product.</li>
    <li> Being used Do not know</li>
