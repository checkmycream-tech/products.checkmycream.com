    <li> Nice, arrived on time,will order again.</li>
    <li> This kukui nut oil is a wonderful additive to my soap recipes!  This oil is packed with nutrients that enhance the skin and therefore enhance my soap.  The price is good too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this is pure oil. It had no smell at all. I ordered two other types of oils from this seller and they all looked the same. I ordered Kukui Nut Oil from another source and wanted to try this in comparison. I will not be buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I buy from Dr Adorable the have great products. When I lived in Hawaii I used Kukui Nut Oil always. So I bought this from my past love. I find this oils is not as thick and does not permeate my skin as well. I do not know why. the products from them are great. Im sure I was using products with crap in them in Hawaii so I thought the pure product would sooothe the need. I am in LA and it is soooo dry here now. I am searching for something to put on my legs that will help. So I will keep using this one till i finish it but it did not live up to my memories. But maybe that is me and not them. I am 15 years older, lol.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent oil for dry, rough, damaged skin. I highly recommend it for feet and hands, especially those dry heels.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that greasy, feels good.  I like it and I will continue using this.  It&#x27;s a anti ageing for me.</li>
    <li> I like how this absorbs and itsn&#x27;t oily. Happy with it and still trying to see if this oils blocks pores or not ?</li>
    <li> I liked the oil and it is good for my dry aging skin. I use it when my skin is&lt;br /&gt;very dry. It is good for the hands, body and hair, as well.</li>
    <li> I tried this first, and loved it enough that my husband finally tried it. He doesn&#x27;t like anything sticky, so was hesitant. Instead of sharing a bottle, now he has his own. I gave up all my expensive lotions and potions and use this exclusively on face and body. Now I&#x27;m giving a bottle to my mom and daughter.</li>
    <li> I had actually ordered this and received 16 oz of 100% Organic glycerin. I emailed the seller who VERY PROMPTLY told me to keep it for the trouble and immediately sent the correct order. Even expedited the shipping, and I got the Kukui Oil about 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;Best news of all, The kukui nut oil is great on my hair and skin, and Ive decided to make soap with the glycerin and ordered another bottle from this seller. I would absolutely use this seller and both of these products again.</li>
    <li> i like works well with my skin and my skin look health. I used this product in morning after taking a bath and in the night time before going to bed</li>
    <li> This was the first ingredient in a popular eczema cream at my local Walmart. So I looked up kukui nut oil by itself. I figured that was the key ingredient it&#x27;s certainly hasn&#x27;t disappointed me. It is very healing.</li>
    <li> Has no ingredients list on the bottle. Also, when you&#x27;re applying this to your hair, be sure that you apply a little bit because it makes your hair look very oily</li>
    <li> The kukui nut oil is rich and moisturizing and very good for the skin.  The company Dr. Adorable is wonderful to deal with and wants the customer to be happy with their purchase.  The kukui oil arrived quickly.  Would highly recommend ordering it from Dr. Adorable.</li>
    <li> A great body oil.  Not greasy or messy.  Smooth and wonderful.</li>
    <li> nice oil.. absorbs well</li>
    <li> Sinks in pretty quickly, but moisturizes the best of any oil I&#x27;ve tried and it has never broken me out. You only need a little, so the bottle lasts a long time. I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Very light and easily absorbs into my skin</li>
    <li> I love it! I suffer with dry, itchy scalp and this alleviates it almost instantly for me! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Kukui nut oil is very good for dry skin.  I have had a problem with flaking skin on lower legs. No other cream has been as effective as daily use of Kukui oil.  The nice thing is that even though it is an oil, it absorbs very quickly and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it and no toxins in it ,all organic  good value and makes her skin so soft , thanks</li>
    <li> I made a body butter with this oil and Lavender essential oil. I used shea butter, cocoa butter and this oil and I just love it. I use it every night after my shower and it is heavenly.</li>
    <li> I love this oil ! I wish I was a bigger bottle . I use it a body treatment as well a hot oil treatment for my hair before shampooing.</li>
    <li> smells good and worked well in my lotion and soap making.</li>
    <li> Love this product. So absorbable and clean!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for very long. I do love to use coconut oil and olive oil both and they work great. This was recommended by &amp;#34;the people&#x27;s chemist&amp;#34; on youtube and seems to be a good product. It has no additives. I usually do not put anything on my skin you cannot eat and this I do not believe is an edible product so I am looking into that. People say my skin looks at least 20 yrs difference than I actually am so I must be doing something right.</li>
    <li> love it.. great product... will reorder.</li>
    <li> This is great not greasy easily absorb works great wish I was using this sooner</li>
