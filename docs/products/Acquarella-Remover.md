### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works best if I saturate the cotton + allow it to soak on the nail for about a minute before wiping.</li>
      <li>fumes (no acetone)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
      <li>Karma Organic Tea Tree Nail Polish Remover]] works a lot faster for me, but this isn&#x27;t ideal for using Acquarella, because the oils can interfere with Acquarella adhering to the nail.  </li>
      <li>I bought this system because I was looking for an organic/natural nail polish product, and I am so happy with it</li>
      <li>After a great deal of soaking and rubbing</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>The shipper was great.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This remover works well with the Acquarella polish and the company is just great.</li>
      <li>this is a very nice one.  </li>
      <li>Truly amazing!</li>
      <li>This is a good product.  </li>
      <li>it removes really good.  </li>
      <li>Had I known how good this stuff is</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad this stuff exists.</li>
      <li>Though, I am very pleased with the nail polishes.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy and the results are beautiful.  </li>
      <li>I love the acquarella remover!</li>
      <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s a great less-toxic alternative to regular nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>Instead, it kind of smells like peanut butter to me.</li>
      <li>Its great to use while pregnant.</li>
      <li>I used it to remove 2 coats of Acquarella nail polish with a conditioner coat on top and it all came off very easily.</li>
      <li>I had not been able to use polish or removers on my nails for years as I had a reaction to the chemicals in them.   </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t want to have to take the time to file my fingernails more than once</li>
      <li>was not an option for her :-)</li>
      <li>This product is okay.  </li>
      <li>I really like this remover, has worked great the couple times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
      <li>Love the Acquarella product line.  </li>
      <li>I love this remover.  </li>
      <li>it can&#x27;t use regulate things and its hart to find in stores also love the nail polish</li>
      <li>I purchased this mostly to remove my daughter&#x27;s polish</li>
      <li>Even though I like that it&#x27;s healthy , this remover does not work.</li>
      <li>so I will give this one more chance with my nontoxic piggy paint polish</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I love Aquarella nail polishes</li>
      <li>Vegan nailpolish removers do not work as well as acetone-based ones but the lack of toxic odor more than makes up for it.</li>
      <li>What I like most about the remover is that it does not have a strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>I wish I could say that this was worth the while, because it is supposedly safe and earth-friendly, but it does not remove nail polish!</li>
      <li>We often expect quick and easy, but sometimes it takes chemicals to get that kind of response, and my eyes and allergies can&#x27;t handle that.  </li>
      <li>Allergies free  product love</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m very lucky that nail didn&#x27;t get infected.</li>
      <li>This remover, although healthy for you and your nails, takes a bit of work to remove the polish, but I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not bad for you.</li>
      <li>but the remover doesn&#x27;t take off the polish easily and quickly you have to hold it on there with a cotton ball and rub and rub and apply more.</li>
      <li>The remover worked fine if you got any on your hand.</li>
      <li>Do not buy as it would not remove the light polish from my nails.  </li>
      <li>I purchased Lil Dippers which are wearable tip soakers and filled each with Acquarella remover.  </li>
      <li>Out of curiosity, I tried the Acquarella polish and remover as my first nail polish products and have been enjoying them.  </li>
      <li>I am still new with using all these products, so I haven&#x27;t yet reached my own verdict.  </li>
      <li>So far, this product has effectively removed the Acquarella conditioner.</li>
      <li>I prefer traditional colors in the creme opaque and translucent colors, and all of these are gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>Worth it to me to be able to remove my polish with ease while using products far better for my body.</li>
      <li>On that, it&#x27;s true that it won&#x27;t do anything; even the instructions state that to be the case.</li>
      <li>As soon as I received them, I read the instructions on every product completely, followed all the instructions exactly, and I now always sport a gorgeous pedicure.  </li>
      <li>people out there make green products that WORK and SMELL GOOD!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather take the time getting it off using a non-toxic nail polish and non-toxic remover, than have it be quick and toxic.</li>
      <li>I quickly swipe each fingernail before I begin removal so that the remover has time to soak in, which does help a lot.  </li>
      <li>I was amazed at how this removed the polish so quickly and has no odor.  </li>
      <li>Acquarella polish remover quickly removed all traces of polish.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>It was quite quick in cleaning my nails off for application</li>
      <li>products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors come off easily when using the remover exactly as directed, the polishes apply easily &amp; quickly because of the good brushes &amp; polish consistency, and dry quickly.  </li>
      <li>It stays on &amp; looks good for a really long time.</li>
      <li>So gentle and completely cruelty-free; I love it!</li>
      <li>unless I buy another color, the remaining bottle of remover probably won&#x27;t be of any use to me (because I don&#x27;t believe this is intended to be used to remove regular nail polish;  I think it is specifically meant to remove Aquarella&#x27;s own brand of nail polish).  </li>
      <li>Its not as powerful as the non-organic stuff though.</li>
      <li>so I have been trying to buy more organic and natural products.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>easily as the polish goes on (no \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; clumping), the remover foams up and the polish is completely gone, leaving nails</li>
      <li>That will be awhile though because the Acquarella Nail polish is better than the traditional!</li>
      <li>I do dab all the nails first to get the chemicals started</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to buy also Prissy and Brave.  </li>
      <li>It also helps to let the remover soak into the polish for a minute first.</li>
      <li>Odor free completely.</li>
      <li>The first 2 times I did this, the 3 fingers that I used to hold the cotton ball soaked in this remover PEELED.</li>
      <li>pretty well.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ll be checking that first.</li>
      <li>As I remove one I just switch it to the other hand and then using a clean gauze dipped in some more remover, 1-2-3</li>
      <li>As other reviewers point out, it&#x27;s a must to follow the instructions of the remover for it to be effective.  </li>
      <li>Unlike conventional products that really dry out my nails + have a strong odor, this leaves my nails in good shape doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
      <li>I have pretty much every product they make</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice that this is chemical free and all that, but what good is it if it does not do what it is supposed to which is remove nail polish... rubbed and rubbed for about 10 minutes, even pre-soaked... horrible product!!!</li>
      <li>If there is still some polish on my nails after half an hour of scrubbing I soak my nails in warm water and use an orange stick to scrape the rest off.</li>
      <li>This process was a little more time consuming then the acetone nail polish remover but worth the little more effort (no bad smell).</li>
      <li>Takes a little longer, and more work to get polish off, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>I have also found that soaking nails in warm water for a little bit before using the remover to remove polish is very helpful.  </li>
      <li>However, because of the time my hands are exposed to this remover, it really dries them out, and the skin around my nails starts to peel.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame really</li>
      <li>For now, I use Karma if I have on several Acquarella coats, but before polishing with Acquarella, I lightly buff my nails and then I swipe each with the Acquarella remover and then rinse before polishing.</li>
      <li>I use another brand and this polish did absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a gentle nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>Better than the other non-toxic removers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Well, not only does the nail polish flake off in a couple of days but the nail polish remover, that is suppose to take off this special nail polish, doesn&#x27;t make a dent.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no way this remover works on regular conventional polish, but it DOES work with Aquarella polish, and the reason I use it is because it is healthy and chemical free; I&#x27;m using natural products on my hands, and my hands reflect it.  </li>
      <li>This takes a little bit more time</li>
      <li>There didn&#x27;t seem to be any difference between this remover and the one from Honeybee Gardens; neither have a smell, they don&#x27;t dry out the fingers or toes, and works quickly on acrylic-based nail polish (much faster than vodka or rum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It DOES NOT work, and it is really sad because all the non toxic claims sounded great, but if it doesn&#x27;t remove the polish...</li>
      <li>It would be nice if Acquarella Remover worked as quickly as conventional nail polish removers, but I am willing to take a little longer to use something that is safer for my health.</li>
      <li>When I first purchased this product I missed the part where it said, &#x27;Can only be used on Acquarella nail polishes&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>It takes more of an investment of time to use natural products, but in the end, I&#x27;m spending no more time on a manicure than I would be in a salon where they pile on the layers of chemical-based nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Some soaps are better than others for this, but I natural oil-based soap usually does the trick.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works well with their brand........Acquarella Remover....when having natural nails I prefer this brand of polish and remover....if your having trouble with chemicals...</li>
    <li> I have a few allergies that I recently found out about so I have been trying to buy more organic and natural products.  I found this brand and when I saw the nail polish remover (with the nail polishes), I thought I&#x27;d try.  Well, not only does the nail polish flake off in a couple of days but the nail polish remover, that is suppose to take off this special nail polish, doesn&#x27;t make a dent.  I used 1/4 of the bottle without removing a speck of the color.  I had to resort to old fashion nail polish remover which took it off in one swipe.  This natural/organic product is not worth buying.</li>
    <li> So far, this product has effectively removed the Acquarella conditioner. It works best if I saturate the cotton + allow it to soak on the nail for about a minute before wiping. This takes a little bit more time but it&#x27;s worth it. Unlike conventional products that really dry out my nails + have a strong odor, this leaves my nails in good shape doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> I know it is supposed to be water based and non-toxic, but it doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to do.  Which is to remove the acquarella nail polish.</li>
    <li> I wish I could say that this was worth the while, because it is supposedly safe and earth-friendly, but it does not remove nail polish!</li>
    <li> This remover, although healthy for you and your nails, takes a bit of work to remove the polish, but I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not bad for you.</li>
    <li> I like this remover--it does take time using this to remove Acquarella polish----however it removes really good.  I had not been able to use polish or removers on my nails for years as I had a reaction to the chemicals in them.   I can use this product and no reaction and does not weaken my nails.</li>
    <li> This is a nail polish remover that Aquarella made specifically to take off its Aquarella water-based nail polish.  Note that this nail polish remover is NOT FOR REGULAR POLISH!!  It works fine to do the job it was created for (again, Aquarella nail polish only) -- you have to scrub a little until it foams up like soap and takes off the polish.  No harsh chemical smell like regular nail polish remover.  Best of all, it&#x27;s a great less-toxic alternative to regular nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> ...a nail polish remover that does the job but doesn&#x27;t smell...at all? Truly amazing! The consistancy is more like soap; it actually suds up a little bit when using. So gentle and completely cruelty-free; I love it!</li>
    <li> It works on Acquarella polish</li>
    <li> I purchased this mostly to remove my daughter&#x27;s polish and she just does not have the patience for it. After a great deal of soaking and rubbing I went back to the toxic stuff.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to remove Acquarella Nail Polish, but the Acquarella Remover eventually gets the job done. What I like most about the remover is that it does not have a strong chemical smell. Instead, it kind of smells like peanut butter to me. To get the remover to work I have to use a generous amount and work it into a bubbly froth. It also helps to let the remover soak into the polish for a minute first. Then I soak a cotton round in remover and hold it on my nail for a few seconds. Then I swipe the polish off. Sometimes it helps to keep swiping in the same direction, instead of scrubbing back and forth. The conditioner takes longer to remover (40-50 minutes) than the nail polish (about 30 minutes). If there is still some polish on my nails after half an hour of scrubbing I soak my nails in warm water and use an orange stick to scrape the rest off. It would be nice if Acquarella Remover worked as quickly as conventional nail polish removers, but I am willing to take a little longer to use something that is safer for my health.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work. I wish it would because it is really natural non-toxic product, but it does not do its job neither on conventional nail polish or acquarella nail polish . By the way I followed all the given instructions and suggestions - no success.</li>
    <li> Takes a little longer, and more work to get polish off, but well worth it. Doesn&#x27;t dry out nails and skin like acetone or other chemical removers. Odor free completely.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nail polish remover that had the least amount of toxins so I decided to try this product since it was on the EWG.org website.  It would not take the Acquarella polish off.  I even followed the directions, letting it soak the nail, but it still didn&#x27;t work.  I had to use another brand.  Though, I am very pleased with the nail polishes.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no way this remover works on regular conventional polish, but it DOES work with Aquarella polish, and the reason I use it is because it is healthy and chemical free; I&#x27;m using natural products on my hands, and my hands reflect it.  We often expect quick and easy, but sometimes it takes chemicals to get that kind of response, and my eyes and allergies can&#x27;t handle that.  It takes more of an investment of time to use natural products, but in the end, I&#x27;m spending no more time on a manicure than I would be in a salon where they pile on the layers of chemical-based nail polish.  Once I had acrylic nails done and the woman buffed, with an electric machine, so far down into my nail, around the cuticle, that I thought it was going to lift up out of the bed and fall off.  There was almost nothing left of it, and she attached acrylic nails to it! It took a LOT longer for that nail to grow out than it does for me to care for my skin and health with this product. And I&#x27;m very lucky that nail didn&#x27;t get infected.</li>
    <li> There didn&#x27;t seem to be any difference between this remover and the one from Honeybee Gardens; neither have a smell, they don&#x27;t dry out the fingers or toes, and works quickly on acrylic-based nail polish (much faster than vodka or rum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine that the people who&#x27;ve complained that it didn&#x27;t do anything were using it on traditional polish.  On that, it&#x27;s true that it won&#x27;t do anything; even the instructions state that to be the case.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It&#x27;s sudsy like it has a soap base, but couldn&#x27;t get any of the nail polish off, even scrubbing over and over.</li>
    <li> THIS DID NOT DO A THING TO REMOVE MY NAIL POLISH!!!!  The reason i gave it 2 and not one star is b/c my nail polish is from a nail salon and probably the \\&quot;bad toxic kind\\&quot; so I will give this one more chance with my nontoxic piggy paint polish but as it didn&#x27;t even put a dent in the other stuff, i don&#x27;t have high hopes.  as for letting it soak for a while.... i let it soak for like 30 minutes and it still didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I love the acquarella remover! Finally no harmful chemicals! To take the nail polish off apply remover and let it sit for a while then it will rub off a lot easier.  I am telling all my friends to get rid of regular nail polish and regular polish remover because it&#x27;s really bad!</li>
    <li> The product does work if you follow their instructions carefully.  I took it one step further.  I purchased Lil Dippers which are wearable tip soakers and filled each with Acquarella remover.  I put them on and let them sit for about 5 minutes.  As I remove one I just switch it to the other hand and then using a clean gauze dipped in some more remover, 1-2-3 and it&#x27;s off.  You can pour the leftover in the reservoirs back into the bottle without any problem.  Worth it to me to be able to remove my polish with ease while using products far better for my body.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this product I missed the part where it said, &#x27;Can only be used on Acquarella nail polishes&#x27;.  Whoops, but, no big deal, I just bought some of their polish.  The polish stayed on for weeks until I had to remove it with the Acquarella nail polish remover.  This process was a little more time consuming then the acetone nail polish remover but worth the little more effort (no bad smell).</li>
    <li> You might as well wait for the nail polish to come off. That will be awhile though because the Acquarella Nail polish is better than the traditional! It stays on &amp; looks good for a really long time. The remover worked fine if you got any on your hand. (I got the remover &amp; polish because I didn&#x27;t want my daughter exposed to anything too toxic &amp; not painting your nails was not an option for her :-) I think they need to improve it a little bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the \\&quot;green\\&quot; beauty products out there, and this is by far the worst...sorry, I don&#x27;t have time to let my nails sit in remover for 5 minutes so that I can then go back with more remover and try to scrub the polish off. Tried it once and threw it in the garbage -- what a waste of my time and money. It&#x27;s time people out there make green products that WORK and SMELL GOOD!</li>
    <li> When you are looking for an alfernative to acetone, I didnt expect to choke on the smell of this product</li>
    <li> This product is to be used as part of the Acquarella system, and will not work with conventional nail polishes.  I adore this nail polish system:  it&#x27;s easy and the results are beautiful.  As soon as I received them, I read the instructions on every product completely, followed all the instructions exactly, and I now always sport a gorgeous pedicure.  The polishes dry quickly and wear extremely well.  (I don&#x27;t usually use polish on my fingernails, I use a simple two-sided nail buffer &amp; shine block on my fingernails--anything more &amp; my nails grow too fast [I&#x27;m a pianist] and I don&#x27;t want to have to take the time to file my fingernails more than once a week.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire Acquarella system must be purchased and used in order for any &amp; all of the products to work:  1) Buffer Kit, 2) Remover, 3) Conditioner, 4) the nail polishes are optional &amp; you can use just the conditioner as your only polish.  I also bought four of the nail colors: French Kiss, Pink-a-Boo, Plasma, and Aristo--I prefer traditional colors in the creme opaque and translucent colors, and all of these are gorgeous.  I&#x27;m going to buy also Prissy and Brave.  Also, there are no obnoxious smell or fumes in any of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors come off easily when using the remover exactly as directed, the polishes apply easily &amp; quickly because of the good brushes &amp; polish consistency, and dry quickly.  I bought this system because I was looking for an organic/natural nail polish product, and I am so happy with it I&#x27;m not interested in using any other nail polish product of any type, organic or otherwise.  It is so much better than any other nail polish products I have ever used, conventional or otherwise.  Had I known how good this stuff is, I would have abandoned conventional nail polish years ago even before I started using all organic beauty &amp; household products.</li>
    <li> I love this remover.  I am not exposed to harsh chemicals, acetone, etc.  It does not have an odor like other nail polish removers.</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover works well  for the acquarella nail polish. You just have to be patient. It takes some time, but it gets it off. I&#x27;d rather take the time getting it off using a non-toxic nail polish and non-toxic remover, than have it be quick and toxic. Like they said, it does help to have soaked your feet in water for a little while or to have been in the shower; it makes it come off a little easier when it&#x27;s been softened already.</li>
    <li> Completely useless. Thankfully, I think it&#x27;s safe enough to pour down the drain. But I&#x27;ll be checking that first. Just in case.</li>
    <li> This remover takes some time to get all the polish off my nails (between 10 and 20 minutes), as well as quite a bit of scrubbing, but it does the job well, and is non-toxic, so no horrible smell or dangerous chemicals.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t clear to me that this remover was made specifically for Acquarella nail polish. So of course when I used it on conventional nail polish, it didn&#x27;t work. Then I bought Acquarella nail polish and used the remover on it and it works  ... pretty well. I don&#x27;t know what they can do to improve the formula, and make it work quicker, but I wouldn&#x27;t switch back to acetone.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. I was looking for a gentle nail polish remover. There were no directions included in package contrary to product listing and the remover did not remove anything. My cotton ball/pad was still clear after scrubbing and trying to remove polish.</li>
    <li> The product contents are fine, but the bottle is tested badly as both bottles of this leaked all over til they were empty!</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  Carefully get rid of your acetone fingernail polish remover which is so dangerous, and get this.  Read instructions of course.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all. I sat there scrubbing at my nail trying to get the polish off to no avail... I may as well have been using fragrant water. It&#x27;s a shame really, I can&#x27;t even return it because I lost the receipt.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cruelty-free polish remover ant this is a very nice one.  I neglected to read the description carefully, though.  This will only work with Acquarella polish.  I use another brand and this polish did absolutely nothing.  Didn&#x27;t remove a speck of polish.  It&#x27;s my own fault, but it was disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my daughter and was drawn by the non-toxic factor.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work well because it&#x27;s hard to get a toddler to sit still long enough to work per the directions.</li>
    <li> I like this product and brand in general because it is the least toxic according to EWG Skin Deep but the amount of prep time you have to put into putting on the polish and letting it set and using this remover first makes it time consuming and the polish doesn&#x27;t last that long but the remover doesn&#x27;t take off the polish easily and quickly you have to hold it on there with a cotton ball and rub and rub and apply more. I don&#x27;t think it works with other brands of less toxic nail polishes either.</li>
    <li> This product is okay.  You can&#x27;t really remove the regular nail polish.  This product only removes an organic nail polish.</li>
    <li> I had to return this product as it does not remove the polish at all.  Not even slightly.</li>
    <li> Love the Acquarella product line.  Wish the polish came off easier with this remover, but it&#x27;s worth a little elbow grease to avoid the harsh chemicals in traditional products.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s free of awful chemicals, etc., but it is simply soap and wouldn&#x27;t remove lacquer if you soaked in it for hours and hours. :(</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles of Acquarella polish (clear conditioner and Tickle Pink) and one bottle of Aquarella remover.   After removing my salon applied pedicure with regular nail polish remover, I rinsed my feet and applied a coat of Aquarella clear conditioner and two coats of Tickle Pink.  When about 2 weeks had passed,  I used the Aquarella remover to take off the Acquarella clear coat &amp; Tickle Pink color.  It worked like a charm and without the harsh smell of regular nail polish remover (although my cat did not appreciate the smell of my fingers when I tried to pet her after using it, even though I had washed my hands).  I did not really like the Tickle Pink shade of Aquarella nail polish, so unless I buy another color, the remaining bottle of remover probably won&#x27;t be of any use to me (because I don&#x27;t believe this is intended to be used to remove regular nail polish;  I think it is specifically meant to remove Aquarella&#x27;s own brand of nail polish).  I give it 5 stars for removing Aquarella polish.  I may buy some Pritti brand polish and see if it works just as well with that.</li>
    <li> This so-called remover doesnt remove ANYTHING!!! It felt like water mixed with soap. My gosh! I wonder how people can sell that stuff. That needs to be removed from the market ASAP! Save your money!</li>
    <li> Vegan nailpolish removers do not work as well as acetone-based ones but the lack of toxic odor more than makes up for it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this remover, has worked great the couple times I&#x27;ve used it. Better than the other non-toxic removers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s user error.... doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I had never used nail polish and/or polish remover before simply because of the health and chemicals concerns I&#x27;ve read about them.  Out of curiosity, I tried the Acquarella polish and remover as my first nail polish products and have been enjoying them.  As other reviewers point out, it&#x27;s a must to follow the instructions of the remover for it to be effective.  I have also found that soaking nails in warm water for a little bit before using the remover to remove polish is very helpful.  After all, the polish itself is water-based.  With the added step of softening the nails and polish with water, I actually find that just a small amount of the removal on cotton ball can remove polish on 10 finger/toe nails.</li>
    <li> This remover works well with the Acquarella polish and the company is just great. If you have an issue with anything they will take care of you. I have pretty much every product they make and it&#x27;s all quality, non-toxic products.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this remover would work without a lot of rubbing and scrubbing. But it did and with no smelly odor. I used it to remove 2 coats of Acquarella nail polish with a conditioner coat on top and it all came off very easily. Great product.</li>
    <li> I like that this polish remover is safer but it doesn&#x27;t work all that well. In fact, it takes me about 10-15 min of vigorous rubbing to get everything off. I do dab all the nails first to get the chemicals started and then I go to each nail to start the rubbing process... and it&#x27;s not any faster. The first 2 times I did this, the 3 fingers that I used to hold the cotton ball soaked in this remover PEELED. See the photo yourself. It took about 3 days to heal over. Next time, I will need to use saran wrap to hold the cotton balls or maybe place the balls in a Ziploc bag and then rub the fingers that way. I still do prefer these over the toxic stuff, but lesson learned: do NOT handle the solution directly. After all, nail polish remover is nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> It DOES NOT work, and it is really sad because all the non toxic claims sounded great, but if it doesn&#x27;t remove the polish... what&#x27;s the point?   I bought this for my little daughter, to prevent her from toxic exposure to regular nail polish remover, but its performance falls short of our expectations. I didn&#x27;t return the product, but would never buy it again nor recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I was kind of slightly dreading using this remover for fear that it would dry out my nails like regular acetone does and leave me dizzy from its smell. NOT SO! It was quite quick in cleaning my nails off for application and I didn&#x27;t smell it at all. I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> This remover isn&#x27;t helpful in taking off the nail polishes and it smells vaguely off putting. It&#x27;s also feels strangely soapy and greasy at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I love Aquarella nail polishes so what I do is remove them with soap and just peel off the rest with my finger nails or a scrubby in the shower. Some soaps are better than others for this, but I natural oil-based soap usually does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother buying the remover.</li>
    <li> With two coats of Acquarella, it takes 5 minutes to remove the polish off each hand, which isn&#x27;t too bad.  However, if you have on several coats, it just takes too long.  I quickly swipe each fingernail before I begin removal so that the remover has time to soak in, which does help a lot.  However, because of the time my hands are exposed to this remover, it really dries them out, and the skin around my nails starts to peel.  This means I no longer use this remover. :(    [[ASIN:B002PAJ8QA Karma Organic Tea Tree Nail Polish Remover]] works a lot faster for me, but this isn&#x27;t ideal for using Acquarella, because the oils can interfere with Acquarella adhering to the nail.  I am still new with using all these products, so I haven&#x27;t yet reached my own verdict.  For now, I use Karma if I have on several Acquarella coats, but before polishing with Acquarella, I lightly buff my nails and then I swipe each with the Acquarella remover and then rinse before polishing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad this stuff exists. Its great to use while pregnant. Its not as powerful as the non-organic stuff though.</li>
    <li> The product does not contain any of toxic ingredient(at least that I am aware of). The smell is not too bad however it only removes water based nail polish.</li>
    <li> Even though I like that it&#x27;s healthy , this remover does not work. I don&#x27;t know how long it would take me to remove the nail polish and I just don&#x27;t have time to experiment. I would not recommend it again!!</li>
    <li> Used to remove the polish \\&quot;plasma\\&quot;. The polish remover worked well. It was easier to remove  part of the polish that was already coming off, had to hold over the polish for a few minutes to soak.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice that this is chemical free and all that, but what good is it if it does not do what it is supposed to which is remove nail polish... rubbed and rubbed for about 10 minutes, even pre-soaked... horrible product!!!</li>
    <li> I read the bad review and risked it, thinking the polish we are trying to remove would be easier as it&#x27;s all natural (Piggy Paint). Nope. Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Soaked for a minute and it softened it, but no amount of rubbing would remove it.</li>
    <li> Allergies free  product love it can&#x27;t use regulate things and its hart to find in stores also love the nail polish</li>
    <li> Acquarella polish remover quickly removed all traces of polish.&lt;br /&gt;As easily as the polish goes on (no \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; clumping), the remover foams up and the polish is completely gone, leaving nails clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fumes (no acetone)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely great!</li>
    <li> Do not buy as it would not remove the light polish from my nails.  I had to toss it.</li>
    <li> I paid more for this than I have paid for any remover and it is my far the worst &amp;#34;remover&amp;#34; I have ever used.  Tried on a variety of polishes and it removed none of them.  Too bad as I was looking for a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; product for the granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how this removed the polish so quickly and has no odor.  No dry feeling or residue feel.</li>
    <li> I did follow the instruction. ,but it doesn&#x27;t work, nail polish never come off. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> The shipper was great. Received the product promptly.  However, the product is a bust.  I read the instructions carefully, and was even prepared to spend more time removing the nail polish if it meant it was less toxic.  But after 20 minutes of rubbing my nail with the remover and there was little to no change, I gave up.  All it did was make the polish a little softer so it was slightly easier to chip off... but it did not remove the polish by any means. Try another brand.</li>
