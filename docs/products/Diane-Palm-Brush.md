      <li>Liked it so much.</li>
      <li>great beard brush, especially for the price</li>
      <li>just what I wanted great product for short army style hair cut</li>
      <li>I am really happy that I found it, this thick brush is good for my scalp.</li>
      <li>seems to be a good purchase for the product so far.</li>
      <li>Works best when his hair is wet, right before he uses pomade.</li>
      <li>hope this helps in chosing the right brush for you. :-)</li>
      <li>I will be using it to clean my toaster oven grates, but not for brushing my hair.</li>
      <li>so i really just wanted it to make sure i stay looking clean.  </li>
      <li>My husbands beard is looking mighty fine after we bought this brush ;)</li>
      <li>Unlike many others, this brush seems to be reasonably well made.</li>
      <li>Very good stiff brush.  </li>
      <li>Very Firm bristles, love it, great buy.</li>
      <li>but this has a little more pull than the OG and that is a good thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably repurchase in the future, seeing as it has such a great price!</li>
      <li>This brush works pretty fantastic.</li>
      <li>Great brush, but it&#x27;s pretty rough on my scalp.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, and free (with a qualifying</li>
      <li>Constructed well and well worth the price.</li>
      <li>This is a smaller brush but it does the job quite nicely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bristles are stiff, and are great for exfoliating.</li>
      <li>Not a lot of boar hair or anything, but other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>It has a good &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; to it without feeling overly sharp or abrasive at the tips of the bristles.  </li>
      <li>My beard stays clean and well kept thanks to this baby</li>
      <li>Very firm, great for the scalp and in shower washing of hair.</li>
      <li>I actually got this for him to scrub his beard with in the shower, and he does use it for that, but it&#x27;s also great as a regular hairbrush.</li>
      <li>I still use it, but very gently.  </li>
      <li>This was very very stiff/harsh and hurts when I use it.  </li>
      <li>Very very scratchy on your face.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find that this brush is as good as those I have seen costing 5 or ten times as much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>I took a chance on buying a brush for my beard without trying it first.  </li>
      <li>Hurts a bit at first dragging it across your face</li>
      <li>Most of the bristles are plastic, which defeats the purpose of using actual boar bristles.</li>
      <li>I got this for my beard and it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Nice product as expected</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you&#x27;re trying to style short, curly hair. Does not irritate scalp when used like other brushes do. Easy to hold and handle for hitting all the areas around your head. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to help tame my boyfriends coarse curly beard.</li>
    <li> Bristles are very very (very) firm not just extra...</li>
    <li> Advertised as a palm brush but it is humongous.</li>
    <li> Nice, inexpensive, but great quality beard brush.. My husbands beard is looking mighty fine after we bought this brush ;)</li>
    <li> Extra firm!!! Which is what I wanted so it&#x27;s great when that&#x27;s what u need. Not a lot of boar hair or anything, but other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Strong brush, I ise it everyday for my beard. Highly recommended for coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son because I could not remember the store I bought his previous one from.  I have 3 African American sons and the oldest is always taking the brush for himself so I decided to buy his own.  He was quite happy to have his own, (just turned 16).  I asked him and he said 4 stars.  I asked him why and he said because its harder than the other one.</li>
    <li> I like these product. It came on time.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son, who has short hair but sometimes it tangles. This brush works pretty fantastic. And the size is ideal.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush.  I expect to get many years of service from it.</li>
    <li> The brush looks as advertised and does seem to have boar hair, but it isn&#x27;t much. i would say for every 10 plastic bristles, there is one boar hair. You really don&#x27;t feel the boar hair, but you can certainly feel the harsh scratching of the plastic ones. But hey, it does comb the roughage and it was cheap too.</li>
    <li> This thing is very stiff and scratchy. I will be using it to clean my toaster oven grates, but not for brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> Super stiff boar bristles make my scalp smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is well made, and I might even be able to shine my boots with it, if the need ever arises...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kinda new to the whole beard care thing.  Been growing my beard for a couple years now and was just using a general comb to try and keep things in check.  This helps tame the &amp;#34;scruffiness&amp;#34; overall.  It doesn&#x27;t always get the job done on it own, but it does help.</li>
    <li> I bought it to be used as a beard brush, works great! Wasn&#x27;t expecting much from the price but very happy</li>
    <li> Terrible brush, especially for beards. Nasty scratchy plastic bristles.</li>
    <li> Ok but the brush is extremely hard. Felt like I was brushing hair with a razor but other then that brush is perfect for 360 waves</li>
    <li> just what I wanted great product for short army style hair cut</li>
    <li> i lovee it its nice it got my waves just how i wanted them and i will be buying moree thanks(:</li>
    <li> Most of the bristles are plastic, which defeats the purpose of using actual boar bristles. Otherwise it works alright, I think.</li>
    <li> 100% fake bristles.... one strand of boar&#x27;s hair here and there</li>
    <li> Great brush, but it&#x27;s pretty rough on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Great size! Very stiff, but needs to be for a beard.</li>
    <li> Feels great when I brush. Very firm bristles to get through a tough beard!</li>
    <li> Hard the way I needed it, i have tough hair to control and this really digs into my scalp to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I have very long, thick hair and this helps me take care of tangles and keeps my hair looking smooth!</li>
    <li> Too stiff bristles.. Hurts to brush your hair with it. OUCH!</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a beard wash/condition kit. The brush itself is well made, the bristles are tough and it takes a lot of abuse to get them to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO real hair in this, it is 100% synthetic I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s labeled as real hair. That being said, it still works well and is very stiff, so it exfoliates very well.</li>
    <li> Mostly horribly hard plastic bristles. Not much boar to speak of. Serious dislike.</li>
    <li> Liked it so much. I bought an extra one.  Keep one on the counter at home, and one in my travel kit.</li>
    <li> I am an advanced dry skin brusher and upgraded to this firmer ones after a few months with softer. Same company. Very happy. Works on cellulite, circulation and even general mood. 5 stars for quality+price.</li>
    <li> This product is great for wolfing but wayyyyy to hard for any other reason. I gave it five stars because it is as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great comb, my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this to finish may Yukon Cornelius beard after combing.. It may be made from boar bristles, but boars that grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, street tough boars. These boars would likely hear from the lady boars that they needed to shave their bristles prior to boar style love...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good on the beard - Opus Dei flagellation on the face.</li>
    <li> It brushes stuff and the bristles are stiff, you can hold onto the wood part and brush stuff.  Why did I do this review?  Oh yeah, it IS well made and does a very good job on my hair.</li>
    <li> My husband is Puerto Rican, and has such thick, curly hair that he&#x27;s broken a few clippers while cutting it before. I actually got this for him to scrub his beard with in the shower, and he does use it for that, but it&#x27;s also great as a regular hairbrush. Works best when his hair is wet, right before he uses pomade.</li>
    <li> The bristles are pretty stiff, but i have short hair so i really just wanted it to make sure i stay looking clean.  I also use it to brush my goatee which feels really nice.  the bristles have started to fall out a little, but nothing terrible.  seems to be a good purchase for the product so far.</li>
    <li> I love this brush- gets the job done on my beard- a little coarse on a light beard- heaven on a full beard.</li>
    <li> Bristles are firm and works well on professional, short hairstyle.</li>
    <li> One for my husband and son.&lt;br /&gt;They both like them!&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t notice any unusual smells with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;(Some had mentioned a smell in some reviews)</li>
    <li> These bristles are extremely rigid. Painful on the scalp. Beware!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these as my son keeps one everywhere he might need a great brush! Home, dorm, car, toiletry kit.  Good quality, fair price.</li>
    <li> For me it&#x27;s just like the OG 8119 but this has a little more pull than the OG and that is a good thing.</li>
    <li> It is as advertised. Shipped on time. Works great on my beard.</li>
    <li> Its not real board hair</li>
    <li> This was the best for taming my beard during November, and I use it all of the time on my hair, now.</li>
    <li> My beard stays clean and well kept thanks to this baby</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product at a good price.  Frankly, I&#x27;d expect to pay a lot more for a brush of this quality.  Yes, it&#x27;s made in China, but, I&#x27;ve found it to be on par with a brush that I lost that cost over $50. Works well on my men&#x27;s military-style haircut.  My only complaint is that the description is inaccurate as the brush only has bristles on one side - I actually prefer that, so the complaint pertains to the description only.  I&#x27;d buy this again if needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. Not large. Very firm, great for the scalp and in shower washing of hair. If you want a healthy scalp, use this.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this I thought it was too stiff. The brush it replaced was stiff, but not nearly as stiff as this. After some use however either my scalp changed or this got softer. Now I like it and use it every day. If it lasts anywhere nearly as long as the old one (over 20 years), I will come back and change it to 5 stars. For the price this is a good deal.</li>
    <li> excellent brush that isn&#x27;t painful against your skin and helps keep things under control, so you don&#x27;t look like a madman.</li>
    <li> This brush is truly reinforced. I had the Diane 8159 and this one is pretty much the same only handleless. Only use this brush if you are wolfing or growing your hair out because this brush will hurt your scalp heavy!!</li>
    <li> Great for a thick beard, combs and scratches at the same time.</li>
    <li> The description is misleading, &amp;#34;reinforced boar bristles,&amp;#34; what on earth does that mean you ask? I know that&#x27;s what I was wondering. It means that it is about 90% thick plastic bristles and 10% boar hair (going by size and coverage) give or take 5% . The plastic bristles are all kinds of sharp and rough on the ends, no idea why. It &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for my purpose (a beard brush) but I don&#x27;t particularly like it. I don&#x27;t see the point in the boar hair at all with this brush. I bought 2 of these and would just return them for the other brush I want if I didn&#x27;t think it would be too expensive. I got these as a compromise to the $35 brush I really wanted. Sadly, I wish I had just coughed up the money for the other one now.</li>
    <li> I used this to scrub some gunk off of my shower that regular nylon brushes couldn&#x27;t get.  And I was afraid to use a metal bristle brush cus I didn&#x27;t want to scratch the tile.  This thing worked pretty well.  Not exactly its intended use, but it got the job done.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush, however, way too hard bristles.</li>
    <li> The brush is very effective when you brush and even when you&#x27;re in the shower it keeps its firmness.</li>
    <li> It is a bit firmer that I expected, but to be fair, it IS labeled Extra Firm.  It is an excellently made brush, and does a great job.</li>
    <li> I got this for my beard and it works pretty well. I do wish the brush fit a bit better in the hand but I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good hard brush for if your into those deep wolfing sessions i am using this up into my 7th week now</li>
    <li> husband loves this. it&#x27;s firm but doesn&#x27;t hurt his skin.</li>
    <li> Using this as a beard brush, it&#x27;s great for getting stray hairs in order, massaging the skin and distributing product evenly in my beard.</li>
    <li> Da bristles shed more den pet hair.</li>
    <li> Get a softer brush. I have very thick hair and it is hard to get a brush/comb through often times so I bought this. Boy let me tell you it hurts your scalp. Trust me when I tell you it hurts like hell. Might as well be metal bristles.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel brush because of its compact size.  The bristles are firm, but not too much so.  One does have to be careful not to bear down too hard on the part of the head without too much hair!  Unlike many others, this brush seems to be reasonably well made. So many reviews of others say that the bristles start falling out almost immediately.  I&#x27;ve had this for 18 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles coming out yet.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find that this brush is as good as those I have seen costing 5 or ten times as much.</li>
    <li> AGAIN IT&#x27;S OK PRODUCT AND I DO LIKE IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when it said it&#x27;s firm  it&#x27;s realy firm keep the good work</li>
    <li> Very deceptive advertising. It&#x27;s basically a plastic bristle brush with a few, and I do mean a few, boars hair in it. Very very scratchy on your face.</li>
    <li> Not a very good brush.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Would not order it again.  The seller did great, just not a good product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the bush in the picture.</li>
    <li> I actually got this for my dog, as it is bettern than a pet brush.  It would work perfect for a human, but I love for my dog!</li>
    <li> The brush came as described, It works very well with the type of hair I have. It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have searched the world over, seriously, for a hard brush that would work for my hair and feel *nice to me*. This brush is really hard according to my family, but I love it. It is the same as a brush that I have been using since childhood (a boar bristle British variety) and this is going to replace it. I own the longer style as well, but like this one better.</li>
    <li> Works very well and construction is solid. But it literally stinks . I mean it smells terrible . Think of the scent of vomit and that is what it smells like. I washed it thoroughly 3 separate times and have aired it out for several days . The smell is still there but slightly less as strong. I&#x27;m a man and I do have a sensitive sense of smell . I bought this for traveling and it was inexpensive and it&#x27;s not worth returning. Hopefully the stench will continue to diminish over time.</li>
    <li> This boar hair brush is wonderful. I have thick hair that is sometimes unruly. This brush handles that perfectly. Although its smaller than I expected it works very well. Bristles are strong and do the job.</li>
    <li> Old brush was 40+ years old! this one is just as good! Very pleased?</li>
    <li> This is great and it says extra firm and it is extra firm! Maybe a little too firm for me but it works for what i needed.</li>
    <li> Great service and the perfect hairbrush at over half the price of a competitor for equal quality and size. Really is perfect for travel and daily use.</li>
    <li> I will start this off saying the people who gave this brush anything under a 5 star review obviously didn&#x27;t read the description.  It states in the title and discretion that this brush is REINFORCED BOAR BRISTLES,  not soft, not normal, not medium, its EXTRA FIRM. So be mad at your self for not reading it correctly,  don&#x27;t be mad at what the brush was made to do. This brush was created for thick or coarse hair, not facial hair, or low cut hair. Again reading is key so may attention, this is a damn good brush for what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on buying a brush for my beard without trying it first.  This was very very stiff/harsh and hurts when I use it.  I still use it, but very gently.  I&#x27;ll probably eventually buy one from a local store.  Very little boar hair.  Mainly nylon bristles.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a boar bristle brush at all. This is a plastic brush, with about 45 individual boar bristle hairs throughout the whole thing. Janky. Might as well just get an all plastic brush, don&#x27;t fall for this scam.</li>
    <li> Nice product as expected</li>
    <li> I LOVE these HAIR BRUSHES :-There is no 1 better you cant even get ghem @ Wal-Mart AMAZON IS THE BOMB</li>
    <li> This is a smaller brush but it does the job quite nicely. It&#x27;s my first boar bristle brush so I have nothing to compare it to, but it seems to do what a boar bristle brush does. I have long thick, blonde, wavy hair so this brush helps me distribute my 2nd or 3rd day hair oils throughout the length of my hair. It&#x27;s improved the softness and shine of my hair by a ton. I&#x27;ll probably repurchase in the future, seeing as it has such a great price!</li>
    <li> My husband uses it as a beard brush. He seems to like it.</li>
    <li> I like this brush and use it twice a day. This is my third brush and will buy again. I am really happy that I found it, this thick brush is good for my scalp.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use on my daughters&#x27; show goats.  It is a well made brush with a sturdy, wooden back that fits nicely in the palm of the hand.  It also has a small groove on each side of the brush for extra grip while brushing.  I wanted a nice, stiff brush and this one definitely fits the bill.  It has a good &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; to it without feeling overly sharp or abrasive at the tips of the bristles.  However, I had to drop it one star because I think it is unfair to describe it as reinforced boar bristle as it is almost entirely nylon bristles with a few boar bristles mixed in.  However, if you are not overly concerned with the boar bristle part then this is a great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> It is a horrible brush it is like a murder brush it is so hard my cow doesnt like it!!!</li>
    <li> No complaints for my Diane Plam Brush that I purchased. my local barber owns a Diane Brush so I knew what my expectations were for a Diane Brush Works great feel good in the Palm of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Great price for a Great product&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> great beard brush, especially for the price</li>
    <li> its basically a shoe brush</li>
    <li> Very Firm bristles, love it, great buy.</li>
    <li> This is good quality, but I don&#x27;t think I would order the extra firm one again, it feels a little too firm on my scalp. But it will probably wear down in time, so I just ignored it.  Not worth the hassle of mailing it back.</li>
    <li> I use this to brush my whiskers.  The bristles are crazy stiff and that&#x27;s good.  Constructed well and well worth the price. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The bristles were a little too firm</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for my intended use. My beard loves it.</li>
    <li> Very good stiff brush.  Hurts a bit at first dragging it across your face but it really tames my beard down!  I did think it would have less plastic bristles and more boar hairs but oh well.</li>
    <li> Works well on this old guy&#x27;s hair and scalp.  My shaggy dog loves the massaging action of the stiff bristles as well</li>
    <li> If only i would have read the product description before buying. There is no kidding around when it is described as EXTRA!!!!! FIRM. And the &amp;#34;boar&amp;#34; bristles could clean deep carbon out of the boar of a gun. This thing is strong and doesnt show any sign of getting smoother. The only reason i gacve it 5 stars is because there is no misrepresentation, the product is as described.</li>
    <li> the boar hair in this is a joke but this is a hard brush and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;m very thick short hair and I need a hard brush to make sure that everything is in place. I do not recommended this for a beard.</li>
    <li> I have normal hair, and needed to replace an old nylon brisle brush.  This one is very close, short, and stiff. The brush brisles are tight and close together and will not even pass through my hair,.... only slightly through the top of it.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is longer than 1/2 inch then it probably will not work for you at all.  Just be aware.  The photo makes it look a bit larger than it is, and makes the brush brisles to look to be at least an inch long.... they are not.&lt;br /&gt;In general it is good quality, and it looks nice..... but it is very limited in what it may be used on and it sure does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps in chosing the right brush for you. :-)</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are stiff, and are great for exfoliating. Works well on hair and beard. Was expecting a few more bristles and a bit fewer plastic ones, so minus one star, (well, a half star to be honest). Shipping was fast, and free (with a qualifying purchase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a solid four and a half star item, all things considered.</li>
    <li> Great quality great  price. Arrived as described and by date promised.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED!!!!</li>
    <li> Great beard brush, very stiff, perfect.  the wood handle part looks as if it were cut out and carved by hand by cheap labor, but it is quite solid and will probably last me forever.  I&#x27;m going to buy two more for work and for my truck.</li>
    <li> stiff just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Works real well. Love how course it is. It gets under your beard and stash good. If you don&#x27;t have one you better get one</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH ( I HAVE CURLY HAIR BETWEEN AND THAT THING JUST BRUSH MY HAIR LIKE THERE IS NO TOMORROW</li>
    <li> Has stiff bristles and is exactly the right size.  Nice brush, not for young children; too hard.  This brush would work well as a curry brush for animals also.</li>
