### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>If I did not I think this would be an excellent product, makes your eye area very smooth.</li>
      <li>But, again, good product, wiped my water-proof mascara off likety split.</li>
      <li>It was a good try.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>And it smelled nice.</li>
      <li>it was kind of irritated &amp; itchy.</li>
      <li>but since they were doing  a good job, I&#x27;d be OK with washing my eyes with soap afterwards.</li>
      <li>It has a nice consistency.</li>
      <li>My Neutrogena Naturals Clenser + Makeup Remover did a better job with waterproof mascara than this product.</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>There is no need to pay more.</li>
      <li>I love this makeup remover and it removes makeup like a champ without any irritation to my eyes.</li>
      <li>I love about this product</li>
      <li>I prefer twist offs instead of this top</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>Works beautifully and leaves skin very soft, however it does not take off waterproof mascara.  </li>
      <li>A good consistency and really does the job!</li>
      <li>Also, I love ALBA products because they are certified by Leaping Bunny as cruelty free :</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very effective at removing even stubborn, waterproof mascara, but it does sting my eyes a bit, which I was surprised about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its ingredients seem fine, but it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>just fine *</li>
      <li>is that it is Cruelty Free.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s also cruelty free was discontinued.</li>
      <li>I ordered this since I was looking for a natural eye makeup remover, and it had gotten good reviews.  </li>
      <li>just okay when I&#x27;m using Reviva Mascara (a more natural brand, not waterproof)</li>
      <li>No oil and grease residue afterwards, I can literally just clean off the makeup and go without washing my eyes afterwards.</li>
      <li>I am using this to clean the sink instead.</li>
      <li>I always try to get them somewhere with more reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>the more I realized the formula is just really watery/thin.</li>
      <li>, someone had recommended taking off the top each time you use this, and I agree that it makes it much easier to dispense onto a cotton</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good eye makeup remover that&#x27;s moisturizing, removes eye makeup effectively, and doesn&#x27;t have parabens/sulfates etc.  </li>
      <li>so I gave this one a good long try, but I won&#x27;t even be finishing this bottle.</li>
      <li>I was pretty excited to try this eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>I will definitely continue using this eye makeup remover as long as it remains as awesome as it is right now</li>
      <li>I really like this product, and most likely, I will continue to use this instead of continuing my search for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wanted a product that has more natural and healthier ingredients and that works.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like rubbing my eyes this much and my eyes just don&#x27;t look clean around the lashes when I&#x27;m finished (by finished</li>
      <li>(yes, you do need to shake it first, well, before you use it).</li>
      <li>The only thing I would change is the top.</li>
      <li>I had been using Arbonne products for a long time and paying top dollar.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like having to wipe anything over my eyes more than necessary, so its not my favorite but a really good value for the price and friendlier less harsh chemical style product.</li>
      <li>I used many different brands and bought this along with another item of the same kind from a different brand.</li>
      <li>I use Stila waterproof eyeliners (and some non-waterproof brands) and it&#x27;s just to too much work to get it all off with this product.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing really &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; about this eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>but I find the gel cleanser does the job and don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
      <li>In the doc, they sighted a website that tells you how toxic products really are.  </li>
      <li>this Alba Botanica eye makeup remover, I rub gently and my eyeliner comes off without much</li>
      <li>The product felt very oily and I find myself needing to wash the bottle and my hands after I am done.</li>
      <li>Well after trying other products buy Alba and falling in love with them I decided to give a shot to this eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>but it wipes off clean, and I&#x27;m not left with any oily residue on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There were two things that I did not like about this particular eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>I am using all Abla face and skin care products and ditching the high prices products.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this \\&quot;waterproof mascara remover,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I highly recomment it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing again.</li>
      <li>and this doesn&#x27;t bother me most of the time, but sometimes feels a little oily after use.  </li>
      <li>Gentle on the eyes, no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>When I first took this out of the package I noticed it leaked a little from the top, but not a big deal.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t apply mascara heavily either, I prefer a more natural look.  </li>
      <li>Also, just a suggestion its easier to take the whole top off and soak a cotton ball for makeup removal than trying to use the little pop open spout...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s SO gentle on the eye area yet it instantly removes all the makeup without you having to go back and forth multiple times clean everything up.</li>
      <li>This product is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used and much less expensive than the Lancôme</li>
      <li>I originally gave it four stars, but bumped my review down to two stars.  </li>
      <li>I have really sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>Since this is natural, it never irritates my eyes, even when I&#x27;m lazy/tired and just dump this all over a cotton ball.</li>
      <li>My eye area/skin around it did feel soft after using this eye makeup remover but</li>
      <li>I have had generic drug store brands which would leave my eye area very oily and greasy</li>
      <li>And, thanks to Amazon, it was a very simple return.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind that you must shake it, it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients that you have to blend for it to work at all.  </li>
      <li>If you are ultra sensitive, this might not be for you.</li>
      <li>I have switched my entire skin care line to Alba but since their shipping fees on their website are high</li>
      <li>Sadly, it REALLY stings my eyes and I am not particularly sensitive.</li>
      <li>so I decided to pick up a bottle of this Alba Bontanica remover at my local Natural Grocers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave them red or irritated, so I might keep using it, but it&#x27;s something to just know about in case you have sensitive</li>
      <li>However the more I used it (everyday for a week &amp; a half)</li>
      <li>I had no idea you could get all natural products like this at such a low cost.</li>
      <li>I prefer shaking it, twisting the lid off, then holding a cotton ball to the bottle opening, because it&#x27;s too liquidy to just neatly pour a dab on a cotton ball using the little spout (literally poured out, hit the cotton ball, bounced off, and went all over my sink the first time I used).</li>
      <li>It removes the makeup easily...is not harsh on skin nor does it dry it out OR leave it oily.  </li>
      <li>I am going as natural as possible and found this product to be just as effective as the department store brands, along with being a lot less expensive.  </li>

<li> I am going as natural as possible and found this product to be just as effective as the department store brands, along with being a lot less expensive.  </li>
<li> This eye makeup remover is highly effective in removing waterproof liquid eyeliner and thickly applied mascara without tugging, pulling or otherwise irritating my sensitive eyes.</li>
<li> first tried the BWC eye makeup remover, and I had to rub a little harder to get my regular eyeliner off my eyelids.</li>
<li> but after giving it more than one try, it&#x27;s just too painful.</li>
<li> There is minimal fragrance (if any).</li>
<li> Disappointed the one I love</li>
<li> I have ALWAYS used clinique eye makeup remover - since I am using all other alba products for my face cleansing needs I thought I would switch to this.</li>
<li> It works well, takes off all of my eye makeup in a few swipes, but lt leaves my eyes a little red which the clinique never did.</li>
<li> Also, does not work with waterproof mascara, at least not the brand I occasionally use.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use up the bottle, but may try something else in the future since I&#x27;m not thrilled with how it stings for a minute or so each time I use</li>
<li> It makes a mess and you have to use ALOT to remove your eye makeup.</li>
<li> solution is a little thicker than water and creamy color.</li>
<li> After using for a week, I tried using a little and then a lot, and it still leaves mascara residue on my lashes.</li>
<li> Product did leak a little when shipped, even though it was thoroughly taped up by the shipper, still leaked.</li>
<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t want to waste a drop!</li>
<li> I am now using the Almay waterproof mascara remover in the form of pads that come in a small plastic container.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like the idea that I have to rub hard to remove the eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I mean after I&#x27;ve worked at it for way too</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had high hopes for this \\&quot;waterproof mascara remover,\\&quot; but I was greatly disappointed. I wanted a product that has more natural and healthier ingredients and that works. Its ingredients seem fine, but it doesn&#x27;t work well. This product takes off some of the mascara, but not all, so it is unacceptable for my use. I am now using the Almay waterproof mascara remover in the form of pads that come in a small plastic container. I happened to come across it again at a discount grocery called Grocery Outlet - for $2.99. It works perfectly. I&#x27;m sorry the Alba product does not work for me. I want it *all* off at the end of the day. It was a good try. And, thanks to Amazon, it was a very simple return.</li>
    <li> Since this is natural, it never irritates my eyes, even when I&#x27;m lazy/tired and just dump this all over a cotton ball. Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve yet to purchase a separate eye makeup remover until I bought my Clarisonic. It&#x27;ll take off bb cream, powder, etc. but not eye makeup so I decided to pick up a bottle of this Alba Bontanica remover at my local Natural Grocers. I love this makeup remover and it removes makeup like a champ without any irritation to my eyes. There were two things that I did not like about this particular eye makeup remover. The product felt very oily and I find myself needing to wash the bottle and my hands after I am done. My Neutrogena Naturals Clenser + Makeup Remover did a better job with waterproof mascara than this product. My Neutrogena makeup isn&#x27;t even advertised for waterproof makeup removal and this one is. It takes off eyeliner, eyeshadow and mascara just fine *EXCEPT* anything that is waterproof. If you want something to take waterproof makeup off, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I had been using Arbonne products for a long time and paying top dollar. I had no idea you could get all natural products like this at such a low cost. I am using all Abla face and skin care products and ditching the high prices products. There is no need to pay more.</li>
    <li> Gentle on the eyes, no harsh chemicals. and it works!</li>
    <li> You need a lot to remove waterproof mascara. Not great and pricey for the size. Disappointed the one I love that&#x27;s also cruelty free was discontinued. Could be worse, I guess.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I find the gel cleanser does the job and don&#x27;t really need it.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on waterproof mascara, it might work well on that.</li>
    <li> Thought it would take off water-proof, but no luck!  It burned my eyes and I still had mascara on after a couple minutes of trying to scrub it off.</li>
    <li> I ordered this since I was looking for a natural eye makeup remover, and it had gotten good reviews.  It&#x27;s very effective at removing even stubborn, waterproof mascara, but it does sting my eyes a bit, which I was surprised about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave them red or irritated, so I might keep using it, but it&#x27;s something to just know about in case you have sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, someone had recommended taking off the top each time you use this, and I agree that it makes it much easier to dispense onto a cotton pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit goopy, but it wipes off clean, and I&#x27;m not left with any oily residue on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use up the bottle, but may try something else in the future since I&#x27;m not thrilled with how it stings for a minute or so each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 1-25-13:  I ended up buying a different eye makeup remover since this one just stings my eyes each time I use it.  The greasiness of it also started to bother me.  I originally gave it four stars, but bumped my review down to two stars.  I don&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> First, Don&#x27;t forget to SHAKE WELL before squeezing a small amount on a cotton pad, and Secondly, my makeup is not waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the BWC eye makeup remover, and I had to rub a little harder to get my regular eyeliner off my eyelids. I don&#x27;t like the idea that I have to rub hard to remove the eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this Alba Botanica eye makeup remover, I rub gently and my eyeliner comes off without much rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution is a little thicker than water and creamy color. I really like this product, and most likely, I will continue to use this instead of continuing my search for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product is that it is Cruelty Free.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing really &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; about this eye makeup remover. I don&#x27;t mind that you must shake it, it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients that you have to blend for it to work at all.  But, it does not work on waterproof/resistant mascaras as advertised.  After using for a week, I tried using a little and then a lot, and it still leaves mascara residue on my lashes. I don&#x27;t apply mascara heavily either, I prefer a more natural look.  It works just okay when I&#x27;m using Reviva Mascara (a more natural brand, not waterproof) but still it&#x27;s nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not great with waterproof/resistant eyeliners either. I use Stila waterproof eyeliners (and some non-waterproof brands) and it&#x27;s just to too much work to get it all off with this product.  I don&#x27;t like rubbing my eyes this much and my eyes just don&#x27;t look clean around the lashes when I&#x27;m finished (by finished I mean after I&#x27;ve worked at it for way too long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like some of the Alba products I&#x27;ve tried so I gave this one a good long try, but I won&#x27;t even be finishing this bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Eyeliner and eyeshadow, be gone! It has a nice consistency. Plus, I like that the company is eco-friendly. The only thing I would change is the top. I prefer twist offs instead of this top (I haven&#x27;t the slightest idea what you call it!) so that I can dip my cotton swab in instead of pouring the product out. I don&#x27;t want to waste a drop!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive eyes and this doesn&#x27;t bother me most of the time, but sometimes feels a little oily after use.  Also, does not work with waterproof mascara, at least not the brand I occasionally use.  I don&#x27;t like having to wipe anything over my eyes more than necessary, so its not my favorite but a really good value for the price and friendlier less harsh chemical style product.</li>
    <li> I have switched my entire skin care line to Alba but since their shipping fees on their website are high I always try to get them somewhere with more reasonable prices. I have not used this eye make up remover before. I have had generic drug store brands which would leave my eye area very oily and greasy but since they were doing  a good job, I&#x27;d be OK with washing my eyes with soap afterwards. Well after trying other products buy Alba and falling in love with them I decided to give a shot to this eye makeup remover. I absolutely LOVE it! It&#x27;s SO gentle on the eye area yet it instantly removes all the makeup without you having to go back and forth multiple times clean everything up. No oil and grease residue afterwards, I can literally just clean off the makeup and go without washing my eyes afterwards. I will definitely continue using this eye makeup remover as long as it remains as awesome as it is right now</li>
    <li> A good consistency and really does the job!</li>
    <li> I just saw a documentary film about all the money that is raised for breast cancer research and where does it all go??? In the doc, they sighted a website that tells you how toxic products really are.  I am going as natural as possible and found this product to be just as effective as the department store brands, along with being a lot less expensive.  I highly recomment it.</li>
    <li> love this product. It removes the makeup easily...is not harsh on skin nor does it dry it out OR leave it oily.  Also, I love ALBA products because they are certified by Leaping Bunny as cruelty free :-)...which means not only do they not test their final products on animals but none of the ingredients in any of their products are tested on animals either.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it is &amp;#34;Leaping Bunny&amp;#34; approved. No product testing on animals. Sadly, it REALLY stings my eyes and I am not particularly sensitive. There is alcohol in it (I think it&#x27;s mixed into the aloe juice?) which I believe is the cause of the burning sensation. Bummer, I so wanted this to be my go-to eye makeup remover but after giving it more than one try, it&#x27;s just too painful.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after reviewing all the feedback, but when I tried it, it was very disappointing. I used many different brands and bought this along with another item of the same kind from a different brand. This one HURTS eyes very bad and ,even worse, doesn&#x27;t remove the makeup well. When I claimed for refund, they said it&#x27;s not return/refundable. Horrible experience. I am using this to clean the sink instead.</li>
    <li> Used to use a creamy eye make-up remover but it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. This works well (yes, you do need to shake it first, well, before you use it). I prefer shaking it, twisting the lid off, then holding a cotton ball to the bottle opening, because it&#x27;s too liquidy to just neatly pour a dab on a cotton ball using the little spout (literally poured out, hit the cotton ball, bounced off, and went all over my sink the first time I used). Product did leak a little when shipped, even though it was thoroughly taped up by the shipper, still leaked. This Alba&#x27;s fault, put one of the peal off tabs on the opening of the bottle or something! But, again, good product, wiped my water-proof mascara off likety split.</li>
    <li> Truly cleans off your eye make-up. No morning after smudges!</li>
    <li> Did not remove waterproof makeup even when holding remover-soaked cotton ball over eye lashes for several minutes. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully and leaves skin very soft, however it does not take off waterproof mascara.  I was disappointed in that because I wear waterproof mascara all the time. If I did not I think this would be an excellent product, makes your eye area very smooth.</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover is highly effective in removing waterproof liquid eyeliner and thickly applied mascara without tugging, pulling or otherwise irritating my sensitive eyes. There is minimal fragrance (if any). I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This product is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used and much less expensive than the Lancôme I&#x27;d been using for years, but the bottle came half full in a soaked box, so I was very disappointed in the careless manner in which it was shipped.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to try this eye makeup remover. It&#x27;s hard to find a good eye makeup remover that&#x27;s moisturizing, removes eye makeup effectively, and doesn&#x27;t have parabens/sulfates etc.  When I first took this out of the package I noticed it leaked a little from the top, but not a big deal. And it smelled nice. However the more I used it (everyday for a week &amp; a half) the more I realized the formula is just really watery/thin. It makes a mess and you have to use ALOT to remove your eye makeup. My eye area/skin around it did feel soft after using this eye makeup remover but it was kind of irritated &amp; itchy. Not moisturized</li>
    <li> I have ALWAYS used clinique eye makeup remover - since I am using all other alba products for my face cleansing needs I thought I would switch to this. It works well, takes off all of my eye makeup in a few swipes, but lt leaves my eyes a little red which the clinique never did. If you are ultra sensitive, this might not be for you. Also, just a suggestion its easier to take the whole top off and soak a cotton ball for makeup removal than trying to use the little pop open spout...</li>
