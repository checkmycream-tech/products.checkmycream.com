### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but it is a great product for curly hair!</li>
      <li>Product works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>Great smell too!</li>
      <li>I used it along with Shea Moisture Smoothie and the two together are a perfect pair!!</li>
      <li>Best product for curly hair on the market!!!</li>
      <li>This conditioner is great for use once or twice a week without washing.</li>
      <li>Great at conditioning my hair but leaves my roots way too greasy.</li>
      <li>Smell is great.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>This product is good, but I still find a need to use a separate conditioner.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>My hair looks so much better now, and it&#x27;s all I use!</li>
      <li>I love the product!  </li>
      <li>The smell was nice, too.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, shortly afterward, maybe an hour or so, my hair transitioned from defined, dripping (meaning hanging downward beautifully) curls to a poofy afro!</li>
      <li>Love all Ouidad products</li>
      <li>Yes, I&#x27;m satisfied with products &amp; price.</li>
      <li>But again, my love of the Ouidad mask that gives my curls immediate stretching and definition made me think I should use all of their products.</li>
      <li>Because I love their mask product, I decided that I wanted to switch all the way over and buy all-Ouidad products.</li>
      <li>This product works great on my curly hair making it soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I received this initially in one of my Curl Boxes and was so impressed that I purchased the full size without question.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair with frizzy curls.</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair.</li>
      <li>the hair feels smooth and untangled after each use.</li>
      <li>While this originally worked great for my hair, recently it just has not done what it originally did.</li>
      <li>updating my original review -  I believe this product was called Co-wash, I guess it has changed names.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine with just a very little natural curl to it and Quidad brings out the best for me.  </li>
      <li>For the price, I just don&#x27;t feel its worth it.</li>
      <li>My hair and scalp felt really clean after I used it without that sticky feeling, and was super soft.</li>
      <li>co-wash seemed like MAGIC initially.</li>
      <li>I wish they would package it in a regular shampoo bottle that rests on its top</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews first because I purchased a $30 bottle from their salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is all natural and this product is fabulous on my hair.</li>
      <li>It does make my hair feel much softer when curly.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t foam too much</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use anything with it and it leave my hair more manageable than any other product.  </li>
      <li>I thought so highly of it that I quickly complimented the product on social media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>normally use Pantene&#x27;s co-wash (used to use Hair Rules and may return to it), Ouidad&#x27;s hair mask and Hair Rules gel.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>But I have to use shampoo about every other wash to really cleanse hair and get rid of any greasiness - it does not get rid of this completely.</li>
      <li>I can get rid of product buildup and my hair is not dry.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair moistuized and not dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great at conditioning my hair but leaves my roots way too greasy. Not a good substitute to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is good, but I still find a need to use a separate conditioner. I prefer the Wen products for a one and done!</li>
    <li> Left hair heavy and feeling unclean.</li>
    <li> I want to like this cleansing conditioner but it&#x27;s just average. For the price, I just don&#x27;t feel its worth it. The label say you can use this alone without a separate conditioner....I say, No! If you have curly hair, you need a separate conditioner. This does not provide enough moisture or detangling properties to use alone.</li>
    <li> Because I love their mask product, I decided that I wanted to switch all the way over and buy all-Ouidad products. Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The co-wash seemed like MAGIC initially. It literally seemed to have a texturizer effect on my 3C/4A (curly/kinky) hair. I thought so highly of it that I quickly complimented the product on social media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, shortly afterward, maybe an hour or so, my hair transitioned from defined, dripping (meaning hanging downward beautifully) curls to a poofy afro! The curls were still visible, but my hair was stiff and dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use Pantene&#x27;s co-wash (used to use Hair Rules and may return to it), Ouidad&#x27;s hair mask and Hair Rules gel. That combo has worked well for me. But again, my love of the Ouidad mask that gives my curls immediate stretching and definition made me think I should use all of their products. I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews first because I purchased a $30 bottle from their salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try again tomorrow with maybe a conditioner as someone suggested and update my review.</li>
    <li> Very thick and hard to spread on hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair with frizzy curls. This moisturizers my hair without weighing it down. It helps my hair stay in ringlets. Great smell too! Been using it for two years with no need to switch products.</li>
    <li> Ouidad is on to something with their co wash. My hair is all natural and this product is fabulous on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Product works wonderfully! HOWEVER, Don&#x27;t leave it in too long! It may burn your scalp tho. That happened to me. However, it kept my hair extremely moisturized.  I used it along with Shea Moisture Smoothie and the two together are a perfect pair!!</li>
    <li> Best product for curly hair on the market!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Cleanses without stripping. Leaves hair moistuized and not dry. I can get rid of product buildup and my hair is not dry.</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;m satisfied with products &amp; price.</li>
    <li> Smell is great. I have fine, curly hair. This conditioner is great for use once or twice a week without washing. But I have to use shampoo about every other wash to really cleanse hair and get rid of any greasiness - it does not get rid of this completely. It does make my hair feel much softer when curly.</li>

My hair and scalp felt really clean after I used it without that sticky feeling, and was super soft. The smell was nice, too. I did have to use some conditioner afterwards, but I always use conditioner so that was no biggie for me.</li>
    <li> I love the product!  I don&#x27;t use anything with it and it leave my hair more manageable than any other product.  My hair is fine with just a very little natural curl to it and Quidad brings out the best for me.  My only complaint is the delivery system.  I hate the pump bottle.  I wish they would package it in a regular shampoo bottle that rests on its top and you can squeeze out!</li>
    <li> the hair feels smooth and untangled after each use. doesn&#x27;t foam too much but it is a great product for curly hair!</li>
    <li> This product was thick to the point that I cannot pump it from the bottle.  It&#x27;s like paste.  I will buy from the Ouidad website after this.</li>
    <li> updating my original review -  I believe this product was called Co-wash, I guess it has changed names. While this originally worked great for my hair, recently it just has not done what it originally did. It is a bit too heavy for my hair now. It may be that my hair is changing as the grey&#x27;s grow in.</li>
