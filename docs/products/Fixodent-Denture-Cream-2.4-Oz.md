      <li>The applicator was too large and let out too much product that made it GOOEY!</li>

      <li>Gift for cousin in foreign country who chose among many brands and&lt;br /&gt;decided</li>

      <li>I could hardly eat anything and would have to apply more cream, Fixodent solved that problem.</li>
      <li>- my husband developed excruciating sciatic nerve pain.</li>
      <li>If you put it on sparingly (don&#x27;t overdue it, dots are better than a long continuous line) and let it set for a few minutes, you can eat anything.</li>
      <li>They my teeth stay firm and the Fixodent dries quick</li>
      <li>I have tried several of the major brands as well as the store brand and keep coming back to Fixodent.</li>

<li> tube is low cost and last a long time too&lt;</li>
<li> My only regret is why I waited so long to try it.</li>
<li> Is it the adhesive, is the failure of many dentists unable to provide a decent set of dentures?</li>

<li> I think it could have lasted a little longer though.</li>
<li> Stays firm all day and It helps me when I eat.</li>
<li> I usually reset the bottom plate once during the day.</li>
<li> Fixodent needs to make a small applicator tip to prevent this problem.</li>

<li> Works but it is not great.</li>
<li> This contains Zinc which it warns can cause serious side effects, which unfortunately happened to me.</li>
<li> Witnessing from a member of the family struggle with fake teeth is a lesson for us all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this, as I have it on a subscription where I get it every 2 months. Very convienent and fast and never have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> Did not do the job well</li>
    <li> Works good to hold top and bottom</li>
    <li> My husband uses fixodent daily so I thought this was a great buy, He wanted the kind with scope in it. But this being such a great deal he was happy to get it. Thanks a lot!!</li>
    <li> VERY GOOEY. The applicator was too large and let out too much product that made it GOOEY! Fixodent needs to make a small applicator tip to prevent this problem.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves not running out of this Product. so nice to have it deliver right to your door.</li>
    <li> Within a week or two of using this cream -which was recommended by his dentist! - my husband developed excruciating sciatic nerve pain. Took us almost two months to figure out and connect the pain to Fixodent use after we accidentally tried zinc-free Polident and the pain magically disappeared within 3-4 days. He then complained that zinc-free Polident didn&#x27;t hold near as well and went back to using Fixodent - the pain came back! That&#x27;s when I sent the tube of Fixodent to the garbage can and put an end to his sciatic nerve pain.&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of information on line about Fixodent side effects and a lot of law suits too. Zinc in  Fixodent destroys bone marrow and causes severe nerve damage. If used for a long time, the nerve damage caused by Fixodent may be irreversible. Read and learn! We did!</li>
    <li> This is the only adhesive that works for me and I have tried them all. I always go back to fixadent original</li>
    <li> Really works well-I like original because it leaves no aftertaste or changes the taste of any food.  Last  all day and then some. I did receive a tube of this from a survey company to try out.  I had previously used fixadent because it works better than all the rest.</li>
    <li> Recieved this product to try from bzzagent.com. I honestly didnt know what to expect or how it would feel in my mouth.My opinion now is that its amazing. The grip is great and no food under the dentures.I finally was able to eat a steak at a restaurant without fear of embarresment.The best part is when you use it you dont even know its there My only regret is why I waited so long to try it. I highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> This contains Zinc which it warns can cause serious side effects, which unfortunately happened to me. I am doing fine now using Polygrip Zinc Free. It took awhile for the problem with my health to show up as a result of the zinc, but now that I&#x27;m not using it any longer the pain is gone. I was also not pleased with the oozing of the cream, and I used as little as possible. These are my experiences.</li>
    <li> I had a dental issue a few years ago that required my getting a partial bottom denture and, while it was pretty secure, there were things I couldn&#x27;t chew: things like cube steaks or some nuts, etc. So I tried this stuff and it&#x27;s like absolute magic. If you put it on sparingly (don&#x27;t overdue it, dots are better than a long continuous line) and let it set for a few minutes, you can eat anything. It&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s not like having your own teeth, no question, but it saves a bad situation and I really can&#x27;t think of much that I can&#x27;t eat. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Excelent product very strong, my mother requered this for you dental protesis, she lives in venezuela, thanks for you attention</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my mother ,,thanks a lot.......</li>
    <li> The Fixodent worked great. I have a full top plate and have my own bottom teeth.  The grip is good and I can eat all my favorites Steak. Corn with no problem They my teeth stay firm and the Fixodent dries quick and  I don&#x27;t have a problem with it oozing out . No unpleasant taste from the paste at all&lt;br /&gt;  I like this so much it is my go to brand for Denture Adhesive  .the tube is low cost and last a long time too&lt;br /&gt;I did receive my product from BzzAgent to try for free to review</li>
    <li> This product is highly recommended for anyone looking to assist in keeping your dentures in place.  Have used for years and find the best prices on Amazon</li>
    <li> Holds well, no bad taste, easier to remove from denture and mouth than other brands.</li>
    <li> The hold is great. I usually apply about 6 am and remove about 8-9 pm. One of the things I don&#x27;t like is its hard to remove it from my gums  it doesn&#x27;t ooze. ** I received this product as part of a promotion from the brand.**</li>
    <li> Best price and since using my dentures are secure! :-)</li>
    <li> Excelente producto lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> As a BuzzAgent, I was sent this product to review.  I loved it.  The hold it gives is awesome and lasts the entire day.  I can now eat foods that I thought I would never be able to enjoy again since I have a full top plate.</li>
    <li> I have tried other denture creams and none hold as well as Fixodent. I could hardly eat anything and would have to apply more cream, Fixodent solved that problem. It is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone that has had dentures for awhile or anyone just getting dentures.</li>
    <li> Full my expectatativas with respect to the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many store brand denture adhesive because they were cheaper. The store brand does not hold all day. I have had my dentures for over 7 years. Fixodent original works great from the time I get up to the time I go to bed. I eat all kinds of foods apples, corn on the cob, even steaks. The only trouble  I have had is eating sticky candy and some gums will pull the dentures loose. As for the zinc its doesn&#x27;t bother me.I soak my dentures over night clean and dry them before putting adhesive on the dentures. I&#x27;m writing this review on Fixodent that they sent Free to try through Bzz Agent.</li>
    <li> I like it. I was surprised at how good it held. I think it could have lasted a little longer though. gp/product/B003V5CTP0?redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</li>
    <li> I received the Fixodent Original to try and i have been using it for  a couple of weeks now.I like that it really holds and there is no worry of my dentures falling out while eating.It makes my dentures feel comfortable.It is easy to apply.I will for sure be using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Look forward to future deliveries</li>
    <li> No problems. Shipped as promised.</li>
    <li> Works better than any of the others that I have tried. I generally don&#x27;t have to reset the top plate all day. I usually reset the bottom plate once during the day. The grip is good and it does not ooze too much like some of the others on the market.</li>
    <li> Works but it is not great. Witnessing from a member of the family struggle with fake teeth is a lesson for us all. Short of getting the transplants where they insert some metal into the mouth, so that the dentures can click and remain in place, this adhesive, and others, are the only thing that a person can use to keep them in place. Perhaps is the bad dentistry where the money got spent, but the results where dismal. Perhaps is the personal individual&#x27;s mouth that makes it hard to accept and live with dentures. After many dollars, and many similar dentures from similar dentists, the last version gets its dose of Fixodent Original Denture Adhesive Cream, each morning, after having been submerged all night in a glass of water with this tablet (the name skips me right now), is it Polident? Then after they are secured in the mouth, the day takes place, and most of the times they get loose before the sun sets. Is it the adhesive, is the failure of many dentists unable to provide a decent set of dentures? We can not tell, but we suspect everyone and every product we have tried. For if it isn&#x27;t the dentist fault, then it is the adhesive. If it is not the adhesive fault, then surely the blame falls on the dentists.&lt;br /&gt;3.5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I have tried several of the major brands as well as the store brand and keep coming back to Fixodent. Now I use the regular or the one with Scope. I don&#x27; t have to worry about my dentures slipping or sliding. The hold is great and I eat anything that I ate before having dentures. The feel is comfortable enough that I don&#x27;t feel as if I&#x27;m wearing dentures. I won&#x27;t flop back and forth again as I am a true Fixodent Complete Original Denture Adhesive fan and recommend it to my friends. I was offered a free sample of Fixodent and was quick to take the free product as I use it regularly.  The fact that the product was free did not influence my review.</li>
    <li> Gift for cousin in foreign country who chose among many brands and&lt;br /&gt;decided that FIXODENT was the best.  Go AMAZON!---</li>
    <li> Good Product for my dentures. Solid performace , hold real well and does a great job.Stays firm all day and It helps me when I eat.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;root&amp;#34; for fixadent</li>
    <li> I got this for someone for Christmas it was a 3 pack deal and a good value and alot cheaper then walmart for 3 of them. so yeah if you are looking for this i&#x27;d say you should buy it</li>
    <li> Best denture adhesive there is!</li>
