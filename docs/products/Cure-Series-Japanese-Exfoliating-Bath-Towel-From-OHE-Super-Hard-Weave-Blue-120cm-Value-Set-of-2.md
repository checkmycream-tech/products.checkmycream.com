      <li>Have used for over a year and always get so many compliments on my 58 year old skin.</li>

      <li>I stumbled on these and based on the positive reviews decided to give them a go.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These bath towels are great!  I love the way my skin feels after using it, and believe the exfoliation is the best I&#x27;ve tried in any product (loofah, washcloth, bath pouf, etc.).  I can get exfoliation from every angle - this thing is huge (like, 4&#x27; long, and 12&amp;#34; wide) - back, sides, you name it - and I love the clean feeling.  Would and have recommended this towel.</li>
    <li> I usually buy exfoliating bath towels from specialty Asian supermarkets located in Chicago land area. I needed to replenish my supply of exfoliating bath towels and did not feel like driving to the store so I decided to buy on-line. I was attracted to the Cure series because of the bright color blue. I would give 5 stars but the of price compared to other exfoliating bath towels was much higher ($$$) I gave 4 stars instead.</li>
    <li> These are great washing towels.  The length on these helps you to get your entire back and you really feel clean after using these.  This is my second purchase of these cloths and I plan to gift some as well.  If you don&#x27;t like a really deep scrub, you may have to buy the less rough ones.  I like these because I get flakey winter skin and these help to keep flakes at bay.  Followed by some good lotion or Aquaphor these will keep you skin soft and smooth through the dry and cold winter.  I would recommend these highly.</li>
    <li> I love these bath towels.&lt;br /&gt;They are the very best I have ever found and used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> These towels are awesome. They exceeded my expectations. Results are rapid, my skin has never felt better. I have my family and friends hooked. I plan on stocking up.</li>
    <li> I never in my life would have imagined buying a product like this... And actually when I was told I had to exfoliate before getting a spray tan (for an upcoming role) I wasn&#x27;t really sure what the heck that meant. I first bought a loofah sponge (another first)... But the ease and coverage of this towel kicks loofah&#x27;s tiny a**.</li>
    <li> Love these XL wash cloths!!  Tried a couple of varieties before finding these Cure Series bath towels and I love they way the wash away the dead skin cells.  Feel cleaner and more refreshed than ever before - will never go back to regular wash cloths again.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended these.  She said get the blue, the other colors are not as good.</li>
    <li> Just OK to me. The Salux cloth is better in my opinion. This one is bigger but if you used the Salux and are satisfied with it then don&#x27;t bother to buy this one.</li>
    <li> I love this loofah bath towel</li>
    <li> Love these exfoliating towels that are hard to find. The ones you find in stores are usually too soft and definitely shorter than these. They are rough like i like them to feel the scrub. These things are also pretty long which makes scrubbing your back a snap. I gave them 4 stars for the price.</li>
    <li> Great value! Item came as described. Great exfoliator.</li>
    <li> The skin has a mantle that must be maintained in order to maintain the health of an individual&#x27;s skin. Using this SUPER HARD WEAVE sands away that mantle, leaving skin not-so-soft until the mantle recovers. I still love the idea of these wonderful long shower scrubs though, and look forward to trying the less abrasive weaves. I&#x27;m guessing one of them will be a 5-star product for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I love it</li>
    <li> I bought these towels after I went to a Korean Sauna. I liked the towels that they supplied us with they were long and hard which made my body feel invigorated and clean. I decided to look for something similar to them. I stumbled on these and based on the positive reviews decided to give them a go. And I am glad that I did. I absolutely love them. They are so good I got my whole family using them. They are long enough that I can scrub my back with ease!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smooth and radiant. I look and feel younger. And these towels work miracles on the elbows and feet (in combo with a nice stone). I highly recommend these Japanese exfoliating bath towels they are a good and worthwhile investment.</li>
    <li> works as expected just like the ones i used in japan 25 years ago. good product...</li>
    <li> I have used all sorts of different body scrubbers and this one by far takes the cake. It is a bit rough and when I first used one many years ago I didnt like how rough it was on my skin but truth is we need a deep clean on our skin. After getting used to the scrubber I never went back to using anything else. It&#x27;s a great exfoliator. My BF bought me one from Japan and I had a hard time trying to find them here in the US and when I did I ordered a few. They last a very long time. I had one for over a year and they are amazing. I feel so clean and soft after each use. Worth every penny and def beats those cheap made scrubs from walmart.</li>
    <li> Excellent and speedy service, thank you!  So delighted to find these exfoliating towels in &amp;#34;super hard weave&amp;#34; from &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34;.  The others on the Amazon site from &amp;#34;Salux&amp;#34; come in lovely colors but are not nerly as exfoliating as this one from &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34;. Brilliant product from Japan!  This blue one is a gorgeous color and the extra length makes it perfect for scrubbing one&#x27;s back in the shower.  Only wonder why it only comes in cobalt blue?</li>
    <li> This is a great size and has enough roughness to feel it is doing the job.  Easy peasy to scrub my back.</li>
    <li> My husband is a large man.  He now can scrub his back correctly.  Seems to last a long time vs the wadded up ones.  We went to this because we now live in a warm climate, and we needed our scrubby to get dry to not mold up.  So much other benefits we wont use anything else now.</li>
    <li> I love using this product.  For years I have used a regular loofah from department stores.  These Japanese towels lather better and really exfoliates my skin.  I can reach my back also which I couldnt do with the loofah.  These are easy to wash out also.  I highly recccomend</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower with either African Black Soap or Charcoal Bar Soap. Afterwards my skin feels so soft and the moisturizers absorbs much better giving my skin a healthy silky glow. The bath towel lathers the soap a lot. It&#x27;s very long (11x47) and stretches. It dries fast so they are great for traveling. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have thin/ sensitive/ delicate skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years.  They hold up well, have a nice length, and are quite coarse.  Some may not like the texture, but to me, it&#x27;s like a gentle exfoliation every day.  Even got one of my sisters hooked on them!</li>
    <li> Scrubs me up nicely.  Very polished and buffed.</li>
    <li> Awesome scrubber. Warning, this is not for the delicate skinned.</li>
    <li> These things are the bomb!</li>
    <li> Love these cloths. My skin is no longer flaky or dry.</li>
    <li> Longer and more rough on your skin than the green 110cm version.  The blue is very course and more rough overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to feel the towel as though it&#x27;s scraping your skin off, go with this one over the green.  I like them both on different days, depending on what I&#x27;m in the mood to use.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I feel so clean and fresh after a shower and though it really scrapes off all the dirt, it&#x27;s not that rough on your skin at all</li>
    <li> Very handy and great for travel, good quality</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Described as a towel, it&#x27;s a narrow strip. I did not find it easy to use on my back.  Would not recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> Does a great job but wife thinks the towel is not coarse enough! It does the job for me!</li>
    <li> I can feel it working on my skin and the fact that I can reach my back is very important to me.</li>
    <li> Love, love,love them! Have used for over a year and always get so many compliments on my 58 year old skin.</li>
    <li> I love these. They exfoliate so well! These might be too rough if u have more sensitive skin but I love them. About to put my 3rd order in.</li>
    <li> I love these bath towels.</li>
    <li> The best exfoliating bath towel it is long and wide, so easy to wash my back now. Better then back brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these things...works great</li>
    <li> Works very well. Long enough to easily scribe my back.</li>
    <li> Very thick. Thicker than the Bass one I had. I love this! It is longer than the Bass one also.  Rough texture, but not scratchy.  Love love love this</li>
    <li> It would be nice if it came with a loop to hang it in the showerThey are super long which is good if you have a large back. I might cut mine. Its basically a flat version of the cheap flower shower gel scrubbers that come in every bath set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the blue color is pretty meh. I wish it was maybe off-white or something more pastel and less industrial blue.</li>
    <li> Love how it cleans and exfoliates my skin.</li>
    <li> These bath towels are great! I have been using them for 4 years.  I use them when I shower and have noticed that after a few months of using this with regular body wash that the scars on my face are reduced significantly!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has acne scars.</li>
    <li> just as expected, nice to my skin and even my son uses it</li>
    <li> I like the length and the texture feels good, and it lathers your body wash really, but me personally would prefer something a little rougher.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product and decided I had to try the bath towel out for myself.  So worth it!  I came out of the shower feeling like a million dollars, the texture is perfect, and the price is fantastic.  I also received my shipment really fast, just a day after I placed my order.  Try it, you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
    <li> These did not come with English instructions, but I read a couple reviews that explained them. They work better than I expected. My first one I cut in half, but that was a mistake. It started to fray. It works better folded over anyway, I think it makes it foam up more. I really like how these remove dead and dry skin. I found these on a Recommended For You list on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these towels! The ones they have here in the US are tiny and weak! they are made of the same material but for some reason they are softer, i like scrubbing my back and this does the job. Its long enough to make that happen, and my back feels really exfoliated after I&#x27;m done. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> You will never feel cleaner.  This is hands down the best shower companion that renders washcloths obsolete.  I tried various exfoliating soaps, which clogged the drain and were actually less effective than this simple, breathable woven towel.  Long enough to swish your back and luxuriously sudsy.  Your skin will glow, your shaves will be closer and your moisturizer will absorb more readily.  Just ordered more for xmas stocking stuffers.  Not sure this would work so well on man fur but my lady friends will definitely appreciate.</li>
    <li> Very large in size, maybe to big.  Does an excellent job of exfoliating the skin.  I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABM</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, FEELS GOOD. It&#x27;s better than candy. I feel like I just upgraded. I am use to using Japanese bath towels and was sure ready for the super weave. WOW, just amazing. It maybe on the long size, but easier to hold on to. Happy scrubbing! Ordering extra, when you don&#x27;t feel that wow factor it&#x27;s time for a new one ;)</li>
    <li> No more messy and slippery cream exfoliators in the shower.  These bath towels are amazing.  You can even use this to smooth your back without any help.  Feels amazing.  I bought the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  Love the way my skin feels after my shower and I always follow up with a moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliator, I use it daily and moisturizer afterwards and my skin feels smooth. It also takes away unwanted tan lines. Will definitely purchase again :)</li>
    <li> Works Great,  love the way my skin feels after use of this towel.</li>
    <li> This product has helped when it came to my horrible dry skin problem. I heard about this product in an online forum. I&#x27;m African- American and my problems areas are my knees, elbows and ankles. This towels wiped those problems away like it was nothing. I always leave the shower feeling squeaky clean. Little did I know how much I was neglecting to scrub my back.  I love these towels for the price and this product comes wonderfully packaged.</li>
