      <li>I am enjoying this perfume.</li>
      <li>sensational, really!!</li>
      <li>Great gift for that special lady/girl in your life ;-)</li>

      <li>If you are patient and willing to wait to get it, then it&#x27;s totally worth it!!! :)</li>
      <li>the fragrancy&#x27;s very good and remains for a long time.</li>
      <li>The lighter form of body lotion has very tiny illuminating specks that look beautiful.</li>
      <li>I call it my &#x27;instant happy&#x27; scent.  </li>
      <li>Amazon definitely had the best value , so I ordered it that very evening .</li>
      <li>My new favorite!  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear fragrance for many years, because i can&#x27;t wear strong odors, but, recently i have been venturing into some upscale fragrances and finding better quality products.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite floral scented perfume, it&#x27;s not overbearing</li>
      <li>like I perceived it on my friend or mildly repugnant like I perceive it on myself --</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and floral with an &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; of spice which, for me, makes it suitable not only for spring &amp; summer for year-round wear!  </li>
      <li>Since their initial fragrance is being phased out, I&#x27;m so glad to have discovered Valentina!  </li>
      <li>it was exactly what she wanted!</li>
      <li>Have it ready for Sunday!</li>
      <li>The first time that i heard about this perfume was because their advertising.</li>
      <li>many compliments and lasts and long time on the body.  </li>
      <li>fast delivery</li>
      <li>It was absolutely heavenly--powdery soft and the very essence of femininity .</li>
      <li>but I love it so much I&#x27;ll wear it year round.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s new.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more frustrated, it is an AMAZING scent.</li>
      <li>buy it on amazon, but try it on yourself first at your local brick and mortar.</li>
      <li>Its floral but not too sweet, personally I feel it i can be wear day for the office or night on a romantic date.</li>
      <li>I know that body chemistry influences how a perfume smells on any given person, so I can&#x27;t be surprised, but I do not like the way it smells on me.</li>
      <li>We feel as though said product is old</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Dolce &amp; Gabbana for nearly 10 years as my preferred perfume and thought that nothing else could compare.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t smell the same and the smell does not linger on her like the old bottle did .</li>

<li> Wondering why this perfumes scent doesn&#x27;t last long on me....</li>
<li> Long lasting!</li>
<li> It also is long lasting on the body and mellows as time goes by.  </li>
<li> I still wear it if I know I&#x27;ll be at a short event, or out for a limited amount of time.</li>
<li> Its last longer than any other that I have</li>
<li> but the scent lasts very long on my skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;re perceiving the smell, if it is soft</li>
<li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
<li> It&#x27;d starting to be my everyday perfume!</li>
<li> A little.</li>
<li> Im weak with bath gels and a friend gave me for a present 2 bottles of this scent, when I tried it</li>
<li> Not to heavy.</li>
<li> I was worried I received a boot-leg formula and obtained a few sample from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
<li> I always get compliments on this scent, a little lasts all day...delightful!</li>
<li> I am not satisfied with the purchase of the body creme or cologne!!!!&lt;br</li>
<li> She is very unhappy with the new products.</li>
<li> Sorry I think it&#x27;s fake.</li>
<li> Very disappointed that she is not pleased and can&#x27;t help but wonder what really is wrong with this product or what we can do about it!</li>
<li> very disappointed; this may be a fake; fragrance flies away in just a moment,</li>

    <li> I love this fragrance,  and the price is great.  The one pictured is the smaller size so the flower design is not the same.</li>
    <li> The first time that i heard about this perfume was because their advertising. Im weak with bath gels and a friend gave me for a present 2 bottles of this scent, when I tried it I definitely love it and bought the perfume. Its last longer than any other that I have and Im currently using 9 different perfums. Its floral but not too sweet, personally I feel it i can be wear day for the office or night on a romantic date.</li>
    <li> She loved it at EPCOT in the France pavilion.  Got it on Amazon for $20 less.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> Great smell!  It&#x27;d starting to be my everyday perfume!</li>
    <li> Amazing smell, lasts all day !  All I want on a perfume</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Dolce &amp; Gabbana for nearly 10 years as my preferred perfume and thought that nothing else could compare.  Since their initial fragrance is being phased out, I&#x27;m so glad to have discovered Valentina!  It&#x27;s light and floral with an &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; of spice which, for me, makes it suitable not only for spring &amp; summer for year-round wear!  It&#x27;s new.  It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> It was just  colored water.  No fragrance whats-so-ever.  A total rip off.  I will never order perfume from there again.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite floral scented perfume, it&#x27;s not overbearing but the scent lasts very long on my skin. Love the design of the bottle, it&#x27;s very unique and looks exquisite on my dresser. Great gift for that special lady/girl in your life ;-)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and saved over $25 because I bought it on line. It is the same as the perfume you get in the store. If you are patient and willing to wait to get it, then it&#x27;s totally worth it!!! :)</li>
    <li> Love it! and it&#x27;s the original not a knockoff as far as I can tell smells just like the one you get at Nordstroms just not as expensive</li>
    <li> sensational, really!! great price point for an exclusive line.  many compliments and lasts and long time on the body.  generous amount for the price.  Im hooked for LIFE!!</li>
    <li> Wear it every day.  Nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I recieve compliments EVERY TIME I wear this fragrance. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> my wife loves it !! fast delivery</li>
    <li> Perfect. Everything was like they said....</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance. Purchased the body cream, the scent is easy on the nose and feels wonderful on the skin. Then i purchased the lighter body lotion and the Eau de Parfum, all wonderful. If you cannot wear anything strong, this will offer you a great option. The lighter form of body lotion has very tiny illuminating specks that look beautiful. This is not glitter so don&#x27;t worry that you&#x27;ll be all glittered up. I wouldn&#x27;t wear fragrance for many years, because i can&#x27;t wear strong odors, but, recently i have been venturing into some upscale fragrances and finding better quality products. It also is long lasting on the body and mellows as time goes by.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Nice floral sent. Not to heavy.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this scent, a little lasts all day...delightful!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mom who had just finished a bottle from a leading department store . She is very unhappy with the new products. They don&#x27;t smell the same and the smell does not linger on her like the old bottle did . We feel as though said product is old and/or has been drastically changed. Very disappointed that she is not pleased and can&#x27;t help but wonder what really is wrong with this product or what we can do about it! I am not satisfied with the purchase of the body creme or cologne!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Elaine Mazza and Theresa Zappa</li>
    <li> Selected the Valentino spray based on recommendations of others who purchaed. so my wife received the spray as a gift last year and loves it. Now I must buy a &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; as it has become her favorite perfume. A home run fragrance.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> lovely feminine fragrance - very nice</li>
    <li> Amazing, very good choice.</li>
    <li> This scent is absolutely amazing !!  Fresh, sophisticated, and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Update *8/22/2014*&lt;br /&gt;I still feel the same way about this scent. It is absolutely delicious. However, it does not last. I was worried I received a boot-leg formula and obtained a few sample from Macy&#x27;s. Same experience. I had others smell my wrist after 45 minutes and it was undetectable. I still wear it if I know I&#x27;ll be at a short event, or out for a limited amount of time. I purchased a roller ball applicator in hopes that applying it in a more concentrated amount would help. It does. A little. I couldn&#x27;t be more frustrated, it is an AMAZING scent. What good is that if you can&#x27;t experience it??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this smells!. Notes of amber, vanilla and woodsy layers. It&#x27;s amazing. Great for night but not too much for day. Summertime is pushing it but I love it so much I&#x27;ll wear it year round.</li>
    <li> I love the smell!!!!!  The bottle is beautiful too.</li>
    <li> Had bought one before as a gift, wife loved it so much she asked me for one for Mother&#x27;s Day. Have it ready for Sunday! Long lasting!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it! it was exactly what she wanted! the fragrancy&#x27;s very good and remains for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s feminine and seductive but not overpowering.  A lot of people ask me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.  It&#x27;s my new favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> Wondering why this perfumes scent doesn&#x27;t last long on me....</li>
    <li> Sorry I think it&#x27;s fake. Bought this for my wife more than once. This is NOT the same as the others. Smell goes away in minutes</li>
    <li> Love this and the price was awesome!!</li>
    <li> Great smell. I am enjoying this perfume.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!  My new favorite!  I call it my &#x27;instant happy&#x27; scent.  And this was the best price I found for the larger 2.7 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> My review needs some context...I smelled this scent on a friend of mine . It was absolutely heavenly--powdery soft and the very essence of femininity . I asked her what the perfume was, and rushed to compare online prices for the bottle. Amazon definitely had the best value , so I ordered it that very evening . I know that body chemistry influences how a perfume smells on any given person, so I can&#x27;t be surprised, but I do not like the way it smells on me. HOWEVER, I get sooooooo many compliments when I do wear it! My husband loves it, and anyone close enough to get a whiff asks me, hypnotically, what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;re perceiving the smell, if it is soft like I perceived it on my friend or mildly repugnant like I perceive it on myself -- bottom line: buy it on amazon, but try it on yourself first at your local brick and mortar.</li>
    <li> very disappointed; this may be a fake; fragrance flies away in just a moment,</li>
    <li> I dont like this perfum! Smell awfull....</li>
