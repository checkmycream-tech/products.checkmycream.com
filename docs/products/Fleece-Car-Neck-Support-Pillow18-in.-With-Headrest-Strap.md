      <li>It is easy to put on existing headrest.  </li>
      <li>It slips easily over your headrest, and it&#x27;s easy to move from seat to seat, or car to car.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable neck support in addition to the car&#x27;s headrest makes resting in the car much more comfortable</li>
      <li>This fleece car neck support is just the ticket for easy driving.</li>

      <li>Fine product.</li>
      <li>Slips easily onto front seat of my Volvo S60, and stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;Attractive design and styling, comfortable cover and cushioning.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>Stays in place fine.</li>
      <li>low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is fine for me.  </li>
      <li>I had to tie up the strap into a knot to make it fit around the head rest.  </li>
      <li>Really comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It does flatten out a wee bit over time, but still maintains a comfortable resting position for my neck when driving.</li>

      <li>Too bulky to be comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It fits comfortably over the headrest of my seat in my Chevy Express 3500.  </li>
      <li>after a while when you start breaking it in slowly it becomes more comfertable to the point now that its just perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;You would probebly need to lean your chairs</li>
      <li>I actually like it more than my bed pillow which cost me more than $100.00, so I am ordering another one to sleep on!</li>
      <li>Love this, really saves me from headaches.</li>
      <li>I may eventually wrap this thing in a cotton pillow case to keep it cool and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Seems like it would fit most fully fixed seats with no adjustable headrest.  </li>
      <li>This somewhat tricky process resulted in the pillow resting high on the seat and in a better position on my neck.  </li>
      <li>I decided that it would be worth taking a chance.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Still worth getting and altering.</li>
      <li>Whether I&#x27;m on a long car trip, or I&#x27;ve stretched-out for a quick car nap, this pillow offers great support and comfort.  </li>
      <li>This was just what I was looking for and the price was right.</li>
      <li>What I can say is that it is soft and comfortable and looks like it would give the right support on my seat if I raise the head rest and place it in the space provided.  </li>
      <li>First, I have a rolled up towel which I shove under my knees.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I&#x27;ll like it better next winter, but for now it seems too hot.</li>
      <li>I have used it consistently in my Jeep Liberty, baby Mercedes, and now in my SmartCar.</li>
      <li>but the few times i did it provided good neck support.</li>
      <li>and I really wish I had this right after the surgery.</li>
      <li>It fits around the seat perfectly and provides just the right amount of cushioning without thrusting my head forward into an awkward position.</li>
      <li>I am now using a large safety pin to keep it in place.</li>
      <li>It was reasonably priced, so I kept it.</li>
      <li>In fact, I like it so much</li>
      <li>strap looks very sturdy</li>
      <li>VERY DURABLE</li>
      <li>It provides that important support for the neck when I want to lean back.</li>
      <li>This is one of those gadgets that seem to be just the ticket for comfort but in the real world don&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have arthritis in my neck and this really helps support my neck.</li>
      <li>The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is the the strap that goes around the headrest get stretches out (fairly quickly) and then it&#x27;s a struggle to keep it on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you tend to prefer soft support, but caution that not every product will work for everyone.</li>
      <li>I have been through and by far</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit my car seat and its not comfortable.</li>
      <li>but other then that its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It takes too long to get everything in place for quick errands around town, but for my daily commute, it has made a big difference.</li>
      <li>Strap for headrest is not tight enough and the pillow sags.  </li>
      <li>Due to the large attached strap that goes over the headrest, you may need to move it up to where you want it.</li>
      <li>so it sits exactly where I want it and wont have to reposition slightly.</li>
      <li>do a few other things to help with a comfortable drive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does the trick. One negative star for a non-adjustable strap.</li>
    <li> the pillow ends up sitting in an awkward spot so it gives me a kink on my neck. Its ok</li>
    <li> It stays put with the strap that goes over the headrest,super comfy ,may order another one for my other car</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Neck support is the best. U may not know it but you need one.</li>
    <li> I have a Dodge Caravan, and the headrest is useless.  With this pillow, I have perfect support.  It is easy to put on existing headrest.  Stays in place fine.</li>
    <li> I like this pillow a lot.  A little firmer than I prefer.  During a long ride, I have to adjust it a lot or I&#x27;ll end up with a headache.</li>
    <li> These neck pillows are just perfect.  They are very soft and are great for resting you neck in the car.  Good support too.</li>
    <li> This s my 2nd one.  Now I have one for the front seat &amp; rear seat.</li>
    <li> Very nice and comfortable once it is adjusted to the correct height.</li>
    <li> This is an OK neck pillow.  It is not a bone pillow.  Strap for headrest is not tight enough and the pillow sags.  Have to raise pillow up out of your back every time you get in car.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this, really saves me from headaches. Don&#x27;t leave without it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I like that it is made in the usa.  I wish it came in other colors but it actually doesn&#x27;t look bad in my Dodge Caravan.</li>
    <li> I suffer from slip disks and driving makes my neck hurt this pillow is great and gives great support Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I own 2 of these pillows and leave each in one of my cars and take 1 on the plane with me, as the strap fits nicely over those seats as well. I have a neck injury front a very bad auto accident and found every other support to be to too hard. This pillow combines the proper amount of support and softness for me to help with my neck pain while driving and sitting for long distances. I highly recommend it if you tend to prefer soft support, but caution that not every product will work for everyone.</li>
    <li> Really comfortable.  Good buy</li>
    <li> Too big for the purpose.  I had to tie up the strap into a knot to make it fit around the head rest.  Too bulky to be comfortable.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use in my car and soon fell in love with it.  I actually like it more than my bed pillow which cost me more than $100.00, so I am ordering another one to sleep on!</li>
    <li> This neck pillow is comfortable to use at all and the band behind the cushion is too long. For its price, this product is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return but the seller did not accept it because I used it already. What a bummer!</li>
    <li> This is one of those gadgets that seem to be just the ticket for comfort but in the real world don&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you mount it (as shown) on the headrest&#x27;s extension rails, the pillow lacks the thickness to support your neck unless you recline your seat to a ridiculous angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s been my experience over a couple of long trips. The thing now lives in my trunk.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I looked everywhere to find a product that does what this product does.  I like neck and head support when I drive.  This is more comfortable than my tilt forward head rest in my Escalade.  I love this cushion.  It fits comfortably over the headrest of my seat in my Chevy Express 3500.  Seems like it would fit most fully fixed seats with no adjustable headrest.  This was just what I was looking for and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I always wondered if having a pillow would help the driving experience and if you do long commutes it does!&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning i do have to warn you that it is a bit &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a while when you start breaking it in slowly it becomes more comfertable to the point now that its just perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;You would probebly need to lean your chairs 1 click back but other then that its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material itself is very soft to the touch like a very fluffy teddy bear.&lt;br /&gt;the strap looks very sturdy but unfortunatly it doesnt have any velkro straps on it.</li>
    <li> Not good for travel. ..maybe at home</li>
    <li> Neck pillow is just to big for the back of my neck.  So it did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received on due date</li>
    <li> Comfortable neck support in addition to the car&#x27;s headrest makes resting in the car much more comfortable and I was able to sleep instead of trying to find a comfortable place to rest my head.</li>
    <li> Way too big and pushes your head forward. I think like other reviewers say, it depends on the type car seats you have if this will work.</li>
    <li> Liked everthing about pillow except the length which made looking over my shoulder awkward.  I use for protection from head rest while driving and need unblocked visibility.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help my drives out of town.  I have received it, but haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet in the car for its intended purpose.  What I can say is that it is soft and comfortable and looks like it would give the right support on my seat if I raise the head rest and place it in the space provided.  I am glad that I got it, just wish I would have actually put it in the car by now.</li>
    <li> Item arrived before quoted time.  Would like to have it stuffed more ... after three uses .... item has a permanent indentation and am looking for filler to stuff in it.  Would have preferred a darker color as it needs to be washed after several use.  Am looking to make a removable cover so it cas be washed instead of the pillow itself.  Would recommend Seller ~ not his fault product doesn&#x27;t hold up to wear and tear.</li>
    <li> I love these things, I ordered two, one for me and one for my wife. I just bought a car that we plan on using for long trips. The seats are great but I felt like I needed some additional head/neck support after an hour or so of driving. This does that. It also can be used as a pillow or arm rest for either of us. My wife also loves hers. Due to the large attached strap that goes over the headrest, you may need to move it up to where you want it. I am going to take some slack out of mine so it sits exactly where I want it and wont have to reposition slightly. Oh, and it is fleeced, just not a rip off.</li>
    <li> Love it! I keep buying this as a gift or everyone that rides in my car.  The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is the the strap that goes around the headrest get stretches out (fairly quickly) and then it&#x27;s a struggle to keep it on. I am now using a large safety pin to keep it in place. It would be better if there was an adjustable strap that could be cinched as needed.&lt;br /&gt;Still worth getting and altering.</li>
    <li> This neck support has worked well in my town car. It&#x27;s a great value at its price point. It would be ideal if the cover was removable to allow for washing. Do recommend it for long distance travel.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel, the strap is a very good idea as stays in place when leaving the car. Fine product.</li>
    <li> I work odd hours so I take a lot of naps in my car. This cushion feels like a memory foam pillow I&#x27;d buy for my bed. It gives great support to my head and neck. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for several years and I still love it! It does flatten out a wee bit over time, but still maintains a comfortable resting position for my neck when driving. I have used it consistently in my Jeep Liberty, baby Mercedes, and now in my SmartCar. In fact, I like it so much &amp; it is so lightweight &amp; portable that I recently decided to make it my travel pillow for airline trips &amp; neck support in guest rooms or rental cars too! LOVE IT. VERY DURABLE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this neck pillow for several weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well in my car. The strap isn&#x27;t adjustable, so I had to pull it really tight back through the headrest and loop the pillow back over the strap.  This somewhat tricky process resulted in the pillow resting high on the seat and in a better position on my neck.  Without this adjustment it would hang too low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is fine for me.  I&#x27;ve discovered that comfort for this type of pillow depends on your size and taste.  It works for me.  It might not work for you.  The only way to know is to try it.  I decided that it would be worth taking a chance.  With an hour commute to work each day, my neck was killing me.  This helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the material.  It&#x27;s a fleece, which is too warm for me. Perhaps I&#x27;ll like it better next winter, but for now it seems too hot. Again, however, it&#x27;s better than an aching neck.  I do think a cotton or polyester cover would be better.  A removable cover would also help.  I may eventually wrap this thing in a cotton pillow case to keep it cool and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a few other things to help with a comfortable drive.  First, I have a rolled up towel which I shove under my knees. This lifts my knees up by 3-4 inches, and the result is that it pushes my back into the seat and the pillow into the proper place on my neck. You have to get used to driving like this.  The seat has to be a little closer to reach the gas since your legs are \\&quot;shorter\\&quot;.  I also use a small, firm pillow on my mid-back to provide a little extra support.  I only use these additional adjustment for longer trips. It takes too long to get everything in place for quick errands around town, but for my daily commute, it has made a big difference.</li>
    <li> Slips easily onto front seat of my Volvo S60, and stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;Attractive design and styling, comfortable cover and cushioning.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with quality and value.</li>
    <li> does not fit car, not adjustable. don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> Good neck support.  Can easily be added/removed.  Used for long 14 hour trip, but still using.  Easily moved from Prius to Mazda.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it is too big to use in my vehicle behind the neck.  I actually have it in my bed, it&#x27;s a nice pill for tucking under your arm or knee.  If I was taller, it may work in a vehicle for you.  It was reasonably priced, so I kept it.</li>
    <li> I have serious cervical issues that requires a firm support both in the car and at work.  This is the sixth \\&quot;neck support\\&quot; I have been through and by far this is the best.  In the car it fits in the gap between the headrest and the back of the seat and it&#x27;s width provides stability in almost all conditions.  In addition, I purchased a second for utlization at work.  I went through a lot of medical justification to have my work purchase a special \\&quot;ergonomic\\&quot; chair for me, but the neck support was poor.  This item provides great support for my neck on my work chair and I have had others in my office also purchase this item and their opinions are the same as mine.</li>
    <li> This pillow is absolutely perfect. It fits around the seat perfectly and provides just the right amount of cushioning without thrusting my head forward into an awkward position. I had spinal neck surgery and I really wish I had this right after the surgery. I am going to get another one and try to make it fit on my lazyboy! I don&#x27;t care if I have to cut it and restitch it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my car seat and its not comfortable. Waste of money. If you plan to buy a car neck support avoid this product.</li>
    <li> This pillow has greatly increased my comfort level on car trips when I&#x27;m the passenger. It provides that important support for the neck when I want to lean back.</li>
    <li> This works great in my car.  Whether I&#x27;m on a long car trip, or I&#x27;ve stretched-out for a quick car nap, this pillow offers great support and comfort.  It slips easily over your headrest, and it&#x27;s easy to move from seat to seat, or car to car.  Very, very nice!</li>
    <li> I have not used it mich but the few times i did it provided good neck support. Is firm yet not to hard. But is shaped a little oddly/hard to get it into proper neck position.</li>
    <li> This fleece car neck support is just the ticket for easy driving. I have arthritis in my neck and this really helps support my neck. I have one for each car and got one for my daughter&#x27;s car. Great item.....</li>
    <li> The neck support looked bigger in the image.  I want to send back but due to my surgery on my neck I lost the receipt.  I wanted to put it my car so I would have added support when I start driving again.</li>
