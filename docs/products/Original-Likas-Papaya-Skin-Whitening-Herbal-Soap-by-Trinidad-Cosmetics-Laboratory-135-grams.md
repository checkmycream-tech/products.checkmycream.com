<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not a bad product I like the soap have been using it for about 2 months but have not noticed any significant lightening of the skin but helps maintain clear and toned skin complexion</li>
    <li> Ok smell but no noticeable effects</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a normal soap, it didn&#x27;t make me any fairer (I use it thinking specially in whitening my knees and arm pits) and it smells kinda funny, but it does clean and make your skin soft. I think I expected too much of it, anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this the first time and saw results gradually. I notice from my first purchase that it would basically peel the skin by drying it out so I wouldnt suggest moisturizing if you want results fast. It took about two to three months and from then on, my skin tone returned to normal (fair). I am buying it once again since I was pleased with the results the first time, however, there is a change to the design of the soap. I am not sure if its the real soap or not but from what I gather online, the company has changed the more round oval curve soap to a soap with a bit more edge (ridges). Will be trying this and update my review on results. Recomended for those who want to lighten tan, not lighten actual skin color. I rarely have pimples so I have no opinion regarding its effectiveness towards clearing skin.</li>
    <li> I used two bars of likas soap... Bought it so lighten up the unwanted  tan line. No result! Skin color remained the same.</li>
    <li> This soap will lighten your skin and leaves your skin feeling extremely dry. So it does what it is suppose to. However, it  smells awful!!!</li>
    <li> been using this product for only a week now and i&#x27;m actually liking it a lot since it&#x27;s smell light and its really cleaning. I don&#x27;t just using it on my face but i leave it in the shower to be used all over and i tan really easily so i was looking for a product that can lighten be up since i just got back from ONE day of being at the beach for like one hour. anyways i did notice my skin is getting lighter to when i was before i went to the beach but i&#x27;m sure if i use this produce for a little longer then i will notice a lot more change. so fare i&#x27;m liking it and will repost back when i finish the bar. md</li>
    <li> I used this for 2 weeks twice a day and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin except dryness. It just gave me a squeaky clean feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical of beauty soaps since they don&#x27;t stay on your skin for a long time, but because of the raving reviews of this product I decided to give it a try. I don&#x27;t breakout really bad, but I do get some pimples around my period and sometimes they&#x27;re big. I had about three when I got the Likas soap and I was shocked that my pimples where so tiny and dry in the morning. By day 2 they were completely dry. I have been using the soap for a week and a dark spot from a previous blemish is almost gone. I never saw a product work this fast! I&#x27;m totally in love with this soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: it does dry out your skin a bit, just make sure that you follow it with toner and moisturizer with SPF for your skin type, other than that GREAT!!</li>
    <li> It did make my skin a little bit lighter but I started getting a lot of black heads on my face so I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Not really seeing results</li>
    <li> took 5 years to see the result lol...... my skin is definitely lighter&lt;br /&gt;the thing is... it will dry ur skin out really bad</li>
    <li> I began using this soap about a month ago and it never did anything, other than dry my skin out. It seems that after about 6 uses the drying stops being as severe and around use 10-12 it stops altogether (at least for me). I wish it would have worked I was looking forward to a more even tone, but oh well its $5.00 I have wasted way more money or other crap. I do still plan on using the soap until its gone, but I will not be making another purchase.     s/n  The soap really doesnt have a smell like most reviewers said it did-maybe somethings wrong with my nose. I would not necessarily advise anyone not to buy this as some said it worked for them. I think it, like with most products, just depends on your body. As an African-American not many products work on our higher melatonin levels (even for us lighter skinned african americans) so I was not too suprised when this didnt work.    Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I am an african american female with two toned arms due to spending time in the sun.  I have an uneven complexion.  My chest, feet, and inner arms are a yellow complexion while other parts are dark chocolate.  I ordered this to help even out my natural complexion but instead it made me darker! Now I have to find a product that will help correct an even bigger problem.  I used this religiously as directed and I am highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> The soap lathers really nicely and softly! My skin feels really nice whenever I use it, and it appears a bit clearer now.</li>
    <li> This soap is mild so people looking for intense lightening will have to use it for a while.  It gives nice natural skin lightening and helps reduce acne.  In the beginning the little acne i had went away and then I had a huge outbreak but a dermatologist told me that acne can stay under the skin so the soap probably got rid of the surface acne and brought the underneath acne up.  Now I am acne free and I did a microdermabrasion after most of it was gone which worked very well together and the skin on my face is more even but not all the way yet and my over all skin color has lightened about a shade and has evened out a lot.  I have been using this soap for a month it is kinda small but has a good lather so you dont have to keep using the bar to lather your whole body.  Leave the lather on for about 5 mins and rinse off and it works very well.  this shipper is pretty good its part of the free shipping deal amazon has.  The soap over all is very good very good price but if you have dark spots like me you may want to get a cream to help those spots along which is what I will be doing.  Just ordered my second bar before my 1st runs out i dont think I will need it after the second month but may keep one to use once a week because it helps remove did skin too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Likas papaya soap. Be sure to check if it is original since this is sooo popular in the Philippines and the first whitening papaya soap that it spawned a lot of imitation papaya soaps afterwards. This is still the BEST whitening papaya soap among all the other brands i have tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likas was originally marketed as a whitening soap but it has a lot of other uses. It is really pure and herbal since i saw it on TV how they made it from the papaya extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, since trying this product, it did whiten my skin, helped reduce my acne problem and scars, and also that \\&quot;radiance and glow\\&quot;. It&#x27;s hard to explain after you use it and look at the mirror-you will see that \\&quot;special glow.\\&quot; Its like using gallons of  skin brightening lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amaaazing just a couple of uses u can already see a difference that a co-worker of mine made a comment that my skin looks better.You have to use it 2x a day to see the results. Lather and scrub it for 2-3 minutes depending on how long you want to use it and with warm wather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning, Likas works great for lighter skin rather than darker. If  you have dark skin, dont expect to see the same results for white skin. Also if you have sensitive skin, be cautious since it can cause some redness and allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to even out your skin or lighten your tan, this works great but if  you have deep pigmentation and scars, dont expect this soap to do \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likas can be drying and it melts easily so be sure to put it in a dry container. Make sure after you use it, use a moisturizer. This is great for oily skin since it controls your oils and i have oily skin-so it works really great for me since it helps prevent breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like in any other product, if it worked for me might not worked for you. So dont expect that this soap will do miracle on you and cure ALL your skin problems and thus be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have positive results and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product thats why i&#x27;m stocking up :) My only problem is this is kind of expensive for me since a friend of mine went to the philippines and gave me a dozen of likas for just a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I received the soap when expected, no problem with shipping. The product appeared to be very old! The glue on the soap box was old and dry causing the box to open during shipping. The soap itself was dark, cracked and dry about a half inch in all around the bar and it didnt have a smell at all. I assumed it would smell like papaya but maybe I&#x27;m just wrong about that. All in all it looked like a bar of soap you left in the dish for a year! Not good! Especially when you&#x27;re anxiously waiting for something to be shipped. I&#x27;d be a little less irritated if I&#x27;d just picked it up at a store for a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this soap and was greatly disappointed when I did. I tried it for almost a week and had to stop because it would dry and irritate my skin horribly. I am of Latin descent and highly do NOT! recommend  this product.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about trying this soap because I didn&#x27;t believe that a soap could lighten your skin.. Well it does. I have a burn mark on my arm about as long as a flash light that I got when I was 5 years old, its been there my whole life and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to get rid of it.. After using this soap it is barely noticeable, with continued use of the soap it will probably go away all together. This soap is amazing!</li>
    <li> Likas is supposed to be an exfoliant.  I guess that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing; who can ever tell?  I&#x27;ve had marks from bruises before using it, and they are still present.  I guess, it&#x27;s soap... I wasn&#x27;t really expecting too much anyway that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars.      I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now, maybe in time I&#x27;ll see a difference, I mean I&#x27;ve been using other soaps all my life, and scars from a child have still remained, so maybe this soap just needs a few more months.  But then again, I wouldn&#x27;t know what was working if the scars do disappear because I&#x27;m using it in conjunction to other things as well like creams, and gels.    Thanks!</li>
    <li> i have been using this soap for only 5 days and i can already see the dark spots on my face fading by each use. I am very sure that by the time i enter week 3 there would be little left to fade. It drys out my skin and kinda makes the spots fade by exfoilating it. I would surely recommend this soap to any one who has problems with dark spots its a very great soap just like the rest of the reviews says and am black so black people can also use it.</li>
    <li> About Likas Papaya Soap, I am an African-American with a perfect skin color Coffee with cream or caramel complexion, and so I don&#x27;t want to get lighter; however, i have a couple of blemishes that I heard this soap would help to go away.  Is it possible to just get rid of these blemishes for a more even tone without changing my complexion lighter because I get compliments from blacks and whites about my skin color.  Thanks if anyone knows, that would be great.</li>
    <li> Although very drying the second I dried off my face, and moisturized, I realized that the way I was using it (every other day), it eventually evened out my skin tone. I didn&#x27;t see any \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; and, personally, I&#x27;m glad. I just like the way it evened my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product for my 16 year-old son because a friend of his told him about it.  He started using it and his acne cleared up within a week.  He hasn&#x27;t had new breakouts since he started using the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my elbows and knees because they are very dark. I am latina and light skin. I have tried many creams and nothin worked. I have been taking pictures every week to see any sort of differences. I can&#x27;t really tell because like I said they are too dark. I&#x27;m not loosing hope, I hopefully it works. I also bought Lactic acid 50%. And I use the lactic acid for about once a week of course I don&#x27;t use the soap the day I get my peel. I will write updates.</li>
    <li> this soap does not do what it claims to do. Iv been using it since 3 months and have not seen any whitening effect at all. dont waste your money on it!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago on Amazon, and I didn&#x27;t really think I&#x27;d ever get around to writing a review because I didn&#x27;t think it would actually work. I have acne, and the benzoyl peroxide I use for treatment makes my skin extremely sensitive to the sun, so I tan really easily. Plus, I already have dark-ish skin, so I needed a decent skin lightener. I&#x27;ve tried a number of skin-lightening soaps and lotions, and none of them really worked. Since I bought the Likas Papaya soap, I&#x27;ve been using it on and off (it tends to be a bit drying), and I never expected decent results. But just recently, I&#x27;ve noticed, when using my usual foundation, that it made my skin a lot darker. Sure, I had to get a new shade of foundation, but THIS ACTUALLY WORKS!    One criticism-this soap doesn&#x27;t really do anything for acne scars/hyperpigmentation, which might discourage some people from buying it.</li>
    <li> I just got my order today and i have to say the delivery was very fast. i am gonna use it to see how it works. ive seen a few reviews that it is drying, but i dont think there is nothing that mositurizer cant fix. anyways i will be doing a review in the next two weeks to say how it works. Thank u yollie</li>
    <li> I ordered my soap about 7 days ago and I have to say I use this with skinwhite lotion spf10 along with a strong spf 50(los Angeles here) and yeah the soap is great  I have uneven skin tones and some freckles and the soap is taking care of that and even making me look lighter (Olive tone normally) the key is to use this and scrub it in the skin for atleast 4-7mins and really get in there lol then I follow up with Skinwhite lotion(works great I highly recommend the lotion) and wow I took off my shoes today at the park with personal trainer and I def noticed a difference yowza!! lol will continue with this product because it is amazing along with my the lotion wot wot...Thank you for this great soap!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping quality product!!!</li>
    <li> I got the soap for my mom..and she love it ..she said That it gets the marks off your body</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several years now. I was introduced to it by a co-worker with beautiful skin. Decided to try the soap becuase my face is very sensitive and I&#x27;ve never been able to use most soaps which dry out my skin and are very harsh. Not sure how much \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; it does, but my skin seems clearer and doesn&#x27;t dry out with this soap. If your&#x27;re like me and your facial regmimen consists of cleansers such as Neutrogena, Purpose and Cetaphil (which are all great), you should do fine with Likas. Although I didn&#x27;t see the difference, I have had people comment on how great my skin looks from time to time. Not sure it&#x27;s the soap, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me for the intended purpose of lightning my dark knees and elbows, i have been using it for about 2 months and my knees and elbows still as dark as in day one. The only thing this product has worked for has been as a regular soap to shower and be clean but that is it, and for that i rather buy regular cheaper soap.</li>
    <li> I had really dark underarms. I started using this soap three months ago and I can now see a huge difference. I must admit when i first bought it, I used it once or twice a week. So it took a very long time for me to see the results. Now I use the soap under my arms everytime I shower. I will be ordering again soon since it is almost gone. My boyfriend has dark spots on his face. I dont know how well it will work for his face but I am ordering one for him too. I can also see it is more expense now, whats up with that???</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this soap iv&#x27;e used it for 2 weeks. I had a really bad reaction. I lathered the soap onto my skin for 5 minutes washed it off, patted it dry than moisturized my skin. My skin burned it was itchy and it broke my face out like crazy. And the lightening affect was temporary. When i finished washing my face i looked pale. But than when i put on moisturizer my kin looked back to its darker state. So I haven&#x27;t seen any lightening affect and it gave me little tiny pimples all over my face. Maybe this soap isn&#x27;t for very sensitive skin like mine. I might just use it for my body is stead. Now my skin is full of pimples and my makeup doesn&#x27;t go on evenly. I&#x27;ll give it a month to see if i see any improvements. As for now I&#x27;m afraid to put this soap any where near my skin. It feels like i&#x27;m applying acid to my skin and it dries out and irritates my eyes, and i don&#x27;t even put it near my eyes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get what the hype is all about except you all are not telling us something....which is just how long exactly are we to use it before seeing any sort of result.    I have used it everyday (morning and evening) for almost a month now and nope, not even a single notice of being lightened. My tan line on my feet is still the same as it was 4weeks ago which goes to show nothing has happened, it only tend to dry the skin but that&#x27;s not a problem for me cos i mosturize non stop.    So the only way i will rate this good is if i see a pleasant result, how long did you all use it for before you noticed results? 2 months,3 months, one year?????</li>
    <li> I got this soap a couple of weeks ago and it is amazing! I had some sunspots on my arm since childhood and now they are almost completely gone. My skin is lighter and at the rate I might become two shades lighter by the end of summer. It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This soap destroyed my skin and made me 4 shades darker. Please don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixed heritage with medium/light brown skin and i wanted a product that would make my skin look lighter and more even. I did some research about different products and decided to give this soap a go because of good reviews and quite frankly because it is so cheap. I have only been using this product for two weeks now and i have noticed my skin is considerably lighter. I now have to use a lighter foundation. As many others have said it does dry out my skin but i already use Savlon on my face daily so it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue for me.      I have to say this product works WAY better than expected. I dont want to use a different soap now again. It might be the case that this soap works for some skins and not others. I do think its worth a try for anybody looking to lighten/brighten their complexion because if it doesn&#x27;t work at least you haven&#x27;t spent a lot of money.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN PEOPLE USE DAILY FOR BODY WASH IN PHILIP AND THEY USE FOR DIRTY THING WHEN IT&#x27;S THERE.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap hoping to get some help with my dark armpits. Used it twice a day for a whole month and nothing helped. I even used a deodorant from Nivea that claimed to be extra whitening and that dint help either even when combined with this product.</li>
    <li> this product works fairly well, after using for about 1-2 weeks you can really tell that it lightens your skin, you have to continuously use it or else your original skin color will reappear. it really dries out your skin after you wash off but it&#x27;s not as bothersome as some people make it seem, its mostly only dry right after your done using it...i started to look super pale after two weeks so i stopped using it. probably will only use it for my elbows and knees, good product though.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT and it really works well on my acne. I&#x27;ve been using this product 1 month now and it is awesome. It helps enlighten my dark spots and reduce my pimples. Use twice a day morning and night time. I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> Thats pretty much it.  I purchased this about a year ago or so (only reviewing now because thought I&#x27;d contribute to the amazon community of opinions) and used it regularly (once a day) for about a month.  I used it all over my body but particularly over my elbows, knees, inner thighs, and without going into to TMI,  other dark toned areas.  It lathers well, has a mild pleasant smell, and a slight, sliight (so much so that maybe it was my imagination) tingling sensation which I hoped ment that theres was some \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; action going on.  After the couple of weeks of use, I didn&#x27;t see a GREAT difference (maybe a bit more lighter) in my skin tone (though that might be due to the vigorous scrubbing) so I stopped because it does dry out the skin a bit.  If your looking to truly maintain a fair complexion, safely, I&#x27;d probably stick to liberal uses of sunscreen, hats, and vitamin C/exfoliating scrubs (that will brighten).  Either that or reengineer your melanocytes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap before 2 months. I have a brownish to wheat complexion. After all the Hype about this soap and since I&#x27;ve got some dark patches all over due to the sun, i thought to try this soap in spite of the shipping charge that is as much as the cost of this soap. All i&#x27;m left with is a further darker skin... GOD., it might work for a Phillipino.. It definitely did not work for me... My spouse is after me., hearing about the shipping cost... I&#x27;m using it now to wash my feet and hands.. :(</li>
    <li> This will not make you white unless you are actually white. Just want to put that out there.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this soap about a year ago to get rid of tan lines and dark spots. It does work for me, but I lather up and let it set a few minutes, rubbing it around my skin periodically. Then I use an exfoliating wash cloth to wash it off. Like I said, if you&#x27;re not naturally white, this is not going to make you white or &amp;#34;bleach&amp;#34; you. I am naturally a golden-brown caramel color, so that is the lightest I&#x27;ll ever be. I use this to maintain my natural skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say though, that the smell is kind of gross, and it will dry you out. I recommend using a moisturizing soap after you rinse off the Likas, and a vitamin C w/aloe lotion.</li>
    <li> this is horrible doesnt really do nopthing it caused me ta break out i had pimples i nevcer had and bumps especialy  my lips world break out dont use the diane stalder gluathaine soap watever its called is better than this.</li>
    <li> BUY IT, YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t whiten my skin at all. instead, it looks like it darkens my skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s just a soap - it cleans and have a nice scent to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for more than 60 days, 5 times a week, scrubbing all my body for at least 5 to 10 minutes!  Just forget about lightening or getting rid of brown spots!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this soap.</li>
    <li> Likas papaya soap, particularly when used regularly with a loofah or exfoliating gloves will smooth rough skin-elbows, knees and feet. No more callouses!</li>
    <li> The soap arrived on time but it looks like it was used. I am not going to use with my face, so I&#x27;d give it a try. Will never buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this served as a whitening soap. I saw no improvements. However, it made my skin feel radiant and very refreshing. I may purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is so incredible!!! I ordered in during the winter when I was having skin problems. I kept getting horrible breakouts which left behind dark spots. I&#x27;d say within a week or so my break outs had completely cleared up. Also while I used the soap consistently (day and night) I noticed I had never developed any new break outs! I&#x27;ve used every acne treatment under the sun and this is the only thing that&#x27;s really worked for me. It also so diminish the dark pigmentation left behind from pimples. It takes a bit more time to see those results though. But it&#x27;s so worth it especially for the price! When spring came along and I ran out of it I tried using another soap and started breaking out again! I will definitely be repurchasing this now because I know that this natural soap is the only thing that deep cleans and prevents breakouts for me.     The only con I would say is that, like others stated, is that it can be drying so you definitely need a good moisturizer with spf. Also I does melt quickly in the shower so I would store it in some type of case/container to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> it doesnt whiten at all or get rid of any acne or spots or anything on the face dont get fooled I have been using it for a long time now and nothing happened it doesnt do nothing as it says</li>
    <li> This product made a reasonable change in the health of my skin; it was more birghting, glowing, and free from pimples. The only bad thing I have to say about this product is the fact that is drys out your skin really bad, but as long as you add a good moisturizer you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
    <li> All the rave about this soap sound great but didn&#x27;t really work for me. I purchase the soap to see if it would help fade old scars on my legs and even my skin tone&#x27;&#x27; am not trying to lighten my skin I luv my golden brown skin tone. May be if I continue to use this soap I&#x27;ll see the results or not.</li>
    <li> I am mixed (African American &amp; White) i used to be pretty light skinned when i was younger so iv been looking around for something that could get my old complexion back and even my skin tone since i was burnt by a boiling water explosion (No my face was not very miss colored from that only slightly kinda un noticable)after i used this soap along with \\&quot;Daggett &amp; Ramsdell Lightening Soap\\&quot; it was back to normal so its decent with tone, though im not sure which one worked this way. Warning if you use some type of clearing exfoliating wash with this it wont lighten in fact when i did i got darker oddly.  This is not a miracle soap as some reviews make it sound like but i believe if you use it regularly you will see results as i have.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped fast!  Got it in a matter of days! Super awesome soap I like it! But doesn&#x27;t really work fast.</li>
    <li> So I ordered it trying to get rid of a load of scars on my thigh. Sadly, it was futile. I guess it was meant to work on your face or something where the skin isn&#x27;t as thick.   So I did that for half a month now. My acne scars are clearing up a little, but it gives me red bumps on my cheeks. People here say it&#x27;s for whitening? I&#x27;m naturally very pale but I tan easily.  Mmmm...I don&#x27;t see much of a difference. But then again I live in Texas and I&#x27;m in the sun a lot. I suppose I have gotten a tad lighter.   But other than that, it&#x27;s just another bar of soap to me...that costed 7 bucks.   Oh, and also, it was weird &#x27;cause when I opened the the package, the soap box was open on both ends. Yikes! But I&#x27;&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was because of humidity or something that caused the glue to detach.</li>
    <li> After reading the mostly rave reviews, I decided to try this product out. I too have tried EVERY procedure the dermatologists have to offer to try and lighten my dark spots. I was hoping that maybe this soap would do the trick. But after three months, there is no change in my skin.</li>
    <li> I was struggling with acne for about 3 months, I used expensive products like murad and clinique. Until I went to my esthetician and got laser therapy. Right afterwards I bought this on a whim when I was shopping online. I started using it a few days after the laser therapy. my skin literally cleared completely and all of my scars disappeared in about 3 days. I have been using it for a week now and it makes my skin so soft and white and I dont get a single blemish. I have had so many complements on my skin. just be sure to moisturize and protect since this product deeply cleans and exfoliates your skin. But I wont be switching anytime soon gonna buy a ton more of this stuff</li>
    <li> Hi all, i ve used this soap for 2 weeks on and off.and i tell u it really works.u need to give it sometime to see results.i mean use 2X a day and leave it for 3-5 min on ur skin and use a loofa to gently remove the tan on ur skin.i ve discoloration all over my body coz i never used sunscreen.i ve used it and i can surely say it almost removed half of the tan on my hands and neck.i dont use it on my face as i ve very sensistive skin but for body i can assure you ,u can see results if used religiously.i used diana stalder papaya kojic soap for sometime,may eb for a week, not a bad soap but again one day when is i saw likas sitting on my sink i wanted to give it a try just to compare both and guess what likas wins ,i saw instant results again over diana stalder soap.this soap is herbal i guess and i m not sure about diana stalder.its just $3 so give it a try,i swore that i am going to use it atleast for a year.and my only prob is i cannot get it in richmond va.plz let me know if anyone knows where do they sell this.</li>
    <li> I am a  puertorican with a bad tan. My horrible tan lines have faded and thats a good sign. I noticed it is very concentrated and that it may leave residue behind if not rinsed very well. Use along  with skin white i think thats what does the trick. Lets see how my skin looks in one week.</li>
    <li> i received my soaps less than 4 days....I will keep you updated to wether the soap works or not.      BEEN USING IT FOR 3 WKS....NO RESULTS!!!!</li>
    <li> The product works fairly well, I make sure to use it whenever I take a shower or bath and leave it on my skin for ~3min and make sure to do ~5min on my face. The results are over a long period of time and since I take care of my soap bar I still have more than half of it to go and I bought it 3 months ago (so make sure to use a small amount of this product and focus on rubbing your hands vigorously to produce a lot of soap bubbles to make it last long). I will definitely think about buying this in the future though because I have no adverse reactions to it, my skin feels tighter, and instead of my skin getting darker in this summer heat it became slightly lighter ^^</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soap for a few weeks now. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference in the lightening of my dark spots, but I will wait until it is all used up and do another review.</li>
    <li> Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described. Thanks a million.</li>
    <li> This is nothing but a regular soap with a fouls smell.  No results were shown and I used it for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I had to stop using this soap because it would dry out my skin really bad, on top of that, my skin would become itchy.</li>
    <li> The longer that I have been using it, I have noticed a lightening of dark spots, etc.  I like the soap very much.</li>
    <li> It smells kindof gross, kindof gives off a sort of wet carpet smell. would not recommend, unless youre into that sort of thing. Also, I used it on my face ONCE and I broke out for about a week. Defenitely does not help with skin lightening in any way. Also dries out your skin like nothing ive ever seen before .__. but hey!  if youre looking for the ultimate mold scented, skin drying, acne enhancing product, this one&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> This soap is good I like how it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
    <li> I am a freshman in my high school (14 years old). During the summer I ordered this soap hoping that it would lighten the weird tan lines that had been created and continue to do so over the year because I was in marching band. I absolutely LOVE this soap!!!!! The first time I tried it I noticed the sweet-ish smell that came from it and how you can tell how well it cleanses your skin. I used it on my arms, legs, neck, and face. I have very oily skin so drying of my skin was never really a problem. After religious use for about 2 weeks I noticed a huge difference. I still use it now because I am the lightest skin shade and I live in Florida so unwanted sunburn and tan is always a problem. This soap didn&#x27;t really lighten my acne scars but didn&#x27;t make then worse either. If anything, it helped dry out my pores a bit and help with acne development. Anyways, I would totally recommend this soap to anyone as long as they don&#x27;t have dry skin. LOVE THIS SOAP!!! :DD</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Likas soap for about a month now.  I&#x27;m a VERY fair caucasian female and I suffer from pretty bad hyperpigmentation all over my body after having a twins ten years ago.  And, to top it off, my skin is pretty dry.  My dermatologist prescribed hydroquinone 4% to help lighten my dark spots.  Just as an aside, insurance doesn&#x27;t pay for hydroquinone because it&#x27;s for cosmetic use only, so those 40ml tubes are $24 each.  And, there are some very scary stories about skin cancer if you use as much of the stuff as I was going to need.  So after a couple of tubes with very little results, one of my Filipina friends told me about Likas.  I bought a bar and tried it.  I can&#x27;t believe the results!!  My skin tone is much more even, my skin is SO soft and my dark spots are fading.  Yes, I am much paler now but I look ten years younger.  I don&#x27;t use the soap on my face because my skin is a little too sensitive</li>
    <li> I used Likas skin whitening soap for about 3 weeks. The reason why it was for such a short period of time was because my skin had a bad reaction to it. I have really sensitive skin, so I have to be careful anyway. One other thing that I should make note of is that my goal for using Likas soap was to even out my skin tone and brighten it, not to make myself \\&quot;whiter\\&quot;.  The reason that I decided to give this a try was because it was supposed to be natural, and it doesn&#x27;t contain hydroquinone. I used it on my face, and I washed with it externally on my body. The first few days, everything was fine, but then I started to see red marks come up on my skin. I didn&#x27;t realize that since the main active ingredient in this soap is papaya extract that it pretty much works like a chemical peel. The skin on my arms and neck started to peel and burn away. I&#x27;m just lucky that I didn&#x27;t get those side effects on my face. Parts of my neck turned purple because it was so inflamed and irritated from this soap. Little sores on the back of my arms started to come up. I had to stop use immediately.  Now I&#x27;m on a different beauty regimen, and the skin on my neck is back to normal if not better and my arms are healing up nicely. I&#x27;m just glad that I stopped using this soap before I had some permanent damage to my skin. I&#x27;m also happy to say that I&#x27;ve found another product that is way gentler but also effective for getting rid of acne scars and evening and brightening your skin tone.  If you have sensitive skin, I would ward away from Likas soap or only use it sporadically. Claims of being a more natural and more affordable alternative to other products is not worth losing your skin over.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this soap. It does exactly what the description says it does. I will continue to purchase this product</li>
    <li> This soap was a waste of money. It made my dry and break out even more than it had previously broke out. I had to throw this soap away because it was that bad :-(</li>
    <li> I have not seen any changes in a month</li>
    <li> I used this soap when I discovered that I had an intense farmer&#x27;s tan...like...terrible.  Forearms a nice brown like chocolate, but biceps (if you could even call them that...ahem...) a nice yellow...two nice skin tones clashed together to make one ugly complexion.  I bought this soap hoping to even myself out.  After the first use, I noticed the water had turned gray as I was rinsing off (gross I know), which told me that it helped to strip off a bunch of dead skin.  I&#x27;m a guy and tend not to think about sunscreen, exfoliation, moisturizing, etc.  I&#x27;m naturally a yellowy color (I&#x27;m half Caucasian), but thanks to my Filipino genes, I can get pretty dark.   So I think that this soap works mainly for people who are naturally lighter, but have darkened due to sun damage, dead skin build up, etc.  An easy way to tell is to look in a place where literally, \\&quot;the sun don&#x27;t shine.\\&quot;  Take a look at your scalp under your hair, and that&#x27;ll give you a ballpark estimate of what color you are.  This soap probably won&#x27;t get you back to that color, but it&#x27;ll lighten you up.    I personally noticed an overall brighter complexion after a week, but not necessarily a skin color change.  My skin color started getting lighter once fall started and I wasn&#x27;t outside as much.  I usually can hold a tan through the winter, but with this soap, that&#x27;s not true anymore since it exfoliates off the skin that has been tanned.  I have been using this soap since August 2010, and it&#x27;s now February 2011, and I am so light compared to the color that I usually am.  This soap is more of an exfoliating soap, so in order to actually lighten, you&#x27;ll need to keep a sunscreen on your skin to shield the sun from making your melanocytes too active (of course this isn&#x27;t going to decrease the melanin production naturally present as hydroquinone would, but that&#x27;s a different review!).  Give it around 4-6 weeks to see a difference, because that&#x27;s how long it takes for your skin to be completely regenerated.    I should also mention that you&#x27;ll need a good moisturizer for this soap cuz if you don&#x27;t use one, you&#x27;ll dry out like a prune.  This worked for my acne too.  Thank God...those drug store acne kits just seemed to make me more oily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been one week since I&#x27;ve been using it. I ordered two soaps, one for face and one for body. I have been using the face one twice a day, and the body just once a day. I have some pretty fresh acne scars on my face that I want to lighten up, and so far the soap seems to have made them look redder!  It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting or irritate my skin. It lathers up really well, and it&#x27;s easy to smooth on and massage on skin, and when you rinse it off, it rinses easily, but leaves skin feeling dry. I moisturize afterward and my face looks really good...EXCEPT for the gross red marks (one on top of eyebrow and another on the side of my nose). Seems to be helping everything but what I wanted it for. I can&#x27;t say I see any difference at all for the body. I focus mainly on my arms that I have very uneven tan marks still from summer, and then I use my regular soap that moisturizes and smells good. I will continue to use this product, and would like to update.</li>
    <li> I really like that soap. It make your skin really smooth and fresh. But it can live your skin dry if you dont use a good moisturizer. Other than that i recommend that soap. Does not change your skin color at all!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for a while and my skin looks a lot more brighter and the dark spots I have on my cheeks are a lot lighter which I love. I have been looking for anything that would lighten my dark spots and this does just that.</li>
    <li> this product is the first skin care lightening soap that I have used that lived up to my expectations. I have tried them all from deep depilatories, makari skin care products, you name it. My skin had a lot of hyperpigmentation due to acne scarring, and I am pleased to say that the Likas soap evened out all these areas, as well as took care of the dark areas around my elbows and knees. Thanks for making this product, I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!    Z-mac</li>
    <li> Nice pure soap that whitens skin imperfections.  It is really drying though.  I will just use on the body not face.</li>
    <li> This soap will work if you use it regularly as a routine and exercise patience. I didn&#x27;t do either but for the occasions I did remember to use it I did notice a tone evening affect of an old burn mark. If you buy be prepared that you might not achieve instant results its definitely a process, nevertheless it does the job.</li>
    <li> Using this soap for a month and a half I noticed many pros and cons. I mainly bought the soap to help lighten my dark spots, and my skin by 2 shades lighter mainly because of the good reviews I read. However it did even out my skin tone about 23/100% and got rid of some dark spots. But the waste of money part or cons about the soap was that it made me 3 shades darker and made my skin very dry looking at my month and a half of progress pictures. Don&#x27;t discourage buying this product because of my review because every product works different for everybody, and every product is not meant for everybody.</li>
    <li> This product works astoundingly and makes my skin so clear and surprisingly it makes my skin tone COMPLETELY even.  The only problem I have with this is how quickly it runs out.  Buying it for just the price itself I would have given it a five but since the shipping was almost more than the product it gets a four.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bar of soap and I can say I believe it may work if you buy more than one. I started seeing fading with my dark spots on my back within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I do not refer to LIKAS as a soap because I am allergic to soap.  But I am not allergic to Likas, it is more like a cleanser to me, does not leave a tight soap-stripped feeling.  Rinses clean.  I would recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The soap came fast to my door! The soap is a bit drying to the skin, so learn to lotion up like I did. I like the soap but I did get a rash on the side of my face. It made me a shade BRIGHTER not LIGHTER! however it has only been 3 days, so im still optimistic....</li>
    <li> I come back to order this papaya soap because it really works on me, it whiten my skin, and this soap is very mild but i can&#x27;t believed the price now it goes up to $5.00 more for just couple of months , i just have to check my cousin in california if she can get cheaper for 12 pieces, its a bit too much for me!</li>
    <li> I have a problem with dark skin in sun exposed areas (neck, arms, etc) and so I was trying to find an inexpensive solution for skin whitening.  Likas soap seemed to be the best bet with the reviews I have seen.  After ordering I used the product for about a month and noticed that my skin was supple and radiant.  However, as far as whitening goes, I don&#x27;t really think it works because as soon as you stop using the soap, your skin returns to its previous state.</li>
    <li> This soap is really good. i have tried many other products for skin lightening and had no idea that a simple soap would help. it has worked really well. my husband noticed the difference within few days of my using it and i was using it sparingly so u can imagine how good it must be.:)</li>
    <li> This product works well. Its not a magic spell so it takes time but if u have dark arm pits its a great solution.</li>
    <li> This product is alright to use as a facial cleanser maybe 3 times a week for people that have oily skin, too much use and it may over dry your skin.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for about a month now. It&#x27;s great. My complexion has definitely gotten brighter n my skin is even all over!!!! Definitely going to purchase more!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my skin was looking old and I needed help with little sun spots, freckles etc. I have used it for about two months and it does work. It does not erase the spots just lightens them up. I used it on my face and I didnt break out at all and my skin just has a nice clear glow, I have started using it on my neck and sholders and it seems to be brightening all areas! I am over all happy with this product and I have gotten several compliments, even from my kids!</li>
    <li> I really love this soap. I have a lot of blotchy spots on my face but after one week of using it both day and at night I saw a dramatic difference. My skin had a glow to it. I went to lunch with a girlfriend and she keep saying how nice I looked. Just one word of caution... use moisturizer. The soap is very drying. I now have my niece hooked on it also. It is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I am an african-american of partail Anglo-Saxon ancestry, with fair skin. Or, at least I had fair skin until certain complications, and skin damage took this from me. I tried this soap for a period of 4 months non-stop only to find that i was getting even darker! after a month on not using it again, this dark parts of my arms and face won&#x27;t go back to normal. This soap has damaged my skin even more, and now it is many shades darker than it was when i bought it. This has been a huge waste of time, and money, and now im even darker than i should be. This product fails to deliever it&#x27;s promises (or at least, it did for me).</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 1 week and I already see the difference, I wanted to lighten my elbows and knees this works but for you to get results fast you need to keep at it, people buy stuff use it when ever they remember and expect a miracle...    when you now start to use the soap of course you will feel your skin a bit rough and darken a bit but it&#x27;s just working to remove the old uneven skin and bring out new skin so you keep at it and your skin peels a little...    If you are working on your body, lather up and keep rubbing for a min on areas that need the work then rinse, the last place to use this soap is the face but leave for just about half a min as your face would be sensitive...    I have noticed my stretch marks fading also but yes you need a good moisturizer, it drys you out a bit...</li>
    <li> regular soap...nah.. even worst!! because this soap only dry your skin and thats all  buy it if you dont believe me</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because I thought i could lighten up a bit, and guess what? IT WORKED! :D I&#x27;m really happy with my results, i&#x27;m going to buy some more. Oh and you have to have patience, because it works gradually.</li>
    <li> I used this soap deligently for 4 months. I don&#x27;t see a difference. If anything it&#x27;s a bit drying to my skin. I consider myself a special case only because I naturally have sensitive skin and only soaps like Dove etc are not drying to my skin. The dark marks on my arm, chest and back haven&#x27;t gone anywhere. I even had an intense breakout on my back with cystic acne that I&#x27;ve never seen before. Not sure if it was the soap but I had to stop using it. I like the smell...</li>
    <li> I thought that Likas Papaya soap was going to get rid of dark spots and lighten my tan.&lt;br /&gt;I used it religiously, every single day Morning, Afternoon and night. I bought this soap since Feb and I still haven&#x27;t seen any results.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really diss at it because it might work for you. This is just my opinion, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Eh, It didn&#x27;t work for me so yeah. This is just a warning :)</li>
    <li> This product I can say its very good. If your looking for a drastic whitening experience this is not the product for you it&#x27;s a waste of time. But I can say it gives me a healthy glow and helps fade dark marks or pimple scars on my face.please make sure to use a good moisturizer after you watch because it does leave the skin very dry.other than that I like it ,I mean I will purchase again</li>
    <li> Soo far so good, hopefully it helps my skin since I have such sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use just any soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to lighten the tan I&#x27;ve gotten since starting university. The soap melts VERY quickly, so you&#x27;re going to need to have a few bars on hand to see any real results. I just finished my first bar, and I will agree that it did lighten my skin slightly, and considering I used this product on and off for about three weeks, it works pretty well. If used regularly, maybe for six months straight, you will get the results you want. I don&#x27;t recommend this is you want to truly whiten your skin, I think this will only work to get rid of dark spots and tans. Maybe with prolonged use and avoiding the sun along with wearing SPF at all times will change things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap wasn&#x27;t drying at first, but after about the third use, my skin felt super tight and was incredibly dry when I toweled off after my shower, so make sure you use a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is just okay. I will not repurchase, simply because it&#x27;s way too expensive for the amount of time it lasts and melts too quickly.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this soap. it is actively clearing my blemishes from head to toe. scars are fading quickly by the week, and my skin began to glow like never before after only using this soap for two weeks. I will always use this soap.</li>
    <li> I love this exfoliating soap! It works really well instantly. It gives a very pretty glow to your skin. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but since I constantly read them as judgments of products I figured it would be very helpful for others to get an extra opinion. So I have been using the product for around a month and about half of the bar is gone, I use it everyday. Initially, I did not see much of a change in my appearance but now I can see a start to see lightening around my darkened areas. I am an African American female, and I got the product because I want to reduce the appearance of my acne scars along with lightening my tan from the summer. I have seen lightening so I do give the product a lot of satisfaction about that, however; it is not even lightening and I do suggest to leave the product on your skin for at least 2 minutes. So do I recommend the product? Yes, with time and patience you will get the desired look you&#x27;re attempting to achieve.</li>
    <li> It works fairly well! However, you do peel, and for faster results I would suggest a skin lighting lotion (i.e. fair and white), and L-glutathione capsules (I take Dr James).

Goodluck and God Bless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This soap seems to have some lightening effect. I like to use it along with Kojic acid soap (only on my body not face).</li>
    <li> I can see difference in just 2 weeks thanks. now im as pale as a ghost^^</li>
    <li> I can definitely see a difference even with only a few times using it! I want to order more and I&#x27;m so glad that its organic!! Why doesn&#x27;t America make good products like these...</li>
    <li> The soap helped a lot with my dark marks and even out my skin tone I am pleased I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen little results.The thing is that I have a bunch of scars from my eczema and those tend to be harder to get rid of plus I&#x27;m African American so I guess that&#x27;s reasoning too.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all it&#x27;s a bad product should be out of the market  guess the manufacture know this already people should not buy crap Money is too hard to come by</li>
    <li> I have suffered from \\&quot;folliculitis\\&quot; on my arms and chest for most of my adult life.  It&#x27;s basically little pimples all over my skin.  Up until this soap, I was using a VERY expensive medicated scrub, and the results were fine at best.  Well, with this soap, I got BETTER RESULTS, at a fraction of the cost.  Not only does my skin look better, the pimples are about 95% gone, my skin is brighter, but also---my skin feels incredible!  After the first use, my skin felt like a thousand layers of dead cells were gone without using any harsh abrasive scrubs.  It felt almost tingly, like I had some kind of spa treatment. Overall, I think this product is wonderful and I plan on using it as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
    <li> Hi everyone, I would just like to start off by saying that I did my research on this soap very thoroughly. It is supposed to smell faintly of oranges and should NOT smell soapy or detergent-like. I ordered from a not-so-popular source as WELL as this one to compare the two. I decided if they both looked and smelled similar that I ended up ordering two of the same soap and it wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal. Turns out, this soap is NOT THE REAL LIKAS SOAP. First warning sign: when I received my package, the box was halfway opened and I could easily see the product inside, so essentially someone could have taken it out and gotten a new soap to put in it. Second warning sign: this soap smelled like straight up detergent. I did get some hints of orange like I saw when I did my research, but it did not smell &amp;#34;faint&amp;#34;, the smell is strong and pervasive. The box looks 100% authentic, so it may fool some of you, however, (THIRD WARNING SIGN) you could CLEARLY see where they put a stamp on the soap to make it look like it was authentic. The real Likas soap I got from the not-so-popular source does NOT have these markings around the logo, it has a very faint smell like oranges, the box was not pre-opened and the holograms on the box are not as bright, more subtle, but still there. Below is the link to get THE REAL LIKAS SOAP.&lt;br /&gt; Do not waste your time or money trying to lighten your skin with this off-brand, fake product!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00446DJI6/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to any one who wants clean and lighter skin tone, it really works but make sure to get some sun screen on if you are going to go in the sun after using it.</li>
    <li> It does work but not really that good. ........................It just helps a little bit, maybe one shade lighter than your original color?</li>
    <li> When my product arrived it was open. After I bought the product and looked at the reviews and saw that people were getting fake soap.the same thing happened to me sadly all this does is dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Well... I can say that this product is good, it&#x27;s leave a smoothness in the skin also my skin looks more healthy. It doesn&#x27;t leave dryness at all and is not bleaching your skin. But it does look a little bit more light it, but it takes time to work cuz I been using it for 2 weeks and it&#x27;s starting to work perfect and I like it :) I recommend it to everyone who wants to have a light it and smooth skin.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best product that I&#x27;ve used to even out and brighten my skin. For whatever reason my skin loves being splotchy so within a week this product has evened out my skin really well. Not saying It&#x27;s where I want it yet but it&#x27;s getting there and my roommates have even noticed. I use this all over including my face. The only downfall is how dry it makes your skin. Even after you rinse off in the shower you can feel your skin drying out so have a good hydrating lotion to use immediately after. Other than that I use sun screen everyday because it kind of defeats the purpose of the soap if you&#x27;re gonna go outside without sunscreen and get a farmers tan right after.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to lighten the dark spots on my face and I did not have any skin lightening (I am a dark brown african-american.) The soap dissolved quickly. My other organic bar soaps lasts quadruple the time this soap lasted.</li>
    <li> Stay away from this soap if you have acne or sensitive skin. My face became extremely dry and red after using this soap for 4 days. I am back to my old aveeno clear complexion bar. Please don&#x27;t buy this product as it will make more damage to your skin. If you have acne or post acne marks like me, then give aveeno soap a try. It might take 3-4 weeks to heal your face but it does clear your complexion. Just stick with it and it will help to heal your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 weeks and already I see my sunspots fade which is awesome because I even went to the dermatologist once and the expensive junk he gave me didn&#x27;t do JACK! I wanted to try this (stab in the dark) and it actually did something Great I&#x27;m exited to see more results, only thing is it leaves my skin a bit dry after using Oh Well though it delivers. I put lotion on afterward.</li>
    <li> This seller charges shipping charges for each soap even if you have ordered 3 soaps in one time they will charge 3 shipping charges for 3 soaps. Shipping charges are $4.99 for each soap. Just wanted to make everyone aware about this.</li>
    <li> I lived in Los Angeles and had purchased a bar of herbal papaya soap for $3.00 that came in it&#x27;s own exfoliating net that had just a few ingredients in it and fragrance free. I bought this soap at an actual Thai herbal store, had amazing results in just two uses. My old dead skin was flaking off, and it was gentle enough to use everywhere, even neck, chest and face. So when I saw that this Likas \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; soap was promised to make my skin \\&quot;ghostly white\\&quot; in just 3 washes, I hurried and purchased it. I am a caucasian female with fair skin but bad farmer&#x27;s tan from living in LA and Kansas City, and this Likas soap, DID lighten my skin a LITTLE with NO PEELING after ONE wash, but left my skin so raw and bare that even with an SPF herbal lotion SKIN WHITE, i would come home with sun burn everywhere, wake up the next day and be the same color I was before. Plus, it did not really rid any body odors under the armpits after sweating alot, or the feet. Not to mention, the product whitening skin lotion Skin White with that gluto-whatever it is that Amazon tries to pair you up with, is horrible. Yes it leaves skin soft, yes it smells like herbal hair dye, but in the middle of the tiny, barely legible section of ingredients, DIMETHICONE is right in the middle, making it quite a used ingredient in the product. If you have ANY sensitivity in your skin before, such as shampoos or lotions, perfumes making you get painful pimple like bumps on your neck or anywhere else, this product that carries Dimethicone (skin irritating chemical) AND Butylated Hydroxytoluene, another skin irritating chemical. Not to mention, the bottle is smaller than the size of my hand, so for the money, it ain&#x27;t worth it. Especially after a painful neck and chest breakout. Look up Thai herbal store &#x27;Thai Herbs and Spa&#x27; on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles CA. The lady is super nice, sold us natural Krao Krua breast enlargement pills (THAT WORKED), and can send you the better stuff.</li>
    <li> a natural soap cleanser and it last longer compared to other brand-papaya soap.  I am so glad that i found it here on amazon.com and the delivery was on time and will order again before i will run out of my stock!    Worth the product! Highly recommended!   Thanks</li>
    <li> If you can get past the name of the soap, it is a very good soap for dull complexion. It is more drying than I need, but moisturizing after use helps. It does leave you clean and after using it, you squeak when you walk. It is true to advertisement.</li>
    <li> This soap is great for the skin,for acne...I love it ! After years of looking for a great soap finally</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. It literally lightened my skin in a day. I went out to the beach and I got a slight tan even though I was wearing spf 50. I washed my face and body with this soap and the tan was almost gone! It got me back to my original skin tone in one to two washes. I would have given it 5 stars but the one problem it has is it makes my skin more sensitive after I wash my face with it, like if I use a product that kinda irritated my face before now I get more of a burn feeling. It doesn&#x27;t burn my face while washing but, it just leaves it a little dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap occasionally the last 6 months or so and I&#x27;ve been really liking it. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this soap lightens your skin (this is why I originally bought it) but it is a FANTASTIC exfoliator! Though it doesn&#x27;t do what I hoped and thought it would I am still very happy with my purchase. I used this throughout the summer whenever I would get a tan because it would exfoliate the first layer of skin away and eventually get rid of the tan. I also use it sometimes when I feel like my skin just needs to be renewed. I would get in the shower and do my normal stuff then get out and put this soap on and leave it for around 5 minutes so it can completely dry. When I would get back into the shower to wash it off the water would be this greyish brown color because of all the dead skin coming off (yes I know it&#x27;s really gross but hey at least it works that well!). I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who just wants a great exfoliator or to anyone wanting to get rid of a tan and back to their normal color.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT DELIVERS USE IT EVERYDAY AND YOU SOULD SEE RESULTS BUT YOU WOULD HAFT TO BUY MORE TO SEE LASTING RESUALTS BUT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
    <li> I love this papaya soap! After reading the reviews, I decided to try it out and within the first couple of days my scars dried up and peeled off. All of my scars are fading slowly but surely! Will definitely be ordering more. &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever use a different soap. I love this soap. Its great it cleans really good and does lighten skin a little but nothing dramatic. The only con I would say is that it is very drying. Just make sure you have a good moisturizer to combat the dryness.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the hope it would lighten acne spots. I\\&quot;m african american and have pretty tolerant skin. I used it once a day and immediately starting having skin so dry it was peeling. I&#x27;m not one to give up on using any product but this was unbearable. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great soap for acne or if you just wanna have smooth flawless skin!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, only makes your skin drier. There are some black tiny sands in the soap. Never use it again!</li>
    <li> I love Likas soap. I has made my skin clear. my dark spots on my skin has drastically lightened from using it for about a week.</li>
    <li> This soap is great I notice a diffrent the same day I used it my skin felt soft and bright but u do have to pass so kind of moisturizer because it does got ur face dry. It cleared the dark circle I had under my eyes and that was just the first bar I use it on my entire body not just my face so I have a beautiful even tone all over</li>
    <li> The item got to me quickly, which was awesome! It felt good on my skin, and I have noticed my skin discolorations disappearing. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and leaves it soft. I will be getting some more soon.</li>
    <li> This soap is low quality stinky garbage.  It doesn&#x27;t work either. If you want to really lighten spots or whatnot, use arbutin serum.  Wish I would have never believed the reviews on this product and not have spent a penny on this crap.</li>
    <li> It didnt work at all... waste of money.. i wouldnt recommend at all but if it does for you good..</li>
    <li> Amaizing product, works better than I thought it would!!!!   The cost is very affordable.  It does not dry out your skin at all, but makes it smooth.  I would definatly reccomend this product to everyone out there who is looking for a great whitening soap:))</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent product. If you are looking for something to lighten scars, this is perfect. It takes a lot of patience though. I am a brown-skinned girl, and this product worked pretty well on my skin. I used this product as a result of being severely bitten by fleas. I was so upset about the scarring that I looked everywhere to find a product that can help. As a dark-skinned girl, black scars are very bothersome for me. I used this product on my scars and they did lighten up considerably. The kojic acid in this product is what helped out the most. I went to a dermatologist and she encouraged me to use a product with kojic acid to help. She also encouraged me to use a loofah to scrub the scars and to use apple cider vinegar before to help exfoliate. She said that I should scrub very hard and that my skin might feel raw afterwards. I did this for several months, and it works. She said if my skin feels raw, that I should lay off a few days until it feels better. I also used a cream afterwards to further my result. Although I still have a little scarring left, I am very impressed as I do not believe that my results have plateaued!</li>
    <li> I have acne scars on my body that I wanted to lighten, but this didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for everyone! Try it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Likas Papaya soap for about 6 years now. I&#x27;ve always bought mine straight from Hong Kong from a large, reputable chain store (Watson&#x27;s) so I know those are authentic. I ran out of my supply so I figured I&#x27;d order from Amazon because of the fast shipping. I thought since this was delivered by Amazon Prime, that it was authentic. But the one I received from this seller I&#x27;m POSITIVE is fake. The box does NOT have any holograms which is the major difference in real vs. fake Likas soaps. It seemed slightly opened when I received it, not to mention quite old and dusty. It does not have any smell, while the real one has a faint citrus, slightly orange type of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I knew this was fake, out of curiosity I tested it out for a week to see what difference it would make on my skin. It actually made me darker! My mom and my best friend noticed that my skin was darker and even made comments like &amp;#34;How did you get so tan?&amp;#34; I&#x27;d rather see no result from the fake soap at all, than have it make me darker! Needless to say, I threw this out after a week.</li>
    <li> I have had so many compliments on my skin since I started to use this soap.  It makes my face feel really clean.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema/atopic dermatitis since I was a kid.  I was given topical steroids by dermatologists to combat it.  While the steroids did provide temporary relief, it gave me severely blotched skin.  After trying many products on my own, Likas Papaya Soap was the one that actually helped bring my natural skin tone back.  I&#x27;m not writing this on behalf of the company so I&#x27;m not going to lie, it didn&#x27;t totally clear it up.  However, the results are far more remarkable than anything I&#x27;ve been given by dermatologists in at least 15 years.  I highly recommend Likas Papaya Soap for all people suffering from uneven skin tone due to dark marks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what was supposed to happened with this soap happened. Yes it cleaned my skin but as far as helping to remove those dark spots and/or even out my skin tone didn&#x27;t happen for me. So disappointed being that I bought two of these soaps. I guess I should have saved my money and bought Dove.</li>
    <li> Soap is awesome I&#x27;m African American and use to soap to lighting my skin its really good it can do minimum sun tan dead skin remover to get u back to ur original tone of transform you like I did I kno your wondering why change your skin tone be happy answer because I can. I went from Gabriel union color to Beyonce even Jessica alba color but I tanned I didn&#x27;t wanna be that white... products used this soap prep skin fresher nadinola mixed with fair and white exclusive serum \\&quot;vit c\\&quot; one.. then reach desired shade maintain with yelen glow body milk and brighten up kit by f&amp;w mix the serum with ur regular moisturizer and keep this soap forever lol also do a chemical Peel twice only twice weeks apart I recommend maxi Peel 3 and start off using carotien nourishing cream and just thus soap a month before u start it will speed up results alright I&#x27;m done Google luck BTW its safe</li>
    <li> ok after, reading several reviews on Likas, i finally decided to order it. i do have a very sensitive yet oily skin, making it hard for me to use certain products. i have been using crystal white serum which is also made in the philippines, and it works great but i can not find it here in the USA.  Back to this review, i received it today and just tried it out, i love love love its fruity smell; i gave it a 4 cos i am yet to see any changes other than my face feeling smooth, hopefully it makes my skin brighter. Am not looking for a soap to clear any marks or scars or acnes because i have known. Likas had better make my skin evenly brighter than it is already. Lol! i would give it 3-7days of &amp;#34;religious&amp;#34; routine and give another feed back.</li>
    <li> I purchased a bar of this soap a while back.. It did not work I used it for a month.. I have beige skin I am Mexican American and I am very pale.. It did not work for me, even when I tried leaving it on. What did work that was cheap is Baking soda and Lemon juice hope that helps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a Lil over a month now and its really fantastic. My skin is many shades lighter. It&#x27;s really excellent for acne too. It keeps your skin looking great. I told my mother about it and she bought some and everyone is telling her she looks like she glowing. I think she loves it more than me. Lol It&#x27;s a great soap and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is now a staple in my everyday regimen and it exfoliates my skin and body extremely well. I like to use it with my Korean Italy Towel while taking baths and boy, the dead skin just vanishes off and go down the drain. I keep purchasing this product for the main fact that it is wonderful for my skin. Thank you.</li>
    <li> i didnt like this product. there are certain ingredients missing in this soap.  for me, it didnt work as well as the other kojic acid soaps. aw well</li>
    <li> It is still too soon to tell about lightening of the skin but I do like the soap and feel it is working a little. I think in a month I may see a difference, After I use it I add my anti aging serum on my face so it does not dry out my face, and I have not had any problems at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for washing a few times a week because it dries skin a tad much. This does not do anything for spots which is what i was looking for.  It&#x27;s probably ok for overall lightening but no help for reducing spots (frecles, sun spots or scars).</li>
    <li> Very nice product you should try it, it is really worth the price. The shipping was faster than I spected. I am very pleased with my purchase.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This does not work at all. It was a waste of my money and time. The smell is unpleasant. I used two bars. Never again.</li>
    <li> I got this product for the same reason as everyone else, to lighten and brighten my skin. It came in a timely manner and I used the entire soap bar for over a month I think. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on my arms but maybe I need to use it for longer? Either way, it dried up my skin a lot and debating if I should get it again or not.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this thinking it&#x27;s going to make you several shades lighter, or light at all. It&#x27;s a REGULAR soap with nice lather. ALL Kojic Acid/papaya soaps work to remove dead skin which gives the appearance of lightening. Kojic Acid BARELY lightens skin (if at all) . More importantly, only those that already have fairer skin and THIN skin will experience any of those benefits. Everyone else just enjoy a nice lathering soap they may VERY lightly exfoliate skin. This type of soap should be used in addition to bleaching creams, for those that are trying to lighten scars or overall skin.</li>
    <li> It is really good soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was amazing on my skin, it peel dead skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Papaya is good for the skin</li>
    <li> Works great use daily</li>
    <li> This product seems okay. I have been using it for a few weeks now and so far, I have not really seen a difference in my complexion/skin-tone. However, I am not sure of the timeline for expected results. It does clean the body very well although it can be drying so be sure to moisturize after every use. I will purchase more to give it a chance before I totally give up and move onto something else. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to express my thoughts.</li>
    <li> This is great for dead skin but you need a scrubber brush or something similar to slough off the dead skin.</li>
    <li> I have age spots on my hands and wanted something to help lighten them.  This soap has ingredients which are supposed to be good at lightening skin, but since the lather is something that gets \\&quot;rinsed off\\&quot;  the skin it really isn&#x27;t on long enough to do any noticeable lightening of dark spots.  I am mainly just using it up as a hand-soap now.  I did not notice that this soap is particularly moisturizing either like it states on the front of the box.  Okay for a hand-soap, but not for the best skin lightening effects.</li>
    <li> the reason give this product a 5 is because the shipping was fast got here with in the week and results were insane. i have gotten lighter each time i used lika&#x27;s im a dark-ish tan mexican who has tried everything to get at lest one or two shades lighter and after using lika&amp;#34;s i refuse to use any other whitening product lika&#x27;s has help my acne  helped whiten my scars and tone my skin making every signal bad tan line go away. the only bad side to lika&#x27;s is it drys your skin and and it is a slow process which you do have to patient for any change to happen. I would defiantly recommend this to all my friends and anyone who just wants to get lighter and next time I won&#x27;t buy just 2 box im going to buy a 12pk.</li>
    <li> I have brown spots, so I figured I would give this soap a try, well, it didn&#x27;t work.  I used it for 3 months, so I did give it plenty of time.  All it did is leave my skin feeling dry and dull.  Why do I give it a 2 star? Because it was cheap and it does have a nice scent.  But will I recommend it, no, not at all.</li>
    <li> Ok so i  received this soap this past Tuesday 1/2/13 and i used it right when i got it out the box and then before i went to sleep that night. I had been using it twice a day up until Friday when I used it once that morning and then continued using it twice a day after that... Now here comes the bad part, now today when i went to my mothers for Sunday dinner my mother told me it looked like i had a mask on my face hurt my lil soul cause i have had a this problem since i was pregnant and i have been trying so hard to get my face back to normal and nothing has worked. When i first started using it i thought it was making it better and i finally had a sense of relief but i guess it has made it worse had my hopes up and this was my last resort.I don&#x27;t know anymore i don&#x27;t want to put up a pic to embarrassed to do so...</li>
    <li> It feels so natural and what I like the most is that  it doesn&#x27;t have any perfumes like some soaps do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had melasma across the top of my upper lip for as long as I can remember, and two years ago after giving birth more dark spots appeared on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Obagi to Meladerm without ANY results. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for two weeks and my dark spots are so much lighter. My face is brighter and now the dark spots aren&#x27;t the first thing I notice in the mirror.</li>
    <li> I have had acne/ post acne scars (PIH) for so long I can&#x27;t even remember myself without it. I am African-American but my complexion is very fair and so everything shows. It&#x27;s like pimples and scars on parade. I know you may hear it all the time but I have tried it all. I have done micro-dermabrasions, clinical dermabrasion with medical intervention, skin peels, hydroquinone, birth control pills, proactive, neutrogena, noxema, retinol A and even combining a couple of these treatments. A few work but very slowly and trust me,  after a while these all get really expensive.   When I saw all the reviews on this product, I figure how much damage can it do. Plus it was cheaper than my other attempts so I gave it a try. It has cleared most of my scarring and it has only been three weeks. I am just  ecstatic!! I have been receiving compliments about my skin  from everyone. It is amazing, I can&#x27;t walk by a mirror without wanting to look at my face. Now I can go without painting my face with tons of concealer and foundation.  Overall this was a good buy and shipment was fast. My one pointer is to get a good moisturizer- maybe one with some sunscreen- because it has a drying effect to your skin. That was the only glitch. Everything else was wonderful.</li>
    <li> i am on my second bar of this soap and have seen no dramatic results like i thought i would, maybe because i am of african descent and it&#x27;s just taking longer to take effect. i think i will go for the kojic acid soap next time.</li>
    <li> shipping - It stated it will arrive Thursday. I received it Friday.&lt;br /&gt;Quality - it is a pretty good soap. I have oily skin so this soap does not dry my skin. It leaves my skin smooth. It is a good exfoliator. It left my face a bit tight as in dry the first few days but moisturizer helped that. It melts quick. I keep it in one of those travel soap boxes. I have had it for 3 weeks and its about to run out in a week or so. I use it everyday. Sometimes twice.&lt;br /&gt;Lightening - This soap it seems has lightened up my acne scars and skin complexion a little. I do get the sense of skin glowing as other reviews state. I have tanned skin so this soap has helped me keep a lighter complexion than usual for this summer. Or perhaps its because I have been avoiding the sun. I will update my review in another month.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because i didn&#x27;t use it for too long, but i did see some result not amazing results, but it&#x27;s probably because i used it for about a month. Great soap, smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I feel that my face feels very clean and smells great.  I am not sure if it has made my skin any smoother.  I will give it three months before I comment.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and figured I can&#x27;t go wrong especially considering the cheap price. To my dismay in the first use I could see changes. my skin looks the way it should, Even and glowing. I have only used on body but after reading someone posting about the changes on the face i will buy a separate bar for my face!!! I will buy this again and again and will recommend. Buy it!!! what can you lose?</li>
    <li> It is a decent soap, It kind of works to lighten, haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference. probably wont buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in any dark spots. Works just like a regular bar of soap- an expensive bar of soap! (:</li>
    <li> Good soap if you&#x27;re looking for non-scented, good lather and not overly drying. As for the claim of a skin whitening property, I note no evidence of that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for more than 45 days. Thought I&#x27;ll give it more time to see if it works. But it doesn&#x27;t. Its been 6 weeks but it hasn&#x27;t even made me get rid of my tan, forget about lightening 2-3 shades. Am already light but this summer got a really bad tan which I wanted to get rid off plus I suffer from acne and acne scars, so I thought maybe it&#x27;ll help lighten them but its a waste. Don&#x27;t waste ur money buying this soap, try diana stalder papaya kojic soap or swiss glutathione soap..They work! Plus this soap is really expensive here..U can get much cheaper soaps if you go to any Asian grocery stores for less than half of this price (for 2-3 dollars).</li>
    <li> Have not seen any changes. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I loved this i actually bought a second bar of soap. One thing is the soap should be used for your body only. I don&#x27;t recommend this on your face since it can sometimes get in your eye when your showering and leaves the face VERY dry. So i only use this on the body and it does make your skin lighter. Note that it just gets rid of the tan you have IT DOES NOT GO BEYOND YOUR NATURAL SKIN COLOR. To check what your natural skin color is check somewhere where your skin doesn&#x27;t get sun like your stomache or thighs and that&#x27;s how light the soap will get you. If you plan on using this on your face use it separately from when your showering. But be warned it does make your skin dry so makes sure to apply moisturizer wherever your put this on your body.</li>
    <li> Read my review I&#x27;m being completely honest. I have eczema and it got worse as I got older. Now that I am almost 20 years old I am learning how to keep it under control. This soap just may be the answer to my prayers. I&#x27;ve been on steroids for the past year and they work but they also have crazy side effects. I digress! This soap!!! I saw results (my knuckles, stomach, back, knees, lower neck and butt) is darker than my arms, face, thighs, legs, feet, chest and breasts which is a caramel color. After using the soap for two weeks I have noticed that my knuckles are returning to it&#x27;s natural color and blending in with the rest of my hand. I have noticed patches on my back of my caramel color coming back. I have also noticed my horrible eczema scars on the back of my legs fading away, my stomach is fading right down the middle. Everything is coming together GRADUALLY except for my neck. That&#x27;s my biggest problem but I pair it with Ambi and it&#x27;s getting there. I say pair this soap with a lightening cream because it will make it go faster. Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize because this soap is drying HOWEVER the more you use it the less drying it is. It will begin to soften the skin (wierd but yes). My first two or three nights with the soap, I was so dry, I saw the ash of white during as I stepped out of the shower. I was that dry!! But as I used and used I guess my skin became immune to it and I no longer get so dry.</li>
    <li> at an attempt to decrease the noticeability of some small laugh lines and summer freckles. It helped with the freckles but also a little bit drying for my skin.</li>
    <li> It made my skin really soft and I love it I will buy it again the scent is also very nice. It rinses to a gray color I didn&#x27;t understand why. But other than that I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all.. Do not waste your money on it, it isn&#x27;t worth it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but after I used this I didn&#x27;t notice much &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34;. I DID, however, notice that my skin felt tight...not in a good way. Like super dry. Or stretched out. Not painful just annoying. The smell is fine...I HATE papaya. Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> Gives you smother skin but that&#x27;s where it stops doesn&#x27;t do much else I would search elsewhere for a better product.</li>
    <li> Not working at all , why people has to lie</li>
    <li> So far seeing some results. But really drying. Must use lotion after using soap. It does make my skin really smooth. I like that about it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do too much for me. I had unsightly tan lines and they didn&#x27;t appear to go away or blend better. It was also drying. I didn&#x27;t like the product, however I did not have any problems with the company that shipped this item. I received my item quicker than expected and the box was in good shape.</li>
    <li> I ordered this same product with the same seller twice before, and was very happy with the quality. But this time the soap smells bad and looks dry and old, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the authentic one or not. I&#x27;ll try another seller next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure ~2 months is enough for an informative review. It&#x27;s very drying to my skin. I&#x27;m dark complexioned, i just wanted to lighten areas such as my elbows and knees. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d continue with this soap because i&#x27;ve decided to leave those areas alone and get them lightened professionally, later.    This company did well in making sure my product delivered on time and answered all my questions.     A little questionable note, when I received my soaps, i realized all the areas on the packaging that said,\\&quot;skin lightening/ whitening\\&quot; had been covered with a white strip. I think this has also influenced my decision to move on.    Here&#x27;s a very helpful response I received from Seller, I think it will be in the best interest of the manufacturer to pay heed to this info:              \\&quot;Thank you for your order. I can assure you that the all of the products we sell are authentic. We only purchase our stock from reliable wholesalers who have a distribution agreement with the manufacturers of the products.  The original Likas Papaya boxes display a holographic effect when you move the boxes under the light.    The white labels covering the Skin Whitening text is intended to satisfy the US FDA requirement that any therapeutic claims be substantiated and supported by the FDA. The FDA has made a point to more thoroughly investigate products from foreign countries. I would imagine that Trinidad Cosmetics will change their package to comply with FDA regulations at some point, as the white strips look pretty tacky.     Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.    Best Regards\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product did nothing to my sun spots but it caused deep wrinkles under my eyes. Thank you Licas Soap for ruining my facial skin! TERRIBLE PRODUCTS!!!</li>
    <li> I got this product to help with my dark underarms. I couldn&#x27;t even believe the results at first. In about 4 or 5 washes I saw a really noticeable improvement. After two weeks of using it the dark spots were almost gone. I don&#x27;t have any acne scars and never used it on my face, but it does help skin discoloration for sure. Amazing product would DEFINITELY recommend.</li>
    <li> This soap does not work.  I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, and no results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> :^) I just got mine in the mail (shipping was great) yesterday morning and used it 2 times that day. I ordered 2 boxes of this soap. The soap doesnt come with instructions or nuthing like that, it just has a brief summary of the ingredients in the soap: Enriched with papaya enzymes and blended with tropical herbs to whiten the skin for a clearer and finer skin complexion. It is a nice size (about as big as dove bar soap, chunky, maybe a little bit bigger.) and will last a long time if you use it in the proper way and not leave it sitting in or under water. When I ordered from this seller it came packaged nice, but the only thing was that for some reason one of my boxes was opened and it had what looked like some black crust or dust speckled on it and it was some on the sides inside the soap box. I nocked it off and rinsed it with hot water before i used it. The new box (un-opened) had a little bit of the same stuff in it as well. I guess things happen in manufactory sometimes, but its ok. The soap purchased from yollies is the real likas original papaya soap if anybody is concerned about that. Um, It really doesnt have a scent, Its like real light papaya soda smelling scent. It has a really rich creamy lather, almost like shaving cream when you really work it in. After my first use I could see a glow to my skin as well as the second time I used it. It didnt dry my skin out, but for others it might because what works on one may not work on the other the same way or may not work at all. I am african american with a brownish caramelish tone, purchased it to remove mosquito bite marks, old child hood marks/acne spots, and burn marks on my body. As far as lighting/whitening I dont know yet because Ive only used it for one day. I do have confident that the soap will work because of the many benefits papaya has and the fact that its all natural. It left me fresh/clean and soft. I will post another review in a month on how it does with removing marks and skin lightning/whitening!!</li>
    <li> Fake product. Been using likas for three years and never had a problem till now. This came packaged with the top noticeably glued together and the soap made me breakout all over. Just terrible!</li>
    <li> I expect it to see some big improvements but saw only a little bit. Maybe if I buy one more I can start seeing some results it kinda did lighten my neck area a little bit.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help lighten skin up much, but it defiantly helped with my unwanted tans over the summer. It also smells really nice and gets my skin really clean without drying it out.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap.  It does lighten your complexion, and gives it a nice glow.  It can be drying, but I have combination skin, and I use a moisturizer, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I ordered it July 28th and it said the estimated time it would be delivered was Aug 4 - Aug 18. I got it Aug 1st which was great 😀 ! I read reviews how people said it smelled fake , it had a wonderful scent and left my skin smelling amazing. I haven&#x27;t used it much but so far so good . and it cleared up the blackheads within the first use and it was wrapped and packaged nicely . will definitely order again .</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin, so using this soap made my skin SUPER dry. I made sure to moisturize immediately after I used this soap, but it still made my skin dryer than it was before I started using this. I think for this soap to work you have to let the soap stay on your skin for several minutes, and I am just way too lazy to sit around naked in the bathroom for that long, or let the soap crust on my face for 5mins, so I stopped using this.</li>
    <li> My friend have been trying this for 3 months, but aint working... this is just another soap with more advertisement..!!&lt;br /&gt;Will update after month</li>
    <li> I choose this item because I was looking for a present. The item was just as it was described in picture. I would definitely recommend this item to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t work...I wasn&#x27;t to happy with this product...im still seeking a soap that actually work and does what it says....a real waist of money</li>
    <li> Love it. It works well.  Keeps my skin clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now with no results.  The soap feels nice and is effective and all, although it has a tendency to dry skin out.  If I get any results with it I&#x27;ll happily edit this review, but as of right now, I can&#x27;t recommend this as a lightening soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for two months now and my scarring has not gotten better at all! It helps clean my face very well but thats about it. Sorry if I dissapointed a few but I&#x27;m just keeping it real.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to deal with the black spots left behind from acne. I used it religiously for two weeks and began to get cystic acne which were really painful and I assume was an allergic reaction. After each use I noticed a residue left behind on my skin and at first, I rewashed my face but later realized it was from the soap. I stopped using the product and the acne SLOWLY went away.</li>
    <li> this product gave me a skin rash and it left it feeling waxy and gross. i would highly suggest not buying this. it&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;check out this review on makeupally.com:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks. So far I am really liking how my skin is looking after use. Don&#x27;t get it near your eyes, it does not feel good.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any lightening affect and it gave me little tiny pimples all over my face.  I&#x27;m not  buying this soap again</li>
    <li> This soap works very well but I&#x27;m not really sure if it really does lighten them.I have been using it on the underarms for a month and I can&#x27;t really say if it does the job. It is definately a good soap in general! The smell is pleasent as well.</li>
    <li> I never thought that a bar of soap that is so inexpensive would AMAZE ME so much! I feel like this papaya bar of soap from the Phillipines is some type of ancient secret recently uncovered and not yet adopted by the mainstream beauty industry because they haven&#x27;t been made of aware of it&#x27;s powers. I was VERY VERY skeptical about it and saw that there were so many people supposedly saying that \\&quot;it&#x27;s so great\\&quot; and that \\&quot;it changed their lives.\\&quot; I saw that it was so inexpensive so I decided to just give it a try and see what happens. After the first time I used it, my sister and mother told me that I looked \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and that my face looked like I was using some type of cosmetic enhancer. They literally asked me what I had just used, and I was very surprised myself with the way my skin looked as much as they were surprised to see how different I looked within the span of 5 minutes. I told my sister \\&quot;It&#x27;s Likas, some papaya 100% organic bar of soap from the Phillipines\\&quot;. She then told me that I sounded like a commercial (which I DID!!) and she tried it. Her skin looked porcelain after 1 use! For us, this works very very well and instantly gives us a clean, smooth, fresh, almost powdered-feel looking skin! (*I lather it for about 3-5 minutes each use 2-3 times a day*)    I have been using it for about 2 days and really really really LOVE IT. I would in an instant pay $70 for the same bar of soap if they suddenly changed the price. It&#x27;s that good! As for the acne treatment of this product, I have only used it for 2 days and will post an update in a couple of months addressing it&#x27;s lightening effects as well as acne treatment effects.     I normally only review high-technology products but I just HAD TO SPREAD AWARENESS OF THIS SOAP! TRY IT!! IT&#x27;S SO AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> This product seems like it is great but it lacks any proper directions and directions are hard to find on the internet.  Can anyone give me directions on how to use it properly?</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product.  I have always been naturally very pale, but I became interested in this product when I wanted something to help all the scars from bug bites I get in the swampy area I live in.  I&#x27;ve had problems with acne too, so with reviews about it being all natural and clearing up skin (plus, I really love my pale skin and wouldn&#x27;t mind it being a little brighter) I thought why not?  I&#x27;m SO gad I did!  I could see results after my first time trying it.  I was particularly impressed with how it cleared up the dark circles I&#x27;ve always had under my eyes, which were still noticeable with products piled on.  I no longer have to wear concealer or foundation!  My skin looks great, it glows, my scars are fading rapidly, and my acne is nonexistent.  I would recommend (if you REALLY want it to work) to scrub yourself down with it every time you shower.  I step out from under the water and really lather it at least twice each day.  My boyfriend, who is part Thai and dark skinned, was impressed by my almost instant results, so he tried it for his acne as well.  He uses it every few days and we can really tell a difference.  My skin is much softer after each use, and I don&#x27;t really have a problem with the dry skin issue.  I do put moisturizer on my face with SPF 30, as that was the only place it dried out my skin.  I will definitely be buying this product in bulk and using it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin much more even and also helps with acne scarring. However this soap does dry out your skin a bit so make sure to use more lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great soap but doesn&#x27;t last long since it&#x27;s only available online.</li>
    <li> This stuff smelled weird and did not work for me. I prefer Kojie San</li>
    <li> Ppl this soap doesn&#x27;t work trust me it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
    <li> I have noticed there are some concerns regarding the authenticity of this product - it made me rather nervous to even try ordering this off of Amazon.  I wanted to let others know that I ordered from  KC Commerce and received what looks and feels like an authentic bar of soap.  The box had a hologram, and soap smelled as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap really dries out my skin, so definitely invest in some good lotion/cream to apply after using.  I&#x27;ve not noticed immediate results, it is fairly slow acting.  Fortunately, I am not the sort to believe in miracles, so I already knew it would take time to really get the results that I want.</li>
    <li> You need to use this product everyday to see results. I stopped using it for 2 days and then my color went back to original  shade. I was in the Caribbean Islands for a few months and had a major tan on my legs. I used this product and the tan went away. The product is good for people who want to get rid of tans but it is not good for people who want to improve the shine and glow of their skin. I saw better results with natural products such as lemon!!!</li>
    <li> Whether you&#x27;ll like this soap depends on what you are trying to get out of it.  I don&#x27;t use this soap to lighten my skin.  In fact, I&#x27;ve used this soap for months and I&#x27;m the same complexion.  I have hyper-pigmentation and acne scarring ... I get a bump, it leaves behind a brown spot and it takes forever to fade away.  My skin is also super sensitive so there aren&#x27;t many things I can use that don&#x27;t result in additional bumps, then brown spots.  This soap helps even my tone.  The brown spots fade faster and it takes away excess oil without excessively drying out my face.</li>
    <li> I got a terrible tan, and decided to use it.  It lightened my skin every time i used from the first day I saw a difference in my complexion.  This soap is natural and works.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this soap I read the majority of reviews posted. Many claimed this soap LIGHTENS skin tone. Those claims are blatant exaggerations--I stop short from calling them lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap does NOTHING to alter/change the skin tone. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I used the entire thing, including using sunscreen when out &amp; about. I saw absolutely no change in my skin tone/colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is JUST a soap--it cleans the skin. Period. It does NOT alter/change the tone/colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point: if you are looking to even out or alter your skin tone in any way, save your wallet &amp; yourself from disappointment &amp; DO NOT BUY THIS SOAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;re just looking for soap, plain old soap---have at this one because that&#x27;s all it is.[[ASIN:B000OV3ZDO Original Likas Papaya Skin Whitening Herbal Soap by Trinidad Cosmetics Laboratory - 135 grams]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Amazon allowed I would give this product a zero rating, it does not deserve any stars.</li>
    <li> This soap is a life saver! I have used other products that say the same &amp; nothing compares to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It does not \\&quot;whiten\\&quot; skin, It \\&quot;brightens\\&quot; skin.&lt;br /&gt;-I use on my face &amp; body, once a day.&lt;br /&gt;-After 2 weeks, my skin tone looks evened out. My face has a nice glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;-My acne scars are fading &amp; breaks out are clearing up. (I have occasional break outs)&lt;br /&gt;-It does dry skin out (but what other bar soap doesnt) Just follow with a good moisturizer, problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;- It does have a bit of an odd smell to it, but it doesnt drive me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have great results with Likas papaya soap. I would def recommend this! Great price &amp; you will get fast results.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this soap does nothing except making you feel like it washes dirt off your skin. I used two of them and i noticed no difference in my skin tone. I wouldn&#x27;t consider buying ever again.</li>
    <li> This product is the truth... I&#x27;m 2 shades lighter I&#x27;m using this alone with Retin a my face is lighter than my body! Be very careful I burn my neck I don&#x27;t know if it was a combination of the Retin A I&#x27;m thinking my neck is way to sensitive because it happen twice. My acne scars has deminish a lot and the ones you do see are red. I&#x27;m A.A. Dark completion this product is the business I&#x27;m so happy with this product also my legs are very smooth I had to order more! Now I can work on the beminishes on my chest and back! Thank u Papaya soap yay!</li>
    <li> This soap does not work the way it claims too, in fact it did one thing well that is dry my skin out even with moisturizers. i stopped using it after about three weeks not only because of excessive dryness but also it was so harsh to my arms and face that it left a reddish rash after about a week and a half of use.because i am about a light brown man  who has a medium brown complexion on parts of my face and arms due to sun damage i thought this might help but it didn,t the rashes on my arms and face turned darker and was left with dark marks from the rashes after that i went back to using body washes and moisturizers the rashes faded in about 3 and a 1/2 weeks. i will not buy this soap or any other soap because they are to drying except for glycerin soaps which are very good and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin or body washes.do not waste time or money on this YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!.</li>
    <li> I honestly like this soap. It has a great smell and it seems to be working for my neck, face and, butt area. I recommend it :-) The only con I would say is to have some lotion nearby because it can make your skin feel a little tight and dry. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I work at a spa &amp; know a thing or two about skin care. To be upfront &amp; honest this soap can definitely help reduce oil &amp; maybe even acne too. Off the bat, I have never suffered from acne but I have had random pimples which would leave scars making it look like I had acne. I bought the soap mostly for my back where I do actually have acne scars from my teenage years. The soap will dry out your skin, painfully. Sadly, you still need oil in your skin. My advice would be to not use the soap daily but at most 3-4 times weekly. My face started to sting from using it too much. It seems like the soap is a really good exfoliant which can be very helpful in reducing acne &amp; even oily skin but never over exfoliate. Your skin becomes super sensitive which is what happened to me. I didn&#x27;t notice the first few days that the soap can be in some ways, damaging. My face became so sensitive that it started to burn &amp; sting so much. Moisturizers didn&#x27;t help with the dryness or peeling skin. Since I work at a spa I found some thicker moisturizers to help. However, my back has cleared up a lot without over drying.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to first consider that everyone has different skin. If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend this soap for you but if you really want to try it I would make sure I have aloe gel to put on after use. If you&#x27;re trying to clear up acne tea tree oil is magic but can also burn so it&#x27;s better to mix it with lotion or jojoba oil. However, it will not lighten your skin or lighten your skin.</li>
    <li> I was very anxious to get this soap because of the terrible marks that ance has left on my back and face. I recieved the soap about a week after I ordered it which was fantastic because I am currently stationed in South Korea. Unfortunately, this was not the original product. Portions of the box were covered with white tape including the boxes original ingredience, and other different ingredience were used than the original formula. I really do expect more from companies that sell through Amazon because we should be able to trust that the ratings are not being manipulated and that we recieve what we order. I am a very concered customer not just for myself but for others who take the risk of buying online. Of course it will too much of a hassle and I will have to pay addtional shipping cost to attempt to get my money back or the product I requested and for me it is not worth the added effort. Therefore I am writing this review as caution to others who are interested in buying this soap from this vendor. Beware.</li>
    <li> I have to say this soap is incredible, yeah it can dry your skin, but only if you don&#x27;t use a good lotion, other than that I love it, I bought it because its supposed to be good with acne and evening skin tone, and I tell you my face is now acne free and Ive been using it only for a week, my sun spots are fading and my skin looks radiant, my complexion is bright, it doesnt make me any whiter, but its not why I bought it anyway, I just like that it does work and my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> This helped with the marks on my kids skin they got from bug bits.will  try to find at local stores</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cleansing bar that did not have any chemicals added to it. This bar is perfect. It cleared my oily complexion in just a couple of days. I only use the bar once day. I recommend this for anyone that is sensitive to chemicals or perfumes like myself.</li>
    <li> i must say this papaya soap was very cleansing and made my skin feel fresh. and they say this soap lightens and brightens the skin. and i have been using this for a while and i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been noticing. i think it has been, but i will surely update this. but the one downside to this is that i used it on my face and it gave me this nasty rash on the side of my nose and cheek area. almost like it was peeling or due to burning. so use sparingly on face if u do so.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t help with the lighting of my dark spots it did however make my skin worsen. It you have sensitive skin I would not recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Not done with it but I guess it works okay</li>
    <li> After one use I could see the difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sadly it was the wrong kind of difference (but still a difference!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bad farmer&#x27;s tan from my boyfriend shorts and I used this in the bath hoping it would lighten my skin after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;It actually lightened my legs all over, however that made my farmer&#x27;s tan even more noticeable! lol my pale skin was bright and light and my tan skin appeared smooth but still tan (lighter though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so be careful where you focus your use&lt;br /&gt;try to avoid the already white parts of your body :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was a bit dry after a week of every day use, but because I have naturally moisturized skin a little lotion took the problem away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit odd but oh well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing more results!</li>
    <li> I started using this likas soap about 10 days ago. At first it felt like a little burn to my skin and made my pimples red but I continued using it after the third day or so it felt like a regular soap and no irritation at all. It made my face feel like all stretched out right after washing it but used a good face moisturizer and problem solved. It gave me a good exfoliation because my pimples started drying out and scabbing...    )))))) BUT NOW after continuous use My skin looks clean, My enlarged pores are almost invisible, My old dark brown acne scars look pink and are fading away, My dark spots and blemishes are almost gone and my skin has a lighter complexion. Now my oily forehead, nose and chin look amazing and oil free and is been only 10 days of use. ((((((...     ** ))))) I&#x27;M SO HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!!! ((((( **</li>
    <li> I bought this soap and used it for a month. I used it every shower, with a loofa sponge and saw LITTLE results. There was no skin lightening/ whitening from the soap, only a minor change from the exfoliating of the sponge. this soap DOES NOT work. :(</li>
    <li> i have used it for a few months, i haven&#x27;t been consistent but i see the difference still.&lt;br /&gt;a better result with another product may be</li>
    <li> I do like the way it feels, but not really noticing any remarkable change or different in skin, and its been a month. But it is still a nice soap</li>
    <li> My husband and I went fishing all summer from day to night, We were really upset with how dark we had gotten but we had so much fun...so I was in search for a product to lighten up.  I read many reviews before making this purchase and they were all correct even the concerns they had i had them to but it does brighten your skin bottom line. One word Great!! The only issue would be that it itches where ever it is applied (thats why i deducted a star but dont frown because its well worth it). Simple way to ease the drying itch is to Moisturize with lotions, oils, or buy Cortizone Cream (it worked great for the itch).... I have been recieving many compliments from the people who hadnt seen me since the summer and not only do they awe at how bright i have become (lighter than i was before the summer) but also that my skin is much clearer and my husband seems to really love how super smooth my skin is as well, so thats a really big plus ;). I just put in an order for 4 bars to split with my mother (lol) she loves how clear my complexion has gotten. Huge Thanks to Likas this product was everything i could ask for and more!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE PAPAYA SOAP IS GOOD FOR AGE SPOTS IN MY HANDS</li>
    <li> I bought this two years ago because somebody had told me it was good for acne prone skin. So decided to use it but it was leaving my skin too dry. You could actually see white dry areas on my face and with makeup it looked really acentuated. I only used it for like 3 months, I stopped using it after that. I don&#x27;t think it helped much in making my skin more even tone or reducing red marks. I thought it was a good soap to use just not on my face. It reminds me of the soap dial and I don&#x27;t like that soap, especially not on my face. So I mean if you want to give this a try you should but just beware of the drying affects. Be sure to use a good moisturizer when using on the face.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  Maybe its not for me but its worth a try.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating this review after speaking to my daughter and after using the product myself.    If you are looking to actually whiten your skin, this is not the product for you.  My daughter used it to alleviate the effects of hyper pigmentation on the back of her neck, and after using the entire bar, it worked.  The skin on her neck is now the same shade of brown as the rest of her body...and that&#x27;s the point here.  What this soap is really good at doing is returning skin to it&#x27;s original color, and nothing lighter.  While her skin is very sensitive, she was able to use it twice a day without it over drying her skin.  In fact, it felt like using any other soap.    I am now using this product myself to alleviate hyper-pigmentation due to acne scaring, and I am very pleased with the results.  It doesn&#x27;t happen over night, but it does work.    Last point.  My daughter has chocolate brown skin while I am more of a cafe au lait, both of us use the product, and have experienced the same results.</li>
    <li> The box fell apart once I pick it up.. Soap was old and moldy looking. I threw the soap away, too scared to use the product.</li>
    <li> Original Likas Papaya Skin Whitening Herbal Soap by Trinidad Cosmetics...&lt;br /&gt;Trinidad Cosmetics Laboratory Inc. this soap is really good to clean your face</li>
    <li> You feel your skin almost chemically exfoliated by this soap.  Sometimes your skin is grimy enough to need that.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The package was damaged and the soap have a plasticky smell...not the soft orange smell it is suppose to have. I even told the seller that the soap he is selling is fake but he didnt bother to respond back. I used the soap for 1 weeks and my face breakout all over. would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any whitening effects whatsoever, but the soap smells downright heavenly. The bar is huge and lasts a long time. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice papaya soap, this is it. If you&#x27;re looking for whiter skin, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This soap did not have any effect on my skin. I used it faithfully every day and also used sunscreen. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. The good thing is I did not get any rash or allergies when using the soap. Be careful to put the soap on a soap dish. I put the soap on the bath tub and it stained the ceramic/tile and would not wash out. It seems it works on things other than my skin. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> so the reason for the title is that there has been many fake likas going around the internet and i&#x27;m feeling kinda shady about this one. not only did mine arrived with the box being fully opened but the scent of the soap is not right. many have said that the real likas soap smells like a faint scent of oranges but mine just smells like straight up detergent and it&#x27;s very strong as well. i don&#x27;t know whether this is a fake or legit one considering the fact that the box is the original box but seller could have just switch the soap. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</li>
    <li> still continuing to use it its been  a week haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet . Dont forget a good moisturizer makes the skin feel tight and dry .</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is whitening my skin but is definitely brightening my skin and looks very clear.</li>
    <li> Really good. I bought this not to lighten my skin but to get rid of acne marks because a friend told me it would work. Great product and I&#x27;ll definitely get it again.</li>
    <li> i love this product. i used it four day and my skin start to become lighter and smooth. i recommend it</li>
    <li> So far... not what I was expecting, I havent noticed any brightening (not using it to lighten)...and its a little drying...for now will continue to use&lt;br /&gt;...Will update later</li>
    <li> I used it everyday for a little over a month and it has fantastic results. It doesnt lighten your skin too much but it does help with acne. My skin has broken out since and I&#x27;m a teenager. I will definently buy this again.</li>
    <li> Still using but don&#x27;t know if it works for me.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about it besides it&#x27;s a great product. If your looking for a bleaching or lightening product this isn&#x27;t for you. It only helps to remove the dead skin cells aka exfoliate that&#x27;s why I love it so much. It&#x27;s an all herb soap so you don&#x27;t have to worry about bleaching agents affecting your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it lightens my skin under the arms, I use it every day and it smells good.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the acne-curing miracle that people have claimed that it is (I&#x27;m not saying that it didn&#x27;t work for them -- just not for me), but it does seem to have improved my skin. I&#x27;ve never had much trouble with acne to begin with, but I had a couple of scars that I wanted to fade, and this seems to be doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, however, that I&#x27;ve been using both this *and* the Aveeno exfoliation cream that I&#x27;ve been using for the past several years. I&#x27;ll use this when my skin seems to have calmed down, and I&#x27;ll use the Aveeno whenever I have a zit. The mixture seems to be very good for my skin. Today in particular it looked like porcelain; it hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time -- if ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that I haven&#x27;t been using this for whitening purposes, so I can&#x27;t speak for how well it does in that area. My skin is already paler than my bedroom walls, so I definitely don&#x27;t need any more help with that. I do think that my skin has gotten a touch more pale, though, so maybe it does work -- at least a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: it&#x27;s probably not going to cure your acne or give you vampire skin, but it does some small improvements here and there if your skin responds to it correctly (I personally have rather sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s done fine for me). It&#x27;s good for fading acne scars and making your tone a bit more even, which is what I bought it for. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember: if you scrub, do so *very* gently. It&#x27;s an exfoliator, and it&#x27;ll tear off your skin if you go too crazy.</li>
    <li> This soap made my skin dry</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month no change in the dark marks it does clean very well and brighten your skin but I was hoping it would fade some marks it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> my acne scars,&lt;br /&gt;i think it&#x27;s not working lately,&lt;br /&gt;because my skin is used to the soap now, but pretty useful.</li>
    <li> I basically bought this soap to use around my nose and also forehead which is very oily. Likas is very effective in dealing with  oily skin. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day around my nose and forehead and have noticed excellent results.  I have fair skin and haven&#x27;t noticed in any change of color.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap and I like the way it makes my skin look smoother fading dark spots. I highly recommend this soap</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what skin type this is for but it did nothing to lighten any dark areas on my skin. I am a brown skinned women and this may not work for these skin types.</li>
    <li> The product smells great and goes on smooth. It lightened up my acne scares along with my hyper pigmentation pretty well. I could see a noticeable difference in my complexion after the first week, It was definitely worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only advice is that you have pretty good moisturizer on deck after you use the soap. It dries out skin pretty good,</li>
    <li> This product works really fast.  I saw great results almost immediately!  I even ordered a few boxes for my mother and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> This soap did not work for me. The soap itself was very dry when I received it and it made my skin extremely dry. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible for a soap to whiten my skin, but I read that it helps improve acne so I decided to try it. It did not do anything for me so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> when i got pregnant my hormones messed with my face &amp; i had ugly acne. i started to use the papaya soap on my face &amp; within 2 weeks my acne is completely gone &amp; all my dark spots from the acne have began to lighten all while giving my face a more beautiful complexion. it has worked better than everything else i was using on my face (even all the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; stuff). i feel way more comfortable going without makeup now! it burns like heck if it gets in your eyes though ...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years with no complaints.....clear skin, zero blemishes and a happy lady!!! Would not trade for another..</li>
    <li> I mainly bought this soap because of the reviews i read on it.The soap came in a slightly damaged box and all the places where the word lightening soap was supposed to be was blocked off with a thin piece of white paper. And the soap had no scent as it was supposed to have a light fruity scent as a read in a review.But i still decided to try it and after a week of use, I saw no change in my skin. I did use the soap down to the end as i paid for it, but i will not discourage anyone form buying this product. Maybe mine was just a fake.</li>
    <li> Great soap! It works in achieving a quick brightening effect! Softens the skin overall but I recommend using a moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> The soap seems to working fine.I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin tone but neither did i have any negative reactions.I have extremely dry skin, but this is not drying my skin out.The smell is quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple,this stuff really works.Ive only been using it for a few days and i have already started noticing some subtle changes in my overall skin tone. Deffinatly invest in this organic product!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  It really makes your skin feel clean in addition to the whitening. Great price.  Just great all over.</li>
    <li> Am not into writing reviews but with this, I thought I have to because it was others reviews that made me to try this soap out. And if you re out there still deliberating to getting this soap or not, pls wait no more, this is the best soap you can ever used. I promised myself i won&#x27;t write a review untill i see result and I have and that is why I am here. For months now I have been trying to get my skin lighter because I live in a place where the sun is like a sahara desert, with the summer, I went soo dark, hated what I look like, so I started buying all the expensive lighten soaps, honest, it didn&#x27;t work, I came up here and I saw this Likas Papaya soap, based on the reviews, I decided to give it a trial, to my own luck, I got it at an asian store here, cost me half of what is been sold here, I bought 4 at a spot. Towards the end of the first one, I notice i was lighter cos my foundation which was light on my face became light, by the time i finished the second one, I went for a lighter foundation, by the time i finished the fourth, I went for another lighter foundation. I cannot believe it, everyone is telling me am much lighter, I of course with that use a lighten lotion and I think am becoming too light so, will try to tone it down, especially with the winter at the corner.&lt;br /&gt;This is simply a miracle, just want to say a big thank you for everyhone that took their time to write a review, you helped me made my choice. This is it! I hope they never stop making this soap, its simply a mircale.</li>
    <li> It is best for oily skin types as for dry it makes it more dry. After using the soap i need to put good moisturizing cream on my face.</li>
    <li> Order this back on Xmas eve and NEVER got the order. Still waiting to get refunded. Very upset about this. I was really looking forward to getting this soap since I really enjoy the product and have used it for a few years now.</li>
    <li> I sort of bought this to see if it would lighten my skin but it really didn&#x27;t. It did dry out my face afterwards though(my face will feel cracked unless I put on lotion).  What surprised me is that after using it for maybe a month as a cleanser some spots on my skin that are left from scratching scabs from acne started to get less noticeable until they virtually disappeared. I don&#x27;t know if was the soap or I was just noticing more but it seemed have affect in that aspect.</li>
    <li> Beware when buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this soap about 4 times a week for about a month  and although it did brighten my skin a bit it also dried my skin out terribly and gave my face a dry, dull look. I went to a makeup specialist and she specifically said it was this soap. After discontinuing the use of this product my skin slowly began to regain its natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware if you have sensitive skin and use a REALLY good moisturizer after using this soap</li>
    <li> It works great minus the fact that it will make you extremely dry especially if you have sensative skin like me.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin softer and moisturized. Not sure how well it works for whitening because I didn&#x27;t see a difference, but then again, I only used for a month.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this soap after reading all the great reviews but I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I used it on my face once a day, and my spots didn&#x27;t really seem to fade; maybe I&#x27;m just being impatient. I will say it gave my face a good even tone. I also used it on my underarms twice a day, and they haven&#x27;t lightened one bit :/ I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this soap.</li>
    <li> It does not work. Do not waste your time buying this. I don&#x27;t think it even has any kojic acid.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! This is soap is amazing! I read plenty of reviews and I decided to give it a try. After obtaining a horrific sun burn on my hand, I swear it looked like I had obtained someone else&#x27;s hand. It was honestly about 10 shades darker than the rest of me! It was horrible! I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 2 weeks and its almost gone! You can still see where I got burned, but its honestly like 3 shades darker than me! Like I said before, I read plenty of reviews. What I did was that I washed my hands 2 times a day (day and night). I applied the soap and left it on for about a minute or so and then I scrubbed it off.  :/ After I dried my hands I applied plenty of lotion. If you don&#x27;t use lotion, your body will get really dry. I had originally  bought it on Amazon, but i got tired of waiting so I googled a few filipino store by my house and picked it up there for like $3. I have recommended this products to my friends! I wished I would of taken pictures to show my progress, but I didn&#x27;t :( Try it! You really don&#x27;t have much to loose!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. I will purchase this soap again. I saw results after the first ⏰ using it...</li>
    <li> I purchased FOUR bars of this soap after reading rave reviews about it. I bought it to help fade the dark spots on my face. It&#x27;s quite drying and definitely didn&#x27;t lighten any of my spots. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. When I first opened the box I sniffed the soap and I had a sneezing attack. Won&#x27;t try that again. I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now and I see that my neck and face are getting lighter. I only use it once a day and keep the soap on my neck for 2 minutes then wash it off. This product showed results within one week. Other reviewers stated that it helps clear acne, but I have not noticed any changes on my face. I have oily skin, so after I washed 2 hours later my face would be oily again. I had to stop using the soap on my face because white spots were appearing around my bottom right lip. I will not use on my face again unless it gets tanned from the sun. The first couple of washes did tingle a little bit and my face did itch a little. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Worst soap ever! Within one week, my palms started to feel dry. Then the skin started to peel off. I thought it was due to the weather but the moment I stopped using this soap, my palms became normal. Just wasted my money on this unworthy item.</li>
    <li> This product does feel very nice as a lather. However, with all products, u should moisturize immediately after a shower/bath. I generally LIKE this herbal concotion. I am one week in &amp; my skin is smoother. Buy it; try it, &amp; see how it works for U. I DO NOT put this on my face, nor do I wash my private areas with it... SCRUBS/EXFOLIATES really well. I hope this helps... :-) Natural products are the way to go; YES, the results may take more time to be effective. Furthermore, U will not be harming your skin with CHEMICALS...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 5/3/13&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will use this as a bathing soap. Cant really tell if it&#x27;s helping the medium dark knicks on my legs, however, the over all tone looks smoother. I&#x27;ll give it more time. But even if it doesnt help, I LIKE this natural soap. Bathes very well, geta ALL the dirt &amp; impurities OFF the body...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 5/8/13&lt;br /&gt;just rcvd second bar in the mail 5/7/13&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this soap lathers. I have noticed changes. My remedy, bathe, towel dry, lather soap in hands, smooth on legs, let dry for about 10-20mins. Rinse &amp; moisturize with N.H. lotion. One thing is for sure, it has changed the color of my olive colored wash cloth :-)</li>
    <li> It takes months and added regimens plus the soap to lighten your skin. i used this soap directly from Philippines before and it worked, this bar did nothing for me over course of 4 weeks and i noticed dint smell as strong or tingle my skin like the original bar someone brought over for me.....</li>
    <li> I give this soap a five star rate because it gives my skin a&lt;br /&gt;Glow an keep it clear of acne also hyperpigmentation ... you&lt;br /&gt;Should try it out use it at night is best because your not going&lt;br /&gt;Out in the sun if you do use sun sreen always . My skin looks great an I&#x27;m 39 but I look 35 coming from  my 24 , 22  an 19 an 7 year old kids an strangers to . I use black soap and lactic acid peels an apricot srub and aveeno sunsreen every day and last microdermabrasion olay I&#x27;m very light skinn african american an... hyperpigmentation tends to be a struggle for my race good luck</li>
    <li> This soap does not have a scent and I really didn&#x27;t notice any change in my complection.  I will not be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> It caused my skin to be irritated and I broke out in my face. It dried out my skin and burned it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m tanned in complexion (african)... i always complain about the sun because it can really mess up my skin and then it takes forever to clear up once i get really brown especially my face...i tried this product for two weeks and trust me it does clear up your skin especially pimples and dark spots...it smells really nice, it doesnt dry out your skin and to me it makes the skin feel really soft...unless you want to look white like a ghost i suggest to use this only when necessary ie: twice/three times a week then stop and probably use every couple of days or so...I RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> This soap has really lightened my skin. You have to use it for a while to notice a difference though. It will dry out your skin so you do need a moisturizer. It is truly amazing though.</li>
    <li> Does what the job! Keeps my skin glowing!</li>
    <li> The product was NOT authentic!  The soap burned my skin.  Real Likas Soap does not burn your skin because it is a natural product.  Beware of seller!</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a year ago over the summer time. I&#x27;m not very big on sun tanning due to the fact that I&#x27;m African-American with a medium brown skin tone already. I spent my summer in the south constantly out in the sum all day and my skin never darkened because I&#x27;d use the soap everyday when I&#x27;d come inside. It did a great job on helping me maintain my natural skin tone. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anyone trying to lighten their skin considering the fact i never used it for that purpose, but it did work as far as keeping my skin from tanning over the summer. The shipping was also very fast but the box the soap comes in wasn&#x27;t in the best condition (Hence the 4 stars) and that did worry me at first glance.</li>
    <li> Nice&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for it I found it I got and I am  enjoying it to the fullest&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I bought one about 2 months ago and have used it on my elbows, knees, and inner thigh areas only. It didn&#x27;t really make any difference. It is drying, as all reviews say, but that didn&#x27;t matter as I moisturize. Would recommend using another product.</li>
    <li> definitely exfoliates well. Not sure about the ingredients does not look so safe. Also the shower will be gross after you use it . residue is weird</li>
    <li> Pretty good bar.  Natraul, face became more brighter and it does work very well.  I suggest this product to anyone willing to try it</li>
    <li> This did not work...well at least not after one bar of soap, i think you have to use up several bars before it work, but im not buying again</li>
    <li> My first time using it.  So far, I am liking it.  Came quickly.  I use a black soap to clean and then I apply this soap and let it stay on for about 5 minutes and then rinse.  It rinses clear.</li>
    <li> After my first time showering with this soap, my skin, literally, GLOWED! I saturating a wet washrag with this soap and proceeded to gently scrub my skin for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. I rinsed it off and when I looked in the mirror, I noticed that my inner forearm, chest, and thighs were very bright-looking. Even my outer forearms lightened up as well, taking on a slightly &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34; appearance. And the patches of lighter-colored skin on my upper back are beginning to even out, which was a pleasant surprise.  Despite seeing results upon first usage, I deducted one star for trying it out on my face, which resulted in a few red, painful pimples.  However, I will continue to use this soap to exfoliate the skin on my body, and will limit my facial cleansing products to just black soap &amp; Kojie San soap.</li>
    <li> this soap really works and i think that i need to buy it again so that i can get my skin even lighter.</li>
    <li> Honestly it actually brightened my scars and discolorations up.I am an African American woman just looking to even out my skin and this product did just that,and I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months(the bar will last you a long time)don&#x27;t expect to be 5 shades lighter in 2 weeks!Its not a bleaching soap.I rarely breakout like I use to which is a plus and my makeup looks way better because of the difference in my skin.Id recommend this to anyone looking for a little improvement in they&#x27;re skin.Oh and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize!Its very drying!!!&lt;br /&gt;Update:Well it is now nearing the end of July and thar lasted a great 8 months.My tone is now more even!As of right now I don&#x27;t need the soap,but I will researches in the near future!Give it a try you might love it!</li>
    <li> saw no difference, don&#x27;t waste your time I have dark sports on face due to pregnancy (melasma) and it did not work at all. at all. Not at all.</li>
    <li> it was better than the last soap I bought on Amazon</li>
    <li> I hate this soap it made me darker</li>
    <li> Im already towards the end of my soap bar and I can honestly say I got a tad bit lighter but not a whole lot like I thought was actually going to happen. I was and good experience though to say the least. I probably got a shade lighter but the real trick is trying to avoid the sun whenver you go out because other than than if you&#x27;re always in the sun then this product wont work for you unless you use really high spf sunscreen like I always did. Whenever I went outside I always made sure to try and put on sunscreen before I go out because I didnt want to lower the effect that the soap was doing. IT DOES WORK, but not to the extent where its completely white like my korean friend who is literally as white as paper. Im hispanic and I have a LIGHT brown skin tone and it honestly made me turn yellow(in paler terms). The first person to notice was my hairstylist because today I went in with a tank top with the sun going down and the first thing she complimented was how lighter I got compared to how I used to look when I ran Track and Field competitively. So it does give you a lighter skin tone but not a hardcore white. The compliments I have gotten the most is that I look more glowing, basically tells me it brightens and brings color into my skin. So 4 stars</li>
    <li> I think it works well. Would buy more when I run out. Love the natural smell it has.</li>
    <li> Best seller! AAAA++++</li>
    <li> no result,but  not everybody has the same skin type., maybe it work for you</li>
    <li> You must use this product with a bleaching cream in order for it to really work. It IS NOT as good as the manufactuer claims it to be but it does work with another agent.</li>
    <li> in all honesty i am not able to give a thorough review of this product. i think it started to clear up some of the hyper pigmentation but i had to stop due to extreme dryness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Im on my second package and I gave been using this soaps for over 3 months now yet I don&#x27;t see now difference. I got mild chocolate skin and I don&#x27;t see any improvements. I wont buy again, im trying makari now.</li>
    <li> Not drying.  Okay results.  Will go back to using black soap.</li>
    <li> The soap leaves a nice smell but I haven&#x27;t seen any different in my skin</li>
    <li> I cant believe how well this product works... I can see a huge difference in my skin.. its been maybe a week. The key is to later it on then leave it on your skin for 5 to 7 mins. (Brush your teeth or something) I might have to slow down using it because my skin is changing so fast... It&#x27;s scary. I even stopped wearing foundation on my face :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t write about this when i got it, I have been using it for a week, and it&#x27;s like a miracle! I am pretty light brown, with a lot of pimples, but now! My skin lighten and all my ACNE is GONE! It gets rid the ACNE for a week, and you start seeing a lighter complexion within a week! but for most a month!, I would really recommend this to another person because it works miracles! I LOVE THIS ITEM! It really works and I am NOT lying, but it&#x27;s up to your decision if you believe it works(:</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It has worked very well for me when I get a ugly tan, or just want to lighten my skin up a bit. Gave it about 3 weeks and I seen a big change.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of some of the reviews. Obviously these reviews had to have been written by someone in the company. This product did absolutely nothing for my skin. What&#x27;s more, since I don&#x27;t like wasting things just by throwing it away, I have been using it almost daily. Still no change after 2 months or so. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old woman who has been dealing with acne for years. While I&#x27;ve managed to clear up my face over the years, I still deal with back acne year round and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for it so far. It is great at controlling the oily skin on my back and chest and really reduces breakouts. It is winter right now and I appreciate that this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate or overdry my skin. The smell is pleasant and mild as well.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a week and I can already see results. Will buy again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Have used for over 7 days no obvious change.  I will keep using until finish.  I&#x27;ll repost, upon completion of bar.</li>
    <li> After a month of using this product, I finally noticed the result. I have a lot of acne on my back and it almost gone away! Simply works for me. Still waiting for the white skin improvement but I am not hoping too much about it because I already got natural white skin complexion since birth. All i only care about is just for my back acne.. The reason I gave 3 star is because I received the soap with the box already open.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap thinking that it would lighten my skin by at LEAST a shade or two. Nothing happened. Even after consistent use this soap produced absolutely no results besides dryer skin. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone, it just doesnt work for me.</li>
    <li> ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;sodium cocoyl isethionate, stearic acid, sodium tallowate, water, sodium isethionate, coconut acid, cocamidopropyl betaine, and/or sodium laureth sulfate and/or sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, sodium sterate, sodium cocoate, or sodium palm kernelate, fragrance, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, triosodium edta, papaya enzyme, FD&amp;C yellow 3 FD&amp;C red 40.  it contains ingredients that makes your skin very dry.  ive tried kristine papaya soap and this one is much better. it gently exfoliates but wont dry your skin.  i got a lot of compliments after using it after 3 days.  ingredients:  carica papaya extract, refined coconut oil and sunflower oil, glycerine, fragrance, deionized water</li>
    <li> First, I will say that this is a lightener that SUBTLY!! works. If you&#x27;re looking for a DRAMATIC change in skin tone in a short amount of time (2 week &gt; 3 months), this soap is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this soap (2 pack) in the summer of 2012 to lighten my arms about 2 shades to match the rest of my body. I substituted Likas for my regular soap, but I didn&#x27;t shower/bathe with it every day, and 10 months later (now; May 2013), my arms are even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, you won&#x27;t notice that you&#x27;re getting lighter until a significant amount of time has passed and you look back on how your skin used to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this soap only to the PATIENT, and for people who have minimal lightening goals.</li>
