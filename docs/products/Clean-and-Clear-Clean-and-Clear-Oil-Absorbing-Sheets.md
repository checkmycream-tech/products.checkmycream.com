      <li>I will definitely purchase again - great price!</li>
      <li>Need to buy more.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to men, women, and (mostly) teenagers who are developing acnes or who are getting grease or dirt on their faces because of stress, pollution, etc.  </li>
      <li>i felt like the more</li>
      <li>look better/more confident.</li>
      <li>I love these things.</li>
      <li>I used these mostly on my trip abroad</li>
      <li>i love this product it helped my oily face from breaking out</li>
      <li>but the amount of oil on my face requires something more substantial.</li>
      <li>Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Haven&#x27;t found any cons yet :)</li>
      <li>i was dubious because the commercials were so over the top</li>
      <li>and I doubt I&#x27;ll be able to stop.</li>
      <li>and they fit nicely into your purse.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry and has the nice sticky patch on the cover to make it easy to pull out 1 sheet at a time.</li>
      <li>What works best for me is toilet seat covers or Starbucks napkins</li>
      <li>A good product that really does take away the oil from your face and reduce acne!  </li>
      <li>quick and effective, one swipe and you&#x27;re done!&lt;br</li>
      <li>; and I can say firsthand that that is 100% true!</li>
      <li>The package is about the size of an iPhone screen and is so easy to toss into my makeup bag</li>
      <li>They are super absorbent and works like a charm!</li>
      <li>and they did a great job of keeping my shine-free for pictures even when I was running around various tourist attractions in the summer heat.</li>
      <li>It really works!!!</li>
      <li>I hope you love them as much as I do!</li>
      <li>I feel clean and convenient.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of different brands (blotting papers are a must have for me, otherwise my face turns into a disco ball mid-day) and these are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>but wow! amazing</li>
      <li>I love these oil-absorbing sheets because they are very convinient and they don&#x27;t require any water to use.  </li>
      <li>The price is much more reasonable though.</li>
      <li>and they make me feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>so it is a worthy nvestment.</li>
      <li>thank you clean and clear for giving me a solution to my problem :)</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t really do better job than clean and clear because they are coated with powder...  </li>
      <li>These are great and with a small pack fit in my pocket.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They remove oil from your skin very quickly, and the box with 50 sheets is very convenient to carry.</li>
      <li>I recently starting using these sheets and love them!</li>
      <li>so if you have very oily skin they are not for you, if not they are fine.</li>
      <li>skin look blotchy, and that they really do pick up a ton of oil for a shine free look.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and need to pat 2 or 3 times a day to feel comfortable.</li>
      <li>It works well for me and worth the money.</li>
      <li>I tell ya, this is so far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>And whenever I apply make-up and a couple of minutes go by my face looks so greasy like there was no make-up to begin with, so when I tried this product I instantly feel in love with it, it absorbed all the oil on my face and never smudged my make-up</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use too much makeup, maybe concealer sometimes, but my skin is super duper oily.</li>
      <li>When you don&#x27;t have easy access to other ways to clean up, these are well worth it!</li>
      <li>The container is very much portable and convenient.</li>
      <li>I have very, very oily skin and by the 11am hour</li>
      <li>yes, very much so,</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t pick up very much oil</li>
      <li>this to anyone, male or female who needs to freshen up quickly to make a good impression either on others or ourselves.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and these sheets work so well, and after i use these my face doesnt shime as much!!</li>
      <li>Clean &amp; Clear wins for being both efficient and cost-effective.</li>
      <li>These work pretty well</li>
      <li>Overall, though, one of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>Wow, I sound like I am selling an ad for this product....</li>
      <li>and they really work!</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t use any tissue for my face because I feel like that I am adding more dusts to the skin by doing it.</li>
      <li>The Clean and Clear did remove the oily shine</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the texture of the Clean and Clear sheets on my face (somewhat rubbery) and sometimes couldn&#x27;t get one sheet out at a time.</li>
      <li>These sheets are great for those who work long days or are on a long trip.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product overall, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it while whipping my face my makeup comes on those sheets.</li>
      <li>(do i have a large face? ^^;)  </li>
      <li>These are the first oil absorbing sheets I have ever bought</li>
      <li>Make-up for the most part remains undisturbed so long as you &#x27;pat&#x27; (don&#x27;t rub).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many oil blotters from many different brands - Shiseido, Bobbi Brown, M.A.C and Clinique are the most recent ones , and I can tell you that M.A.C&#x27;s and Clean&amp;Clear&#x27;s facial blotters are the only ones worth buying because they really suck the oil from your face.  </li>
      <li>The oil absorbing sheets by Clean &amp; Clear are absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite certain that these sheets do not contain mineral oil in the sense</li>
      <li>The only down side I have found is that they could be a bit bigger, but otherwise, Great Product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing what one little sheet can do.</li>
      <li>These sheets are a wonder and they really don&#x27;t disturb your make-up, although you might want to touch-up after you&#x27;ve used a sheet.</li>
      <li>It saves so much time since applying powder foundation to your skin after</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Surprise!!! I waited 3 weeks to receive these. It&#x27;s just some tiny strips of paper. oil absorbing yes, very much so, but the amount of oil on my face requires something more substantial. I can just as easily absorb my facial oil with a tissue...or the paper toilet cover sheets in the ladies room which are supplied free.</li>
    <li> I love these things. I just wish they were bigger. The only other kind I&#x27;ve tried are the CVS-brand ones, and they work just as well.</li>
    <li> This oil-absorbing sheets is really good my face gets really oily especially my nose. And whenever I apply make-up and a couple of minutes go by my face looks so greasy like there was no make-up to begin with, so when I tried this product I instantly feel in love with it, it absorbed all the oil on my face and never smudged my make-up I&#x27;m just sorry that I didn&#x27;t buy 2 packs lol.</li>
    <li> I had bought this product like 5 times already and let me tell you even my boyfriend loves cleaning his face with this oil sheets. It really absorbs all the oil from your face without leaving it sticking, and when you have make up on it truly does not mess it up at all! I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My face is oily year round and I can&#x27;t live without these. I&#x27;ve tried them all and for the price these are the best! I use them all day for instant matte finish and before I reapply pressed powder. I don&#x27;t want all that oil on my compact puff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many oil blotters from many different brands - Shiseido, Bobbi Brown, M.A.C and Clinique are the most recent ones , and I can tell you that M.A.C&#x27;s and Clean&amp;Clear&#x27;s facial blotters are the only ones worth buying because they really suck the oil from your face.  However, I&#x27;d have to give M.A.C the number two spot simply because they cost 4 times as much. Clean &amp; Clear wins for being both efficient and cost-effective.</li>
    <li> These are the first oil absorbing sheets I have ever bought and I really like them. They really get rid of the oil from my nose and forehead area and removes shine. I love how small the package is so that I can just put it in my makeup bag and take it with me anywhere.</li>
    <li> I used these mostly on my trip abroad and they did a great job of keeping my shine-free for pictures even when I was running around various tourist attractions in the summer heat. It&#x27;s easy to carry and has the nice sticky patch on the cover to make it easy to pull out 1 sheet at a time.</li>
    <li> These work great! I have the oilyest skin ever, and this gets it all off, without causing a breakout! Yay!</li>
    <li> This product does work, look up an instructional video on how to use the sheets. BUYER BEWARE, these are well known to cause acne, so if you&#x27;re looking for an acne fix, then look somewhere else. Sorry &#x3D;( I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, but near the end of the day it gets oily, and drives me nuts. As a boy, I cant just use makeup to solve my skin flaws. These are great and with a small pack fit in my pocket. I use them at work near the end of the day. The sheets feel thin and absorb almost all of the oil, and stops my face from being so shiny. If you do have oily skin, and need to use three to four a day, its not good for your skin, they do have chemicals that cause acne. Combine these with tissue paper, like Kleenex or the kind you put in gifts, and it should help drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very useful, and good for summer when your skin gets oily at the end of the beach day. I don&#x27;t use them regularly, and don&#x27;t recommend that anyone does.</li>
    <li> I agree with the bottom reviewer!  I love these oil-absorbing sheets because they are very convinient and they don&#x27;t require any water to use.  So if you are in rush, and if you have very oily face like myself, you can use these sheets to wipe the grease out without visiting the restroom.  These sheets comes really handy if you cannot go to restroom to wash your face. (ie: in the car, bus, classroom, etc.)  I recommend this product to men, women, and (mostly) teenagers who are developing acnes or who are getting grease or dirt on their faces because of stress, pollution, etc.  Only downside of this product is that you need at least more than two clean sheets to wipe the entire face.  (do i have a large face? ^^;)  Considering the price of this product, I believe that this sheets are extremely handy but can become an expensive accessory for your facial skin.    I personally don&#x27;t use any tissue for my face because I feel like that I am adding more dusts to the skin by doing it.</li>
    <li> They are very small, so they are good for on the go. They don&#x27;t pick up very much oil so if you have very oily skin they are not for you, if not they are fine. I don&#x27;t use them very often because they don&#x27;t do too much for me because I have decently  oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and I doubt I&#x27;ll be able to stop. My face is just extremely oily and these little absorbing sheets definitely take the shine, grease, and sweat off my face. They are super absorbent and works like a charm! I highly recommend it to anyone who has stubborn oily skin. Instead of caking on powder, try these sheets and I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Wow, I sound like I am selling an ad for this product....LOL</li>
    <li> Best brand I&#x27;ve found, very effective and come in a compact holder.</li>
    <li> I absoluteluy looooooooove these sheets. It&#x27;s so convenient to have these in my purse and quickly blot away the oil during the day to keep my makeup and skin looking flawless. It really does keep the oil away too.. for hours. and you dont have to keep reapplying powder and clogging pores. I can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
    <li> It completely absorbs oil. Since my skin is oily and in summer this helps a lot! I use this very often almost every two hours nowdays. I was used having a shine on my face but now it looks very clear.</li>
    <li> Having extremely oily skin, I use these every single day. If not, I feel as if my skin is dripping with oil (YUCK!) I thought with age the oiliness on my skin would subside; at this writing, I&#x27;m 38 and I still have acne and oily skin. These sheets are a wonder and they really don&#x27;t disturb your make-up, although you might want to touch-up after you&#x27;ve used a sheet. The only thing preventing me from giving this product 5 stars is their size: they should be bigger, I think. Instead of just one sheet, I use two or three. Anyhow, if you have oily/shiny skin like I do, these will do the job. I hope you love them as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, especially that time of the month and in the summer when I sweat. I usually found myself washing my face 3-4 times a day. I recently starting using these sheets and love them! I use one in the morning right before I apply my usual acne medication and one or two throughout the day when I feel like I need a touch up. I keep a pack in my bathroom and one in my purse for when I&#x27;m on the go. I can&#x27;t believe how it soaks up all the oil. The only down side I have found is that they could be a bit bigger, but otherwise, Great Product!</li>
    <li> These sheets are great for those who work long days or are on a long trip. It is a great way to refresh yourself when it&#x27;s just not practical/possible to wash your face. One sheet picks up an awful lot of oil and leaves you feeling much more confident and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this product and my daughter too and the price is good too I give 5 stars to the product</li>
    <li> This product works very well to reduce the shine from your face. It makes your face looked instant matte finish and it costs a lot less than a very similar product from Clinique. It&#x27;s small and handy. I just kept it in my purse and use it once or twice a day to make my face looked refreshed without any makeup.</li>
    <li> It really works!!! It&#x27;s really convenient to have it in the purse. Just like it claimed in the description, it does absorb excess oil.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well but they dont last all day&lt;br /&gt;I find my self using 2-3 a day but for the money you can&#x27;t beat these</li>
    <li> It is convenient to take the sheet out because some brand has no sticky preventive pad. I feel clean and convenient.</li>
    <li> I have very, very oily skin and by the 11am hour I am completely shiny and my make up turns dark. This removes the oil and shine without smearing the make up and you dont look caked up. I love it, works great. Only downfall is wish the pads could be a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I helped me get a lot of oil off my face and I can actually see it working as it turns clear to show you how much oil it has absorb! Definitely buying this product again.</li>
    <li> These are just average, not worse but not better than some of the other beauty blotters out there. The price is much more reasonable though.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> A good product that really does take away the oil from your face and reduce acne!  Wish they were a little bigger, or folded in half or something, because they are a tad bit small.</li>
    <li> I have tried three types of blotting papers so far for oily skin: Clean and Clear, Palladio and 24/7. The Clean and Clear did remove the oily shine and I didn&#x27;t notice any residue on my skin. I didn&#x27;t like the texture of the Clean and Clear sheets on my face (somewhat rubbery) and sometimes couldn&#x27;t get one sheet out at a time. My favorite are the Palladio for ease of use and the option of a slight powder finish (on one side of the paper - so you can just absorb oil if you prefer). The Clean and Clear are better than the 24/7 which left a ghostly white powder on my face (only comes in one color).</li>
    <li> Poor quality plastic-like material. Don&#x27;t absorb oil very well and difficult to separate without touching them all. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Love these! My fav. Life saver if your face is not agreeing with your makeup and your in public. Need to buy more.</li>
    <li> not too good, plastic sheets</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several years, and I try never to be without them. My face tends to get oily in the afternoons, and a quick dab all over with one of these completely takes care of it without disturbing my makeup.  I took off one star because they aren&#x27;t quite as big as I would like.  If you&#x27;re oily enough that you need to use the whole sheet, you end up having to hold it by a spot that is already used and then you have your face oil on your fingers.  If the sheets were a little bigger, that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  Overall, though, one of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE!!! I have an extremely oily face and after gym I use these and they make me feel fresh and clean. DEFINITELY GET THESE!!!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a guy. I use these if I have to meet with someone after getting off of work. They refresh you - they make me feel/look better/more confident. I hate feeling oily if I go to dinner/a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have to use 2 (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s cause I have a big face or because I get real oily or what).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product overall, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it while whipping my face my makeup comes on those sheets.</li>
    <li> The oil absorbing sheets by Clean &amp; Clear are absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They remove oil from your skin very quickly, and the box with 50 sheets is very convenient to carry.</li>
    <li> i love this product it helped my oily face from breaking out i felt like the more i used it the less oily my skin looked will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for ppl with oily skin! This provides a quick lasting solution. ..like if I blot in the morning Im usually good for the rest of the day unless its just one of those where its extremely humid but other than tht this is def a staple in my skin care routine</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use too much makeup, maybe concealer sometimes, but my skin is super duper oily. So even if I use a sunblock, after a few hours, my skin will be very oily. So I use this sheets to remove the oil from my face. Its very easy to use- just take a sheet from the package and press it against your skin and that&#x27;s it! The sheet will turn transparent as soon as it absorbs the oil from your skin. It saves so much time since applying powder foundation to your skin after every 2-3 hours is such a hassle.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works well for me and worth the money. I will recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> I used this product about 4 times one week, and I experienced a terrible breakout.  It looked like a rash of tiny whiteheads (clogged every pore), and it left my skin tender and inflamed.  Look at the ingredients (yes, there are ingredients, it&#x27;s not just paper).  The blotters contain mineral oil and other unnatural ingredients.  It has taken me a long time to clear my skin from this experience. Spare yourself the grief, don&#x27;t use these.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and these sheets work so well, and after i use these my face doesnt shime as much!! The only con about this product is the size, the size can be bigger.</li>
    <li> I tried $2 rice paper from some no name company to $10 Saphora brand to $15 Shiseido brand...  I tell ya, this is so far my favorite.  Yes some expensive stuff are coated with powder but WHY?  They don&#x27;t really do better job than clean and clear because they are coated with powder...  Don&#x27;t believe they are better because they are more pricy!</li>
    <li> Im using this product for over 5 years, and its really a absorb your oil on your face.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this even with a make up</li>
    <li> Came exactly as if I bought it in store, perfect for the summer time.</li>
    <li> FINALLY! i have used so many powders etc to try to control oil but with my dark complexion they don&#x27;t really match my skin tone. so i decided to try these and they really work! i was dubious because the commercials were so over the top but wow! amazing and i ony need to use two in an entire day so it is a worthy nvestment. i HIGHLY RECOMMEND these! and they fit nicely into your purse.  thank you clean and clear for giving me a solution to my problem :)</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin for my age group of over 65. These work great for taking the excess oil off my face. My skin shows oil an hour or two after applying my make-up. I would recommend these to anyone with oily skin.</li>
    <li> If you get shiny skin during the day this is a great way to get the oil off without having to wash your face.</li>
    <li> works good at clearing your oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hah stupid review thing required me to type out a longer review dumb, take this and shove it!</li>
    <li> Love these blotting papers - they work amazingly well!  I&#x27;ve used a number of different brands (blotting papers are a must have for me, otherwise my face turns into a disco ball mid-day) and these are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I like that there&#x27;s no transfer of residue, since powder coated blotting papers can make you&#x27;re skin look blotchy, and that they really do pick up a ton of oil for a shine free look.  Make-up for the most part remains undisturbed so long as you &#x27;pat&#x27; (don&#x27;t rub).  The Top Care Brand is the other blotter sheets that I carry when I find them in stores and they&#x27;re nearly identical in ingredients and packaging, except they run about a $1 less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I&#x27;ve seen anyone complain about this on Amazon, but every now and then you&#x27;ll find a review on Makeupalley where someone gets all in a tizzy over &#x27;mineral oil&#x27; being one of the listed ingredients.  I&#x27;m quite certain that these sheets do not contain mineral oil in the sense that they&#x27;ve been &#x27;coated&#x27; with oil.  The sheets themselves are polypropylene based (plastic) as opposed to traditional paper blotting papers and I believe the mineral oil is one of the ingredients in the manufacturing of these plastic sheets (just as oil is often used in the manufacturing of other &#x27;plastics&#x27;).  Just as one wouldn&#x27;t worry about a plastic water bottle leaving an oily residue in their beverage, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the mineral oil used in making these sheets leeching out onto your skin.  These sheets have never caused me to break out - highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and need to pat 2 or 3 times a day to feel comfortable. These things are too small. I have to use like 4 sheets just for basic face coverage. They&#x27;re also EMBARRASSING. If I whip them out in public, which is the whole point in having them, the matte light blue turns to dark greasy spots where the oil absorbed, which is highly embarrassing for anyone who looks at what your doing. And the price, no thanks, they don&#x27;t need to charge that much for these little guys. What works best for me is toilet seat covers or Starbucks napkins Lol. I gave it 2 stars for convenience and they do absorb oil moderately. But I will look for something else.</li>
    <li> Sometimes during my walks at lunch I work up a bit of a sweat. When I get back to the office I use one of these and they work great. When you don&#x27;t have easy access to other ways to clean up, these are well worth it!</li>
    <li> These sheets are so portable, affordable, convenient, and full of quality that I see no good reason NOT to buy them! I&#x27;ve tried brand after brand and one day when walking through the local Wegmans spotted these and picked them up on impulse. I was very glad that I did, because they are a purchase I do NOT regret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very quick and effective, one swipe and you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;-On the package it says &amp;#34;won&#x27;t smudge makeup&amp;#34; and I can say firsthand that that is 100% true! My concealer does not smear when using this, and I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely portable. The package is about the size of an iPhone screen and is so easy to toss into my makeup bag and go!&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve had the same pack for a few YEARS and I still get the same results as when I first bought them. Admittedly I do not use them that often, but that is because with proper face care and cleaning, when necessary one wipe does the trick and I am left with matte gloss-free skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Haven&#x27;t found any cons yet :)&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this to anyone, male or female who needs to freshen up quickly to make a good impression either on others or ourselves. It&#x27;s amazing what one little sheet can do. 5/5!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, my chin and cheeks are quite dry, but my forehead can be rather oily (especially with bangs!) This product works so great. It really helps take away the shine from my forehead and temples. I will definitely purchase again - great price!</li>
    <li> works great. I had a tough time at first trying to separate the sheets but realized after there is a sticker which grabs them individually. So dont make the same mistake as me and try to separate these sheets one by one.</li>
    <li> These sheets work magificent! These absorb quite well, and the sheets turn clear in areas of the sheet that have absorbed oils. The container is very much portable and convenient. I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon once I run out (:</li>
    <li> Only oil blotting sheerts I use</li>
