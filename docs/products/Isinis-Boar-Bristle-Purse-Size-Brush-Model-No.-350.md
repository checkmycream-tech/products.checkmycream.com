### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful brush!  </li>
      <li>Great brush</li>
      <li>I read some great reviews on this brush</li>
      <li>The brush is perfect :) I wish it came with a case...</li>
      <li>but the bristles are boar and the bed is just the same-so you can use them for a good vigorous brushing without pressing them into your head.--they</li>
      <li>did a good job with this brush.</li>
      <li>This is true, these are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I never had this kind of problem with MP brushes.....</li>
      <li>Not quite mason Pearson but a good solid brush which is also beautiful to look at.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>My husband has had a boar bristle brush for so many years that it was falling apart.</li>
      <li>I am glad I just ordered 1 because I needed more</li>
      <li>Love these Hairbrushes.  </li>
      <li>Bought two for my granddaughters also, and they love them.</li>
      <li>My favorite brand of brushes since the 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>just right, they don&#x27;t pull and they feel good on the scalp.</li>
      <li>That said, I love this brush; it makes my scalp feel fantastic, and my hair looks thicker and shinier.</li>
      <li>but because I have fine textured hair I ordered it anyway.  </li>
      <li>They fit in my hand</li>
      <li>I gave it 5 stars because it is perfect for fine or thin hair.</li>
      <li>I have lots of fine textured straight hair.</li>
      <li>A little pricey, but a great product.</li>
      <li>A great little hand bag sized brush.</li>
      <li>Well worth the 5 minute effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my thin hair.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>It gets through my scalp and brushes much more like my old Mason Pearson brush did.</li>
      <li>I have very thin, fine hair, and I&#x27;ve read that a boar bristle brush is the best  for this type of hair.</li>
      <li>so the size is just right for me.  </li>
      <li>make it just right for that.  </li>
      <li>(the larger Isinis brush does a better job of getting to the scalp, of course)</li>
      <li>is extremely short and is much better suited to a child&#x27;s size hand.</li>
      <li>The second one arrived looking much better than the first.</li>
      <li>While the quality of the brush is pretty good, it doesn&#x27;t get all the way through my hair to the scalp until the 2nd or 3rd stroke.  </li>
      <li>I thought when I ordered it, it was the large size I have always used.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this brush after my puppy chewed up both of my MP pure boar bristle hair brushes.</li>
      <li>The rest of the bristles were also very uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Given the cost of the brush, I expected substantially greater quality.</li>
      <li>It works perfect for me, I have fine textured, thick, shoulder length hair and this little brush gives me the same scalp massage and oil distribution that my large size Isinis does.</li>
      <li>The pure boar bristles are just as high in quality as those in a Mason Pearson brush.  </li>
      <li>I have had an Isinis brush for over 20 years and had really looked forward to my new brush, however the handle&lt;br</li>
      <li>I personally prefer the smaller size so I can carry it easily on trips.</li>
      <li>One side of the outside row of bristles were significantly shorter than the rest, and they barely touched the surface of my hair.</li>
      <li>It has sharp edges as if it was punched out of a cheap mold and the excess plastic was still clinging.</li>
      <li>Some of the bristles have squared off ends and some have a natural taper, but when the brush is washed in hot water all the bristles become much softer, so I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re all the same substance.  </li>
      <li>Cheap, very rough edged plastic brush.  </li>
      <li>A little smaller than expected but great product.</li>
      <li>Have used them for years, and needed new ones after about 15 years of using the old ones.  </li>
      <li>So anyone complaining about that should really just invest in the larger size.</li>
      <li>Very overpriced actually.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read that the boars are not killed for their bristles.  </li>
      <li>I had not used it the lady was very obnoxious to me that they would not let me return for a larger size.</li>
      <li>I just take smaller strands of hair and brush a few more strokes.</li>
      <li>Its true that its not big enough to run through my hair to the scalp in a single stroke, but this is the portable sized one, not the large.</li>
      <li>Also, I switched from my usual Mason Pearson brushes to the Isinis because  another reviewer said they were just as good for much less money.  </li>
      <li>It also works so well on my hair (thick, long, and straight) that I bought two more for my travel kit and purse.</li>
      <li>The other review I read indicated that the brush was too small to be effective</li>
      <li>This is a scratchy brush capable of brushing my thinner hair down to the scalp, if anything it&#x27;s a little too stiff, but it seems to do the job of redistributing oil nicely.</li>
      <li>have medium (not thin nor thick and coarse) stick straight Asian hair.</li>
      <li>The plastic is soft and you will soon have the exact same shiny finish as that on a Mason Pearson brush at less than half the price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have had an Isinis brush for over 20 years and had really looked forward to my new brush, however the handle&lt;br /&gt;  is extremely short and is much better suited to a child&#x27;s size hand.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after my puppy chewed up both of my MP pure boar bristle hair brushes. She hopped on my vanity chair and then climbed up on my vanity. I read some great reviews on this brush and I decided to give it a go. I always wanted a BBB for my purse anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super disappointed when I first looked at the brush. It has sharp edges as if it was punched out of a cheap mold and the excess plastic was still clinging. One side of the outside row of bristles were significantly shorter than the rest, and they barely touched the surface of my hair. The rest of the bristles were also very uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe I received a lemon and decided to order another one from a different seller. The second one arrived looking much better than the first. The edges were not as sharp and the bristles were even. HOWEVER!!! After only brushing my hair twice with it, I noticed that the tops of the bristles are breaking off, resulting uneven bristle length. Also, quite few bristles are starting to bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium (not thin nor thick and coarse) stick straight Asian hair. I brush my hair in section to maximize the benefit of BBB. I never had this kind of problem with MP brushes.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning both and getting me a MP brush again.....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get through to my scalp;  I bought this brush when my Mason Pearson brush was stolen along with my purse.  While the quality of the brush is pretty good, it doesn&#x27;t get all the way through my hair to the scalp until the 2nd or 3rd stroke.  I have lots of fine textured straight hair. Recently, I bought a Bass brand brush for 17 dollars, it&#x27;s a combo natural bristle with some nylon bristles.  It gets through my scalp and brushes much more like my old Mason Pearson brush did.</li>
    <li> I have used Isinis hairbrushes for 40 years.  They fit in my hand just right, they don&#x27;t pull and they feel good on the scalp. Just wish they still cost $5 and I could get them in all the colors.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush!  The pure boar bristles are just as high in quality as those in a Mason Pearson brush.  It has the same  benefits as a Mason Pearson...your hair will stay on your head rather than getting ripped out or breaking.  For those who object to the rough edged plastic all around the Inisis brush, simply purchase an OPI nail pad and gently sand the edge down.  The plastic is soft and you will soon have the exact same shiny finish as that on a Mason Pearson brush at less than half the price.  Well worth the 5 minute effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that the boars are not killed for their bristles.  I&#x27;m not sure how you shear a boar, but there it is.  That&#x27;s what Mason Pearson claims!</li>
    <li> The brush is perfect :) I wish it came with a case...I ended up putting it in a small cloth umbrella case!</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but a great product. Very overpriced actually.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these small brushes for my travel kit, and my six-year-old daughter stole it. She has thick curly hair, and this is the only brush that actually gets through her hair. It also works so well on my hair (thick, long, and straight) that I bought two more for my travel kit and purse. I would not recommend using it everyday (the larger Isinis brush does a better job of getting to the scalp, of course) but then again this brush is not intended for that. Worth the money. I expect that it will last for years, as my larger ones have.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Its true that its not big enough to run through my hair to the scalp in a single stroke, but this is the portable sized one, not the large. So anyone complaining about that should really just invest in the larger size. I personally prefer the smaller size so I can carry it easily on trips. I just take smaller strands of hair and brush a few more strokes. Not rocket science.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s for my daughter in law for Christmas. Inhave used the large and small for over 20 years. This brush is very hard to find as it&#x27;s made in France. Buy the bore over the nylon, it easier on your hair.</li>
    <li> Cheap, very rough edged plastic brush.  Uncomfortable to hold due to the rough edges.  Given the cost of the brush, I expected substantially greater quality.</li>
    <li> A great little hand bag sized brush.</li>
    <li> This was not the product I thought I was ordering.  The bristles do not go through my hair like the last isinis brush that I had. I was disappointed that this was not what I thought I was ordering.  I am glad I just ordered 1 because I needed more but this was the wrong product.</li>
    <li> This brush is too small.  I thought when I ordered it, it was the large size I have always used.  I tried to return it and because I I had opened the package they would not allow it.  I could not know what was in the package if I hadn&#x27;t opened it.  Even tho I had not used it the lady was very obnoxious to me that they would not let me return for a larger size.</li>
    <li> It is small but I have a small hand so the size is just right for me.  I believe it is 100% boar bristle.  Some of the bristles have squared off ends and some have a natural taper, but when the brush is washed in hot water all the bristles become much softer, so I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re all the same substance.  This is a scratchy brush capable of brushing my thinner hair down to the scalp, if anything it&#x27;s a little too stiff, but it seems to do the job of redistributing oil nicely.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than expected but great product. Not quite mason Pearson but a good solid brush which is also beautiful to look at.</li>
    <li> My husband has had a boar bristle brush for so many years that it was falling apart. I was shocked to see how expensive the brand her had was now-so I tried this one. Not wooden handle-but the bristles are boar and the bed is just the same-so you can use them for a good vigorous brushing without pressing them into your head.--they did a good job with this brush.</li>
    <li> Love these Hairbrushes.  They are well worth the money.  Have used them for years, and needed new ones after about 15 years of using the old ones.  Bought two for my granddaughters also, and they love them.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand of brushes since the 1970&#x27;s.  Great brush</li>
    <li> This brush arrived with 1 tuft of bristles missing (I can see a hole where the tuft should be). I don&#x27;t think it makes a difference in how it brushes through my hair, so it&#x27;s not worth the trouble of exchanging it. That said, I love this brush; it makes my scalp feel fantastic, and my hair looks thicker and shinier. I have very thin, fine hair, and I&#x27;ve read that a boar bristle brush is the best  for this type of hair.</li>
    <li> The other review I read indicated that the brush was too small to be effective but because I have fine textured hair I ordered it anyway.  It works perfect for me, I have fine textured, thick, shoulder length hair and this little brush gives me the same scalp massage and oil distribution that my large size Isinis does. I bought it to carry in my purse and the small size and weight make it just right for that.  I gave it 5 stars because it is perfect for fine or thin hair. If you have coarse textured or very thick hair it might be too small to effectively brush your hair.  Also, I switched from my usual Mason Pearson brushes to the Isinis because  another reviewer said they were just as good for much less money.  This is true, these are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my thin hair.</li>
