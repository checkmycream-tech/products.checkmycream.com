      <li>It is a great find!!!</li>
      <li>Wonderful.</li>
      <li>Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Tried a lot of products over the years and this is what works best for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to wait 5 minutes after washing before applying the serum.</li>
      <li>great product !</li>
      <li>excellent.</li>
      <li>AMAZING!!</li>
      <li>Great product, and cheaper than what you pay at a retail store.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even explain how great it is.</li>
      <li>Great product for Rosacea.</li>
      <li>She is now happy with it.</li>
      <li>They are pleasant and non-irritating, but didn&#x27;t do a thing to ameliorate the roseacea.</li>
      <li>She said this will do my skin some good.</li>
      <li>Good product just not for me.</li>
      <li>Truly amazing.</li>
      <li>I just mix both products on my hand and they blend nicely, as they are both gel based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is very easy on it.</li>
      <li>Very easy to order and saved A LOT of money by purchasing this product through amazon.com as opposed to buying it someplace else.  </li>
      <li>love all of murad products</li>
      <li>I love this product.   </li>
      <li>Not too sure about effectiveness for the redness.   </li>
      <li>One of my favorite products of all time.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried it before I bought it, but heard it was a reputable brand.</li>
      <li>just make sure you do have moisturizing lotion to go over it, or you won&#x27;t achieve the &amp;#34;full effect&amp;#34; of healthy skin.</li>
      <li>and at night, after cleansing and toning, I massage about two squirts of the serum into my face, concentrating more product on areas with redness.</li>
      <li>I love, love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Either way, I am mostly satisfied with this product and this was the cheapest price I found for it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d already tried the most moisturizing stuff I know of (Eucerin Cream)</li>
      <li>and this calms any redness and gives my skin a lovely glow.</li>
      <li>This is the first serum I have ever really been impressed with.</li>
      <li>More smooth, plumper and more even toned.  </li>
      <li>It is excellent for moisturizing skin especially if you have to use oil free products.</li>
      <li>smooth, healthy</li>
      <li>very nice serum for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The pump did not work, however I can use it fine without the pump and there are no problems.</li>
      <li>My skin looked better after the first night!  </li>
      <li>I started using this &amp; it has made a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Smooth to put on</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this.</li>
      <li>I asked if she thought I should switch to the line that is specifically for users with sensitive skin and surprisingly</li>
      <li>But this is great for those with true redness issues not just a red tint to your skin.</li>
      <li>I am surprised more people don&#x27;t know about it!  </li>
      <li>Love this serum and the whole Murad line.  </li>
      <li>&amp; my skin looks really good especially for all the abuse I put it through.  </li>
      <li>I read where it is also great for rosacea and other skin conditions.</li>
      <li>I wear it after a toner and before my moisturizer to help my skin from drying out and getting irritated so quickly.   </li>
      <li>It also helps to calm the redness.</li>
      <li>I just figured it would calm my irritated skin</li>
      <li>Silky smooth &amp; very hydrating.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s glowing, calm and hydrated - without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it worth money we gave.</li>
      <li>she was SO right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed and excited to have already seen results, as it has only been a week, and it seems like the bottle will last me a long time.</li>
      <li>Did nothing for my skin but make it more red then it has ever been.</li>
      <li>When I blush or exercise, I turn even more red, and people have told me I look like a tomato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to using my Emu or Avocado oil and layering Aquaphor&#x27;s healing treatment over, which I find to be much more soothing and calming to my skin.</li>
      <li>So much cheaper here then at the salon!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different serum&#x27;s due to problematic adult acne and this works great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I grew up in AZ and spent all my time in the sun, lifeguarded, &amp; on top of all that, flew for an airline, which really dries out your skin.</li>
      <li>I  was really worried about what my skin was going to look like in a couple of years.  </li>
      <li>however I will be more careful where I purchase it from.</li>
      <li>I really like the hydration this product gives my face.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>, she said she thought all I would really need to do is purchase this product to help with the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have surface acne that is very stubborn and while this doesn&#x27;t get rid of my acne</li>
      <li>I read review after review by dermatologists and everyone else that said this stuff clears up any kind of skin trouble you may be having</li>
      <li>and she said that I most likely have really sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>By the way, the price is fantastic &amp; it lasts a long time!  </li>
      <li>but it may older packaging.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I like this product, but the price is kinda high.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend trying the Murad line.</li>
      <li>(I live in Chicago and it is COLD here in the winter), but would also make my moisturizers more effective.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard Murad sold out several years back and the new management changed many ingredients to cut costs, thus reducing quality.</li>
      <li>This soothing serum was recommended to try with other &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; products that tend to be too strong used alone.  </li>
      <li>This product in particular is new to me.</li>
      <li>About 14 years ago, my sister-in-law from California (who lived at the beach &amp; spent a lot of time in the sun) came to visit me &amp; her skin looked fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I live in the desert and at 50+ yrs.</li>
      <li>I initially thought I&#x27;d have to stop using the whole line but was hesitant to do so because it did work really well.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It does seem to work quite well, especially when used with the cleaner first.</li>
      <li>old, I am trying really hard to keep my skin healthy.   </li>
      <li>I have used the sensitive skin soothing serum for about six months.  </li>
      <li>It seems to help with facial dryness very well and does have a soothing effect.</li>
      <li>My skin was dehydrated with some fine lines and just dull.</li>
      <li>Not the right product for my sensitive, pale skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, but a little sticky after applying, so I like to wait a few minutes for it to absorb into my skin before I add Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge on top.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and this is one of the only products that not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but also soothes preexisting irritation, and protects against further sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that since I&#x27;ve started using it, my natural skin is EXTREMELY dry.</li>
      <li>The serum really does moisturize well, but can sometimes leave a little bit of a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling until it dries.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was not completely happy with this.  I just figured it would calm my irritated skin but it didn&#x27;t as well as I figured it would.</li>
    <li> About 14 years ago, my sister-in-law from California (who lived at the beach &amp; spent a lot of time in the sun) came to visit me &amp; her skin looked fabulous.  I noticed a big difference and asked her what she was using.  It was Murad &amp; this is one of the products (it was under a different name then).    I grew up in AZ and spent all my time in the sun, lifeguarded, &amp; on top of all that, flew for an airline, which really dries out your skin. I  was really worried about what my skin was going to look like in a couple of years.  I started using this &amp; it has made a huge difference.  Fourteen years later &amp; my skin looks really good especially for all the abuse I put it through.  I attribute it to the Soothing  Serum.  It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy.  It feels like it locks the moisture in.  I am surprised more people don&#x27;t know about it!  But, hey, it&#x27;s my little secret!  By the way, the price is fantastic &amp; it lasts a long time!  You just need one pump squirt (that&#x27;s about the size of two drops).</li>
    <li> Great product, and cheaper than what you pay at a retail store.</li>
    <li> I have surface acne that is very stubborn and while this doesn&#x27;t get rid of my acne it calms my skin down and removes the redness as well as reduces the obvious bumps. I have very sensitive skin and this is very easy on it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.   I wear it after a toner and before my moisturizer to help my skin from drying out and getting irritated so quickly.   I was a little disappointed in my recent purchase as the packaging was different.   It seemed to be the same product but it may older packaging.  I will continue to use it however I will be more careful where I purchase it from.</li>
    <li> Murad is the only product that I like to use on my skin. I live in the desert and at 50+ yrs. old, I am trying really hard to keep my skin healthy.   This product in particular is new to me. I have been using it for about a month now. It seems to help with facial dryness very well and does have a soothing effect. Not too sure about effectiveness for the redness.   A bit pricey, but lasts a long time. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different serum&#x27;s due to problematic adult acne and this works great for my sensitive skin.  I apply post shaving and it also helps combat razor burn and ingrown hairs around the beard/neck line.  I don&#x27;t use any other Murad products except this one, I mix and match other products like Cetaphil cleanser and Lab Series Oil Control Daily Hydrator.  I&#x27;ve heard Murad sold out several years back and the new management changed many ingredients to cut costs, thus reducing quality.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Ever! I only wish it had SPF. Definitely for your night routine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!!  I went for a facial and the aesthetician recommended this serum.  She said that not only would it help my redness in the cheeks (I live in Chicago and it is COLD here in the winter), but would also make my moisturizers more effective.  She was correct on both accounts.  My skin looked better after the first night!  More smooth, plumper and more even toned.  She told me to use it under my moisturizer night and day during the winter and only at night in the summer.  It is a great find!!!</li>
    <li> I received the Serum on the day it was supposed to arrive,  I have used the product twice and it leaves the skin feeling supple and hydrated.  It also helps to calm the redness.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and struggle with skin care products.  This soothing serum was recommended to try with other &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; products that tend to be too strong used alone.  It works!  I use this as a base layer and then able to use other wrinkle fighting cremes without irritation!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried it before I bought it, but heard it was a reputable brand. The serum really does moisturize well, but can sometimes leave a little bit of a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling until it dries. However, I&#x27;ve never used serum before so that could be with any product (I wouldn&#x27;t know). Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that since I&#x27;ve started using it, my natural skin is EXTREMELY dry. Not sure if that&#x27;s just due to the winter months or because it is used to the extra moisture now. Either way, I am mostly satisfied with this product and this was the cheapest price I found for it. just make sure you do have moisturizing lotion to go over it, or you won&#x27;t achieve the &amp;#34;full effect&amp;#34; of healthy skin.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin but make it more red then it has ever been. I looked like I had a bad sunburn for about a week after stopping this product. Not the right product for my sensitive, pale skin.</li>
    <li> Love this serum and the whole Murad line.  Since I am turning 50 this year, I do use the Resurgence, Age Reform and the Environmental C line.  Tried a lot of products over the years and this is what works best for me.  Highly recommend trying the Murad line.</li>
    <li> very nice serum for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Silky smooth &amp; very hydrating.</li>
    <li> Another recommended by a facialist . She said this will do my skin some good. And after wash my face and apply moisturiser on. My skin gets very red. And this helps with that.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that helps deal with my dry skin patches.  So much cheaper here then at the salon!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product for Rosacea. I use this every night. Smooth to put on and then I use a moisterizer. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Very easy to order and saved A LOT of money by purchasing this product through amazon.com as opposed to buying it someplace else.  I have used the sensitive skin soothing serum for about six months.  Within a week of using it, my redness was gone.  The good part about ordering online is I ordered what I needed and did not get side tracked into buying other items I wanted, but did not need (stores can be dangerous to the wallet).</li>
    <li> love all of murad products</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife. She tried other products before Murad. She is now happy with it. it worth money we gave.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products of all time. Does what it says, lasts forever, so don&#x27;t fret the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin&#x27;s redness from this product. I have slightly red/pink areas on my cheeks (nothing severe) and it didn&#x27;t change anything. I&#x27;ve gone back to using my Emu or Avocado oil and layering Aquaphor&#x27;s healing treatment over, which I find to be much more soothing and calming to my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using murad products for almost 2 years haven&#x27;t come across any of the products that I don&#x27;t like. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> The murad products were recommended to me for my non-cystic roseacea.  They are pleasant and non-irritating, but didn&#x27;t do a thing to ameliorate the roseacea.</li>
    <li> excellent. great product !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is excellent for moisturizing skin especially if you have to use oil free products.</li>
    <li> I started using the Murad Acne Treatment Set (purchased here *http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JKEB38/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1* on Amazon for MUCH less than on the Murad website although it is an older version) a few weeks ago and while it did clear it up SUPER fast (the spot treatment is seriously nothing short of miraculous), it also dried my skin out to the point of flaking and peeling. I initially thought I&#x27;d have to stop using the whole line but was hesitant to do so because it did work really well. I ended up going to the Murad website and chatting with one of their reps and she said that I most likely have really sensitive skin. I asked if she thought I should switch to the line that is specifically for users with sensitive skin and surprisingly, she said she thought all I would really need to do is purchase this product to help with the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you... she was SO right. I read review after review by dermatologists and everyone else that said this stuff clears up any kind of skin trouble you may be having and I was skeptical for sure. I&#x27;d already tried the most moisturizing stuff I know of (Eucerin Cream) and it couldn&#x27;t even touch the scales on my face. I put this on the night I got it and literally woke up with smooth, healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever skincare regimen you use, if you ever experience dryness/redness at all, this is the stuff for you. I read where it is also great for rosacea and other skin conditions. Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this. Gets rid of skin issues with no oil residue or greasy feelings afterward. AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Too string for me.... it made my face red and itching.</li>
    <li> Good product just not for me. I chose it after a worker at ulta recommended it because my skin looked red, but I don&#x27;t have rosacea I have a red tone to my skin. After a few weeks I switched to the murad resurgence line. But this is great for those with true redness issues not just a red tint to your skin.</li>
    <li> Truly amazing. I have redness on my cheeks and nose due to sun damage and broken capillaries under the skin, and it can be unattractive and embarrassing. When I blush or exercise, I turn even more red, and people have told me I look like a tomato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore! I started using this product about a week ago and I&#x27;ve already seen results. It&#x27;s gradually diminishing my redness and evening my skin tone. My skin is sensitive and this is one of the only products that not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but also soothes preexisting irritation, and protects against further sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning and at night, after cleansing and toning, I massage about two squirts of the serum into my face, concentrating more product on areas with redness. This stuff is hydrating, but I need some extra moisture afterwards. It&#x27;s lightweight, but a little sticky after applying, so I like to wait a few minutes for it to absorb into my skin before I add Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge on top. If I&#x27;m in a pinch I just mix both products on my hand and they blend nicely, as they are both gel based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed and excited to have already seen results, as it has only been a week, and it seems like the bottle will last me a long time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was concerned due to there being a black line drawn across the package, hoping this did not mean it was expired.  The pump did not work, however I can use it fine without the pump and there are no problems.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but the price is kinda high. It does seem to work quite well, especially when used with the cleaner first. It&#x27;s best to wait 5 minutes after washing before applying the serum.</li>
    <li> I love, love this stuff. I use it every day after cleansing my face and before putting on moisturizer. I can&#x27;t even explain how great it is. I have super sensitive skin and this calms any redness and gives my skin a lovely glow.</li>
    <li> I really like the hydration this product gives my face. I like that a little goes a long way. I have reordered this product.</li>
    <li> It did calm the burning but unfortunately did take away the redness</li>
    <li> This is the first serum I have ever really been impressed with. My skin was dehydrated with some fine lines and just dull. Also, semi irritated and acne prone. This serum has given life back to my skin! It&#x27;s glowing, calm and hydrated - without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks murad but geez it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
