      <li>Probably best as a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent cream, and not something to pass</li>
      <li>With a score of 3 from the EWG and excellent moisturizing and protective qualities my normal/combination skin couldn&#x27;t be happier.couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
      <li>Brand- the face cream is excellent.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is a wonderful thing for me.  </li>
      <li>Feels amazing on my face !!!</li>
      <li>but this one I can say is the best daytime moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality.</li>
      <li>Avalon ruined this wonderful product when they made it &amp;#34;more sustainable&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>For me, it is best used in the morning as it isn&#x27;t incredibly moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin</li>
      <li>good luck !</li>
      <li>Great smell and sunscreen protection.</li>
      <li>I think it smells great</li>
      <li>This is a great &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>Jojoba oil is great for all skin types including oily skin as it balances out the amount of sebum production in the oil glands.  </li>
      <li>But until then, this product does a great job.</li>
      <li>Very nice.  </li>
      <li>I buy it again and again because it is very effective at protecting and moisturizing ,</li>
      <li>The scent is a very nice light/creamy citrus.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell was pleasant, just like the Renewal Cream.</li>
      <li>Have always loved this product.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s good too because sometimes a lot comes out at once</li>
      <li>He loved this product he used 3 bottles already n</li>
      <li>I feel good about using organic products on my face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the type of person who if I don&#x27;t like a product I stop using it probably before I&#x27;ve even given it a fair chance to work.</li>
      <li>If I was Queen Elizabeth I, I would have loved this stuff as a moisturizer/white pock mark concealer.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves my skin feeling moisturized very nicely, like I said not greasy and also nicely moisturized and not just like a layer of product sitting on my skin-</li>
      <li>I have been using the Avalon Organics Vitamin S Lotion SPF 15 for more than a year and been quite happy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;With that out of the way, let me say I&#x27;m glad I tried this!</li>
      <li>I thought I would love it!</li>
      <li>Another great thing I like is that it is easy to wash off.</li>
      <li>It works wonders for my skin and it smells amazing as well.</li>
      <li>Its an amazing product.</li>
      <li>Smells AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s customer service is amazing &amp; I will continue to shop with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I doubt I will get any kind of answer.</li>
      <li>and I was absolutely thrilled with the results.  </li>
      <li>really nicely.</li>
      <li>I liked that this had sunscreen</li>
      <li>I liked this when it was thicker</li>
      <li>I think it is really effective.  </li>
      <li>I think it diminishes freckles and it smells nice.  </li>
      <li>I tried and really liked the night cream.</li>
      <li>Yes , it is if you dont take time to apply to you face nicely.</li>
      <li>This is a nice lotion.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, blends right in, has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So to summarize, Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Moisture Plus SPF 15 (new formula) is the best \\&quot;green\\&quot; moisturizing sunblock I have found at this price point.</li>
      <li>Need VERY strong hands, therefore, not using it &amp; will probably toss it.&lt;br /&gt;CJ</li>
      <li>These truly offer broad-spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB rays; they are much more effective than the chemical agents for protecting your face from harmful UV rays.  </li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;d be nice to get the perfect product, moisturizing, sheer, chemical-free protection from the sun, sometimes you can&#x27;t have it all!</li>
      <li>The new rating from EWG&#x27;s sunscreen guide for this formulation is a 3; very good:</li>
      <li>Just love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I love using this.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s more like a toner).  </li>
      <li>I chose this moisturizer based on a magazine review as a top product with Vitamin C.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that this is one of the safer sunscreens out there.</li>
      <li>I found that it blends better.</li>
      <li>more sustainable formula&amp;#34</li>
      <li>and I got two more.</li>
      <li>My favorite face lotion.</li>
      <li>It is safe, which is the top priority for my family.</li>
      <li>I started with the Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Creme and loved its fresh scent and hydrating properties,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Not the best facial product.</li>
      <li>I love the toner and lotion.</li>
      <li>I also needed to make sure to shake the bottle before use</li>
      <li>Love the organic, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
      <li>The orange scent is ok.</li>
      <li>it does not even squeeze out of the dispenser top.  </li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>I use this moisturizer and I love it.</li>
      <li>When I saw this, I bought it even though I figured it would make me break out, because most face lotions do.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>After a while I felt some stinging which went away, my face felt sticky as if I just applied cheap liquid foundation on!</li>
      <li>I used to love it, now it&#x27;s like using elmers glue on my face.  </li>
      <li>Now I am in love.  </li>
      <li>Having said all this, I do still use Olay night moisturizer because I didn&#x27;t love the Avalon Organics one I tried.  </li>
      <li>I like to add a drop or two of jojoba oil to make the product a bit thinner and more moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I love that it does not leave my face oily.</li>
      <li>did bye the Avalon Vit C at a local store &amp; the product is excellent &amp; glides on easy.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy cosmetic type products online unless you&#x27;ve tried them first or they have a good return policy.</li>
      <li>I had been happy with the olay but just decided to try something new that time.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s probably best in dry weather.</li>
      <li>Plus, because it is a more affordable moisturizer I feel more comfortable putting on my hands, neck, and</li>
      <li>Her face looked so smooth, I love this and would recommend it to everyone</li>
      <li>The original one with out the sunscreen is sooooo much better.</li>
      <li>and it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking bright and healthy.</li>
      <li>I am still trying to find something that will absorb into the skin easily and is harmless.</li>
      <li>When I first applied it , it smelled amazing and went on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Cream and use it as night cream.</li>
      <li>I use it as a light sunscreen</li>
      <li>So...I ditched my tinted moisturizer and started using a light, oil-free foundation instead.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and works</li>
      <li>I never felt smooth and supple skin.  </li>
      <li>and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;m happy to be putting on.</li>
      <li>I have medium to light olive skin and never have a problem with ashiness using this method with this product.</li>
      <li>This is wonderfuly light on my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great smell and sunscreen protection. I use it along with origins lotion as this sunscreen is so thick. I use a very small amount. Goes on quite easily although a bit white-ish but absorbed quickly. I store it upside down so it comes out easier. I only use it in the daytime and don&#x27;t use any foundation makeup.</li>
    <li> Pleased with and have been using it for a few years now. I add a few drops of tea tree oil to effect.</li>
    <li> as ordered and works well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the worse product I have ever bought from Amazon !!! It&#x27;s dried liquid inside and leaves white spot after applying on face. Also its giving etching after some time (i never had issue with any moisturizer before) :( wastage of money !!!</li>
    <li> Its an amazing product. I love using this. My father also used this and let me tell you it removed  all the fracles  and blemishes from my father&#x27;s face. He loved this product he used 3 bottles already n he wants to use as his daily moisturizer.😊</li>
    <li> Everyone should use a moisturizing lotion with SPF on their face and neck! This is wonderfuly light on my skin. Makeup applies well over this. The scent is a very nice light/creamy citrus. I feel good about using organic products on my face. I&#x27;m tired of all the synthetic stuff out there!</li>
    <li> Contrary to many of the other reviews I actually liked this! Being a person who doesn&#x27;t purchase products made with chemical sunscreens, I have tried a bunch of streaky stuff! Yes, while this does not go on completely transparent like some of the chemical blocks, it didn&#x27;t make me look like a ghost and I have olive skin! I liked the fact that it contains antioxidants and the price is not as ridiculous as some of the higher end skin care. If you&#x27;re looking for a physical block that goes on completely clear and are willing to spend a bit more try Replenix Sheer Physical Sunscreen, it&#x27;s not made to be moisturizing but it has some powerful antioxidants. If you want something with a lower SPF (since Replenix is 50+) I would recommend doing some research although this is not half as bad! I did experience some issues with layering so get it all on before it dries. Eventhough this is supposed to be a lotion, it&#x27;s better if you put something dewy on your face first (try 100% argan oil or facial moisturizer) just remember to let it set first. I found that it blends better. Although it&#x27;d be nice to get the perfect product, moisturizing, sheer, chemical-free protection from the sun, sometimes you can&#x27;t have it all!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that this so call \\&quot;organic\\&quot; healthier cream still contains paraben ( propylparaben) it has been shown to cause breast cancer! many \\&quot;health\\&quot; products clearly states on \\&quot;paraben free\\&quot;.  Disapointing</li>
    <li> I really liked the old formula for this product but the new one it is not as good. It is thick and leaves a white film on your face.</li>
    <li> The orange scent is much too strong. Goes on a little chalky.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because a friend recommended it to me ,and being a fan of organic products I thought I would love it! But after a couple times of using it I noticed my face feeling a little irritated like a burning sensation but nothing to painful, so I researched more about the product and found that they had added some harmful ingredients that can being very irritating to the skin and very bad for skin as well. I have to say the only thing I liked about it was the citrus smell. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have a sensitive skin type. good luck !</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. For me, it is best used in the morning as it isn&#x27;t incredibly moisturizing. I like that though because it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. I also appreciate the sun protection it offers.</li>
    <li> i was disappointed with the quality of this moisturizer.  After putting it on my face - it felt dry and left white streaks (almost like a sunscreen would).  I would not buy it again.  the only thing i did like about it was the citrus smell.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is a wonderful thing for me.  It starts my day with a fresh orange scent-real orange oil gives it a fresh peeled orange scent. After application, the orange scent fades quickly but the dewy softness of my skin remains.  After a couple of weeks I can see an improvement in my skin. Living in the South where the sun can be viciously hot and dangerous, I need a moisturizer with UV protection.  The product has SPF 15 to protect me from the ravages of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a smile on your face and improve YOUR face value with Vitamin C Moisture Plus Lotion with SPF 15 from Avalon Organics.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic face cream that also had spf 15.  When I saw this, I bought it even though I figured it would make me break out, because most face lotions do.  I decided to give it a chance anyway.  The cream is a little heavier than most, and my skin is oily, so this was also a red flag for me.  But I was wrong!  The cream absorbs quickly and is moisturizing, yet does not make me break out.  In fact, I believe that it has helped clear my skin.  This is an excellent cream, and not something to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular seller is Mother Nature, shipping is free after $25, so I enjoy buying from this seller.  Other products that I use with this lotion is:  Dessert Essence face wash, Nelson&#x27;s acne gel and Home Health Acne lotion (it&#x27;s more like a toner).  You can get them all from Mother Nature.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for years, they just changed it and you can see the word NEW on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is so white and the texture is so thick now that you will feel like you are spreading white glue on your face and you look like a clown with white face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company but did not get any response. They also changed the formula of their serum and it is really bad, in fact you can check other review about their NEW line and figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed as I really like the product the way it used to be and now will need to find something else.</li>
    <li> Avalon did not blend well into my skin .......  I have dry skin but i felt it was too greasy for me</li>
    <li> A bit thick, so need to make sure it is all rubbed in, but otherwise I am very satisfied and will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> This is a thick and creamy, lightly orange scented cream for face, neck or hands.  Very nice.  Update...had to stop using this on my face. It makes my eyes burn and my sinuses close off.  I&#x27;ll try it on my hands.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift on my wish list bc I tried and really liked the night cream. This facial lotion is THICK like cream cheese. It acted like cream cheese too and did a good job of clogging my pores, giving me terrible acne along my hair line. Big mistake. Will not order it for myself.</li>
    <li> I wanted a light moisturizer with SPF to protect my face on the drive to work. I wear light makeup, so something that would soak in well and not be greasy is necessary. This is NOT that product. I&#x27;ve never used a greasier lotion. Since I wear SPF 30 when I&#x27;m outside for long periods of time, I guess this will get tossed in the trash.</li>
    <li> Too thick to dispense easily and doesn&#x27;t rub in well. No visible results.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, but it&#x27;s gotten hard to find in stores.  It is very thick but it&#x27;s not greasy.  I think it diminishes freckles and it smells nice.  I mix it with my foundation.  This works better for me than those fancy creams that are supposed to soften wrinkles but never really do much except make you greasy.</li>
    <li> I love Avalon Organics, especially the naturally scented orange (Vitamin C) &amp; lavender moisturizers and creams, but I don&#x27;t recall labels claiming they are noncomedogenic (non pore clogging). I occasionally use this spf 15 on my cheeks and have had no resulting break-outs, but the essential oils *especially* citrus, are potential irritants and can also cause photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight). I advise anyone who wants to apply Avalon Organics on their face to do a Patch Test if you have oily or hypersensitive skin, dermatoses, or are prone to acne or pimples.  Otherwise, there is a risk of breaking out or having a reaction, and the safe route is to stick to using Avalon&#x27;s skin care on other areas, like neck, hands, elbows, etc. Also, the reviewer who rated this 1-star is correct that it contains paraben as a preservative, so unfortunately it is not totally organic, just like many similar brands! :-(</li>
    <li> Probably best as a sunscreen. Has a residue.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and so far I like it. Yes it is a bit thick and \\&quot;gluey\\&quot; but the trick is to pat it in gently with your fingertips instead of rubbing.  You should be applying your skin care products like this anyway instead of rubbing which can cause irritation and friction on the skin.  You want to apply the product to the skin and avoid rubbing it back into your hands which defeats the purpose.  I&#x27;m a skin care therapist and I understand the reason they use zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in place of ingredients that are normally found in products with SPF.  They are physical sunscreen ingredients in place of chemical ones.  Yes it does produce a very white thick product but the ingredients are all natural as opposed to chemicals absorbing into the skin.  I like to add a drop or two of jojoba oil to make the product a bit thinner and more moisturizing.  Jojoba oil is great for all skin types including oily skin as it balances out the amount of sebum production in the oil glands.  I would recommend to the company to maybe add this to the product to make it easier on us consumers to use, but otherwise I really like this product!</li>
    <li> This is more like rubbing sunscreen on your face with a little moisturizer added!  Did not moisturize my skin. Not at all what I expected or wanted and will look at a different product line.  Was a waste of my money!</li>
    <li> This lotion is so thick I can barely get it out the bottle. I thought I would use it as a body lotion but you would need at least 30 minutes just to apply it. And it&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought not to mention expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a SPF body lotion.  They Vitamin C in it didn&#x27;t hurt either.  Four oz. isn&#x27;t really large enough to use it as a body lotion so I used it as a daily moisturizer on my face and d&amp;eacute;colletage instead.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.  It is thick and hard to spread.  I usually use a tinted moisturizer over my SPF and the two together was leaving me looking oily.  However, it had a little sting to it, which I liked (but you may not if you have particularly sensitive skin).  So...I ditched my tinted moisturizer and started using a light, oil-free foundation instead.  Now I am in love.  I think it is really effective.  I used to use a Vitamin C serum by Skinceuticals, but it was so expensive I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep buying it.  This makes me feel like I am getting the benefit of Vitamin C, but not spending as much.  Plus, because it is a more affordable moisturizer I feel more comfortable putting on my hands, neck, and anywhere else I feel like it.  That&#x27;s good too because sometimes a lot comes out at once and it&#x27;s hard to rub in so it helps to rub it everywhere.</li>
    <li> I liked that this had sunscreen and it is very thick.  If you use too much though it doesn&#x27;t absorb very good and the white stays a while so I just use less or tab a little other moisturizer on too.  I have been using it on my neck and noticed the lines going away.</li>
    <li> I like the new formula which is creamier and light weight. It still has sheen white cast but not sticky. However the SPF is quite low and the bottle is hard to dispense. I use it as a light sunscreen when Im at home, I dont think it would moisturize enough to replace my daily moisturizer. P/S the last picture is product blended</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer and I love it. It works wonders for my skin and it smells amazing as well.</li>
    <li> I can understand the preference of taking some potentially harmful additive out of the lotion recipe.  But it does not seem this new formula was ever tested by real people, real consumers who currently used the product.  What a mistake, further more the manufacturer surely did not test the formula in the exact bottle for distribution......it does not even squeeze out of the dispenser top.  I had to squeeze the bottle so tightly it cracked.  then on top of this mess had to use the cream in some fashion as I was traveling...so had to wrap it in blastocyst and use a cotton swab to retrieve it from the bottle to use.  Will not ever be buying from this company again.....loss of a 15 year customer for them.  many other organically on the market with same features, price and far better quality now.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Cream and use it as night cream. During the day, I use a moisturizer with SPF and thought this lotion would work-- Nope.  This lotion is incredibly thick, is difficult to rub in, dries white and feels tacky to the touch (like glue). I immediately returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was pleasant, just like the Renewal Cream.</li>
    <li> I have liked other Avalon Organics products that I have purchased in the past, but this one is very disappointing. It&#x27;s not moisturizing at all. In fact, it makes my skin feel even drier. I think that it must be the sunscreen that&#x27;s leaving a chaulky residue/feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it, it just felt goopy and heavy. It never seems to absorb. Instead, it feels like a layer of goop sitting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to preserver with it. In order to do so, I have to water it down or mix it with a moisturizer. That, of course dilutes the SPF, which is the main reason I purchased it in the first place.</li>
    <li> Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Moisture Plus Lotion SPF 15 smells like a cross between citrus and chalk.  I had a hard time squeezing the cream through the bottle&#x27;s pour top since the cream is so thick.  I actually had to take the top off and scoop it out with my fingers.  I also needed to make sure to shake the bottle before use, otherwise, a thin, milky fluid poured out with any attempt in accessing the cream.  Cream is tacky feeling and did not provide me with any visable results. You can not wear this cream, at least I couldn&#x27;t, during the day because it will not absorb regardless of how well you feel you tried to rub it in.  One day, half-way through my work schedule, I caught my reflection in a mirror under fluorescent lighting.  I was devastated.  How long had I been presenting to work looking like a geisha girl, face heavily coated with snow white cream??!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful! What a waste of money...it leaves a thick, white layer on your face and even after rubbing it in as much as possible it leaves your face feeling greasy. I broke out almost immediately and had to throw it in the garbage. That money went right down the drain, grrr.</li>
    <li> I think my skin is especially receptive to vitamin C creams-- I started with the Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Creme and loved its fresh scent and hydrating properties, but without SPF, there&#x27;s not much opportunity to use it. Since switching to this product I&#x27;ve been able to use it much more frequently and the little crow&#x27;s feet starting to show under my eyes are disappearing (age 34). My skin has gotten softer too. I look at least 3 years younger after only a few weeks. Here&#x27;s hoping this lasts! This is a rich cream so it&#x27;s probably best in dry weather.</li>
    <li> I was using other Avalon products for years, but this is the one I love the most. It is safe, which is the top priority for my family. And it surprised me after using about half a bottle that my kids and myself do not tan as much as using other products in spite of a humble SPF 15. While you may want to the health color, but less tan means more sun protection to me. It goes on quite white, but easy to spread and then it looks just normal. Another great thing I like is that it is easy to wash off. I used to develop sunscreens for a big personal care company. This product is my dream. Well, my family went through a bottle and I got two more. If I have new things coming up after that, I will report.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Really helped with my skin.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and I really should wear a face lotion with sunscreen in it everyday, but especially in spring and summer. This is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that is comfortable to wear and that I don&#x27;t have issues with breaking out. It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy at all. The only issues I have comes from having oily skin to boot, but I have literally tried every regular and natural product you can think of and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;m happy to be putting on. I even put it on my eye lids and make up goes on over it really nicely. After you put it on, because of the zinc it may look streaky for a moment, but you just have to give it a minute or two to absorb.</li>
    <li> I liked the previous product formula...not at all the same.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my face feel too much like I am putting sun screen on it, versus a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they still had the old product.</li>
    <li> Why is it every time I find a product that I really like it&#x27;s either discontinued or altered?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Avalon Organics Vitamin C products for a few years now and I was absolutely thrilled with the results.  So much so that I chose it over Avon&#x27;s Anew line, which also works really well on my skin, and it&#x27;s the only thing my son will use on his blackhead prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They might as well have said the original product was discontinued and replaced by this, because they are nowhere near being the same thing.  This so-called renewal lotion is NOT the same product that I originally got hooked on.  The original formula for the facial lotion was fabulous.  It was light, flowed easily, absorbed completely and left my skin feeling smooth and looking refreshed with each application.  It felt like a lightweight, vitamin c based product.  This new formula is garbage.  It&#x27;s thick, white, doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin at all - it sits on top like a thinned out clay mask, it&#x27;s awful!  I feel like I&#x27;m putting paste on my skin instead of a facial lotion.  It makes me angry to have spent so much on something that&#x27;s just sitting in my medicine cabinet waiting to expire.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re face is wet it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Too small, too expensive and misrepresented by Amazon. Please respond to me directly if you are really concerned. I doubt I will get any kind of answer.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lotion.  It&#x27;s difficult to find a moisturizer with sunscreen and natural ingredients that isn&#x27;t really expensive.  I liked this when it was thicker and I like it in the newer thinner version, as long as the sunscreen works.  I buy this regularly for daily wear.</li>
    <li> This lotion is next to impossible to squeeze out of the bottle.  Need VERY strong hands, therefore, not using it &amp; will probably toss it.&lt;br /&gt;CJ</li>
    <li> Because of the reviews here, I was apprehensive about purchasing this moisturizing sunblock. I was in desperate need of sun protection and after looking it up at the Skin Deep site decided to give it a shot. I wanted to play devil&#x27;s advocate here to hopefully help someone unsure of purchasing this as I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t use conventional cosmetics or personal care items at all except for SPF facial products, and a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; ingredient list is the primary deciding factor for my purchase. So, other \\&quot;green\\&quot; type SPF moisturizers are what I am judging Avalon&#x27;s product against. I have very limited experience with \\&quot;conventional\\&quot; products, ie. they may very well have a completely different mouthfeel and other qualities I cannot speak to. In short, my opinion may be a unique one here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, let me say I&#x27;m glad I tried this! To address other reviews regarding the thick consistency of this formulation, I found it to be the same as other \\&quot;green\\&quot; sunblock products with a similar SPF, if not better. The added bonus for me is that this product also moisturizes without feeling overly greasy. The trick with this, as with any similar, product is small dabs blended well. I have medium to light olive skin and never have a problem with ashiness using this method with this product. Also, unlike other moisturizing sunblocks, it will not \\&quot;pill\\&quot; or gum up on your face if you decide you need to add another thin layer, and Avalon absorbs fairly quickly. It also leaves my skin feeling moisturized very nicely, like I said not greasy and also nicely moisturized and not just like a layer of product sitting on my skin- an issue I&#x27;ve had with other products... another bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to summarize, Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Moisture Plus SPF 15 (new formula) is the best \\&quot;green\\&quot; moisturizing sunblock I have found at this price point. With a score of 3 from the EWG and excellent moisturizing and protective qualities my normal/combination skin couldn&#x27;t be happier.couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I like The Avalon Brand- the face cream is excellent. But this cream was a little too thick&amp; it made it difficult to try to get it to come out of the container. I will use it up, but I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years.  I buy it again and again because it is very effective at protecting and moisturizing ,</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on my face !!!</li>
    <li> The lotion goes on a little thick, but perhaps that is because of the SPF 15. Overall, good product and does not cause my skin to break out.</li>
    <li> I have just bought this. Complain about it white ? Yes , it is if you dont take time to apply to you face nicely. But if I put my regular makeup on the top , my face stays fresh all day !! Before my T-zones got shiny and I needed to carry some compact powder to dry off my nose and forehead. Now the problem is gone !!!!!  I am happy with the result, works for me !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who if I don&#x27;t like a product I stop using it probably before I&#x27;ve even given it a fair chance to work. I had been using Olay facial products for a few years prior to buying this Avalon Organics facial moisturizer. I had been happy with the olay but just decided to try something new that time. It was after the very first use of this moisturizer that I knew it was a keeper. It&#x27;s the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have sensitive skin and it has never been at all irritating. My skin felt softer and smoother immediately. I figured that as the day went on I&#x27;d lose that feeling but it remained soft and smooth throughout the day, as it does every single day. I tend to get a little oily on my forehead even with other oil-free products but not with this one. I don&#x27;t want to sound like a commercial but I&#x27;ve even gotten comments on my improved complexion. I&#x27;ve used probably 3 bottles of this since I started. I did try a different Avalon Organics moisturizer in between which I didn&#x27;t like nearly as much. It was &amp;#34;fine.&amp;#34; Not bad at all but not something I would buy again. I think it was the one with the serum in the formula, I&#x27;m not really sure. This product leaves a much smoother feel than that one did.  The formula is definitely thicker than most moisturizers, I guess frm the zinc oxide. But don&#x27;t let that fool you. It dissolves in instantly and leave no residue. You only need to use a tiny drop and it goes a long way. The first few times you use it you&#x27;ll most likely use too much and you&#x27;ll keep taking less and less on your finger until you finally get it right on the 3rd day.  If you use &amp;#34;a little&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll use too much. You really do only need a tiny drop. I actually do have one complaint about the product and that&#x27;s the bottle top.  It should maybe be in a pump or the type of top that has a tiny hole that you squeeze the product through.  This top is the kind that snaps open and closed and I find that the product is too thickto squeeze just a very small amount through. It often comes out in a bigger glob which is too much, so now I sometimes unscrew the lid and just take it directly from the bottle instead of going through the snap closure. Otherwise I give it nothing but high marks and will continue to use this as my daytime moisturizer for as long as they continue to make it.  Having said all this, I do still use Olay night moisturizer because I didn&#x27;t love the Avalon Organics one I tried.  So I can&#x27;t speak for all of Avalon Organics products but this one I can say is the best daytime moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> If I was Queen Elizabeth I, I would have loved this stuff as a moisturizer/white pock mark concealer.  This stuff is laughable.  My husband told me it looked like stage makeup for a clown.  Gross!</li>
    <li> At first it stung a little, but after using for a few days it seemed to have gotten better</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now and can already tell a difference in the look and feel of my skin. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this every day as a moisturizer and sunscreen. I love the smell and I the fact that it has SPF protection. Be careful not to get it into your eyes because it burns like crazy. I like to apply right out of the shower - it seems to go on easier.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years because it was easy to apply makeup over it, but they changed the formula and added Zinc oxide and it is horrible! Does not rub in, leaves the face white, super drying on my skin, and made it very hard to apply makeup over it. I am so sad that the old formula is gone - I wish someone could please help me find a natural face lotion with SPF that was like the old formula....moisturizing and good to apply makeup over. Such a bummer that they changed this product - I can&#x27;t imagine who would want to put this on their face - wore it under my makeup for a day and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it off - just so drying, sticky and awful. I called the company to complain, but they changed it to get the natural NSF rating, which is good in theory, but apparently creates an unusable product that feels terrible on the face. Sigh....</li>
    <li> I try to use products that don&#x27;t contain a lot of junk.  I only use mineral based sunscreen-- so I am used to the way mineral sunscreens work/look.  This is a lot worse that any other mineral sunscreen I have tried.  It has the same whiteish residue you&#x27;d expect, but it dries super fast and in a way that makes you feel like your skin is being dried out.  I would not recommend or buy again.  It did not meet me needs/expectations.  The orange scent is ok.</li>
    <li> i brought this product thinking it will be more cream base and easily absorbed in your skin. Instead, it has your face or hand  white  with this film tinged on your skin, it don&#x27;t absorbed at all. i probably look like a clown with that on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would not recommended this product to anyone at all.. just wasted my money buying this.</li>
    <li> For my skin this stuff just wrecked havoc, my skin is considered combination to oily, so while I&#x27;m not oozing grease i have to replenish my skin just enough. If that wasn&#x27;t enough i also seem to be allergic to half the crap i try stuff like jojoba and borage seed oil broke me out like nobody&#x27;s business so if you have combo oily and temperamental skin this may not be for you</li>
    <li> Wow, this is very smooth and I think my nails are growing because I use it on my hands to get rid of brown spots.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all. They must have changed their formula. It&#x27;s almost pasty. Doesn&#x27;t absorb at all. :(</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Meet my expectations. Affordable price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, blends right in, has a nice light scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a friend of mine&#x27;s face.  Her face looked so smooth, I love this and would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> I was looking for an spf face lotion for everyday and this one is just too thick for daily.  I was going to use it at the beach but being that its only an spf of 15 it won&#x27;t work for that either.  Since I can&#x27;t return it I guess I&#x27;ll chalk it up as a lesson learned.  Don&#x27;t buy cosmetic type products online unless you&#x27;ve tried them first or they have a good return policy.</li>
    <li> The bottle developed a huge crack within a couple months. I did not drop it or mishandle it in any way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Not the best facial product. It is very thick so I ended up using it only for my hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, usually ordering through Amazon, so I didn&#x27;t even look twice before adding it to my cart and buying it recently. The packaging looked different when it arrived, and the product itself is TOTALLY different (see other reviews below for more detail on change in ingredients). It now goes on very thick, very white... much more like a sunscreen you&#x27;d use for a day at the beach than for an everyday moisturizer that happens to have SPF-15 to keep you covered in your few non-office-bound minutes of your day. It&#x27;s also very hard to apply... feels glue-y going on, and is very hard to rub in to get rid of the white residue. I&#x27;ll be returning this product and starting the annoying search for another product to keep loyal to. Any suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that I&#x27;ve been using this brand&#x27;s night wrinkle-defense COQ10 moisturizer for ages as well, and they also changed the ingredients and packaging for that product. So far I am less irritated by change in ingredients on that one than I am by the change to the pumping mechanism, which now barely works, but that&#x27;s a review for another page...</li>
    <li> This is not the same, do not buy!</li>
    <li> My favorite face lotion. Smells AMAZING.</li>
    <li> My wife and I had been using this SPF 15 face moisturizer for years.  It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avalon changed the formula to rely heavily on zinc and titanium oxides.  Now it&#x27;s white and pasty and smells so metallic I thought something was wrong with the air conditioning in my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife wants me to keep using it so we can finish the bottle but I&#x27;m just going to make her send it back.  And then I will spend months trying to find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;Old ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients: Octylmethoxycinnamate, Benzophenone 3, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C) (stabilized vitamin C)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Floral Water (lavandula officinalis), Chamomilla (Anthemis Nobilis) Extract (Certified Organic) (chamomilla recutita), Green Tea (camellia sinensis), Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis), Vegetable Glycerin, Octyl Palmitate, Glyceryl Stearate, Plant Oils of Sunflower, Borage Seed (Certified Organic) (helianthus annuus and borago officinalis), Cocoa Butter (theobroma cacao), Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E) (vitamin E), Methyl, Propylparaben, Pure Essential Oils&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;New ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide 7.5% (sunscreen), Titanium Dioxide 2.0% (sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice(1), Aqua (Water), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil(1), Glyceryl Stearate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil(1), Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglycerol-10 Laurate, Cetearyl Olivate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Sorbitan Olivate, Arnica Montana Flower Extract(1), Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract(1), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(1), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract (1), Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract *, Laminaria Digitata Extract(1), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract(1), Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract(1), Borago Officinalis Seed Oil(1), Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oi(1), Rosa Canina Fruit Oil(1), Ascorbic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Alcohol(1), Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citral, Limonene, Linaloolgamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oi(1), Rosa Canina Fruit Oil(1), Ascorbic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Alcohol(1), Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citral, Limonene, Linalool</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not smooth going on at all. The original one with out the sunscreen is sooooo much better. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers have said, this new formula is absolutely horrible! I have very sensitive facial skin and have been using this product for many years as this was the only moisturizer that would help. Now this \\&quot;New More Sustainable\\&quot; formula is chalky, rough and does anything but moisturize your skin. If you like feeling like you have a layer of mud on your face all day then this is the product for you, otherwise steer clear until Avalon Organics gets the point and re-releases the old formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Avalon Organics website and filed a complaint about the new formula and am still awaiting a reply. Maybe if they hear it from enough people and their sales decline enough they will go back to the way the product was before.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a white film/residue on my face so basically I can&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;m African American so if you have lighter skin it may not be an issue.</li>
    <li> I chose this moisturizer based on a magazine review as a top product with Vitamin C.  I received this product last week.  With daily use, my skin has not broken out or shown other signs of irritation.  The physical block sunscreens in this product leave my skin with a drier, matte finish versus a glossy, oily look.  I really like the orange scent when I apply it in the morning.  The scent is refreshing and energizing for first thing in the morning.</li>
    <li> Loved the product minus the sunscreen. Very thick and dry feeling. Have previously used avalon organics face cream with vit c and loved it. Would never buy the one with the suncreen again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days but I have to say I really like it so far. Unlike the other reviewers, I have had no problem with the texture of this product. Yeah, it&#x27;s thick. Yeah, you have to rub it in for a few extra seconds. So what? I think it smells great and it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking bright and healthy.</li>
    <li> I really wish I&#x27;d read about the change in formula of the vit C spf lotion before I bought this again.  I used to love it, now it&#x27;s like using elmers glue on my face.  It never rubs in, just gets dry.  And it is WHITE!  White along my eyebrows, white in my pores, white in my fingerprints!!  My face feels like there is a sticky residue I can&#x27;t get rid of, there&#x27;s white crud on my skin, and keep rubbing after it dries out on the skin and \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; crumbles off.  What in the world??  Who sent this formula out to be sold???  This is not just worse, it cannot be used.  I had to wash my face and my hairline to even be seen in public.  And scrub my hands, which literally had white dried out \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in my fingerprints.  I&#x27;ve never bought such a complete disaster.</li>
    <li> not what I thought I was getting.  For my face, it leaves a very obvious thick layer of sunscreen. So I cut back on the amount and just use a tiny bit. Use it only as a sunscreen, doesn&#x27;t really work as a moisturizer for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this product from walmart on sale for $7. I&#x27;ve always wanted a vitamin c lotion/moisturizer. When I first applied it , it smelled amazing and went on smoothly. After a while I felt some stinging which went away, my face felt sticky as if I just applied cheap liquid foundation on! Then I decided to look in the mirror and it looked like I applied a white mask on! It you don&#x27;t believe me take a picture of yourself with the flash on! Glad I got this on sale and didn&#x27;t pay full price. I guess I&#x27;ll be using it only at night. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I used to like this product, but they seem to have reformulated it. Why they would change a smooth, easily absorbed lotion into something with a thick and gloppy texture, so heavy that it leaves a white film, I don&#x27;t understand.  As another reviewer mentioned, they do not care--I called their customer line, and the person said,&amp;#34;We changed it a year ago--thanks for calling.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No apology or anything--well, they have definitely lost a customer!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and this product made my face very greasy after a few hours of applying it. I&#x27;m glad I tried it, but I would not recommend it to someone who has very oily skin.</li>
    <li> Avalon ruined this wonderful product when they made it &amp;#34;more sustainable&amp;#34;.  Complaints are rampant and warranted.  Don&#x27;t waste your money - it&#x27;s chalky and gross.  Shame on you Avalon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it religiously but it seems to have gotten very chalky and takes ages to absorb into my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this after we moved to the desert. The other reviewers warned the formula has changed. I should have listened. I love the toner and lotion. This Renewal moisture left my face feeling sucked dry and tight. It leaves a super sticky white residue on my face that coats those little face hairs in white. Later it feels like my face is super dry and makes my eyebrows and other parts of my face sweat.</li>
    <li> Turns your face white!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is awful. It goes into your skin quickly, but as soon as it does it feels chalky and dry.  I never felt moisturized.  I never felt smooth and supple skin.  I used it a week and tossed it in the trash!  It&#x27;s probably the worst moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> the photo in order was not for the &amp;#34;new more sustainable formula&amp;#34;  i was very careful to check for that.  i can get this formula anywhere for no shipping cost.  now i am stuck with it  because shipping the return is not worth it.  the new formula has too much zinc so it does not absorb into skin.</li>
    <li> Not very smooth &amp; hard to get rubbed in.  I wear foundation over &amp; does not go on very well.  Love the organic, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is one of the safer sunscreens out there. I am a fan of the avalon vitamin c lotions. We are dark skinned and the zinc oxide in this does apply &#x27;white&#x27; coverage on our skin. I am still trying to find something that will absorb into the skin easily and is harmless. But until then, this product does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  The previous formulation used ineffective, chemical sunscreen agents for the SPF.  The previous rating by EWG&#x27;s sunscreen guide has been removed, but I believe it was a 6 or 7.  The UVA protection offered by oxybenzone is very poor.  The new formulation utilizes mineral-based sunblocks (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide).  These truly offer broad-spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB rays; they are much more effective than the chemical agents for protecting your face from harmful UV rays.  The new rating from EWG&#x27;s sunscreen guide for this formulation is a 3; very good: [...]  It is whiter than the other version and takes longer to rub in, but it will protect your face much more effectively.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Avalon Organics Vitamin S Lotion SPF 15 for more than a year and been quite happy.  However, the most recent shipment was quite different as Avalon changed they formula for this product. I got a new shipment more than a month ago but I just started using it recently.  The package said \\&quot;New more sustainable\\&quot; formula, however, the new formula was not exactly what I hoped for.  It had a much stronger citrus smell with a white residue that lasted for hours (my friends said your face looked quite white).  Wish they can get back to the original formula :(</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, because I&#x27;ve found something that works for me. It only takes a tiny bit, as it spreads easily. I love that it does not leave my face oily. It has a matte-effect, so I can apply liquid foundation and it stays put. The price is good, and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; moisturizer. Just love it</li>
    <li> I received the Avalon Renewal Vit C instead of Avalon Vit C.  Amaxon attempted to send the correct product, but once again it was incorrect.  Amazon did give me a full refund and was very apologetic.  Apparently there was some error in the advertisement.  Errors happen.  Amazon&#x27;s customer service is amazing &amp; I will continue to shop with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did bye the Avalon Vit C at a local store &amp; the product is excellent &amp; glides on easy.  (The Renewal may work for others but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to spread on my skin.)</li>
