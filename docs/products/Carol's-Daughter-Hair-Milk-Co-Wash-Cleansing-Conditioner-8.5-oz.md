      <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel and look. 0Helps</li>
      <li>/&gt;- love the fragrance</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got only great things to say about this!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It works excellent on my relaxed hair especially when it is close to relaxing.</li>
      <li>I have used Hair Milk Co-Wash in all seasons just to see if there is a time of year it would work better on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have used better curly hair products and wouldn&#x27;t recommend Carol Daughter products to anyone with curly hair.</li>
      <li>love this for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent, love this product.  </li>
      <li>but I would like something with more shea butter.</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t have to add more to comb detangle)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I need something with a better moisture.</li>
      <li>This was very creamy, smells great</li>
      <li>the scent is lovely, conditions ok, but it may not be best for people who require extra conditioning.</li>
      <li>I really liked the way this product worked--left my hair silky and clean without stripping it of moisture.</li>
      <li>It smells good and works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I was able to lightly finger detangle my hair then detangled with a comb after letting it sit on my hair for about 45 mins.  </li>
      <li>Then I massage my scalp to make sure its clean then put a heat cap on it.  </li>
      <li>I require slippery cream shampoo in order to detangle easily.</li>
      <li>It detangles very quickly too.</li>
      <li>I could not believe how easy it was to detangle my 4b/4c hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t follow you all day, but in the shower, it&#x27;s strong and overpowering, and it bothers me quite a lot.  </li>
      <li>I hope they listen to customer complaints and redesign their full size bottles in a more user friendly manner perhaps adding a pump.n the top.  </li>
      <li>This product is pretty nice.  </li>
      <li>Poo-free products are the way to go for me, and this one seems to do a pretty nice job.  </li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to smell and if it doesn&#x27;t smell good or coat my hair well in the shower for detangling, I will not use it again.</li>
      <li>I hope they listen to customer complaints and redesign their full size bottles in a more user friendly manner perhaps adding a pump.</li>
      <li>Leaves my curly hair soft as well as makes it very easy to comb through!</li>
      <li>This cleansing conditioner makes a huge difference in keeping my curls in check.</li>
      <li>I use it with light leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- free of sulfates, parabens, petroleum &amp; mineral oils</li>
      <li>They have different products for what you need for the awesome natural hair look.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m wearing my hair out of protective styles more often now, I have been co-washing more frequently</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sleek and visually appealing</li>
      <li>Actually the product good.  </li>
      <li>Love that I got it soooo fast.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product to use for natural unprocessed hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Love how soft my hair feels after using this.</li>
      <li>, I like the consistency it gave my hair, detangled my hair VERY easily and, to the difference in many of other reviews, I did not have to use that much to accomplish a thorough work-through.</li>
      <li>free which I initially thought this product was (it&#x27;s sulfate, paraben, petroleum, and mineral oil free, and also contains no artificial colors).</li>
      <li>After I rinsed with cool water my hair felt clean, soft &amp; moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I know some people are really sensitive to strong smells</li>
      <li>I am headache-prone and pretty sensitive to strong smells, so I had to give this bottle away to a curly-haired co-worker who doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the smell.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and tangle free and my curls bouncy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty nauseating.</li>
      <li>Carls daughter, first time using it</li>
      <li>tried it on my hair first</li>
      <li>I came home over spring break and my mother, who wears her hair mostly straightened, had bought the entire Monoi line as well as the hair milk and this co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>make it soft, clean and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It leaves my  hair soft, clean, and manageable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind of hair that I can straighten easily with a blow drier, but if I wear it curly and natural, I need to tame it with tons of products.</li>
      <li>Very light and wont dry your hair out.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend for those who have curly fine hair.</li>
      <li>It smells great and only takes a little to do the job.</li>
      <li>This product really lives up to the expectation.  </li>
      <li>The biggest issue really is that cap and the way it comes out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian with Mediterranean/Middle Eastern wavy-to-curly hair that tends to get really frizzy in humidity.</li>
      <li>so much in fact you could even use your fingers</li>
      <li>This does wonders for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is very curly.</li>
      <li>I am a freshman in college and don&#x27;t have a lot of time and money to really try all the products I want to.</li>
      <li>As you see in the picture, the top is an attached twist open cap with a small hole in the top.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend this product to anyone who wants clean hair that is not dried out by using regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>However, this price is too high.</li>
      <li>So if you are one of those curly girlies who prefers their ingredients natural and really look for products absent of silicones, then do not buy this product.</li>
      <li>As I only co wash my hair and it keeps my hair fresh feeling and soft no dryness</li>
      <li>It detangles the hair making it very soft, manageable and curly.  </li>
      <li>I have 4C hair and this leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable after the 1st use!</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean and didn&#x27;t make me hair very soft, the repairing Monoi line is much better, that one I am obsessed with</li>

    <li> I would definitely recommend for those who have curly fine hair. Very light and wont dry your hair out. Amazing</li>
    <li> I really liked the way this product worked--left my hair silky and clean without stripping it of moisture. However, I have to give it two stars because the fragrance is OVERBEARING--very perfumey. I am headache-prone and pretty sensitive to strong smells, so I had to give this bottle away to a curly-haired co-worker who doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the smell.</li>
    <li> I love the Co-Wash because it smells nice and helps to form a better curl pattern with each use. However, this price is too high. It it cheaper to go to the Carols Daughter website and purchase directly.</li>
    <li> well...it&#x27;s not as moisturizing and slippery as Wen coconut mango. my hair is kinky curly spirals. I require slippery cream shampoo in order to detangle easily. the scent is lovely, conditions ok, but it may not be best for people who require extra conditioning. wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Actually the product good.  Packaging defective so you cannot get product out.  Carol&#x27;s admitted that there have been other calls and then hung up on my wife.  Refused to replace the package.</li>
    <li> Started using this product on my daughter hair. Her hair doesnt dry out and it keeps her hair soft. My daughter is 2 years old and other shampoo drys out her hair. But this one gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Love how soft my hair feels after using this. It detangles very quickly too.</li>
    <li> Smells good but I tthink I need something with a better moisture. I probably will not be utilizing this product again. It is not that it is a bad product but I would like something with more shea butter.</li>
    <li> Carls daughter, first time using it and it&#x27;s good, but I don&#x27;t like the Smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell but not a good on either</li>
    <li> this product is the best i just love it . its just to costly for my budget so I will try something eles</li>
    <li> I have very coarse and dry curly. Not super curly but just enough to be more than wavy. Carols Daughter co-wash is the best for making my hair feel soft without taking the curls out. I use it with light leave in conditioner. This is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It feels like I am washing my hair with conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t foam up but it didn&#x27;t take long at all to get used to.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, love this product.  As I only co wash my hair and it keeps my hair fresh feeling and soft no dryness</li>
    <li> Started using the co-wash regularly about Dec. 2013.  Love the way it makes my hair feel and look. 0Helps with overall dryness.  I use the co-wash with the Monoi Repairing Conditioner and get wonderful results.  Hair is growing again. Best conditioning wash I&#x27;ve used.  Would recommend this product to anyone who wants clean hair that is not dried out by using regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have just recently embarked on my curly hair journey to once again regain my natural hair texture. I am a freshman in college and don&#x27;t have a lot of time and money to really try all the products I want to. I came home over spring break and my mother, who wears her hair mostly straightened, had bought the entire Monoi line as well as the hair milk and this co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I have to say, I am not a fan of Carol&#x27;s Daughter products overall. I have used their Tui smoothie, their hair milk, and one shampoo and conditioner of theirs I cannot recall as I had purchased it about 4 years ago. I am very sensitive to smell and if it doesn&#x27;t smell good or coat my hair well in the shower for detangling, I will not use it again. For example, I think their Monoi products smell disgusting and overly sweet and I got too dizzy using the shampoo to even apply the conditioner. However, I decided to take my chances and use this one night and I LOVED IT! It has amazing slippage for me to detangle with, so much in fact you could even use your fingers (I detangle before I get in the shower with a paddle brush and then in the shower with my hair drenched in conditioner and with a wide-toothed comb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have also been reading a lot about having mostly natural ingredients in your hair products and the overall benefit you get when your products are sulfate, paraben, silicone, etc. free which I initially thought this product was (it&#x27;s sulfate, paraben, petroleum, and mineral oil free, and also contains no artificial colors). However, I learned it contains a lot of silicones including one of the worst, dimethicone. I have not decided if I will buy this product again but I will finish this bottle and decide then. So if you are one of those curly girlies who prefers their ingredients natural and really look for products absent of silicones, then do not buy this product. But if you do not mind, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got only great things to say about this! I transitioned to natural almost a year ago and have went through product after product. I have 4C hair and this leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable after the 1st use! Love it!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean and didn&#x27;t make me hair very soft, the repairing Monoi line is much better, that one I am obsessed with</li>
    <li> Bought this at the Carol&#x27;s Daughter salon in Harlem. I&#x27;m Caucasian with Mediterranean/Middle Eastern wavy-to-curly hair that tends to get really frizzy in humidity. It&#x27;s the kind of hair that I can straighten easily with a blow drier, but if I wear it curly and natural, I need to tame it with tons of products. It&#x27;s also color-treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to stop fighting the humidity and just go with the flow this summer. This cleansing conditioner makes a huge difference in keeping my curls in check. It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. Unfortunately, most of the other milk products are far too heavy for me - except the curl revitalizer, which is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for me - and it&#x27;s pretty big - is the smell, which is just so overwhelming and disgusting that I hold my breath during the hair wash. My hair smells nice after I rinse it out, but while I&#x27;m rubbing it into my hair it&#x27;s pretty nauseating. I wish they&#x27;d come out with this in another scent, but other than that, I definitely recommend the cleanser for my texture of hair.</li>
    <li> Does wonderful things to my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The trick I use with this product is rubbing coconut oil thru-out my  hair and spraying my hair with water and than taking this product and rubbing thru out my hair. Then I massage my scalp to make sure its clean then put a heat cap on it.  I have a lot of hair and it is past my bra strap and I refuse to keep washing my hair over/over again.  I use this method to help save on the product and I don&#x27;t have to buy it as often in the winter/colder days. Carolsdaughter make awesome products and I love buying her products!!! OH  I don&#x27;t use this product only in the winter after the season I put it up ... awesome product!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s makes my curls look great</li>
    <li> Perfect. I love this product. It makes my hair so soft and tangle free and my curls bouncy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this co-wash! Leaves my curly hair soft as well as makes it very easy to comb through! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Been trying to find an alternative for Wen. I like this stuff although I have only wavy hair and normally straighten it.  It smells good and works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to use for natural unprocessed hair. It detangles the hair making it very soft, manageable and curly.  This does wonders for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is very curly. This product defines her curls after washing and she gets a lot of complements for her hair.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty nice.  I&#x27;m not quite curly, just wavy and frequently frizzy.  Poo-free products are the way to go for me, and this one seems to do a pretty nice job.  It gets my hair a little cleaner than scrubbing up with conditioner alone, which is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, but there is an adjustment period.  I don&#x27;t have any trouble with the packaging like a previous reviewer mentions, however, the smell is very perfumey.  It doesn&#x27;t follow you all day, but in the shower, it&#x27;s strong and overpowering, and it bothers me quite a lot.  I&#x27;ll finish out this bottle, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product really lives up to the expectation.  It leaves my  hair soft, clean, and manageable.  It&#x27;s great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> For those who are into natural hair, this product and all Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s product are must to have.  They have different products for what you need for the awesome natural hair look.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 4 year old coarse and think hair.&lt;br /&gt;It make it soft, clean and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my hair first and I love it as well&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. Too mediciney for me</li>
    <li> I will only use Carol&#x27;s Daughter on my curly hair</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this Co-Wash at all and wouldn&#x27;t know who to recommend it to.  I have long natural curly hair that is weather sensitive. I have used Hair Milk Co-Wash in all seasons just to see if there is a time of year it would work better on my hair.  Sadly, it just doesn&#x27;t work well.  It doesn&#x27;t soften my hair enough and I find it difficult to detangle my hair even when I leave it in for a while.  It is a waste of money. I wish I returned it in time but thought that it could work for me eventually.  The leave in conditioner Hair Milk is just as bad. I have used better curly hair products and wouldn&#x27;t recommend Carol Daughter products to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of trying several different products over the next year. This was very creamy, smells great, I like the consistency it gave my hair, detangled my hair VERY easily and, to the difference in many of other reviews, I did not have to use that much to accomplish a thorough work-through. The biggest issue really is that cap and the way it comes out of the bottle. Absolutely an inconvenience, especially in the shower when you didn&#x27;t realize just how hard it was to get the cap off. That is why I gave it four stars. The manufacturers should consider changing the packaging. But magnificent product!!</li>
    <li> I could not believe how easy it was to detangle my 4b/4c hair. It smells great and only takes a little to do the job. Great job Carols Daughter! I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> It works excellent on my relaxed hair especially when it is close to relaxing. It makes detangling a breeze. It&#x27;s awesome!!! Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is the best non lather shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> love this for my hair.  Love that I got it soooo fast.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product!</li>
    <li> I love the product, always a good experience with Carol&#x27;s Daughter! It&#x27;s the packaging that&#x27;s irritating me. It&#x27;s very sleek and visually appealing but it&#x27;s SO difficult to twist open. Seriously, I have to open it before I get in the shower because it&#x27;s not gonna happen if you&#x27;re hands are wet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair products in the past and when I heard about her revamped Hair Milk line including this co-wash, I just had to try it. I separated my hair into 4 braids and washed each section separately - following the directions to saturate my hair with water before applying the co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great, it has a strong floral scent that didn&#x27;t bother me.  I know some people are really sensitive to strong smells so be forewarned that initially the smell is strong but as I detangled &amp; twisted my hair it dissipated somewhat and by the time I rinsed it out, the smell was faint but I could definitely still smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This co-wash also has amazing slip! I was able to lightly finger detangle my hair then detangled with a comb after letting it sit on my hair for about 45 mins.  After I rinsed with cool water my hair felt clean, soft &amp; moisturized.  I used a little over a third of the bottle for one wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- free of sulfates, parabens, petroleum &amp; mineral oils&lt;br /&gt;- sold on the ground @ Macy&#x27;s &amp; Sephora&lt;br /&gt;- love the fragrance&lt;br /&gt;- great SLIP&lt;br /&gt;- a little goes a long way (I didn&#x27;t have to add more to comb detangle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- a little pricey for such a small bottle&lt;br /&gt;- can achieve the same results using cheaper conditioner mixed with coconut/olive/grapeseed oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be adding this as a staple product simply because of the cost and I can achieve the same results using cheaper alternatives.  Since I&#x27;m wearing my hair out of protective styles more often now, I have been co-washing more frequently so if I only used this co-wash, I&#x27;d probably finish one bottle after 2 weeks or less and at $18/bottle, that&#x27;s just too expensive.  I would definitely re-purchase if the company ran a \\&quot;bogo\\&quot; or some other discounted special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT: 06/06/2013 - another con is the bottle design.  As you see in the picture, the top is an attached twist open cap with a small hole in the top.  You have to squeeze the bottle fairly tight to get the product out and while this may help cut down on wasted product, it is a huge P.I.T.A. to squeeze the product out of this bottle when your hands are wet &amp; slippery.  Also unfortunately unless you break the cap off, you cannot take it off to pour the conditioner out.  I hope they listen to customer complaints and redesign their full size bottles in a more user friendly manner perhaps adding a pump.n the top.
