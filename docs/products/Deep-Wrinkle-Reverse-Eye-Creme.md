      <li>I love this because it feels good and appears to be making a difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all the greats and by far this does the best job!!  </li>
      <li>Derma E, is by far one of the best products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, to get the most benefit from this cream, I suggest using the peptides eye cream in the daytime, and derma e&#x27;s pycnogenol and hyaluronic eye cream at night.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I need a more emollient product.</li>
      <li>I Love it.</li>
      <li>My husband remarked that I look better rested.</li>
      <li>They love it.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, kind of lightly creamy.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I Love the company with all of it</li>
      <li>I bought 4 different Derma E products and I am impressed.  </li>
      <li>really like it works good</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs easily.  </li>
      <li>This stuff like a lot of their products has no scent goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth, and I think wrinkles are shrinking.</li>
      <li>Comes back if I don&#x27;t use it but looks great when I do.</li>
      <li>i felt changes since the first tryy!!</li>
      <li>Somehow, it really does make my skin look more even and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I take good care of myself and look younger than my age.  </li>
      <li>I love it enough to make sure I stay in stock via amazon.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly and only takes a tiny bit to get great coverage</li>
      <li>This product seemed worth a try.  </li>
      <li>just looks better no matter how old we get.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
      <li>I am in my forties and it works really well on my crow&#x27;s feet!</li>
      <li>I have noticed my eyes feeling more moisturized and just very open.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have tried this</li>
      <li>No noticeable results yet as far as light wrinkle reduction.</li>
      <li>People think I&#x27;m much younger than I am (or maybe they&#x27;re just being polite!), and good moisturizer is a big reason.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying a full set of products geared to your particular need.</li>
      <li>I  really like this eye creme.</li>
      <li>I like this cream so much I bought it for my sister and a bunch of friends.</li>
      <li>Ever since I have been using this product my eyes look much fresher.</li>
      <li>so these things really start to matter.  </li>
      <li>This really works and I would never do without it now.  </li>
      <li>I finished the whole jug, and I don&#x27;t see any difference around my eyes.</li>
      <li>This eye cream contains 2 peptides, matrixyl and argireline, which helps smooth out the wrinkles by stimulating collagen production and relaxing the facial muscles.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin soft and moist and helps smooth out those fine lines and makes them a lot less noticeable.</li>
      <li>Purchase other products from Derma-E, and am enjoying the benefits.</li>
      <li>It works better than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>My favorite eye cream, never causes eye irritation that I often get from some other creams</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS OKAY, NOT SPECIAL.  </li>
      <li>All that-AND it&#x27;s all natural!!</li>
      <li>product was very runny...not a pleasant consistency..a total waste of money!!</li>
      <li>It moisturizes really well and soft and well moisturized</li>
      <li>this is a nice thick cream that soaks in well.</li>
      <li>okay though as a heavy moisturizer near the eyes.</li>
      <li>just i want more information how to use it, how to apply, and all that instructions that comes in a usual beaty product</li>
      <li>and I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>It may work well on younger skin, but on my 56 year old skin, it did absolutely NOTHING.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old</li>
      <li>Received with no problems and as expected, when expected.&lt;br /&gt;Works better than any other mostly natural eye cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I have access to medical grade skin care lines and a variety of high quality products.  </li>
      <li>Before using it, my eyes looked always tired and the wrinkles I have around them were more noticeable.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s natural ingredients and keep the prices low, and I will keep coming back!</li>

<li> I usually like products from DERMA E, but did not see much difference in in the skin tone around my eyes by using it.  </li>
<li> but I wanted something a cream to provide a good base, you have to understand that a cream will not and can not get rid of wrinkles.  </li>
<li> The product isn&#x27;t very thick like other undereye creams, but it does seem to moisturize pretty well for a short time after application.</li>
<li> I use this creme during the day and set it with loose powder under the lower lashes</li>
<li> I am new to this brand and while it sucks I can not buy it in any of the stores around me...</li>
<li> Some ingredient must have been left out...or maybe past</li>
<li> I trust this company and have used other products of theirs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I think they should change the name because my eye wrinkles were not exactly reversed.</li>
<li> However, Just as another reviewer said, I wish they would &amp;#34;combine&amp;#34; their other eye cream that has the hydraulic acid in it to receive All the benefits together.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell of it to use it on a regular basis.</li>
<li> would recommend this product to other women.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had a product that closed my pores by half.  </li>
<li> This was a huge disappointment!</li>
<li> Not sure I have seen my wrinkles diminish</li>
<li> And one small thing is that is DOES sting a lot if you get it in your eye by accident.  </li>
<li> This was no better than any of the others.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for at least a month.  </li>
<li> They are so small now that I don&#x27;t use a filler product to hide them!  </li>
<li> I used a jar and a half of Hydroxatone &amp; had just resigned myself that those faint lines in the corner of my eyes were the beginning of the end.</li>
<li> The \\&quot;wrinkle reverse\\&quot; is a false claim.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I did not see any changes after using it 2 times a day for a month.  </li>
<li> Those faint lines have all but vanished after just a week of use.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product after all the rave reviews.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the first time I have tried this and I was very pleasantly surprised! It goes on so smoothly and only takes a tiny bit to get great coverage and it&#x27;s very gentle. No burning or itching when close to your eye lid which it a big thing for me because we sometimes do get it too close. It moisturizes really well and soft and well moisturized just looks better no matter how old we get. This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I love Derma e products and this is an excellent eye creme.  I am in my forties and it works really well on my crow&#x27;s feet!</li>
    <li> really like it works good</li>
    <li> Very Nice eye cream, and I do notice a difference.  However, Just as another reviewer said, I wish they would &amp;#34;combine&amp;#34; their other eye cream that has the hydraulic acid in it to receive All the benefits together.  And one small thing is that is DOES sting a lot if you get it in your eye by accident.  Otherwise, I Love the company with all of it&#x27;s natural ingredients and keep the prices low, and I will keep coming back!</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye cream. It keeps my skin soft and moist and helps smooth out those fine lines and makes them a lot less noticeable. The smell is nice to.</li>
    <li> After trying all sorts of face lotions and creams, this is one I will stick with for a while.  Somehow, it really does make my skin look more even and smooth.  I&#x27;m 51 so these things really start to matter.  It goes on easily, kind of lightly creamy.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 different Derma E products and I am impressed.  I am a skin care product addict and esthetician.  I&#x27;m always on the look out for something that will take good care of my face and ease wrinkles.  Derma E, is by far one of the best products I&#x27;ve used.  I have access to medical grade skin care lines and a variety of high quality products.  But this product really impressed me.  I&#x27;ve never had a product that closed my pores by half.  They are so small now that I don&#x27;t use a filler product to hide them!  I highly recommend buying a full set of products geared to your particular need. It&#x27;s the combination that made the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all the greats and by far this does the best job!!  This really works and I would never do without it now.  Best price too......especially when compared to the &amp;#34;others&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I always try eye creams but they end of making my eyes sting and get irritated. This stuff like a lot of their products has no scent goes on smooth. I have noticed my eyes feeling more moisturized and just very open. I have no idea if it reduces wrinkles lol but I will say I have finally found an eye cream for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least a month.  I think it works as well as the much more expensive eye creams out there.  It hydrates and firms the eye area quite well.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS OKAY, NOT SPECIAL.  BUT FOR THE PRICE IT WASN&#x27;T LIKELY TO BE WAS IT?  DON&#x27;T KNOW IF I WILL RE-ORDER.  MAYBE.</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t very thick like other undereye creams, but it does seem to moisturize pretty well for a short time after application. No noticeable results yet as far as light wrinkle reduction.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase. I like the fact that I&#x27;m not applying harmful chemicals to my skin. Purchase other products from Derma-E, and am enjoying the benefits. My skin feels smooth, and I think wrinkles are shrinking.</li>
    <li> This eye cream contains 2 peptides, matrixyl and argireline, which helps smooth out the wrinkles by stimulating collagen production and relaxing the facial muscles. However, this cream lacks another key ingredient, hyaluronic acid, which is a moisturizer that also plays a role when it comes to collagen production. Therefore, to get the most benefit from this cream, I suggest using the peptides eye cream in the daytime, and derma e&#x27;s pycnogenol and hyaluronic eye cream at night. Together, this makes the perfect combination for wrinkle reduction.  I have used both these creams for about 3 months now, and I can definitely see improvement around the eye area.</li>
    <li> I use this creme during the day and set it with loose powder under the lower lashes so I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon by midday.  It works better than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.  People think I&#x27;m much younger than I am (or maybe they&#x27;re just being polite!), and good moisturizer is a big reason.</li>
    <li> just fantastic!! i felt changes since the first tryy!! just i want more information how to use it, how to apply, and all that instructions that comes in a usual beaty product</li>
    <li> I like this cream so much I bought it for my sister and a bunch of friends. They love it.</li>
    <li> stings like anything if you get in the eyes, which it&#x27;s supposed to be for..makes no sense..an eye cream that stings the eyes. Use your regular cream for that! Works okay though as a heavy moisturizer near the eyes.</li>
    <li> I am new to this brand and while it sucks I can not buy it in any of the stores around me... I love it enough to make sure I stay in stock via amazon. this is a nice thick cream that soaks in well. Price is on point as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream along with a sunblock for quite some time, and feel that it the best of what I have tried.</li>
    <li> I tried this until the product ran out. I think they should change the name because my eye wrinkles were not exactly reversed. They are still there. It helps to soften the skin around my eyes so that the wrinkles are not so pronounced but it did not reverse them. I may purchase again.</li>
    <li> this peptide wrinkle reverse eye creme is just a moisturizer at best.  I dont actually have wrinkles but I wanted something a cream to provide a good base, you have to understand that a cream will not and can not get rid of wrinkles.  But if you want a good moisturizer than go for it.</li>
    <li> I  really like this eye creme. It definitely makes a difference. Before using it, my eyes looked always tired and the wrinkles I have around them were more noticeable. Ever since I have been using this product my eyes look much fresher.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product and it has been everything she said it was. It works and I definetly will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I do not like this stuff. I can&#x27;t get past the smell of it to use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and always looking for products to soften lines around and below my eyes.  This product seemed worth a try.  Unfortunately, I did not see any changes after using it 2 times a day for a month.  I didn&#x27;t finish the jar, the only reason why I kept using it was because it was neither drying nor greasy and figured no harm.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and will try something else.</li>
    <li> I will praise this stuff from the rooftops!!! I used a jar and a half of Hydroxatone &amp; had just resigned myself that those faint lines in the corner of my eyes were the beginning of the end. And then I happened on a review about this from another dissatisfied Hyd user who recommended it. BEST REVIEW I EVER READ! Those faint lines have all but vanished after just a week of use. The skin looks firmer &amp; brighter. My husband remarked that I look better rested. All that-AND it&#x27;s all natural!! WOW!</li>
    <li> I trust this company and have used other products of theirs.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to other women.  Deanna</li>
    <li> I use this peptide eyecream every night. Have no problems with either puffiness or undue wrinkling; i&#x27;e. it does just what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Some ingredient must have been left out...or maybe past it&#x27;s shelf life..product was very runny...not a pleasant consistency..a total waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I usually like products from DERMA E, but did not see much difference in in the skin tone around my eyes by using it.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs easily.  Perhaps I need a more emollient product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product after all the rave reviews.  It may work well on younger skin, but on my 56 year old skin, it did absolutely NOTHING. I take good care of myself and look younger than my age.  This was a huge disappointment!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for my eyes... affordable and smells nice .  Not sure I have seen my wrinkles diminish but skin is softer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old and I wear an eye cream in the AM &amp; PM.  I love this because it feels good and appears to be making a difference.  Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream, never causes eye irritation that I often get from some other creams</li>
    <li> This product works well.  Received with no problems and as expected, when expected.&lt;br /&gt;Works better than any other mostly natural eye cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;wrinkle reverse\\&quot; is a false claim.  I finished the whole jug, and I don&#x27;t see any difference around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I will order again and recommend to friends.  The tender skin around my eyes appears supple and refreshed.  I Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have tried others but keep coming back to this one. It removes puffiness and just makes my eyes look healthier.</li>
    <li> After using the product, my eyes look great, wrinkles are gone.  Comes back if I don&#x27;t use it but looks great when I do.</li>
    <li> Promises Promises Promises!  I don&#x27;t know why I keep falling for the cosmetic industries ads. This was no better than any of the others.</li>
