<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> thi light works great for doing my gel nails, all at once too.</li>
    <li> very good, does what it is suppose to do</li>
    <li> I bought this uv lamp so I could start doing my own shellac manicures at home.  I was worried because some say you have to use the uv lamp that CND sells in order for your shellac nails to come out right.  That&#x27;s not true!  From what I read from others, your lamp just has to be 36 watt like this one is.  It&#x27;s so affordable and it works like a charm.  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I bought this for curing my gelish nail polish and it works very well. Easy to set up, cures fast (2-3 minutes), and there&#x27;s a few different timing options as well. Very happy with this purchaae!</li>
    <li> I did read some reviews before I got this but I managed to read only the good ones apparently.  I had prepped my nails and applied the first step for the gelish nails, flipped the switch and to my luck nothing happened. I messed around with it for quite a while, made sure I didnt do anything wrong in the instructions, and still nothing.  Of course I am returning it but I have ordered a new one in hope that this one will work.  If it does I will probably update my review because I&#x27;d really like to do my own gelish manicure very soon!!!</li>
    <li> What more can I say?  I&#x27;ve had this on my Amazon Wish List for a few months and I was super excited to have received it yesterday as a birthday gift.  Today, after getting it all set up, it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on!  I tried different outlets and reinstalling the bulbs.  Nothing.  Needless to say, my dear hubby is shipping it back.  So bummed!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas. She opened it this morning and we installed the light bulbs,plugged it in and followed the directions to operate. No good, it just does not work.</li>
    <li> I bought a gel nail kit while I was pregnant that way I could still get my nails done without being in the salon with all of the fumes. I didn&#x27;t realize I would need a uv nail lamp so I finally got this one. It came a day earlier than expected which I love but the actual box it was in, it was busted open with the cord hanging out. Thankfully there was bubble wrap in the shipping box and around the bulbs and IT WORKS! I immediately got out my gel kit and did a tester on a fake nail and it works great and dries fairly quick. Veryyyyyy satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great bang for the buck.  I am a novice at this gel nail stuff and purchased this lamp because of the price and it works like a charm... fabulous nails everytime!!</li>
    <li> I love it. Works better than my other one. I might just have to get another one for more convenience</li>
    <li> This is a great light.  I decided to start doing my own gel nails.  I got tired of seeing the lack of cleanliness at the chop shop I went to.  They used all their tools on the same people, never sanitizing them between customers.  And I know they were talking about us in their native language. I bought a starter kit from Sally Beauty Supply and got this light.  I am still not too good at the smile line on the french look but whatever.  I am just going to do color next time.  It did take about 3 hours the first time but I know I will get better with time.  I really enjoyed doing it and being in my own house with my own tools.  This light is great and a great price.  The cost of the light and gel will pay for itself about the 3rd time I do my nails.  I have only done them once so far.  But I feel a great accomplishment knowing I am free from the shop.  I have checked on the price of other lights and this one is a great price for a 36 watt light.  That seems to be the best wattage to have to cure gels. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this light. You can buy gel all over the internet.  You just have to find the sites that will sell to non nail techs.  Good luck.  This would also work with the shelacs too.  Might try them someday.</li>
    <li> I received it right on time which was great. The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t have the feature where the bottom can slide out for easy clean up. I guess its worth what i paid for it. $40 is better than $100+! I shall wait and see how well it works once i get my gelish colors and start using it. Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that this product didn&#x27;t always work. So far I have not had a problem with it and have been using it for more than a year now. I&#x27;ve use it about every two weeks to do my hands and every month to do my toes. And for a period of 4 months I was also doing my mother&#x27;s nails and my mother-in-law&#x27;s nails too. This machine has gotten it&#x27;s fair share of use and it is still working great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine is big enough that you can put your whole hand in and don&#x27;t have to do the thumbs seperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the 120 second timer for each step in the process of putting Harmony Gelish nail products on and have had no issues. It cures them and they look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine has a 120 sec and 180 sec timer. I wish it had a 60 sec timer instead of the 180 sec. You can also use it without the timer but then have to use the on/off button each time to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great machine especially for the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the price and fantastic results this lamp has to offer.  I use it with my Shellac products and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I use this product with the gelish line and it dries it completely.  Very good for the costs.  I have had this for months without any mechanical problems.</li>
    <li> I plugged it in and it did not work.  I don&#x27;t know why this thinge get such a high rating with all the bad reviews. I took it out of the box and immediately noticed a couple of nicks and then it did not work.  So I removed the bulbs and shook them and they rattle.  The bulbs are burned out. I was sent an item that had been used and returned! I absolutely hate returning things. Will keep stuff just because it is too much trouble to return but this piece of garbage is going back and I will go to a local beauty supply store, pay a few dollars more and try it before I take it. BTW, they sell it on Ebay too and I will post this there as well. I buy a lot from Amazon and this is the first thing I am following through on returning.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this product for just over a month and decided to use it, unfortunately when i tried to turn it on, it doesn&#x27;t work. i&#x27;m disappointed and will be returning it and ordering from a different maker.</li>
    <li> I use this for UV Gel Polish and it was a great buy for the need.  Many products out there with a much bigger price tag, when this is all you need.  I had just a bit of a problem with one of the bulbs going in and seems to be misaligned, but it works just fine.  If using this for gel based products I have read many articles and I think the 36w is most important specs when picking out a UV Light system to achieve the desired results.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to recieve this product but was shortly dissapointed as soon as I opened the box. It clearly indicates 120 volts US version but the product I got was 220 volts and not compatible with American outlets. I was upset because not only was the unit falsely advertised but I also couldn&#x27;t get it exchanged. Luckily amazon gave a full refund and free return shipping. Note to buyers beware of the sellers lack of knowledge of there products and verify that your getting what you pay for.</li>
    <li> IT WOULDN&#x27;T EVEN TURN ON. I gave up after trying so many times and ways. I bought this because it has 4 stars out of 37 reviews but I should have read more carefully. Same thing happened to some people.</li>
    <li> The lamp is not really for curing gel.  It says gel, gel, gel lamp all over the descriptions but the truth is that this lamp will not cure gel.  It only cures nail polish.  So after giving the lamp many many tries, I&#x27;m giving up and sending it back.  Their description deceived me in purchasing the wrong thing.</li>
    <li> I received this unit and was excited to do my nails, but after properly installing the light bulbs I realized that the unit was not functioning - brand new out of the box. I suppose you really do get what you pay for. I will try to find a unit that seems to have better quality ratings in leau of a low price...good luck if you risk buying one of these.</li>
    <li> I used this lamp for both gelish and shellac manicures and pedicures and it worked perfectly. There is absolutely no need to spend more money for a more expensive lamp. I like how the tray slides out to make it easier to cure toes. I also like how the two bulbs on the ends are angled so that it is directed at the thumbs making it more comfortable to use; no need to cure thumbs separately. This same exact lamp sells at Sally&#x27;s for twenty dollars more.</li>
    <li> Sad!&lt;br /&gt;So at first I bought a 9W one that wouldn&#x27;t cure gelish or shellac.&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to buy this one, wow, 36W...&lt;br /&gt;It did turn on and everything but, it just won&#x27;t cure Gelish or Shellac!&lt;br /&gt;10, 30, 180 seconds and nothing! My hands turn black from the UV and still when I cleanse everything comes off.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, if everything came off it would actually be good, but no, some patches stick some not so I still have a lot of work&lt;br /&gt;to clean it off and 1h after trying hard to do my nails I still end up with nothing! So sad!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t return it right away because I wanted to \\&quot;test\\&quot; it more...but no, after several tries I am finally giving up... going to the garbage along with my 9W one...&lt;br /&gt;I am buying a LED today..wish me luck.</li>
    <li> The product i recieved was not the brand Uspicy dryer, as pictured) and it upset me a little but i have been using the dryer for about 3 months now and i am VERY happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So other than the fact its like a generic version of a uspicy its still just as good.</li>
    <li> This is a great light for drying the new Gel Polishes that are the latest craz for natual nails. I&#x27;m a professional nail Tech. and I would definatly recommended this. As of a matter of fact, I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use with shellac nail polish and it works great. It cures the product well. I had no problems with the bulbs.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this.  It allows me to put my own gel polish on in little time.  I use it with both gel and CND&#x27;s shellac.  I find it works well with both.  This is an LED light dryer.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this along with the rest of my gel kit, but was shipped a model with a European power plug rather than an American power plug. I just sent it in for a refund and am debating whether to reorder in hopes of getting the right product or spending an extra $25 to pick it up locally.</li>
    <li> This lamp arrived quick and works very well. It&#x27;s easy to figure out and cures Shellac products beautifully. Compared to other lamps with the same wattage it is a fantastic bargain.</li>
    <li> As stated, I am extremely disappointed with this order. I was very excited to recieve my UV lamp to start gel nails, but I recieved some unlabeled product that appeared used, lights  did not fit correctly, and there was a EUROPEAN PLUG! for whatever reason it seems I cannot return this product. Never buy from this inconsistent seller.</li>
    <li> The USpicy 36w Nail Gryl Gel UV Lamp came with one the elements that did not work.  I tried changing the bulbs, but it is the element that does not light up.</li>
    <li> The lamp arrived late, the cord was not neatly bundled so perhaps the item was a return.  Two of the light bulbs had a rattle but they are working.  it did work properly to cure nail gel.  The vendor offered to replace the bulbs if they quit within a month and asked me to remove my negative review.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I was completely worried this would be a piece of garbage and not work at all, but was so desperate to do shellac at home and didn&#x27;t have a lot to spend...so I took a gamble! I was even more worried when I opened it up and found the instruction written in broken English on a sheet of paper! However, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 9 months now and it&#x27;s been working perfectly. Very easy to use. So far, no complaints and I feel like I really lucked out.</li>
    <li> I was paying $45 for Shellac/Gelish manicures at the local nail salon. I saw this item and decided to try it to see if I could get the look without paying the high price, and also without the risks associated with getting your nails done at a salon (no one can say how clean those tools are, for sure!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this lamp along with Gelish base, polish and top coat. I am pleased with how well my nails look when I use this. It is exactly like getting them done at the salon, only much cheaper. I am by no means an expert when it comes to doing manicures, but I was able to get the desired look relatively easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Very reasonable and if you use often, it will pay for itself in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: Sleek and small enough to easily fit into my bathroom cabinet between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: I was worried it would not dry my nails as well as more powerful professional models but I set the timer for 2 minutes between layers of polish and have never even had a scuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can say is that I was using this item and set a cotton ball with fingernail polish remover on it and it quickly ate away a bit of the top and it now it has an slightly \\&quot;wrinkled\\&quot; look on the top in one area. It is not noticeable but I was suprised at how quickly it ate through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to do their own nails. It is fast, easy, and much less expensive than going to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure you put a little sunscreen on your hands before using this item. The UV rays can be damaging to your skin, similar to a tanning bed. It&#x27;s not something to be overly concerned about, but a small amount of suncreen can ensure that you are safe!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the lamp once, but so far so good. I used with the Red Carpet Manicure gels and I was very happy with the results. All 4 bulbs worked, none were broken, and the lamp is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the hype that you need some super expensive light to cure your shellac polish...this one is very inexpensive but has the wattage to get the job done.  30 seconds per coat (base coat and colors), 1 minute for the top coat.  It has enough room for your entire hand, 2 if you&#x27;re REALLY careful.  LOVE this light!</li>
    <li> I wear my nails natural with polish - I love to change my polish frequently.  My goal was to find a way to dry my polish quickly. After reading the features on this product, I thought I had found a way. From the advertisement, it appeared it would assist my polish in drying faster - NOT!  Perhaps it is best suited for gel nails - so they should remove any references to \\&quot;setting\\&quot; natural nail polish - because it does nothing for drying polish on natural nails.  This was a total waste of money - if anyone knows of a better solution I would love to know how to dry nail polish quicker on natural nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never painted my own nails, clear polish maybe but that&#x27;s it and I was tired of paying the salon prices for Shellac.  I tried it for the first time tonight and worked perfectly... The polish is def thick..make sure your hand is flat while under the lights so the polish doesn&#x27;t slide to one side or the other..make sure you get the ends to seal it in.  Loved. I&#x27;m having a girls night so we can all try it</li>
    <li> I have used this dryer a couple of times now and it works great! 36 watts is just what I need to cure Harmony&#x27;s Gelish top coat. The buttons/controls are simple to figure out and easy to use. I like that it has the option of using the timer, with two settings (1.5 or 2 minutes), or leaving it on for as long as needed. The only installation needed is inserting the 4 UV light bulbs (which came with the dryer) - this is VERY easy to do. Definitely worth purchasing...can&#x27;t beat the price either! This is saving me tons by not having to go to the nail salon!</li>
    <li> It met all of our expectations, has been a terrific machine and loved the price! Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Your gel polish is completely dry and cured, as noted on the box and online in just two minutes.  Now I can do my finger and toenails at home and they look just as good as the salon.  Women, save some salon money and give yourselves a home mani/pedi!</li>
    <li> The UV Light and bulbs arrived in excellent condition.  After following the directions on the CND nail package, it cured my nails perfectly!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent gel nail dryer,  it works great and was a great price.  Very well made, love it.</li>
    <li> Exact same results as the salon. Works like a charm. Saving tons of $$$ by doing my own gel polish, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about having my natural nails drilled to a thin layer anymore.  It is key to make sure you keep the bottles of polish away from the lamp &amp; be sure to shake the polish well prior to use.</li>
    <li> This light is a piece of crap, took it out of the box and plugged it in and it did not work. It didn&#x27;t even come with instructions. I tried switching the bulbs and nothing! I am definitely going to return this product.</li>
    <li> This product worked about 4 times in the course of 2 weeks then completely died. I purchased this light because of the low price, but it certainly was not worth the savings. Save your money and purchase a better quality product.</li>
    <li> I have just started using the Gelish line in the past few months, and this lamp is ideal for fast and complete curing.  The automatic timer feature is really nice, and I can just press the on button and know that the lamp will turn itself off after the right amount of time has passed.  It stays off until I am ready to cure the next polish layer.  The placement of the bulbs inside the unit ensures that all your nails, even your thumb, cure at the same time.  The opening is also shielded well so that even if you look down at your hand while it&#x27;s inside the unit, you won&#x27;t hurt your eyes.      When I first started out, I tried to get by with just a 9W lamp.  It took five times as long, and I would still have trouble with the polish lifting within a few days because it hadn&#x27;t fully cured.  When I saw this model for only $10 more than my 9W, I purchased it right away.  From the very first time I used it, I could feel how much harder the polish set, and in a fraction of the time.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with lifting anymore.  Since professionals in my area charge $40 for a gel polish application, this unit paid for itself the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I bought this uv lamp to do my own Gelish nails at home. I&#x27;m glad that all the bulbs work. The timer works well too. I put some sunblock on my hands before doing my nails. You have to protect yourself of course. Product works great. My Gelish nails get cured nicely. You ha e to wipe off the stickiness with some 70% isopropyl alcohol.  Love it</li>
    <li> This uv gel lamp works perfect. I can&#x27;t believe it for the price too. I bought this lamp, cnd base coat, gel color and top coat. My nails are salon perfect.  I can&#x27;t believe how much time and money I am already saving. I&#x27;ll recoup my investment in just 2 more manicures! I am really proud of myself!!  You can do it too!</li>
    <li> The UV dryer that I received was not what the company&#x27;s description stated. The item had no label on the top and did not come with the instruction manual or the gift nail file.  Also, more importantly, the UV dryer only had the 120 timer on/off setting and did not have the 180 seconds setting. Because the item shipped was not the item described I had to return the item and reorder another more expensive lamp without the warranty that I would receive the UV dryer described.  I give it two stars because it came early.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. My nails cure very well and I love the 2 and 3 minute timer, its very helpful.  Awesome purchase.</li>
    <li> I received this lamp about a week ago and have been dying to do my nails but haven&#x27;t had time. I finally had time to it today, shaped and buffed my nails and cut cuticles buffed. Then I realized I never opened the box of the lamp. I installed the bulbs and the lamp wouldn&#x27;t turn on! I tried a different outlet, but no luck. I&#x27;m super disappointed, but at least Amazon is taking it back with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this same brand of dryer from another vendor and it didnt even turn on when I received it, so I returned the first one. I ordered it again, giving the product the benefit of the doubt.  This one, I could not get the bulbs in and when I attempted to move a bracket so I could plug the lights in the bracket broke.  I was then able to get the bulbs in and low and behold only one of the bulbs turned on!  I returned it immediately and ordered a different brand.</li>
    <li> I recently was in my daughters cosmetology class getting my nails done when I heard the students talking about the UV lamps that they used for the gel nails and how expensive they were. One of the students spoke up and told the class that she had purchased a lamp at a much discounted price and found that it worked just as good as the ones they used at the school. I decided to order this lamp and give it a try. She was right, I can not tell a difference between this one and the $200 one that the school uses, I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Before you consider purchasing products for doing Gel Nails at home, you should add the Nail Dryer Pro to your list.  It cures the nails.  I made the mistake of not purchasing it and my nails did not dry properly.  It is an investment that will save you hundreds of dollars.  It is small, light weight, and efficient.</li>
    <li> When I plugged the dryer in it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I tried different outlets and taking bulbs in and out, still no luck. Shipping back and trying a different company since this same thing has happended to so many other shoppers.</li>
    <li> I just recently started doing shellac for myself.  I was tempted to shell out $80+ on a &#x27;better&#x27; lamp, but I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t, as this one works great.</li>
    <li> This uv light has been good so far. Although I have had some issues with getting the thumbs to cure. I have to have my client put their hand in at an awkward angle in order to cure all the way. Other than that it is great.</li>
    <li> If you read anything, read this.  Horrible experience!  Imagine my excitement as I am prepping my nails to be done only to find that the plug for this lamp was an European plugin.  When I was unable to contact the company, I left a negative review.  They then responded wanting to make it right.  I know mistakes happen so I let them resend me the correct lamp.  When I received \\&quot;new\\&quot; lamp you would have thought that I would have learned my lesson!  Got everything out again but this time had not started my nails.  I plugged it in and NOTHING HAPPENED!!  Took out the bulbs and replaced them again Nothing Happened!  So FRUSTRATING!  I wish this was the end of the story (Thank God that Amazon gives free Shipping back for products)!  I returned the first item via Amazon. The second item I still have and will just put in the trash where it belongs because 17 EMAILS LATER I AM DONE!</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received my shellac products &amp; get started doing mine &amp; my daughters nails &amp; quit spending money at the salons,ONLY to find this product had a short in it &amp; it took 15mts of pressing the on button for it to finally come on &amp; now it seems it doesnt work at all....very upset &amp; I want my money back!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give 0 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get this lamp in the mail and couldn&#x27;t WAIT to get going on my Gelish manicure. When my lamp came I ripped it open, installed the bulbs, got really psyched to do my nails, plugged it in, and....NOTHING. I thought \\&quot;Maybe it&#x27;s a bad outlet\\&quot; - tried it in 3 different outlets and still NOTHING. This thing was a dud straight out of the box! My dreams of gel nails are dashed straight from the get go. I knew the price was too good to be true. Don&#x27;t waste your money, folks. Unless you&#x27;re willing to gamble - either it works or it doesn&#x27;t. Mine didn&#x27;t. :-(</li>
    <li> You def. get great value for this product. Before I started doing my own gel manicures, I was busting out $30+ bucks a pop at the salon. This way cuts down on that, plus I kinda like being self sufficient. :)</li>
    <li> My daughter and I bought all the stuff needed to do our own gel or shalack nails. It was costing $35 a visit so we managed to spend $90 and have enough to last months and still have this UV lamp. I give it a 10  star rateing for price and efectiveness on getting the job done. Hopeing the replacement bulbs are not too high though...</li>
    <li> I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this product. The description states that this is the \\&quot;US Version\\&quot; of this dryer and the picture depicts it as so, yet I was sent a dryer equipped with a European plug. How would that be useful to me? Additionally, I had reason to believe that this dryer was  not a USpicy brand dryer due to the fact that it came in a generic box with absolutely no labels. Though I was not able to plug it in, it seemed used, cheap, and poorly made. I was not expecting this poor of a product and will never purchase from this seller again. It was a complete waste of my money, don&#x27;t bother purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> brought this to start doing my own gel manicures at home. works awesome... very easy to use.... a must have ladies! 😉</li>
    <li> I have ordered this item twice. The first one I received was just fine, correct plug, works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I ordered it, they sent it with a foreign plug and the wrong voltage. It wouldn&#x27;t work in the US even with a plug adapter. I hesitate to re-order because I&#x27;m concerned they&#x27;ll send the wrong version again.</li>
    <li> I used this dryer with Harmony &amp;#34;gelish&amp;#34; nail polish and it took 2 minutes to cure each coat but it was a true 2 minutes, no more time necessary which I love! Its a great dryer!!</li>
    <li> Real nice uv light! Was easy to install bulbs. Has a setting on the back for either 2 or 3 minutes. Came in a nice box. Works good so far!</li>
    <li> I bought this light with the intention of doing my own gelish/shellac manicures. After viewing all the lamps, I decided on this one. Such an AMAZING decision! For the low price of around 25 dollars, you get the exact amount of curing needed in about 90-120 sec intervals. Works great!!</li>
    <li> I bought this light to use with the Gelish colored gel nail system I purchased at Sally Beauty supply.  It worked perfectly! I couldn&#x27;t be happier and since salons charge $30-$40 for gel nails, it pays for itself after the first use!</li>
    <li> This lamp surprised me. There are 4 blubs inside they they are very bright. I used this to cure Gelish products and it worked great! The only thing I would change is a digital timer. But hey, cant have it all! Very good buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this product has such a good rating. I like others received my lamp put the light bulbs in and...... NOTHING happened. SO I took them out tried different bulbs and had the same result. So I sent it back. I was very disappointed. I think it might be worth spending a little more to not be disappointed and get a better quality product. Amazon was great about the return...Love amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> This is my first UV light for my nails, but I have to say its fantastic. The price was fantastic and I love that it times the light so you can sit back and relax. It&#x27;s a quick push of a button. I have NO complaints!</li>
    <li> I received this product on time and was able to use it on my nails for New Year&#x27;s Eve.  I&#x27;ve been using the Gelish system since June and was using a smaller Uv light.  I started looking for a bigger lamp, and was happy when I found this one; it is quite affordable.  This lamp is very easy to use.  My whole hand fit inside comfortably.  The timer is very convenient!  I will recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality lamp for a reasonable price.  I am more than satisfied with it!</li>
    <li> This lamp works very well. When I first received the machine and originally put in the bulbs, I didn&#x27;t push them in hard enough. I thought it didn&#x27;t work. However, after unscrewing and removing the bottom, I had a little more leverage to gently push them in further.  Once I did that, the machine worked great. I&#x27;m super happy with this purchase in combination with CND Shellac products.  Note that the bottom floor plate does not slide out like it says on the box. It does have to be unscrewed. However, it still works very well for fingernails and (more carefully) for toenails.  Shipping took awhile since it was sent from FL to CA via UPS.  I love saving money and doing my shellac at home.  On a side note, search on youtube for CND Shellac is you&#x27;re a beginner. There are some very informative and instructional videos.</li>
    <li> I have used the light several times now to do Gel Polish manicures, and the light cures the polish on the lowest time setting with no problems.  I&#x27;ve read complaints for other light products that say people have to double or triple exposure times, and you definitely don&#x27;t with this light.  I would definitely recommend this light to anyone looking to do Gel manicures.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t powerful enough to cure shellac.  After three (3) 180 second sessions my nails were still tacky.  They eventually dried, but within a week the shellac was peeling.  Unfortunately, I waited too long to attempt a return and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> I just got my UV lamp and I don&#x27;t know how it works because it has an European plug!?!? The product description doesn&#x27;t mention it, and the product image doesn&#x27;t show it either, so I guess it can either come with an US plug or an European plug...if you&#x27;re not willing to buy a plug adapter, return this product!</li>
    <li> Good product works how you would want it to the only thing is, is that the bottom is removable like it said it would be. This is great for at home use not to fancy just does it&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> I got my USA version and it had a European plug on it WTH?? So I sent it back. So beware.</li>
    <li> As a Three year Nail Technician, I do quite a lot of Gel Nail (which have to be &#x27;cured&#x27; under these lamps). This one is of better quality, than the first one I purchased a year ago, and works wonderfully. I would highly recommend this product to any professional that does gel nails.</li>
    <li> This product is just &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not very durable, and one of the lights / light plug- in holes shorted out so even with a light bulb change,  it would still be no good.  I can hear the pieces rattling around in there.  It does it&#x27;s job and is ok for a home model.  But the negative is that it can get damaged in the shipping process as mine may have and getting it fixed (even if that&#x27;s an option) would cost more than the unit.  And not sure where to get replacement bulbs - ( didn&#x27;t really look, either) - just feels like a lot of hassle.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this item. I love that it has a timer, makes it so easy and not having to count or watch the time.</li>
    <li> Love this light, works perfect and my gem manicures are awesome! Have used it a few times and I will never pay a ton to get them done again! So happy</li>
    <li> Works for both fingers and toes :) great price easy to use and compact enough to not take up too much space</li>
    <li> this product is very good, i&#x27;d like it becouse i love to make a gel polish for my nails, its give a good result in a small time to finishing my nails, but its take more time to shipping to me, although i read its take 2 day for free shipping.</li>
    <li> Product is incredibly easy to use - READ THE INSTRUCTIONS for both the machine and for shellac nail polish. The CND website has step by step instructions that were great. Reading the &amp;#34;bad reviews, it looks like folks had two problems, the first the machine didn&#x27;t turn on - most likely cause is the bulbs weren&#x27;t in fully - first time I tried to turn it on my bulbs did not go on, I had to push the bulbs in harder. The second I see is the nail polish is still sticky after curing under the light - most likely cause, didn&#x27;t fully wipe down the nails with alcohol after curing, until that&#x27;s done, the nails appear &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> The machine is easy to assemble. The timer makes it easy for me to know when I&#x27;m done. Also, the gloves are a plus because if you&#x27;re like me and like to do your nails every week, then you will need them to protect your hands.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for home use. When it came everything was packaged very neatly. I had a little trouble getting the bulbs installed but I found that if you unscrew the bottom plate installation is much easier and you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking the bulbs. It is the perfect size and you can reuse the box for storage to prevent damage. Love it and the optional timer feature is great.</li>
    <li> It was really excited for this product to arrive. I did my toes and it worked well. Then I got to my fingernails and after one coat the machine just shut down. It now will not turn on and is completely broken. I am appalled that after ten minutes of use the item would break.</li>
    <li> When I first put the bulbs in I found them to be unstable. I had to put a lot of pressure  to get the bulbs in snugly enough to work. Now I am concerned when I have to remove them if they will break during the process</li>
    <li> It does what it say it will do. I love this product for salon and at home use. The only thing is you have to make sure after a while the lights on the sides are in place or curing (drying) is uneven. You can avoid this problem by proper storage of the machine when not in use.</li>
    <li> Item just as advertised</li>
    <li> The machine has already paid for itself several times. Works great, no more $30 gel nails for this family. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> The lamp worked well, but I did not receive the free gloves that was supposed to come with it, instead I got an emory board.</li>
    <li> Great machine for a resonable price, just like the nail salon! I will no longer go to the nail shop and &amp;#34;pick a color&amp;#34;.  I am my own nail shop.  However the description said that this would come with a pair of Uspicy gloves and it didnt, I want my gloves!</li>
    <li> I found this dyer to be very reliable and accurate. Dries without issues. I had purchased this one because it was affordable and seemed to be a great quality dyer. It very much was. I would like to try other of their products. A great plug is that the manufacturer stands behind their product. The warranty is great. For such a great price and all the bonuses I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> It was great and on time . Thanks</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get mt USpicy machine, but when it came in the mail the machine showed it was on but it didn&#x27;t work corrrectly. So now i have all this gel nail stuff but no machine to use.</li>
    <li> This dryer works very well does not burn your nail when the gel is on also dries nail polish well.</li>
    <li> Came in time! Nicely packed I tried it out a several times before acuatlly writing a review. The lamp comes with 4 light bulbs which you just slip right into place, all of them were good but I noticed that one of the light bulbs was getting lose so I would have to retake it out and pop back in to place while I&#x27;m trying to cruel my nails. It comes with some UV gloves which I think are great!!! You Dont want to expose your had to much to UV lights .&lt;br /&gt;The lamp is great and I would recommend it ;)</li>
    <li> I have used this light for almost 2 years. I purchased it along with gel polish in order to save money at the salon. Having used this almost once every other week for 2 years I have never had to replace a bulb. This is a great product and great quality. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love the nail dryer and the super fast delivery, highly recommend.Dryer works great.Has a timer and came with uv gloves</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. The thing does toes and fingers. If she likes it, I like it. Polish runs about 12 bucks. Is that expensive?</li>
    <li> Sent the item back as all of the bulbs were broken when I received it.</li>
    <li> Used this for Shellac and it worked wonderfully.  It is larger than I thought, but it works well.  Hand or foot comfortably fits inside.</li>
    <li> I love my USpicy nail dryer!  It works perfectly!  I use it with the Gelish polish for curing my nails. I just got tired of paying so much at the nail salon to have my nails done.  It has already saved me so much money.  It easy with the USpicy nail dryer.  I really like the timer.  I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to do their own nails.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to as far as the little buttons/switches but once you get it and get comfortable with a cure time you will be a pro. I LOVE my at home gel manicures now.</li>
    <li> This was a moderately priced lamp. The free glove and file are a definite plus. The timer feature is perfect! With the model I ordered the bulbs needed to be firmly pushed into place (listen for a loud click). It was easy once I got over the fear of breaking them.</li>
    <li> GREAT price for salon quality UV light. It takes a few minutes longer than an LED dryer but if you aren&#x27;t too impatient I would recommend this light. Came all in one piece with minor assembly required for light bulbs. Nothing was broken. If you want to do your gel nails at home with a professional sized UV light, this one is for you! I love mine!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!! it&#x27;s fabulous! Price is great and product works amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the light twice so far to manicure my nails with gel poilsh. The light bulbs popped right into place and all light up as they are suppose to. Packaging came well padded. The gloves fit my mother and myself. Be sure that your polish is fully dry before removing the gloves. I&#x27;m happy to have this paired with a gel polish kit that I also bought on Amazon. Everyone wants me to do their nails!</li>
    <li> This product was perfect to begin my journey of DIY gel manicures. I was looking for a 36 watt UV lamp that would cure Gelish polish and this product fit the bill. It arrived quickly, was well packaged, and as described. Since purchasing this, I have done 3 manicures on myself and each have turned out really well. The best thing is that the UV lamp is VERY reasonably priced, which means the products I bought have already paid for themselves. Previously, I was spending $30-33(depending on whether or not I got a French Manicure)every 2-3 weeks to get them professionally done. An extra bonus is that I am now more likely to also do my own pedicures and avoid the nail salon altogether. Buying this has already saved me money!!!</li>
    <li> If you need a gel lamp, why spend more money? Unless you are a professional who already has dozens of clients with the need to place both hands in, this product is a deal! Does the work, easy to set up, and convenient timers on it! This lamp does not disappoint!</li>
    <li> I got this for x-mas for my wife and it was a big let down. The box it came in was kind of clunky the item barely fit in properly, I chose to ignore it(big mistake). Me and my wife were exchanging presents early and when she open this thing she looked disappointed and with good reason I didn&#x27;t say how much it cost but she felt that I probably paid too much. I tried to stay positive but when I go to set up the machine by putting the light bulbs in there I noticed that one of the sockets has what seemed to be the leftover or another light bulb already in there. I tried to remove it but it felt like I was pulling the whole thing apart. I have no doubt that this belong to someone else, it was returned and then the seller just sold back to me. I already started the process to return it my self. Honestly my wife never tried the machine but I&#x27;m not even going to try and get a replacement. The seller was lazy to say the least, never going to buy from them ever again and netheir should you.</li>
    <li> The first Dry and Cure we ordered for our daughter for christmas came with the back inner heat guard broken.  So that was very dispointing to have to return it.  The second one which we ordered came quickly and is working great.  The return was easy and they credited our visa back so we were thankful that went well as we have never had to return an Amazon purchase.  I am trying the nail dryer now using OPI polish from Walmart...we&#x27;ll see it that goes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with this one... it didn&#x27;t do a thing.  I tried switching the light bulbs and hitting the timer and switch... nothing.  It just doesn&#x27;t work.  Seems like enough people say this.  Interestingly, there is a better rating on the same product with a higher price.  Makes me wonder if they ship the defective ones at the lower price.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good quality, inexpensive for home or professional use. No issues with this set and what a money saver! I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have only been able to use the product once but it performed perfectly.  My nails came out hard and the only problems I had were application issues, not related to the lamp.  I had read so many reviews of other products were the people were unhappy so I was leery of buying one.  Since I had a gift card, I gave it a try.  I am really glad I did.  Beautiful nails.  The only thing I would change would be to have a shorter time option on the timer.  Undercoats do not require 120 seconds, only 30 or so.  So I was unable to use the timer for most of the coats and had to operate it manually.  Small price to pay for a nice polish job.</li>
    <li> I bought this UV Lamp after another, lower model, USpicy lamp of mine was defective and didn&#x27;t work. I was so excited to receive this product in the mail, only to discover that....SURPRISE....this lamp didn&#x27;t work either. After doing some research I saw that this was a common problem. If lamps did work, they died quickly. USpicy lamps may be a great price but it&#x27;s reflected in their quality.</li>
    <li> I have had the nail dryier for 6 months now, and so far it has been working great. I use it once every 3 or 4 weeks, and so far I had no problems with bulbs or other issues. It is pretty light, it finishes the job quickly...in a few words, it is doing what one would expect it to do, no more no less. And for me, this is enough (given the low price).</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money.  I bought it not even six months ago and its already died.  I tried it in a couple different outlets and it still doesnt work.  Such a waste of time ordering it!</li>
    <li> Works well! Has already paid for itself and the polishes I had to buy in just 3 manicures! Needed 2 more words. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It works, but takes so much longer than LED. Save your money up and buy an LED!!</li>
    <li> I use this with regular (non-gel, non-shellac) polish. Works GREAT! I love being able to have great looking nails in 30 minutes without a trip to the salon and without $15 a pop! (30 mins &#x3D; base coat, 2 cycles of light, 2 coats color with 2 cycles of light after each, top coat with 3 cycles.) Large enough for pedi&#x27;s too!</li>
    <li> Since the day I got this, one of the bulbs hasn&#x27;t worked. It just sits in there and flickers. It is one of the side lamps, so whenever I&#x27;m curing my nails, I have to turn them to the side or that side doesn&#x27;t cure. Not a good purchase...</li>
    <li> the light works fine. The bulbs and everything came packaged nicely and wasn&#x27;t broken. I had to play around with the bulbs once I put them in because they had to be place just right in the socket. Other than then that, it works fine, except that it&#x27;s only one hand placement and it takes longer.</li>
    <li> Happy I chose this product. It works very well for regular polishes and our Gelish no chip polishes. Yes, is take 2 minutes to dry each coat for the no chip Gelish polishes but it was worth saving the money on the lamps the does it in 30 seconds. I don’t mind relaxing for that extra 1 ½ minutes.</li>
    <li> As many have already stated, unit did not turn on. I followed the directions, even had my brother follow the directions to make sure I was not missing something. Not worth the hassle, just spend $20 more and get a reliable unit.</li>
    <li> Product in working condition upon arrival, but only worked with certain brand gel polishes. Within two uses, bulbs or circuit burnt out. Absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews so I was aware that people were having reliability problems but there was&lt;br /&gt;also some good reviews. The nail machine was deliver as agreed however 1 out of 4 lights&lt;br /&gt;did not work...we changed the bulb and it still did not work.  so we are sending the machine&lt;br /&gt;back today for a refund.  sorry:(</li>
    <li> The order went well, arrived quickly and well packed with my Prime account purchase.  But this was not a \\&quot;USA Edition\\&quot;.  The plug was not compatible with US outlets.  Had to return.</li>
    <li> The picture depicts it with an American plug, however it arrived with a European plug !&lt;br /&gt;Does not heat up.&lt;br /&gt;Wasted money- can&#x27;t use for anything now.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;DRIES MY GEL EXTREMELY FAST.&lt;br /&gt;REALLY EASY AND QUICK TO CHANGE THE LIGHT BULBS.&lt;br /&gt;AND THE GLOVES ADD EXTRA PROTECTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works very well, good quality, the strength is perfect for drying. I would recommend purchasing if you are interested in doing your own  gel manicures</li>
    <li> The wattage is not strong enough to cure Chellac polish - even though it said it would be. It woked kind of ok, but I would reccommend a stronger wattage if you are using it to cure chellac or gel nails - I seriously doubt it would be strong enough for acrylic, but I didn&#x27;t try it for that type.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a novice to do gelish manicures at home. It works great and has lasted 2 years already. Saves me a bunch of money every month and paid for itself within a few uses.</li>
    <li> The light hasn&#x27;t worked for me yet. The bulbs didn&#x27;t work when the machine arrived. I just haven&#x27;t had time to return it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this nail dryer and was very happy to get it so quickly and quickly disappointed to find that it had a broken bulb and the wrong plug in. I contacted the seller and was very happy with the quick response to resolve the problem. He immediately sent a replacement unit and i received it within just a couple days. I just have to say i know things happen, but when a company stands behind their product and takes care of any issue means more to me than being perfect every time.  I will definitely order from this company again! The nail dryer has worked to my expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl and she seems to love it, so I assume it is good. Sorry I can not be more helpful.</li>
    <li> I just wish that it would help regular nail polish dry faster too. I really liked the box and its presentation :)</li>
    <li> I like it, still using</li>
    <li> My daughter is becomming a professional doing acrylic Nails and loves the product she has profession tools and has become a pretty good nail designer also; We get good deals and not expensive products than ks for your products that extend so much toold and designs with decoration and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my 2nd lamp.  The first one was purchased in 2011 and has faithfully worked for 3 years.  I was so happy with it that when my lamp finally crapped out (which might have been from the diet coke that my puppy spilled in it), I decided to stick with what has worked and purchased another one.  Can&#x27;t wait to get it and get back to doing my nails!</li>
    <li> What a piece of garbage.  It worked for like a day and then just cut out.  Couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  No instructions.  No idea why it wasn&#x27;t working.  It just stopped.</li>
    <li> Folks, this is it. I have used this light for nearly 2 years and it works as good as it did the day I got it. Since then, I&#x27;ve become somewhat of an unofficial ambassador for at home gel manicures (in my own mind, anyway). I&#x27;ve had at about 10 people purchase this light based on my recommendation and I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad yet. I have probably used it about 40 times on myself and have used it on a couple of others. I get a lot of compliments on my nails. I type a lot at work and school and I hate the look of chipped polish, so doing the gel manicures myself has saved me money and makes me feel put together. For me, the polish can last anywhere from 7 to 14 days. Some polishes last longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;*I use Gelish brand nail polish that I get from Amazon. Love that you get a large bottle for arond $12 (when it&#x27;s $14 for a mini in stores).[[ASIN:B004T49ZEK Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Jet Set]]&lt;br /&gt;*When doing your manicure, be sure to wear the UV gloves.[[ASIN:B009YSXB3M USpicy Anti-UV Gloves for UV Light / Lamp / Nail Dryer &amp; LED UV Nail Dryer Curing]]&lt;br /&gt;*Do not get the polish on your skin, or it will case the polish to lift.&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t worry if your polish has some imperfections when you&#x27;re applying it.

    <li> Loved when I first received, but it malfunctioned after just a few weeks. Had to return. Not a happy person!</li>
    <li> Works really well. I normally use nail spray but the Uspicy works better and much faster. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but gets the job done, cheap parts. But fast delivery !</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work your client has to keep switching hands. It takes forever for the coats to dry. The thinnest coats mind you. Spend a little more and get a better product. I don&#x27;t even use this anymore.</li>
    <li> This UV nail lamp arrived quickly and came with exacly what was pictured! I was expecting gloves as well with the nail lamp. However, after receiving the product and coming back to read the product description it does state&lt;br /&gt; - 1 * USpicy nail dryer gel curing UV Lamp&lt;br /&gt;- 4 * 9W 365mm UV Bulb&lt;br /&gt;- 1 * Free Nail Sanding file&lt;br /&gt;Although disappointed that it did NOT come with the free pair of UV protective gloves stated in the title I would purchase again and recommend this item.</li>
    <li> i love it but one lite bulb was not working!</li>
    <li> The nail dryer works great! I received it fast and it ended up coming with more accessories than I thought it would! I would recommend this for anyone wanting to do their own gel nails.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. Did not cure nail at all.  What a mess.  I applied very thin coat of gelfish polish. On a good note the company was great and I was able to return the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year now, and honestly I&#x27;m not the most gentle to it. And although over the last six months I have used it maybe three times, it&#x27;s still going strong and has never once lead me to think it&#x27;s going to stop. The shipping was fast, and the product was just as described. I paid a very fair price and I am more than happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I received this item before the shippment day, it is perfect, light weight, made with sturdy material and easy to use. I recommend this product to any one that is looking for a gel lamp, this one is better than the one they use at the shop I frequent.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great! The only problem is that one of the bulbs is always loose, besides that it&#x27;s been working well!!</li>
    <li> Love this! Started doing nails at home very novice. Looked up how to do on you tube and decided to buy this. Very good price and does job great. Nothing broken or wrong with it. Easy to assemble. Common sense assembly. I cure for 2 min each layer and also use a ph bond before to help prep nails. I&#x27;m hard on my hands and my mani last about 10-14 days and my nails last anywhere from 2 weeks or longer. Very Happy!</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.  I would happily do business with this seller again in the future.  Why would you pay to have this stuff done at a salon when you can buy all the stuff for so much less.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed with this product.  Had to dry my nails 3 times in the timed mode or for over 6 minutes in the untimed mode to make my gelish nail polish to dry.  Returned it with no problems.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I expected.  I received the package on time, but the product was made with a european plug.  I did not bother to contact seller for a return, I went ahead a bought a european outlet converter.  Once I received the converter my lamp was able to cure.  Then I accidentally broke one of the lights.  I bought a replacement but it did not work, again because it was made for european materials.  I was not happy with this product at all and now I can&#x27;t even contact seller.  I bought another lamp Thermal Spa 49135 Professional and am very happy with this lamp.  It was made for American outlets and cures in seconds.  Even though, it is a bit more expensive I would highly recommend purchasing another UV lamp over this one.</li>
    <li> Plugged the lamp in to test it, worked first time. It did not turn on after that. I read the instructions, and tried each step over and over. I called the 1-800 number, got a fast busy and number has been disconnected. Did not try to email these folks, just threw it in the trash. Not worth the effort. I would consider some other product, as this USpicy UV Nail Dryer failed.</li>
    <li> good for the gels... if you dont have a lot of money for a OPI or Shellac UV Lamp... this is good for any gel manicure or gel tips...</li>
    <li> It does the job! The timer is a very nice feature. The \\&quot;box\\&quot; is large enough to fit one foot too.</li>
