      <li>With the primary wax he is able to train his mustache.  </li>

      <li>There are days when I want to leave the stache &amp;#34;down&amp;#34;, so I use the primary wax</li>
      <li>Can You Handlebar Primary Wax.</li>
      <li>important:  </li>
      <li>I cannot express enough how happy I am with this wax.  </li>
      <li>There are two important attributes:  </li>
      <li>So, the manufacturer is right in suggesting that you purchase both waxes and use them as appropriate.  </li>
      <li>It has super strong holding power.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Honest Amish and it works beautifully to apply but loses hold in about an hour.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to get this product to review my experiences with it and share.  </li>
      <li>But, well worth it, and will be purchasing again!</li>
      <li>Using a hair dryer to cool the wax and set it in your mustache helps keep excess wax under control, however, I tend to not need much of the secondary wax for a great hold, so doing this just to set the wax faster is great.</li>
      <li>You warm it in your hand or with the lid closed under warm water since it is made of bees wax.  </li>
      <li>The primary holds the mustache well and the secondary holds the tips/edges great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it would look great from light blond to dark colored hair.</li>
      <li>both waxes wash out nicely with soap, hot water, and a bit of gentle massaging.  </li>
      <li>Then wax the heck out of the ends, let &#x27;em cool and shape &#x27;em</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll periodically open the can up just to take a whiff, it smells that good.  </li>
      <li>The secondary wax fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
      <li>a tad bit discolored, not bad though, looks as if I were a smoker.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for a friend and he is now a loyal customer too.</li>
      <li>but it dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>primary wax goes on more easily (useful if I&#x27;m in a rush) but only lasts for several hours before hairs are heading in their own direction.</li>
      <li>It has no artificial dyes or fragrances.</li>
      <li>Works well and the non scented does have a distinct smell</li>
      <li>I love how soft my husbands mustache feels now.</li>
      <li>The Primary was great for the colder climes - I&#x27;m in the tropics now, so I have high hopes that the Firm Hold will keep my stache where it belongs.  </li>
      <li>my bars stay looking great all day, and also the wax is pretty much &#x27;invisible&#x27; if you put it on right (not too much), so you don&#x27;t end up looking like you stuck a piece of plastic to your upper lip.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll first use the primary wax on the whole moustache and create the shape I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
      <li>The primary is great for getting a little control of your whiskers but keeping a natural look.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, the very next day in the mail was a coupon for more</li>
      <li>really recommend using a hair dryer to facilitate getting a full even distribution.</li>
      <li>My main goal is to keep it out of my mouth since it is so long, but in the South Texas heat, I&#x27;ve come to find out that wax isn&#x27;t a good solution.</li>
      <li>It works great -- except that the ends wouldn&#x27;t hold their shape all day (especially when it&#x27;s over 100°F outside!).</li>
      <li>Amazing hold for a large handlebar in the humid heat of southern Ga. Solid product,  out of dozens of products I&#x27;ve tried this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>The secondary wax was just the thing to take my state and make it look great throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
      <li>The secondary wax is great for keeping his beard tamed in windy weather.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So I got this for my son. I was able to get this at a discount as a part of a promotion in exchange for a review with my honest and unbiased opinion.  My son who has a mustache is interested in having a handle bar mustache, so this product is perfect for him.  With the primary wax he is able to train his mustache.  It&#x27;s like a hair wax that you use on your hair.  He has been using this religiously every day and he loves the control that it give him.  He is almost ready to move on to the secondary mustache wax which provides him more control.  I can&#x27;t personally tell you how this works since I don&#x27;t have a mustache.  I can only tell you that if he likes it and is using it everyday, then it must be a really good product.  I can tell you that I have gotten other products from this company and those that have used it are extremely happy with the products including this one.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely well produced product. For a beginning mustache waxer, this product is king. Not only do you get standard wax, you get extra strength for your coarse, wire-y facial hair like mine. I started waxing not to long ago, and was using your average drug store hair wax and pomade fair, but with very poor results. I recommend this to people who want an all-day hold that doesn&#x27;t need much (if any) refinishing during the day. Using a hair dryer to cool the wax and set it in your mustache helps keep excess wax under control, however, I tend to not need much of the secondary wax for a great hold, so doing this just to set the wax faster is great. The friendly &amp;#34;grooming tips&amp;#34; email from the company was also a fine touch to an already wonderful product. I would definitely recommend this to friends and strangers alike. &amp;#34;Can You Handlebar&amp;#34; has become my favorite brand and will probabaly hold that place for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I&#x27;ve used Beardbrand previously and also Clubman.  CanYouHandlebar is way better than Clubman but is comparable to Beardbrand.  The &amp;#34;Primary&amp;#34; is hard but not nearly as hard as the &amp;#34;Secondary&amp;#34;, which is fine.  I usually do the natural mustache look so the primary is my go to.  Some reviewers complained it was impossible to get it to melt but I had no issues.  Scrap some up with the back of your fingernail and rub with your index and thumb until it is tacky..add heat from your mouth to expedite the process.  It works well and smells great.</li>
    <li> As my moustache grew longer, it was obvious that I needed wax.  That started a string of purchases, some OK, some not, but I outgrew the &#x27;OK&#x27; ones as the hair got longer.  I needed hold.  The secondary wax fits the bill perfectly.  There are two important attributes:  my bars stay looking great all day, and also the wax is pretty much &#x27;invisible&#x27; if you put it on right (not too much), so you don&#x27;t end up looking like you stuck a piece of plastic to your upper lip.  The wax also passed a rigorous stress test:  I rode roller coasters all day without mussing a single hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secondary wax is VERY stiff.  So, the manufacturer is right in suggesting that you purchase both waxes and use them as appropriate.  I use the primary wax for the middle hairs, where some hold is necessary but that&#x27;s also where your lips actually move so having super stiff wax is uncomfortable (at least to me).  The secondary goes on the long &#x27;handlebar&#x27; hairs for hold and shaping.  I use both at about the same rate, so the two-pack works out well.  There are days when I want to leave the stache &amp;#34;down&amp;#34;, so I use the primary wax only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also important:  both waxes wash out nicely with soap, hot water, and a bit of gentle massaging.  Other waxes I have tried seem impossible to remove, so eventually it felt like having a junky crayon stuck on my upper lip.</li>
    <li> I would attest in a most graceful yet appropriately boastful vigor. That a true gentleman of sound resourcefulness would revere such an appanage of this patronage as this: The one and only store where prestigious masculinity can be espied amongst the whitest noise of mediocrity!</li>
    <li> great  product. and even better company . thanks</li>
    <li> Got htis as a gift for my dad. He has a truly epic 12 inch handlebar, but, he&#x27;s always had some trouble keeping it neat and tight. He loves this product and I&#x27;m so happy to see how proud he is of his beautiful mustache.</li>
    <li> Little yellow Santa doesn&#x27;t need that</li>
    <li> Good hold. Use the back of your thumb nail to scrape off some product (it is stiff if you don&#x27;t heat the closed package in some warm water). It has a slight odor but it dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! The primary holds the mustache well and the secondary holds the tips/edges great! I wish it was scented though but still a great product that does the trick.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! Excellent hold and very easy to apply. Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product. This was my 4th attempt at finding real mustache wax. This s*** is leggit.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about using this wax to keep my stache under control. My main goal is to keep it out of my mouth since it is so long, but in the South Texas heat, I&#x27;ve come to find out that wax isn&#x27;t a good solution. It&#x27;s just too pliable and doesn&#x27;t firm up to keep things in place. Yeah I can handle bar but not with this wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that I would have to continually re-apply and play with my beard all the time to make it stay put. I really need something less high maint.</li>
    <li> Great product and outstanding customer service. Answered questions very quickly. Use it myself daily. Bought this for a friend and he is now a loyal customer too.</li>
    <li> Amazing hold for a large handlebar in the humid heat of southern Ga. Solid product,  out of dozens of products I&#x27;ve tried this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I am loving this set of an you Handlebar mustache waxes! The primary is great for making my mans beard soft and not so scratchy. The fact that they have no added scents or colors is a huge plus! My man has a sensitive face. Some products we have tried have caused major itching and even blotchiness. This product did not. The secondary wax is great for keeping his beard tamed in windy weather. I am sold on these great beard waxes! I was offered the opportunity to try these waxes in exchange for an honest review, and im glad I did!</li>
    <li> I finished my first tin of Primary and have ordered the Primary &amp; Firm Hold.  The Primary was great for the colder climes - I&#x27;m in the tropics now, so I have high hopes that the Firm Hold will keep my stache where it belongs.  Nothing like a droopy Wilford Brimley experience to ruin your meal.  I used it daily and the tin lasted a long time.  It better work as my wife won&#x27;t kiss me unless I get the stache under control.  Peace out.</li>
    <li> The secondary wax is the only wax I&#x27;ve found that can keep my handlebar moustache under control for 12 hours. It takes time and is a little difficult to apply but it works very well. This is the only wax I&#x27;ve found that lasts this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary wax goes on more easily (useful if I&#x27;m in a rush) but only lasts for several hours before hairs are heading in their own direction.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The primary is great for getting a little control of your whiskers but keeping a natural look.  I generally use a combination of the 2...the primary to get things settled and the secondary to lock it in place for the whole day.  After you wash it out, you will find your mustache to be well conditioned and soft (the wife will still plant one on you ;) ).</li>
    <li> My husband enjoyed it. He has had fun with the new styles his mustache can now do. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but it does take a while to make pliable with the blow dryer. But, well worth it, and will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> The Primary even has a great hold in this product, much less the secondary.  It works as expected, holds all day, however, the only problem I have is snow white gray hair.  This does leave my moustache a tad bit discolored, not bad though, looks as if I were a smoker.  I&#x27;d say it would look great from light blond to dark colored hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I have some of the &amp;#34;Can you handlebar&amp;#34; primary wax from a previous order. It works great -- except that the ends wouldn&#x27;t hold their shape all day (especially when it&#x27;s over 100°F outside!). So I ordered this set (it&#x27;s $5 cheaper than getting each can individually), and the secondary wax has incredible hold. Heck, I still had handlebars when I woke up this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that there is no added scent at all. The vague honey-like smell of the beeswax is subtle but very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Hello Gentlemen, I am very new to the mustache world, in fact this is my first mustache in 42 years, well ok when I was 16 I had a dashing fuzzy almost transperant caterpiler that emerged on my upper lip. Needless to say the ladies stayed away that year. So now I have a nice start to a good looking Handlebar. I have read all the tips and tricks online about training and teaching this guy how to sit up, speak and roll over. But I was in need of a good wax to keep him out of my business. So I searched around and found Can You Handlebar and jumped right in and bought the Secondary Serious Wax, I was seriously wanting this thing to stay put. So I received the package in the mail just a few days later, and viola my mustache was staying put. But the wax is so hard that it was ripping out hairs as I tried to comb it through with my Fonzi black hair comb. I was discouraged, I used the hair dryer to melt it down a bit and hurry to distribute it throughout but every time it was just so uncomfortable. So I hung my handlebar down and went a month with using hair wax I used to spike up my do, but this was wrong, all wrong. I knew it, my mustache knew it. Luckily, the very next day in the mail was a coupon for more Can You Handlebar Wax. So I decided to check it out again with a more wise and experienced set of eyes. There it was in plain site, the little tin I so impatiently jumped over to find disappointment, Can You Handlebar Primary Wax. I ordered it up, along with a little mustache comb and a few days later I was rolling wax between my fingers. I cautiously applied the small amount to my mustache waiting for the uncomfortable pulling of hairs but NO! it was wonderful! it gently spread throughout like mustache butter, I took my new Can You Handlebar mustache comb and with it&#x27;s little comfortable handle I gently and evenly combed the wax through. It was wonderful. It makes my mustache soft and conditioned, it stays in place and when I want to get some serious action I apply the Secondary Wax to the ends with ease. I may have started this journey as a Amateur Handlebarer, but I leave today a man! Which leaves me to say I CAN HANDLEBAR.</li>
    <li> I had to learn to use this product. I use a heavy guitar pick to scrape small flakes which I roll into a small ball and roll between my fingers to warm. I then start at the middle of my moustache and work the wax in and out to the tips using a blow dryer on low to further soften the wax for even coating. The primary is usually all I need but the secondary comes in handy on those bad moustache days. If you have a hard time getting your moustache to stay in place try the secondary. It has super strong holding power.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about these two babies. This what you need and want if your mustache is a tough untamed one or just would like to have yours on its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 all natural waxes that I would name as the perfect hold waxes to be used as needed or desired. These 2 are the perfect complement for you to mold your mustache as it grows so it gets away from your mouth,  and what you&#x27;ll definitely need if ever wanting to handlebar your soon to be or already long enough mustache. Neutral scent on both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primary Wax &#x3D; low to medium hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondary Wax &#x3D; medium to high hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth mentioning that even though this is wax, your regular shower is enough to have it removed. No hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pea sized amount so you cover your mustache and the mold it. Not much to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it easier to apply it if I used a lighter&#x27;s heat close to my fingers so it was better softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very recommendable products and company!</li>
    <li> The primary is hard as a hockey puck and will not soften enough to use.  I tried keeping it in my pocket, warming it on a radiator, and soaking in hot water but it barely softens.  I tried scraping out a bit with my thumbnail after each heating method to warm it in my fingers, but the portion I could scrape out would only roll into a small hard ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secondary was a bit softer but after soaking the tin in hot water would only smear and roll up into tiny particles.  I&#x27;ve used Honest Amish and it works beautifully to apply but loses hold in about an hour.  I was hoping this product could keep my mustache in place for longer but I can&#x27;t even get it to melt enough to even apply.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to use, makes your moustache looks better. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Both of these waxes are amazing. I use the primary when I want  soft control (just keeping the hairs out of my mouth) and add on the secondary when I want handlebars that will last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend using a hair dryer to facilitate getting a full even distribution. While I have done the &#x27;pick and roll&#x27; method I find that for me at least that requires a lot more work to spread around. Melting a little puddle with the hairdryer lets you get a thin layer of very soft wax on your thumb and forefinger that is easy to apply. A little hairdryer on the &#x27;stache and your &#x27;stache comb will spread the wax evenly. Then wax the heck out of the ends, let &#x27;em cool and shape &#x27;em up.&lt;br /&gt;The All Day Handlebar will be yours...</li>
    <li> Got for husband and he was impressed. What he like is that they were in case that was easy to travel with and if he was in a hurry he could just slide it in his pocket. This is the second &amp;#34;Can you handlebar&amp;#34; product my husband has used and he likes them better than any other brand.</li>
    <li> I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I got them for the men in my family to try because they all seemed to be growing out their mustaches. The product works well with keeping the facial hair soft and moisturized as well as being helpful in getting the ends to turn up. The only complaint we had was taking the extra step to soften it when other products they have bought didn&#x27;t need that. We also used these for my son&#x27;s dreads to help keep the shape and it worked for that too.</li>
    <li> Manly men of the world,&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best wax I have ever used. My moustache is quite large and my hair is very thick and difficult to keep a good hold with. The secondary wax was just the thing to take my state and make it look great throughout the day. The primary is weaker and easier to put in your stache, but the secondary was the real winner for me. This package is great for first time buyers. Try them both and see what you can do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/5 stars!</li>
    <li> Gentlemen, these are the waxes for you.  I have tried a few different waxes in the past few weeks, and Can You Handlebar works best for me thus far.  The ingredients are all natural and include: beeswax, lanolin, castor oil, coconut oil, shea butter, vitamin e, and &amp;#34;high grade essential oils.&amp;#34;  The smell is very masculine yet just mild enough.  I&#x27;ll periodically open the can up just to take a whiff, it smells that good.  Like most quality waxes, it does require some heating up (especially the secondary wax).  Just leave the tin in your pocket, and then scrape the wax out and roll it between your index fingers and thumbs til you can work it.  As for the hold, I usually use a combo of the primary and secondary wax.  I&#x27;ll first use the primary wax on the whole moustache and create the shape I&#x27;m looking for.  The secondary wax is a bit too uncomfortable for the middle hairs but is ideal for shaping the ends of your stache and will usually last the whole day.  I cannot express enough how happy I am with this wax.  Out of the moustache waxes I have used, Can You Handlebar is the only one that I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Delivers exactly what it promises. Some may not like the lack of extra scent, but I personally like the natural wax smell.&lt;br /&gt;The photo is after 9 hours of work; still holding strong.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve already got a pair, then you might as well have a pair of these mustache waxes.  Whether your headed to a competition or a night on the town, this is a must have!  You are in control and can chose to have it styled to last or shaped to have some freedom of movement.  This is a must if you live in a windy area like I do...or if you just give a crap about how you look!</li>
    <li> Works well and the non scented does have a distinct smell</li>
    <li> This is a great set to have.  I love the can you handlebar brand.  I had never heard of it until &amp;#34;No Shave November&amp;#34; came around one year.  Then it was all the rave.  I was excited to get this product to review my experiences with it and share.  Made from quality ingredients. The batches are made by hand, inspected by hand and packaged by hand right in the USA!!  What is not to love about that. The Primary wax makes your hair smoother and more tame.  It has no artificial dyes or fragrances. The Secondary wax is for a firm hold.  On days you want it  to stay put then that one is for you.  The tin they are kept in is great.  You warm it in your hand or with the lid closed under warm water since it is made of bees wax.  A great gift for you or a loved one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; *I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Well I did not know that they made mustache wax until I ordered this set for my husband. He always tries to curl the ends of his mustache and it never works until now. I received instructions on how to use this from an email by the seller. I thought that was great and made our experience a great one in being a first time user. We used a hairdryer to soften the wax. Then we used a Q-tip to get the wax out and unto his mustache. I love how soft my husbands mustache feels now. I would get so irritated by the rough poking hairs and now they are soft and not irritating. I would recommend this to any man with a mustache. I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Man what a great wax combo.  Had been using firehouse.  Struggling to get more then a few hours of hold on the handlebars!  This wax is smooth and works in great!  5 stars</li>
    <li> My beard and moustache is very coarse and I had only tried some wax i got at the local pharmacy, and it wasn&#x27;t doing the job. I figured I needed &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; moustache wax, so I did some research and decided to give this pair a try. I am very happy with the results! I typically use a little of both to style with in the morning, and the hold last all day. Even retains some hold when swimming! I like the ingredients, and the smell is very mild and pleasant. I may sample some other brands, but I will definitely purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> It is excellent. You only need a little and it lasts all day.</li>
