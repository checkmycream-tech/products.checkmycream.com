<ol>
      <li>Especially love this mascara!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Cover girl Bombshell mascara is excellent!</li>
      <li>you Amazon for a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a great mascara to use on days I did not have time to apply the younique mascara.</li>
      <li>Step one stays on great</li>
      <li>The mascara is amazing!</li>
      <li>:) VERY happy with this.</li>
      <li>My wife love it, says this is the best eyeliner she had use it.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and perfectly and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Great Product, packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>I loved all the makeup.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and is a beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>LOVE this!</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>I think it is an amazing deal!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>mom isn&#x27;t used to applying her own liquid eyeliner, so I recommend this type of applicator tip if you are a beginner in applying liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>Kind of like the tubes</li>
      <li>found it a lot easier to use than the liquid eyeliner that comes with a telescope kind of applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I sort of liked this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i really liked it.</li>
      <li>liked the eye shadow a lot.</li>
      <li>But if you are light or fair skinned, it will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Step 2 will make sure your mascara stays on all day and then some.</li>
      <li>The liquid liner comes out smoothly, more so than any I&#x27;ve used, allowing me to get it in the cracks of my lashes.</li>
      <li>I looked for reviews on youtube and a lot of them said that you could apply Step 1 as many times as you like and then finish with Step 2.</li>
      <li>eye liner is okay.</li>
      <li>There is nothing spectacular or special about it.</li>
      <li>The highlighter is a nice universal color, good for most skin types, and the mascara works well.</li>
      <li>Stays on ALL day and does not clump off or rub off easily at all.</li>
      <li>She liked it so much she gave me the money for it!</li>
      <li>Eyeshadow is super cute and stays on through swimming..</li>
      <li>I got one of these as a gift free gift from Ulta.</li>
      <li>Cute set that has good amount of product that last for a long time, definitely worth 5 bucks!!!!</li>
      <li>I love this gift set, so much cheaper to buy it this way!</li>
      <li>On a more positive note, it didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
      <li>mascara is full size.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly for me, but I also use a makeup setting spray, so that might help it set also.</li>
      <li>The mascara itself costs normally 8 or 9 dollars, so what can I ask for more?</li>
      <li>I find myself rarely using the younique anymore.</li>
      <li>Make sure you buy directly from Amazon and not from thirdparty sellers if you are concerned about quality or freshness.</li>
      <li>My lashes look awesome and as good as my friends that wear false lashes and much more expensive mascara.</li>
      <li>The mascara was the main reason I brought this because it works wonders!</li>
      <li>But that is her way of showing she really appreciates something, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;It includes a Bombshell mascara, an intensity eyeliner and eye shadow in a tube.</li>
      <li>However after one use the shadow opened at the top and I have to keep it closed with a bobby pin.</li>
      <li>I really wanted was the mascara</li>
      <li>It was very clumpy and my eye lashes kept sticking.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this item!</li>
      <li>The mascara is OK, however the liner that comes with it is completely dried out.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t bother opening what else was in the set as I had really only been interested in the liner and mascara.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t anything what we thought, but it was for my granddaughter, thought it looked a little cheap.</li>
      <li>eye-shadow is pretty and lasts long...</li>
      <li>be aware of the mascara that it takes longer for it to dry...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice a thickening with the use of the first side but the second end is definitely shinier and slicker.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t take my chances because I am not good at touching up my makeup throughout the day.</li>
      <li>mom is Asian and it looked natural on her.</li>

<li> mascara takes a long time to dry and that makes a messy finish because if you have long lashes like me you get smudges on your lids and hair and then on your face</li>
<li> So in your next purchase of CoverGirl products, you can get a few dollars off on each item.</li>
<li> Weird right?</li>
<li> The mascara was okay, nothing to rave about (I now just use it as a base coat for other mascara), the eyeliner flaked</li>
<li> The mascara and eyeliner are black and the eye shadow is a type of beige, nude color.&lt;br</li>
<li> I was afraid it would be to shimmery, but it provides a nice base for the eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;She looked really glam, in a subtle way.</li>
<li> read that another shopper received a dried out eyeliner.</li>
<li> If you are into BLACK!</li>
<li> eyeliner is a little on the small side.</li>
<li> put a small dab on your eyelids.</li>
<li> Mascara sucks.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s has a thick, liquid consistency.</li>
<li> Removing the mascara was even worse.</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> and this mascara was a hugh disappointment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great Product, packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> I sort of liked this.&lt;br /&gt;To start:&lt;br /&gt;-The mascara takes a long time to dry and that makes a messy finish because if you have long lashes like me you get smudges on your lids and hair and then on your face and oh god! But it does work for a mascara.&lt;br /&gt;-The eyeliner is timid for my liking and if you&#x27;re wearing primer of shadow it doesn&#x27;t color well.&lt;br /&gt;-The eye-shadow is pretty and lasts long... i really liked it.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t anything what we thought, but it was for my granddaughter, thought it looked a little cheap. Sorry</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. The liquid liner comes out smoothly, more so than any I&#x27;ve used, allowing me to get it in the cracks of my lashes. The highlighter is a nice universal color, good for most skin types, and the mascara works well. I don&#x27;t notice a thickening with the use of the first side but the second end is definitely shinier and slicker.</li>
    <li> The mascara was okay, nothing to rave about (I now just use it as a base coat for other mascara), the eyeliner flaked and I didn&#x27;t bother opening what else was in the set as I had really only been interested in the liner and mascara.</li>
    <li> My wife love it, says this is the best eyeliner she had use it.</li>
    <li> Cover girl Bombshell mascara is excellent! My lashes look awesome and as good as my friends that wear false lashes and much more expensive mascara. This does need to be removed with an oil based makeup remover. I use coconut oil to remove it at night. Great product!</li>
    <li> Mascara sucks. I can&#x27;t remove it even with makeup remover and a shower and swimming in the pool. Maybe line lash blast gives me fuller lashes and comes off when I want it to. Eyeshadow is super cute and stays on through swimming.. liner is runny</li>
    <li> I love this gift set, so much cheaper to buy it this way! The mascara was the main reason I brought this because it works wonders! Highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> It is amazing. It got $1.00 off coupon in Amazon, and I purchased this as $4.22. The mascara itself costs normally 8 or 9 dollars, so what can I ask for more? It also got coupon booklet in it. So in your next purchase of CoverGirl products, you can get a few dollars off on each item. I think it is an amazing deal!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware of the mascara that it takes longer for it to dry...</li>
    <li> LOVE this! If you are into BLACK! Eye makeup, this is for you! Stays on ALL day and does not clump off or rub off easily at all. :) VERY happy with this.</li>
    <li> So, I bought this as  a gift for my mom. She liked it so much she gave me the money for it! Weird right? But that is her way of showing she really appreciates something, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;It includes a Bombshell mascara, an intensity eyeliner and eye shadow in a tube. The mascara and eyeliner are black and the eye shadow is a type of beige, nude color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is full size. It has 2 steps of applying. Step 1 adds volume to the lashes and Step 2 is like a regular mascara and seals all the volume in. I looked for reviews on youtube and a lot of them said that you could apply Step 1 as many times as you like and then finish with Step 2. So, no alternating between Step 1 and Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the eye shadow a lot. It&#x27;s has a thick, liquid consistency. It comes in a tube. Kind of like the tubes the lip gloss for kids comes in.&lt;br /&gt;Just put a small dab on your eyelids. If it&#x27;s not enough, you can always put on some more.&lt;br /&gt;My mom is Asian and it looked natural on her. I was afraid it would be to shimmery, but it provides a nice base for the eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;She looked really glam, in a subtle way. Just a hint of shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m darker (blasian) and haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin tone, so I don&#x27;t know how it works for women of color. But if you are light or fair skinned, it will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner is a little on the small side. It has like a marker sort of applicator tip.&lt;br /&gt;My mom isn&#x27;t used to applying her own liquid eyeliner, so I recommend this type of applicator tip if you are a beginner in applying liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;She found it a lot easier to use than the liquid eyeliner that comes with a telescope kind of applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I read that another shopper received a dried out eyeliner. My mom&#x27;s was fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I snagged this set for $5.21 so I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I bought 3 sets and I will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. Make sure you buy directly from Amazon and not from thirdparty sellers if you are concerned about quality or freshness.</li>
    <li> I loved all the makeup. However after one use the shadow opened at the top and I have to keep it closed with a bobby pin.</li>
    <li> Cute set that has good amount of product that last for a long time, definitely worth 5 bucks!!!!</li>
    <li> This set was a stocking stuffer for my daughter. The mascara is OK, however the liner that comes with it is completely dried out.</li>
    <li> I like the liquid eye shadow. It goes on smoothly and is a beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;The eye liner is okay. There is nothing spectacular or special about it. It is an eye liner pen.&lt;br /&gt;What I really wanted was the mascara and this mascara was a hugh disappointment. It was very clumpy and my eye lashes kept sticking. Removing the mascara was even worse. On a more positive note, it didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a great mascara to use on days I did not have time to apply the younique mascara. I got one of these as a gift free gift from Ulta. The mascara is amazing! I find myself rarely using the younique anymore. Goes on smooth and perfectly and lasts all day. Dries quickly for me, but I also use a makeup setting spray, so that might help it set also.</li>
    <li> Especially love this mascara! Got a couple of these for my daughter for Easter bc she kept using mine, problem solved! I do usually only use step 1 unless I need it to last all day . Step 2 will make sure your mascara stays on all day and then some. Step one stays on great as well I just don&#x27;t take my chances because I am not good at touching up my makeup throughout the day.</li>
