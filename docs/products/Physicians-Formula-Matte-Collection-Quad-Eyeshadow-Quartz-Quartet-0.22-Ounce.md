    <li> Perfect! I have been wearing classic nudes for years and its getting hard to find, so I am happy to be able to find on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  It&#x27;s difficult finding matte eye shadows anymore, but this was has nice subtle colors that stay on all day.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Never have to reapply during the day, and I work 12 hour shifts so that is really nice.  Love the way it goes on smoothly and blends so well.  Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> like all four of these colors</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow quad. I really like the matte finish. They are also Great colors. Will recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the matte collection! Goes on soft and the colors are so natural.</li>
    <li> Probably the best drugstore matte eyeshadow. I gave it 4 stars only because I wish there was a darker shadow in this quad rather than 2 which are very similar. Still well worth the $.</li>
    <li> after several online purchases....gone oh so wrong....it is nice to feel satisfied with a purchase....true to description.....as i like matte only..and...the less dramatic shades.......thanks...</li>
    <li> Applies easily and looks great!</li>

    <li> I have been using this brand for years.  The eyeshadow  goes on smooth, last for hours, only minimal touch ups needed.  I have also used this exact eyeshadow &amp; loved it!  Makes my eyes look stunning.  I recieve several complements when wearing their eyeshadows.  If you wear Physicians Formula makeup you will look just as Gorgeous.  For some reason Wal-Mart Supercenter doesn&#x27;t carry these eyeshadow palettes as much, its cheaper there.  As in under $6 bucks.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this,and will order it again.</li>

    <li> Good, a little darker than expected.</li>
    <li> I love the Matte eye shadows!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I have hooded eyelids and this does a nice job at concealing that.</li>
    <li> Perfect if you don&#x27;t want sparkly eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Want to buy another already...not shiny, natural color...although it is a little challenging if you are like me and usually add some water to apply&lt;br /&gt;more onto the eye than just using dry...PLENTY of each color for the $$.</li>
