      <li>Billy Jealousy face wash is still the best face wash I have used to date.</li>
      <li>Using chiefs with eucerin moisturizing sun lotion is a perfect combo for my face.</li>

      <li>This stuff is great as a face wash.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is attractive and doesn&#x27;t stand out like a sore thumb on my counter.</li>
      <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s an effective way to cleanse and wake up!  </li>
      <li>Chiefs makes great stuff, and the Energizing Face Wash is no exception -- a nice lather, and that menthol burn feels great.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>The eucalyptus really is pleasant when you&#x27;re groggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for five days now and have been very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>It lines up to its billing, and I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>I received a discounted product for the purpose of using and then reviewing the face wash, giving our honest opinion.  </li>
      <li>This face wash is pretty good, it cleans very nicely</li>
      <li>It feels amazing, and then makes my face tingle, which feels even more amazing.</li>
      <li>This product a perfect partner for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is great - really stimulating, and there&#x27;s and nice tingle that wakes me up too.  </li>
      <li>The smell is nice and it leaves my face clean without drying!  </li>
      <li>Chief&#x27;s is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I think he&#x27;s convinced! :)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Day 1: He likes the smell although it&#x27;s really overwhelming. ..</li>
      <li>so I can order more.</li>
      <li>I just love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s supposed to wake you up so, ok.</li>
      <li>Love the mint and energizing feeling that you get from the face wash.</li>
      <li>When it said energizing, I thought, &#x27;sure, of course it is.&#x27;</li>
      <li>use it solely in the morning, and it&#x27;s definitely the best part of my morning routine.  </li>
      <li>If you want a quick \\&quot;WAKE ME UP\\&quot; face wash this one is for ya :))))</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic way to wake up in the morning.</li>
      <li>Then my face feels nice and clean, and I feel ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the clean fresh smell and the feeling on my skin after I use it.  </li>
      <li>He says it makes his face tingle, feels really clean and &amp;</li>
      <li>my skin feels freshhhhh and Squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>If you want to wake up this will do the job, it says on the back that it is &amp;#34;designed to kick you in the face&amp;#34;, and it leaves a pleasant smoothness afterwords</li>
      <li>But after a while of using it I can confirm it definitely is my favorite part of the whole morning routine.</li>
      <li>My skin feels cool and almost tingly after using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of face washes lately - looking for the perfect one - and this Energizing Wash seems to be it!  </li>
      <li>Just a quick update...</li>
      <li>Wash my face with this stuff, rinse my face in warm/hot water for 30seconds, and my DE or straight razor whips my beard off as easy as kiss my hand.  </li>
      <li>In fact, it is extremely easy to accidentally squeeze out too much.</li>
      <li>Eminently useful and nothing to complain about means 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh and natural smell of peppermint and eucalyptus in the face wash.</li>
      <li>I love this face wash, Ive been through two of them and it has become one of my prime products in my daily skin cleansing regime.</li>
      <li>and I love that my husband let&#x27;s me know when he&#x27;s running low</li>
      <li>You really start to wake up and want to start the day.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>The product wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; as I expected but a good face wash overall.</li>
      <li>Also love the fact that its all natural as I am not big on chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use face washes regularly but my husband is a tried and true soap fan.</li>
      <li>After I get out of the shower, my skin feels nice and smooth - not too dried out like the other washes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Apart from that, I highly recommend the stuff.</li>
      <li>yes, I skipped ahead a few days but the the bottom line is this: what an energizing and refreshing face wash.</li>
      <li>The chiefs face wash is definitely our new favorite and as long as they make it available,  we will be lifelong customers.</li>
      <li>His skin is not sensitive so he says it has a mild burn.</li>
      <li>The sneaky little secret I&#x27;ve discovered is that Chief&#x27;s is the best Pre-Shave product that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Cleans the skin well, smells good and fresh without leaving a crappy perfume behind, and does not leave my skin feeling stripped and dry like some washes/soaps.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these so far</li>
      <li>yet my face doesn&#x27;t feel super tight after.</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth, and there is no oil slick feel to my skin after using it.</li>
      <li>He has both a beard and a mustache, which he generally shampoos.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too weak, not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Several bottles seem half-filled (or less), and that really irks me.</li>
      <li>The wash is very invigorating and he says that he could see someone with sensitive skin maybe having a hard time with it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m NOT a morning person in the slightest so I thought I would give this a try. It has made a world of difference when it comes to my morning routine. I actually get up a bit earlier in anticipation of using this stuff. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the clean fresh smell and the feeling on my skin after I use it.  Also love the fact that its all natural as I am not big on chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I know the product is aimed at men, but my wife tried it and loves it too.</li>
    <li> I received a discounted product for the purpose of using and then reviewing the face wash, giving our honest opinion.  So here goes! I use face washes regularly but my husband is a tried and true soap fan. He has both a beard and a mustache, which he generally shampoos. He agreed to use the face wash instead of his regular routine for one week. Day 1: He likes the smell although it&#x27;s really overwhelming. ..but it&#x27;s supposed to wake you up so, ok. Day 2: The wash is very invigorating and he says that he could see someone with sensitive skin maybe having a hard time with it. His skin is not sensitive so he says it has a mild burn. Day 3: He says that it&#x27;s impossible not to wake right up from the smell and feel of the face wash! Day 7: yes, I skipped ahead a few days but the the bottom line is this: what an energizing and refreshing face wash. Be careful if you&#x27;re prone to sensitive skin but otherwise it&#x27;s an effective way to cleanse and wake up!  Just a quick update...We&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these so far and I love that my husband let&#x27;s me know when he&#x27;s running low so I can order more. The chiefs face wash is definitely our new favorite and as long as they make it available,  we will be lifelong customers.</li>
    <li> Like the face wash.  The smell is nice and it leaves my face clean without drying!  Hopefully this will be my face wash of choice going forward.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for five days now and have been very pleased with it. The packaging is attractive and doesn&#x27;t stand out like a sore thumb on my counter. The texture is smooth, and there is no oil slick feel to my skin after using it. There was no major burn when I accidentally got a bit in my eye. My skin feels cool and almost tingly after using it. The smell is pleasant, not overpowering. It lines up to its billing, and I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Love the mint and energizing feeling that you get from the face wash. However, it leave my skin oily and is prone to breakouts after using this product for a few weeks. Billy Jealousy face wash is still the best face wash I have used to date.</li>
    <li> When it said energizing, I thought, &#x27;sure, of course it is.&#x27; But after a while of using it I can confirm it definitely is my favorite part of the whole morning routine. I rub it in my hands, smell it, and then scrub my face. It feels amazing, and then makes my face tingle, which feels even more amazing. Then my face feels nice and clean, and I feel ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried about the price, don&#x27;t. A little bit of this product goes a long ways. I put the smallest amount possible on my finger and it is plenty for my bearded face. In fact, it is extremely easy to accidentally squeeze out too much. This product is going to last forever. Also, no face wash I have used has even come close to the quality of this one, further justifying the price. I would say this is a must have.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash, Ive been through two of them and it has become one of my prime products in my daily skin cleansing regime. I apply a dime sie and massage it in circular motion, leave it for 30 odd seconds and VOILA my skin feels freshhhhh and Squeaky clean. If you want a quick \\&quot;WAKE ME UP\\&quot; face wash this one is for ya :))))</li>
    <li> This stuff is great as a face wash.  Cleans the skin well, smells good and fresh without leaving a crappy perfume behind, and does not leave my skin feeling stripped and dry like some washes/soaps.  The sneaky little secret I&#x27;ve discovered is that Chief&#x27;s is the best Pre-Shave product that I have ever used.  Wash my face with this stuff, rinse my face in warm/hot water for 30seconds, and my DE or straight razor whips my beard off as easy as kiss my hand.  No hair pulling, no razor burn.  Pricey for what it is, maybe, but it lasts me for quite a while, since I only need a small spot of it per use.  Eminently useful and nothing to complain about means 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Helps me get up in the morning especially with the app that requires me to scan the bar code to turn my alarm off.  This stuff really works and I look forward to getting the other products as well!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of face washes lately - looking for the perfect one - and this Energizing Wash seems to be it!  The smell is great - really stimulating, and there&#x27;s and nice tingle that wakes me up too.  After I get out of the shower, my skin feels nice and smooth - not too dried out like the other washes I&#x27;ve used.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t add anything that hasn&#x27;t already been said.  I just love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it solely in the morning, and it&#x27;s definitely the best part of my morning routine.  The smell is invigorating and definitely snaps me out of my morning haze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like this has definitely improved my skin.  I&#x27;ve never really had bad skin, but I can tell an improvement with this stuff.  It&#x27;s not too weak, not too strong.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh and natural smell of peppermint and eucalyptus in the face wash. This has been part of my daily morning routine and I can&#x27;t wait to start the day with it. I like its effect on my  face as it smoothens my skin and made my pores finer. This product a perfect partner for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Chiefs makes great stuff, and the Energizing Face Wash is no exception -- a nice lather, and that menthol burn feels great. Pricier than the junk you&#x27;ll find in the drugstore or supermarket, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my anti-products boyfriend, and he LOVED IT! He says it makes his face tingle, feels really clean and &amp;#34;wakes you up&amp;#34; with the scent. I think he&#x27;s convinced! :)</li>
    <li> Good product. I will buy again. I have no overriding complaints. The product wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; as I expected but a good face wash overall.</li>
    <li> If you want to wake up this will do the job, it says on the back that it is &amp;#34;designed to kick you in the face&amp;#34;, and it leaves a pleasant smoothness afterwords</li>
    <li> I wash my face with this while I am brushing my teeth as soon as I wake up and bam! You really start to wake up and want to start the day. I like it.</li>
    <li> This face wash is pretty good, it cleans very nicely yet my face doesn&#x27;t feel super tight after. Using chiefs with eucerin moisturizing sun lotion is a perfect combo for my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic way to wake up in the morning. The eucalyptus really is pleasant when you&#x27;re groggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve only received ONE bottle that actually felt &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; when it arrived. Several bottles seem half-filled (or less), and that really irks me. Not sure why there&#x27;s a difference, but I hope the folks at Chiefs will look into this concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that, I highly recommend the stuff. I&#x27;ve tried Billy Jealousy, and every other brand that Birchbox Man has ever shipped me... Chief&#x27;s is my favorite.</li>
