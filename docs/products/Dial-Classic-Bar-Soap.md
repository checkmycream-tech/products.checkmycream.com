      <li>I have been using this soap for many years and it is the best for my skin as it cleans well enough but doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  </li>
      <li>The Dial brand managers have redesigned all products to not last, and no longer be good value.</li>
      <li>We simply feel good after using it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is my new favorite moved over from the original.</li>
      <li>I ordred this for my friend that told me he was panicing because the stores no longer sold his favorite soap, so thank you amazon for making Mr. Brown&#x27;s life a little bit better. :-)</li>

      <li>love this soap please please bring it back</li>
      <li>Exactly the same as store-bought but both cheaper and more convenient to just order through A</li>
      <li>It is not oiley as well.&lt;br /&gt;it gets me very clean without having to moisturize after,which is such bliss!&lt;br /&gt;also,</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t dry skin out like other dial soaps I have used.</li>
      <li>I am waiting for someone to really get hurt and SUE THEM.</li>
      <li>tried this aloe soap, not expecting much.</li>
      <li>I really like this soap.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;spring\\&quot; aroma or scent is much softer and I prefer that.  </li>
      <li>it gets me very clean!&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other soaps in the hope of making it better, but all they&#x27;ve done is worsen the condition.</li>
      <li>It has such a clean pleasent scent too:):)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this soap for several years and it is definitely effective in eliminating or reducing dry skin particularly in the winter season.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shower/bath soap.</li>
      <li>Who needs the foo-foo new Dial soap &amp;#34;Flavors&amp;#34; anyway?</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Definitely has much more moisturizers than the other varieties of antibacterial dial bars.</li>
      <li>I was a bit hesitant in trying Dial&#x27;s Aloe Vera soap for my face because I thought it might be too harsh, but I really enjoy the aloe for my eczema.&lt;br</li>
      <li>ive never liked that fact that MOST dial soap dries my skin out soooo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different soaps and for me this is the only one that consistently works day in and day out.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised and expected.</li>
      <li>You can actually feel clean without getting dried out.</li>
      <li>I hope Dial keeps making this soap for a very long time because as long as they do, it will always be my first</li>
      <li>I am post menopausal and have heat flashes all of the time, so in other words, I am always sweaty so the antibacterial and deodorant is appreciated.</li>
      <li>It does not dry skin</li>
      <li>when I went shopping in a food market a few years ago,I seen this one for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>(owned by Henkel, Germany) recently added a new scooped out bottom shape to their bath size bars, which reduces the ounces of the bar, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
      <li>soap has been one of the only bar soaps by dial that does NOT dry me out or leave me feeling icky,&lt;br /&gt;it</li>

<li> Not easy to find in the normal retail market.</li>
<li> a person who has verry dry an very senestive skin.&lt;br /&gt;There are very few things that I can use that, doesnt break me out or have certin aeras of my body in discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>

<li> I do not have really dry skin</li>
<li> I still have red spots, but it makes them less noticeable and it even heals my inflammation.</li>
<li> and it was a little less expensive than the regular Dial, of which I&#x27;m a huge fan.  </li>
<li> Especially Winter months will not leave skin dried out.</li>
<li> (unless you like slipping in the shower!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> you have eczema or other skin problems, I recommend you give this soap a try.</li>
<li> have seb derm on my face, which unfortunately leaves red folds and sometimes inflammation next to my nose, under my eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had been trying to find this soap in stores, but could not so I had to get it from Amazon. It is one of those which I prefer to use and I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and have been using it for years. I have very sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use any liquid soaps or shower gels, even Dove&#x27;s shower gels give me a rash. This soap cleans and has a deodorant for all day freshness. I am post menopausal and have heat flashes all of the time, so in other words, I am always sweaty so the antibacterial and deodorant is appreciated. I do not have really dry skin but I like this soap because it keeps my arms and legs feeling nice in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can get it in bulk at a cheaper price. I also love being a Prime member!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC PRICE FOR 30 BARS OF SOAP.  NICE LIGHT FRAGRANCE.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. I bought it because I&#x27;m totally cheap and it was a little less expensive than the regular Dial, of which I&#x27;m a huge fan.  It smells a bit like a lighter version of Irish Spring.  The \\&quot;spring\\&quot; aroma or scent is much softer and I prefer that.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this highly economical purchase.  Great job Amazon.</li>
    <li> I order this often great for extra skin I use this for the winter</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant in trying Dial&#x27;s Aloe Vera soap for my face because I thought it might be too harsh, but I really enjoy the aloe for my eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seb derm on my face, which unfortunately leaves red folds and sometimes inflammation next to my nose, under my eyes. It gets worse in the summer months because of the sun and the heat, with lots of itching and scratching which makes my face even worse. I&#x27;ve tried other soaps in the hope of making it better, but all they&#x27;ve done is worsen the condition. I experimented with Yardley&#x27;s aloe soap with cucumber, and that irritated my face and broke it out. I tried the usual choice, Dove moisturizing, but that doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this aloe soap, not expecting much. But it has cleared up my face very good. I still have red spots, but it makes them less noticeable and it even heals my inflammation. This soap also doesn&#x27;t sting, and neither does it irriate or dry my face in any way. I hope Dial keeps making this soap for a very long time because as long as they do, it will always be my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have eczema or other skin problems, I recommend you give this soap a try. It has worked for me great.</li>
    <li> Not really a good moisturizing soap. Many of the reviews are exaggerated :(</li>
    <li> We have been using Dial Soap in our household for many years (40+).  We simply feel good after using it.&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes the variety with aloe.  Not all stores carry this particular variety, but, as is true in so many such instances, I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> love this soap please please bring it back</li>
    <li> All these bars for such a low price. The soap is great!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wont have to buy for a LONG time.</li>
    <li> I just receive my order yesterday and used it last night.  I really do love the scent but I also love the way it suds up in a wash cloth.  This will very likely be on of my staples.</li>
    <li> So hard to find this scent in stores so I came here to purchase a lot to stock up. Love the scent and keeps my skin clear of acne and dermatitis. I can&#x27;t use regular soap or I get itchy skin.</li>
    <li> The perfect bar soap. The only problem is that the bars don&#x27;t last nearly long enough. It does not dry skin but it also does not leave any extra lotion feel. You can actually feel clean without getting dried out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for many years and it is the best for my skin as it cleans well enough but doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  Too bad I can&#x27;t  can&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore</li>
    <li> Great value for some anti-bacterial soap. I would recommend anybody with body odor as tenacious as mine to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Good soap with nice scent.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores but it&#x27;s my favorite soap. Moisturizing and deodorant protection in one, and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for several years and it is definitely effective in eliminating or reducing dry skin particularly in the winter season.</li>
    <li> smells so great this is my new favorite moved over from the original.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and expected.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as store-bought but both cheaper and more convenient to just order through A Prime.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what purpose is served by reviewing staple (not Staples) items. We all know what they are.</li>
    <li> I really felt great AFTER I washed off this greasy product with ZEST SOAP and felt really clean...This Dial soap left a slimy film that does not wash off after 20 minutes in the shower...UGH..</li>
    <li> Very good soap. Definitely has much more moisturizers than the other varieties of antibacterial dial bars. What I like best is that as moisturizing as it is, it still rinses clean. There  no sliminess left when you rinse.  The scent is strong but I love it.</li>
    <li> We both have dry skin and I need the antibacterial  function. This is the best thing since sliced bread, it is not harsh, you feel clean, and my wife feels soft, what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t dry skin out like other dial soaps I have used.Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Finally found this soap again! They stopped carrying it in the stores around here. Works the best of all I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Great value. Lovely scent for the whole family!</li>
    <li> I ordred this for my friend that told me he was panicing because the stores no longer sold his favorite soap, so thank you amazon for making Mr. Brown&#x27;s life a little bit better. :-)</li>
    <li> only soap we use in our family</li>
    <li> The soap is excellent that I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only bar soap we use. Aloe is a nice extra touch.</li>
    <li> Great product! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Not only do we get the deodorant protection of Dial soap, but it has a great moisturizer also.  I highly recommend this shower/bath soap.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe you get 30 soap for that price!!! Good deal and love the fresh smell. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Ill start by saying that this stuff is just wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Im a person who has verry dry an very senestive skin.&lt;br /&gt;There are very few things that I can use that, doesnt break me out or have certin aeras of my body in discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Ive always had to use dial because it doesnt hurt my body an it gets me very clean!&lt;br /&gt;BUT ive never liked that fact that MOST dial soap dries my skin out soooo much:/&lt;br /&gt;So when I went shopping in a food market a few years ago,I seen this one for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I read its contents an seen all the qualities it was supposed to offer.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited to see this because,it just sounded so perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;so I decided to give it a try!!:)Im really glad I did!!:)!&lt;br /&gt;This soap has been one of the only bar soaps by dial that does NOT dry me out or leave me feeling icky,&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt break me out or hurt my body.It is not oiley as well.&lt;br /&gt;it gets me very clean without having to moisturize after,which is such bliss!&lt;br /&gt;also,It has such a clean pleasent scent too:):)&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this stuff for over two years and havent looked back,&lt;br /&gt;its one of only soaps I use becuase it works great for me,an it actually does what it says!&lt;br /&gt;not to forget,the price for this stuff is awesome!!!so enexpensive!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im so happy that amazon had this product at all,even better,its in bulk!!(so glad cause im almost out,lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive yet to be dissapointed over this product!!!:)</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted.  It works for me.  Good price and easy to order.  Not easy to find in the normal retail market.</li>
    <li> It is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to find any more.&lt;br /&gt;Like the aloe and anti bacterial properties. Good stuff</li>
    <li> I always use this soap. Buying in quantity saves me time when I shop for groceries and personal products.</li>
    <li> Great anti-bacterial soap that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal, and the soap itself is awesome.  It moisturizes without leaving a film on your skin,</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T TOUCH THAT DIAL! (unless you like slipping in the shower!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dial (owned by Henkel, Germany) recently added a new scooped out bottom shape to their bath size bars, which reduces the ounces of the bar, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long. It was formerly nearly flat on bottom. There is no reason for this scoop except to reduce longevity of the bar while appearing to be the same size as before. Problem is the scoop causes a HAZARD. The bars now WILL NOT STAY IN THE SOAP DISH. The bars continually fall under foot. I picked up the bar 2 or 3 times every shower. It gets under my feet. I am seriously worried about a SLIP AND FALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deciding to cheat us by cutting a large chunk out of the bar is one thing, but to create also create safety hazard that could really hurt someone is beyond stupid. I am waiting for someone to really get hurt and SUE THEM. The bar is out of balance on soap dishes. If you have that smaller piece left over from before, you&#x27;ll never get the bar to stay put. It is under foot every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIAL&#x27;S GREED MODIFICATIONS ARE GOING TO HURT SOMEONE!!!!!! I have about slipped several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so amazed that the current keepers of a formerly great brand could be so recklesss in their quest to cheat us that have tainted a 30 year great brand. The Dial brand managers have redesigned all products to not last, and no longer be good value. You added DANGEROUS to their list of product enhancements. Good job Dial Brand management!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t touch that dial.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different soaps and for me this is the only one that consistently works day in and day out. Sometimes even if I forget to put on deodorant I&#x27;m not worried because I know I am covered.</li>
    <li> Soap is great year round gives just right amount of moisturizers for you skin. Especially Winter months will not leave skin dried out.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find locally and thought it had been discontinued until I spotted it on Amazon. Some things you shouldn&#x27;t mess with and this soap is one of them. Who needs the foo-foo new Dial soap &amp;#34;Flavors&amp;#34; anyway? Nothing beats the good old fashioned clean you get with the moisturizing aloe soap.</li>
