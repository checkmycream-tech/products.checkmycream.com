      <li>/&gt;It really is lightweight.</li>
      <li>It looks fuller and I am able to style it with much less fuss.</li>

      <li>Would definitely recommend and will definitely purchase again IF it remains in stock and is easy to find.</li>
      <li>I live on the prairie where the wind is incessant.</li>
      <li>It lasts for a long time so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s dry,  I lift sections of my hair and spray beneath that section, right at the roots.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and just a very small amount of</li>
      <li>I used this years ago and bought it in the salon (which wasn&#x27;t cheap) and haven&#x27;t seen it in a few years.</li>
      <li>This is a very lightweight mist that holds the hair&#x27;s basic shape, but still allows it to move and flow with the day&#x27;s activities.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent  to restyle your hair dry. It is light &amp; weightless.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to all on the run.  My hairdresser used&lt;br /&gt;it for years.</li>
    <li> the spray is easier to use than gel and it relatively light and does add body. It was used at my beauty salon but they switched to another product which I didn&#x27;t like as well</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and the local store has been out of it for months.  Found it on Amazon at a cheaper price than I was paying in the store!!!  Very fast shipping.  Definitely will come back for more!!</li>
    <li> This junk was so nasty in my hair. I have very fine, naturally blonde hair and I am weary of using a lot of product because they generally weigh my hair down, and since my hair is pretty light colored, you can immediately tell when products start making my hair oily. A friend recommended this to  me, but she does NOT have fine hair, so I&#x27;m sure it worked ok for her. If I use a very light amount at the roots, it works decent, but not as well as other LESS EXPENSIVE products I have tried. Over all it left my hair sticky, oily, and weighed down. I much prefer Redken body full weightlifter.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is the perfect light weight hair spray.  You don&#x27;t feel it on your hair the next morning.  But I am very sad that they are no longer going to make it.  The company was bought out I believe.</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time.  I love how it makes my hair feel.  NOT heavy, but weightless yet gives great body.  Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...Why in the world such a price jump????  I bought this for less than $13.  Now it&#x27;s $50?  No thanks!  It&#x27;s good, but not that good</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000N2KMEY GRAHAM WEBB by Graham Webb: THICK INFUSION WEIGHTLESS BODY SPRAY 6 OZ]]In spite of the fact it is costly, this hair spray is the absolute best!  hold without fold I say!  I recommend it to all the ladies!  even men but they might not care for the scent!</li>
    <li> used this product for years  and then they discontinued it..found it on line and was extremely happy!!!!!!!so glad to know it is still available...</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and just a very small amount of this hairspray works wonders.  It is expensive, but it will last a very long time, as you only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> I found this at Marshall&#x27;s so I knew it was likely discontinued but the label stated it thickened hair. I have the hair of the average 6 month old child. It&#x27;s fine, fly-away, thin. It&#x27;s also silver. I live on the prairie where the wind is incessant. I used this product for the first time this morning on clean, freshly styled hair. After a morning spent running errands in the wind my hair had been whipped about my head and no longer had any style. I didn&#x27;t want to re-style it with hot rollers or curling iron so I pulled it into a pony tail. I just went to brush it out and the hair under the pony tail holder was glued together into a nasty, sticky and hardened mess. I am not happy. I do not recommend this product for hair like mine in a climate like the southwestern US. I&#x27;m going back to Big Sexy Spray and Play. It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive but it works very well for me -- as long as I&#x27;m careful not to allow too much build up.</li>
    <li> However, your supplier/shipper, The Best Dan Shop Online, is one I personally will never order from again.  The packaging the hair spray was shipped in was not damaged, but the condition of the spray can itself was not acceptable.  The cover (top) on the can was bent and had a coating of dust on it, which led me to believe this item had been sitting on a shelf for quite a while.  There was also a sticky substance on the can, as if something had been taped to it and removed before shipping.  I tried e-mailing the company, but as of this date, I have had no reply.  I am really surprised, as their claim is to insist that the customer is completely satisfied!  Why, then, no reply to my e-mail?</li>
    <li> Great product. Adds volume without being heavy. Smells wonderful. I use it before I use a curling iron and it adds fullness and body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.... but they quit making it!</li>
    <li> Great for use on fine, short hair! It&#x27;s the only finishing product that seems to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; and give body to my fine hair.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this item and she loves it.  Great if you are going out for the evening and just need to refresh yor hair style.</li>
    <li> This product and body too wet hair or allows styling and repair for dry hair. It is lightweight and is close to unscented as one can find. It lasts for a long time so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> REALLY GREAT PRODUCT. I HAVE THIN AND FINE HAIR AND THROUGH OUT THE DAY IT FALLS FLAT. THIS HELPS GIVE BODY BACK TO YOUR HAIR. ITS NOT STICK OR HEAVY. wON&#x27;T WEIGHT DOWN YOUR HAIR. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Local shops no longer carry Graham Webb products and several other sources have \\&quot;discontinued\\&quot; so was delighted to find this product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair volumeizer I have ever used for my hair.  I am of Danish heritage with very blond thin hair.  This spray gives me volume.  It says body spray, but it is for your hair.  It is not sticky or heavy.  Just right.</li>
    <li> I used this years ago and bought it in the salon (which wasn&#x27;t cheap) and haven&#x27;t seen it in a few years. It works great if you have short hair and need to give it some body while also trying to style it. It&#x27;s not as heavy as using a paste, yet after spraying it on, you can still style your hair like you do with a paste. It&#x27;s kind of a combination lightweight paste and hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it also has a nice scent to it, so that&#x27;s a bonus!!</li>
    <li> I love this product as it does what it promises and it has a very pleasant scent. I would recommend it to anyone with hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Great for thin fine hair.  Gives my hair lots of body and styling ability I would not have otherwise.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT THAT THE WIFE WILL NOT DO WITHOUT</li>
    <li> I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it says.  It leaves your hair thick without weighing hair down&lt;br /&gt;It really is lightweight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and am extremely happy when I can find it in stock.  It works well if used correctly.  I&#x27;m one of those unfortunate ones who has thinning, fine hair and I&#x27;m always searching for a good product that makes my hair appear thicker.  This product lives up to its claims to provide &amp;#34;weightless&amp;#34; body.  For best results, I use it after shampooing and using the [Conair] hot air brush on my hair. Once it&#x27;s dry,  I lift sections of my hair and spray beneath that section, right at the roots.  Then, I just &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; at my hair until it looks polished and ready to go.  BTW, my hairdresser told me that her salon cannot keep this on the shelves.  Would definitely recommend and will definitely purchase again IF it remains in stock and is easy to find.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it. Gives just the right amount of volume to my  hair</li>
    <li> I SPRAY A SPRITZ ON EACH BRUSH FULL ...ON THE SIDES AS I DRY MY HAIR. IT GIVES THE STYLE I NEED.</li>
    <li> This Thick Infusion Spray is the best product for fine,limp hair. Love it..worth the price. I spend much less time trying to deal with my hair. It looks fuller and I am able to style it with much less fuss.</li>
    <li> This is a very lightweight mist that holds the hair&#x27;s basic shape, but still allows it to move and flow with the day&#x27;s activities.  First-rate</li>
