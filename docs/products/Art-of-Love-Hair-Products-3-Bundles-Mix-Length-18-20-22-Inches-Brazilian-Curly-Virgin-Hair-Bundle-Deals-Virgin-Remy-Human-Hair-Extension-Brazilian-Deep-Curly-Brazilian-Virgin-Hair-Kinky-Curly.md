      <li>Most importantly, YES I will purchase this hair again - Normal Shed /</li>
      <li>True to length its kinky curly</li>
      <li>when a full bundle shoul be 100 gram smh</li>
      <li>and that was about the only thing good about this hair.</li>
      <li>thought it was pretty cool and easy.</li>
      <li>I was very excited about that I revived my hair on time as well as being new to this amozon thing</li>
      <li>Really what can you expect for $97 with free shipping for all 3 bundles???</li>
      <li>I will just say try it for yourself because I had full bundles that did my whole head and made it look full.</li>
      <li>I went into the pool and it got wet and the hair still feels good</li>
      <li>Sheds and tangles more than my natural hair.</li>
      <li>Nice but have to maintain it properly or else it will not up</li>
      <li>I love it so far</li>
      <li>I loved this item and it came sooner than expected</li>
      <li>This hair is not worth the price you are better saving your money and looking at places like alliexpress for better hair.</li>
      <li>Firstly, I received two 18&amp;#34; bundles rather than one 18&amp;#34; and one 20&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
      <li>Pretty hair.  </li>
      <li>Hair is very  curly and has a nice pattern once wet</li>
      <li>I was willing to deal with that since I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>To achieve that natural full look</li>
      <li>If you order 6 bundles that will still only be like $194 pretty cheap for the price.</li>
      <li>Needless today my hair ended up being huge and not in a good way.</li>
      <li>very displeased the hair also sheads like cat hair and is very this at the end as well as processed hair..</li>
      <li>look too much like a jerry curl.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very deceiving</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about hair except to put it in.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much I receive my Oder it</li>
      <li>Other then that I love this hair and will probably order again</li>
      <li>I wish I had more time to get other options and return this.</li>
      <li>Not enough to do a full install.</li>
      <li>3 bundles was enough for a quick weave</li>
      <li>The length is not true, even when you do stretch it out and on top the ends are scraggly.</li>
      <li>I have not had much issues with sheding so far.</li>
      <li>Bundles not thick like the pic...not enough to complete a full head...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very soft and looks just like the picture</li>
      <li>3 bundles really turn out to be barely 1 1/2 bundle when it&#x27;s put together.</li>
      <li>The smell of chemical is evident as soon as you open the bag.</li>
      <li>Four stars for the price, only invest in curly brazilian hair if you are ready for high maintenance.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be clear, this hair is processed.</li>
      <li>is like is my natural hair</li>
      <li>hair is soft but doubt that it&#x27;s Brazilian hair...</li>
      <li>plus is that it is soft.</li>
      <li>I have had it for 3 weeks so far.</li>
      <li>it could be enough hair if you have a small head and is leaving some of your hair out at the top</li>
      <li>But you will need to double up on your order to do a decent weave.</li>
      <li>This hair only comes to about your shoulders i its natural state.</li>
      <li>3 bundles is enough to complete an installment.</li>
      <li>AT ALL don&#x27;t expect it to be full like the picture you need at least 2 orders of this to be full, also length is not accurate me</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say much about shedding since I was having to rip it apart due to the matting and of hair was coming out afterwards.</li>
      <li>I had a bad experience with this hair the hair came fast and on time its not for me though its for a person who likes a more bushy natural look</li>
      <li>No were near as long as in the picture....</li>
      <li>first of all when you buy hair off the internet you&#x27;re going off of the pictures and the reviews you read the picture is a lie the hair clearly is down the middle of the woman&#x27;s back this hair</li>

<li> first of all when you buy hair off the internet you&#x27;re going off of the pictures and the reviews you read the picture is a lie the hair clearly is down the middle of the woman&#x27;s back this hair</li>
<li> but once you flat iron it it gets long.</li>
<li> so the curls won&#x27;t be long like the models</li>
<li> , I have had it in for less then 24 hours and have been dealing with some major tangle issues.</li>
<li> TOO LONG!</li>
<li> It took to long to get and plus it wasn&#x27;t what she expected</li>
<li> Now as for this hair , it&#x27;s only 50 grams ( half a bundle )</li>
<li> very thin.. you probably need 5 bundles just to look full..</li>
<li> The hair was not the bundle size it was supposed to be and the hair was very thin and shed everything quickly</li>
<li> Absolutely No Frizz.</li>
<li> I had a 1 single small weft left.</li>
<li> The bundles were so small basically all 3 equal to one bundle.</li>
<li> Total waste of money!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I brought this here for my birthday and I&#x27;m telling you I&#x27;m so in love with it is like is my natural hair I love it I love it I love it all good reviews</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this hair!!!</li>
    <li> first of all when you buy hair off the internet you&#x27;re going off of the pictures and the reviews you read the picture is a lie the hair clearly is down the middle of the woman&#x27;s back this hair only comes tothe back of my shoulders I assumed it would be longer I&#x27;m looking at the picture is very soft but the length is what I&#x27;m unhappy with I&#x27;ll never order it again</li>
    <li> The hair was not the bundle size it was supposed to be and the hair was very thin and shed everything quickly</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be clear, this hair is processed. The smell of chemical is evident as soon as you open the bag. It&#x27;s also not 300 grams, 250 at the most. Not enough to do a full install. I ordered rush because I am going on a trip. The length is not true, even when you do stretch it out and on top the ends are scraggly. I don&#x27;t know what hair the model is wearing, but it&#x27;s definitely not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one plus is that it is soft. I wish I had more time to get other options and return this. I don&#x27;t even do reviews, but this is HORRIBLE! Don&#x27;t waste your time. Everything in the write up is a LIE!</li>
    <li> Firstly, I received two 18&amp;#34; bundles rather than one 18&amp;#34; and one 20&amp;#34; as advertised. I was willing to deal with that since I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s discuss the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Nice looking kinky curl and that was about the only thing good about this hair. It didn&#x27;t just tangle but matted together. One bundle came tangled at the top, I detangled it but it continued to tangle and was matting the worst out of any bundle after the install. I can&#x27;t say much about shedding since I was having to rip it apart due to the matting and of hair was coming out afterwards. One of the bundles came frizzy and remained that way even after being deep conditioned. Needless today my hair ended up being huge and not in a good way. The hair has a loud processed smell and felt like over processed hair when it was wet, gummy and really gross feeling. I installed it one day and took it out the next day. Total waste of money! I would not recommend anyone buy this hair!</li>
    <li> The hair arrived in a timely manner but it was a different product than the picture. The quality is not good. Sheds and tangles more than my natural hair. Guess I should&#x27;ve just done my own hair.</li>
    <li> Not only was a I double charged which I blame amazon for and not the seller! This hair only comes to about your shoulders i its natural state. 3 bundles was enough for a quick weave but I would not suggest sewing this hair it without about 5 bundles because it would be thin. The hair tangles really easy, I have had it in for less then 24 hours and have been dealing with some major tangle issues. I have not had much issues with sheding so far. I tried to lighting this hair and it just wouldn&#x27;t lighten. This hair is not worth the price you are better saving your money and looking at places like alliexpress for better hair. I would not recommend anyone bother with this hair. The style of the hair looks great when you install it but that is about it.</li>
    <li> Horrible hair. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> bad hair will not order again waste of moneysheds alot,, not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much I receive my Oder it awesome thanks</li>
    <li> The hair keeps shedding. Waste of money - don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair ever. The 3 bundles don&#x27;t even add up to one proper bundle. Please  don&#x27;t buy this hair. its a total rip off :(</li>
    <li> Not as seen in picture AT ALL don&#x27;t expect it to be full like the picture you need at least 2 orders of this to be full, also length is not accurate me sure myself even straightened doesn&#x27;t meet that length</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stop getting compliments about this hair. Only needed two bundles with the circumference of my hair left out. Great buy and was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> I had a bad experience with this hair the hair came fast and on time its not for me though its for a person who likes a more bushy natural look I co-wash it I was find until hair started getting frizzy on the in but if your a person who likes that look its great hair you should get it in short lengths it would look better.....</li>
    <li> Horrible I hated the hair !!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair for my girlfriend and she was very unhappy. It took to long to get and plus it wasn&#x27;t what she expected</li>
    <li> False advertisement on hair product, didnot get a refund.</li>
    <li> The hair was nice but it had an odor , so I returned it</li>
    <li> Hmmmmm.... No were near as long as in the picture.... it went just past my shoulders..... and the quality was not good, hair looked dry; nothing like the picture....</li>
    <li> I loved this item and it came sooner than expected I wish it were a little darker but I will be buying again</li>
    <li> wont be ordering this crap again</li>
    <li> Hair not as described, too short. Plus length not as pictured</li>
    <li> The bundles were so small basically all 3 equal to one bundle. They hair its self didn&#x27;t seem too good .... $60 I guess I get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> Love this hair I have 4 bundles in . Hair is very  curly and has a nice pattern once wet it showed more length</li>
    <li> Great products... Thanks for a good job on what you sell and the prices. I will tell all my friends and buy from you only!!</li>
    <li> Why is the box open? Why is the product small than the one in the advertising picture, am not happy for the product at all.no paper at all.</li>
    <li> Bundles not thick like the pic...not enough to complete a full head...hair is soft but doubt that it&#x27;s Brazilian hair...hair came down to the middle of my back but was very thin and shedds...it could be enough hair if you have a small head and is leaving some of your hair out at the top</li>
    <li> The Art of Love Hair 3 Bundle Mix Length extensions thickness is 3A grade (very thin and spindly at the ends) and weighs less than 120 grams. To achieve that natural full look you get with 5A or better hair quality -- you will need to purchase and install more hair bundles. Most importantly, YES I will purchase this hair again - Normal Shed / Absolutely No Frizz.</li>
    <li> the quality of the hair is very good, but they lying about hair length ( shoulder )  otherwise great for the price for all the head 5 to 6 package would be perfect and thé lenght is maybe a 10 or 12 not 18,20,22</li>
    <li> Well the hair is too short to be the inches I order</li>
    <li> This hair gets thick and unmanageable within one to two days. I ordered the 18-20-22 inch hair and it is very short I took this hair out the same week I installed it. Its very light which is a good thing but it&#x27;s not worth the money. I could of gotten this hair for 33$ at my local hair supply store and for 20-22-24 inches. Smh I will not order hair offline again especially from this seller. Smdh!!!.</li>
    <li> Was not what I thought it was going to be. 3 bundles really turn out to be barely 1 1/2 bundle when it&#x27;s put together.</li>
    <li> Pretty hair.  But you will need to double up on your order to do a decent weave.</li>
    <li> oh my this is some good hair i love it</li>
    <li> 3 bundles, appear to be the appropriate weight and length. 3 bundles is enough to complete an installment. *UPDATE* I had a 1 single small weft left. Hair falls to the middle of my back, when stretched it was on my behind! TOO LONG! It&#x27;s human hair... I relaxed it. The hair came tangled towards the top of the weft. It sheds. I mean sheds! Need to seal the wefts before an installment. The hair has been previously dyed and therefore not virgin unprocessed. This was obvious based on the murky gray water after I washed the hair. If you are willing to seal your wefts I would say its an okay buy. Based off the product quality and price I paid for the extensions I would say I am owed $10-$15.</li>
    <li> Four stars for the price, only invest in curly brazilian hair if you are ready for high maintenance. Matches my curl pattern, very very full bundles.I have straightened it today, hold a curl well. Installed for a week now.</li>
    <li> nappy hair do not buy i sent it back</li>
    <li> Really what can you expect for $97 with free shipping for all 3 bundles??? Someone needs to upload some pics so we can see what the hair looks like on a regular persons head and not just the made up models! If you order 6 bundles that will still only be like $194 pretty cheap for the price. If your not tryna keep the hair in a long time like you would with really good quality hair!</li>
    <li> ii absolutely love this hair! so natural, never sheds, thick! i love it!</li>
    <li> The hair come on time but I&#x27;m disappointed on just how thin the hair is.. It&#x27;s very deceiving and I don&#x27;t like that.. Next time around in ordering from someone else</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I don&#x27;t know much about hair except to put it in. I have had it for 3 weeks so far. I went into the pool and it got wet and the hair still feels good</li>
    <li> I will just say try it for yourself because I had full bundles that did my whole head and made it look full. True to length its kinky curly so the curls won&#x27;t be long like the models but once you flat iron it it gets long. Downside is my bundles were marked wrong so I had to figure out which was 22 20 and 18 and I got two different colors. Other then that I love this hair and will probably order again</li>
    <li> Great product and I will be back to purchase more.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst experience in my life. This hair is a waste of money, the packs were very small, it looked like they took one pack and turned into 2 packs. The hair looks very thin and shred all over my house. I want a refund, the only reason I&#x27;m giving the one star was because I received the hair in time</li>
    <li> I love it so far it&#x27;s very soft and looks just like the picture</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, it was so short ...look too much like a jerry curl. It took color well but it just wasn&#x27;t me. It also got matted up and shed non stop...i took it out a week later,gave it away to my hair dresser...never again will I order.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about that I revived my hair on time as well as being new to this amozon thing thought it was pretty cool and easy. Now as for this hair , it&#x27;s only 50 grams ( half a bundle ) when a full bundle shoul be 100 gram smh very displeased the hair also sheads like cat hair and is very this at the end as well as processed hair.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this hair to anyone and wouldn&#x27;t buy anymore</li>
    <li> very thin.. you probably need 5 bundles just to look full.. hair was an ok texture tho.</li>
    <li> Nice but have to maintain it properly or else it will not up</li>
</ol>
