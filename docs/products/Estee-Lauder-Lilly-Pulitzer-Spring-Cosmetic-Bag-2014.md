<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This bag is great! Great quality and good material. Its a perfect size that holds all of my makeup. Will buy again as needed or for a gift.</li>
    <li> The bag does look like the picture but the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as I am use to Lilly Pulitzer items being. The bag says Estée Lauder all over it if that matters to you. For the cost it is an exceptionally great buy as even Walmart makeup bags generally cost more.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. The picture was accurate in terms of colors and pattern. Decent quality. So cute! Love it!</li>
    <li> Super cute makeup bag. Nice quality too!</li>
    <li> Totally love this especially for the price!!</li>
    <li> Wish it was padded but good size &amp; very pretty</li>
    <li> This is an eye popping bag. The colors and print are gorgeous and as stated by other reviewers the color is pink rather than purple. I bought as a teacher gift and super pleased with the size and look. I think it will be well received.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold my make-up and lotions.  It&#x27;s a pretty decent size so it definitely will get the job done!</li>
    <li> Love the print by Lilly Pulitzer by even better I love the generous size of this cosmetic bag!</li>
    <li> Great little cosmetic bag for travel. I was actually surprised that it was bigger than I thought it would be. (When does that ever happen?! Stuff is always smaller!) It is the perfect side for all my makeup for a weekend trip. The material is durable and thick which I appreciated as well.</li>
    <li> Lovely and useful. It&#x27;s a real spring picker-upper.</li>
    <li> Love this cosmetic bag...So pretty and well made.</li>
    <li> I had already received one from my mom and thought it was so pretty, I decided to buy one as a gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s sister. It has a very feminine, bold floral design, small enough to fit on your vanity and big enough to fit all your essentials. I just wish it had a pocket or a zipper of some sort to help separate and organize my makeup. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend to a friend :)</li>
    <li> I love the colors and it&#x27;s the perfect size for my handbag. It arrived in 4 days too!</li>
    <li> Gave this as gifts to my girl cousins last Chinese New Year and they were very ahppy. I got myself one too! It&#x27;s very good quality and classy and holds lots of cosmetics you need. Cute design too.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a smaller bag and wish it was. That said the bag is beautiful</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful bag for carrying the miscellaneous items in my purse.  Wasn&#x27;t quite sure if it would be too big or not.  It is just right.  The size stated on the description are true to size.  Nice and roomy inside, can fit quite a few things in the bag.  Lipstick, eyeglass wipes, meds., pens, travel size bottles of any kind, you name it.  It is a great bag, and didn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my purse even after I filled it up-still have plenty of room for more stuff.  The colors are really vibrant too.  Like the pink plastic handle, easy to grab hold of.  Also believe this bag will hold up long term, its very good quality.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Beautiful colors</li>
    <li> all my staff was fit into this pouch!</li>
    <li> Just too cute should buy 2</li>
    <li> I love this cosmetic bag so much. It&#x27;s fits everything that I need and it&#x27;s so pretty to have in your bag.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for cosmetics in purse ordor travel.</li>
    <li> I just got these two cuties and they are way bigger than I expected one is for my make up and the other are for my deodorant big on and comb brush for my upcoming vacation. Wow I was impressed and I am pickier these days</li>
    <li> Lightweight, sturdy bag with a wide mouth (which I like because it makes things easily accessible). It&#x27;s roomy inside - to give you an idea, you can fit two glass cases side by side and have room for a small lens case and travel-sized contact lens cleaner (see pic). Overall, it&#x27;s a great, versatile cosmetic bag. Pretty, vibrant colors, too :)</li>
    <li> I love this make up bag! Its good material and fits all my stuff perfectly!! LOVE the colors!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom, such a great price and it&#x27;s gorgeous! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> It has great quality, sturdy zipper, material good with water and vibrant colors... LOVE IT. I got it as a gift for my friend.</li>
    <li> Love everything Lilly Pulitzer!  Well constructed, with an extra long zipper pull.  Nice!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my cleaning lady&#x27;s daughter as a birthday present.  She loves it!  Great quality and very colorful, what you would except from Lilly Pulitzer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. got it for my daughter and everything fits perfect and there&#x27;s so much room left. Def a must have</li>
    <li> Great bag! Love the colors and the size; fits all of my longer make-up brushes but isn&#x27;t too bulky.</li>
    <li> Use it as a clutch.  It&#x27;s great.  Love the colors.</li>
    <li> This is so cute and an awesome buy for the price!!</li>
    <li> nice bag. so nice that I ordered 2 more</li>
    <li> This bag is perfect for holding my makeup and make up brushes it arrived on time and was packaged well . The design is beautiful and it is well made. No complaints . Good product</li>
    <li> These are just wonderfully useful for traveling.</li>
    <li> I just got this today and I am absolutely in love with it! The colors are amazing and the size is perfect. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better!</li>
    <li> This came in SUPER quick and let me tell you that I think its honestly so perfect! The colors are beautiful and bright just like in the picture and I just love it so much! Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Perfect size bag for all my brushes.  Just the size I was looking for. The colors are vibrant.  Fast shipping also.  Would recommend product &amp; seller.</li>
    <li> Great sized makeup bag. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love my bag! It&#x27;s a perfect size for travel and fits all of my brushes, even my eyeshadow! I love the design and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Perfect. The item came as described.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for as bridesmaids gifts!</li>
    <li> This makeup bag is okay. I didn&#x27;t like the gold trimming around it too much but it does the job. The colours are bright just as in the picture and it has just enough room to fit my things. Another thing I like is that its not bulky, is nice and slim and fits in your handbag nicely.</li>
    <li> We bought this as a pencil case when the one we bought from an office supply store ripped after one week.  It is the perfect size and is very pretty. My daughter is very happy.  The one thing that surprised me was that it says Estée Lauder on it.</li>
    <li> Way too long and expensive to fit in your purse</li>
    <li> My daughter uses it as a pencil case, she loves it.</li>
    <li> PRETTY! Bigger then anticipated but is super cute.  I plan to use this to store my make-up brushes when I travel. Too big to carry around in my purse on a daily bases but I have a small purse. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I thought it was small enough to fit my purse but it&#x27;s a bit bigger than I expected it to be. I&#x27;m going to return mine but otherwise it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
    <li> This make up bag is very pretty and looks just like in the picture.I&#x27;m inlove with it and so happy with my purchase.For $4 its very worth it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Holds everything</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It is a cute/stylish make-up bag at an affordable (not Lily) price. I actually used it for my compact DSLR because I wanted to be able to take it with me in my purse but have it protected. Did the job well.</li>
    <li> It is really pretty, not expensive at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also it fits all my makeup, and the colors&lt;br /&gt;are so cute! Its a must have :)</li>
    <li> I know it says its a cosmetic bag, but its shaped perfectly for a pencil pouch. I ordered it to be used as one and it is perfect.  It fits all my pins and pencils for school plus more. It came in just 3 days! The expected delivery date is in a week from today. I was pleasently surprised that it arrived before I went back to school. When I ordered it, it was $5.06, but it is still worth what you pay for. Excellent quality. would buy another similar.</li>
    <li> super cute and good quality</li>
    <li> Bigger than i thought. But good for cosmetic pouch</li>
    <li> Lovely piece of merchandise...strong and brightly colored...I got two...you&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> This bag is well loved. Others in the house are trying to steal it. I probably will order another one.</li>
    <li> Just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Roomy and efficient. I use this to hold all the odds and ends that would just fly around my purse. The color really pops.</li>

    <li> Very pretty and nice quality bag. Looks just like the picture.</li>

    <li> so pretty. love it.  just what I wanted. its well worth it.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but much bigger then it appears in the photo.</li>
    <li> This is great little bag.  It&#x27;s colorful and easy to keep clean with just a damp cloth.  It fits well in my everyday purse and I was pleasantly surprised as to how much I could fit inside.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. Bag is super cute &amp; I use it daily in my purse. Arrived before the estimated shipping date. would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Only gave it 4 stars, because while a great bag, it&#x27;s BIG. Too big for my 12 year old grand to carry for school. Had to keep for me and give her my smaller one.</li>
    <li> This got to me in ONE day I love it it&#x27;s so cute and bigger that expected I can fit TWO full size bath and body works body sprays very roomy inside great for on the go 💕 I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality Item; Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> Great colors for spring and a bit bigger than I expected which was great. Came on time, which is a plus. The reason I gave it 4 and not five was because there were just some stray threads that i had to cut off but that is just a small thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small and used material is cheap. There are better ones out there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cute and very spacious considering it&#x27;s size. The patern is cute and at this price, it&#x27;s a steal. Came very quickly and without hassle.</li>
