      <li>This product is remarkably easy to use.</li>
      <li>and it is so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to split and recap.</li>
      <li>I have always used shades of Brown (Golden, Warm and cool color variations)</li>
      <li>Quick and easy to apply.....good color....</li>
      <li>Color is great and has lasted a long time also.</li>

      <li>Item received quickly and as described</li>
      <li>I appreciate the quick application and the fresh color and shine that it produces.  </li>
      <li>The best for long lasting shiny hair at home!</li>
      <li>Instead of that strong chemical smell that my other brand has, this one smells like a really nice shampoo or conditioner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>gloves: High quality textured plastic that fit easily over my large hands.</li>
      <li>The color is natural and lovely.  </li>
      <li>I am medium golden brown.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about the bottle itself but the optional comb tip makes things really easy with short hair.</li>
      <li>Literally every relevant piece in the box is better than the other brand I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a first timer for coloring hair at home.</li>
      <li>and I have more gray than I did back then.  </li>
      <li>Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
      <li>This is easy to use and only takes 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>After applying this color, my hair seems much fuller, the frizz is gone, and my hair shines.</li>
      <li>I have been coloring my hair for years and have never had so much hair dye drip into the floor and counter</li>
      <li>I was buying this at Target and it is so much cheaper buying it on Amazon through Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s extra nice about them is that they&#x27;re so high quality that when I&#x27;m finished I just rinse them in the sink, pull them off inside-out and put them back in the box.</li>
      <li>I mix the 2 in the big bottle with the original bottle cap on</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m finished I rinse the bottle with hot water and squeeze a few rounds of water through the comb tip and everything&#x27;s good to go for the next time.</li>
      <li>The color is a lovely natural looking brown with a few golden highlights.</li>
      <li>I love that it takes only ten mins..</li>
      <li>As I get older, my hair is thinning and often frizzy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick enough I can color my hair in the morning before work and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
      <li>Even if I had long hair and could only use it once I would still get this stuff but being able to use it twice makes this a no-brainer.</li>
      <li>Day to day my hair is glossy, shiny, and most importantly, not gray.</li>
      <li>I love the color and convenience (even if it doesn&#x27;t cover 100%--perfectly) and may not last as long as others have advised me...</li>
      <li>Just colored my hair with this medium golden brown and it looks better than my own long term stylists color, but a lot less expensive.</li>
      <li>It was very noticeably red.</li>
      <li>I used to have my hair professionally colored, but I just can&#x27;t afford to keep it up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a color and it looks natural.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even use the conditioner that came with it, yet my hair now looks and feels natural and soft.</li>
      <li>Your hair will be evenly colored and silky soft.</li>
      <li>This really works in only 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>are natural.</li>
      <li>With all the high quality packaging it almost seems like it was intended to be reused but nothing in the instructions actually state that.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you, this stuff is definitely worth the extra few bucks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s really nothing I can tell that deserves less than five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>addition, the hair coloring solution itself is quite thin and easily drops all over the place.</li>
      <li>I have fine, fussy hair that hates product,  grows quickly,  and is a pronounced ugly brown and gray (I&#x27;m only 32! )</li>

<li> My natural hair color is dark blonde.</li>
<li> Long lasting color and shine.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like leaving hair coloring products on my hair for long periods of time.</li>
<li> I pour half of the big bottle white stuff into a temporary container before mixing.</li>
<li> /&gt;Anyway, because of my short hair I only need to use half.</li>
<li> but this one is actually about half the size of a toothpaste tube with a regular cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color: What can I say?</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out or damage my hair.</li>
<li> What a pity Clairol discontinued it.</li>
<li> I use it every few days and it lasts until the next time I dye.</li>
<li> /&gt;This is not the color I expected.</li>
<li> You may be used to the &amp;#34;ketchup packet&amp;#34; of conditioner with the other brands</li>
<li> and I only have a few!</li>
<li> So hard to find, so I ordered multiple boxes.  </li>
<li> My hair is a really dark brown and this makes it a lighter brown with reddish highlights....</li>
<li> The color paste comes in a foil tube instead of liquid in a little bottle like my other brand</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I will use again but recommend it for those with little gray.</li>
<li> You just squeeze a little while combing through your hair and then do some smoothing and massaging with your non-bottle hand.&lt;br</li>
<li> It had been a few years</li>

    <li> great 10 minute color!!</li>
    <li> The best for long lasting shiny hair at home! Been using for years, best price found anywhere!!</li>
    <li> Ten minutes and you&#x27;re done.  Happy with color and shine</li>
    <li> Loved the ease of use, color&lt;br /&gt;Is perfect. So is softness and shine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this covered grays at all and I only have a few!</li>
    <li> I took a chance getting this &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; brand over my normal brand which is half the price of this one. Let me tell you, this stuff is definitely worth the extra few bucks. Literally every relevant piece in the box is better than the other brand I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves: High quality textured plastic that fit easily over my large hands. (yes I&#x27;m a guy) What&#x27;s extra nice about them is that they&#x27;re so high quality that when I&#x27;m finished I just rinse them in the sink, pull them off inside-out and put them back in the box. Why? Keep reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell: Great. Instead of that strong chemical smell that my other brand has, this one smells like a really nice shampoo or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle: There&#x27;s nothing special about the bottle itself but the optional comb tip makes things really easy with short hair.

It&#x27;s a color and it looks natural. My hair is a really dark brown and this makes it a lighter brown with reddish highlights....maybe even chestnut. (I heard a girl say that once so I&#x27;m not sure what that means)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, because of my short hair I only need to use half. I pour half of the big bottle white stuff into a temporary container before mixing. The color paste comes in a foil tube instead of liquid in a little bottle like my other brand so it&#x27;s easy to split and recap.

Even if I had long hair and could only use it once I would still get this stuff but being able to use it twice makes this a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> Item received quickly and as described</li>
    <li> Used this with a highlighting cap for at home lowlights. It turned out pretty good. I wish I had done more/chunkier low lights. Maybe I will try it again with foils. My natural hair color is dark blonde.</li>
    <li> I was buying this at Target and it is so much cheaper buying it on Amazon through Subscribe &amp; Save.  My husband does this for me and it is so easy to use.  It does a good job on my greys.</li>
    <li> I was unable to find this 10 minute permanent hair color in our local stores so ordered from Amazon.  It had been a few years and I have more gray than I did back then.  I appreciate the quick application and the fresh color and shine that it produces.  However, it seems that staying power is lacking.  In 2 weeks, my most difficult to cover roots were emerging.  I don&#x27;t think I will use again but recommend it for those with little gray.</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake, and now it&#x27;s the only hair color I want. As I get older, my hair is thinning and often frizzy. After applying this color, my hair seems much fuller, the frizz is gone, and my hair shines.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
    <li> Love it!  Have used for well over a year, maybe 2.  Too bad it can&#x27;t be purchased in any stores. ,</li>
    <li> It colored my daughters short hair perfectly. However if you have longer hair you may need 2, possibly even 3 boxes to cover your hair. Color is great and has lasted a long time also.</li>
    <li> Love this and could no longer find in stores!  Like rthat is only 10 minutes vs 25-30 and colors are natural.</li>
    <li> I love the applicator comb it comes with!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years! Although my hair was soft and shiny, it is an orange/brassy shine- HORRIBLE! I have always used shades of Brown (Golden, Warm and cool color variations) but I have never had my color turn out like this- yuck!</li>
    <li> Long lasting color and shine. I don&#x27;t like leaving hair coloring products on my hair for long periods of time. Claire Perfect 10  does a wonderful job in only 10 minutes!</li>
    <li> Only takes ten minutes to color your hair, does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> my favorite hair coloring brand.</li>
    <li> the best haircolor product EVER!</li>
    <li> I love the color and convenience (even if it doesn&#x27;t cover 100%--perfectly) and may not last as long as others have advised me...I still would not switch.</li>
    <li> This product is remarkably easy to use. I love that you can attach the comb to the top and slowly smooth it through your hair to ensure that the solution spreads out evenly. The color is a lovely natural looking brown with a few golden highlights. You really do get perfect results after just 10 minutes! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have fine, fussy hair that hates product,  grows quickly,  and is a pronounced ugly brown and gray (I&#x27;m only 32! ) I used to have my hair professionally colored, but I just can&#x27;t afford to keep it up. This has been a close second. I have it on subscibe amd save and use it monthly. Even my fine, fussy, easily damaged hair does very well with it. Day to day my hair is glossy, shiny, and most importantly, not gray. This is easy to use and only takes 10 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t dry out or damage my hair. The color is natural and lovely.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Clairol Perfect 10 is easy to apply, the color holds well, and it only takes 10 minutes!  What a pity Clairol discontinued it.</li>
    <li> So hard to find, so I ordered multiple boxes.  Love the convenience of the 10 minutes and that the color lasts.</li>
    <li> Best color I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first timer for coloring hair at home. I want to thank others here for their reviews, because I know nothing. Just colored my hair with this medium golden brown and it looks better than my own long term stylists color, but a lot less expensive. I didn&#x27;t even use the conditioner that came with it, yet my hair now looks and feels natural and soft. I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s really nothing I can tell that deserves less than five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This hair color made my hair a burgundy reddish brown color. It was very noticeably red. My husband immediately said something about my hair being red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the color I expected. I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the hair coloring solution itself is quite thin and easily drops all over the place. I have been coloring my hair for years and have never had so much hair dye drip into the floor and counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love that it takes only ten mins.. Color is rich and it does not burn my hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT IN A TIME CRUNCH!! Beautiful color and hindsight pretty highlights in ten minutes. My only comment, and reason for a four star instead of five, is that TRULY I believe the color fades faster than 25 minute hair color. Not TERRIBLE, but I color again sooner when I use this. Still, great product and will use it over and over again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> It only takes 10 minutes but I found it a little bit irritating. The color does not run out for a couple of washes.</li>
    <li> This really works in only 10 minutes.  Great for coverage of the gray.</li>
    <li> Best hair color on the market. Leaves hair shiny. For best results on grey roots, mix remainder of color with one ounce of shampoo and one ounce of water and shake. Add to hair after the 10 minute processing time and emulsify through entire hair from roots to tips  Leave on for 5 minutes rinse, shampoo and condition with the conditioner provided in the box.  Your hair will be evenly colored and silky soft. I have been using this hair color for years and can now only find it on amazon. I hope they don&#x27;t stop carrying this product!  I am medium golden brown.</li>
    <li> 10 minutes is all I want to spend on this so this works for me!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The color is close enough to mine that my hairstylist did not realize I colored my hair until I mentioned it.  It&#x27;s quick enough I can color my hair in the morning before work and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to apply.....good color....</li>
    <li> Everyone who saw this color on me said it is a good color for me.  I am looking for that color when I color again.</li>
