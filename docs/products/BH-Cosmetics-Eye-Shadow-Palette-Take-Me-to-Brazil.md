<li> Black is solid, white is a shimmery green.</li>
<li> I will buy another in the future as I use it everyday.</li>
<li> Some colors are matte and some have a few shine to them.</li>
<li> (My small hand compared to the pallet in pic)</li>
<li> Each eyeshadow is very hard to apply; i recommend for you to buy the palette from BH Cosmetics.</li>

    <li> Unique pallet, convenient case, good price. Maybe not great for regular wear but excellent for costume make up.</li>
    <li> Great color and variety.  Perfect for travelers-survived plane travel in a carry on.  With nude eye shadow primer,  I got complements even the morning after application!</li>
    <li> Love this palet. But found out it was over 7 dollars cheaper from Bh Them self.  And comes just as fast. And many more palets to choose from.</li>
    <li> I just love this eye shadow palette. I saw it on Youtube and I liked the coverage that was displayed. I love this, I ordered two.</li>
    <li> i really like my palette and the colors are loud just like i exspected</li>
    <li> Beautiful palette, fast shipping. Colors are vibrant and last all day.</li>
    <li> Love my eye shadow and they arrive on time for the holidays.</li>

    <li> The colors are great! However the eye shadow comes off very easily.</li>
    <li> A beautiful, beautiful pallet. Not as matte as I expected it to be, but a damp brush can fix that easily. Otherwise, five stars.</li>
    <li> Great shadows very pigmented.</li>
    <li> You migh have to do a slight second touch up but I applied the eye shadow around 9 am and even rode for hours that day and it was still on bright around 6pm</li>
    <li> I got this makeup palette very fast and it actually came 1 day earlier than its due date. It came in a bubble wrap sleeve inside of another box because I also ordered another palette. When I opened it, there were no cracks or loose pots. The colors are extremely vivid and vibrant. If you&#x27;re into neon, rainbow makeup this is the makeup palette for you. It&#x27;s also not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Great colors, great product. That&#x27;s all that needs to be said.</li>
    <li> Love the bright colors!</li>
    <li> INCREDIBLE!!! the colors are bright and last for a long time (i use a primer as well though) and they blend beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;i have a picture of some makeup i did for a costume attached:)&lt;br /&gt;it goes on smoothly, comes off easily and works rlly well! overall i do recommend this!</li>
    <li> Each eyeshadow is very hard to apply; i recommend for you to buy the palette from BH Cosmetics. The colors look very pigmented in the palette and on a brush, but when on my eyes the colors faded away.</li>

The  white is so nice to put on your lids and then add the &#x27;vibrant&#x27; colors to accent it.  I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS!!,,,  I also can say, I am a VERIFIED BUYER AS WELL, so this is NOT made up... You&#x27;ll absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Honestly my favorite pallette of all time! The colors are so vibrant and highly pigmented. So many different combinations that it fits your every mood. I&#x27;d recommend using an eye primer before hand to prevent creasing. With a primer my shadows have lasted all day long and looked just as good from start to finish. I will buy another in the future as I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty! They were carefully wrapped and not a single one was cracked! Thank you! I will Definetly be buying from them again!</li>
