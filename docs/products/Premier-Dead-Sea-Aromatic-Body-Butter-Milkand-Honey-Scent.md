      <li>there are commercially available products that do just as good a job with dry winter skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like perfumey scents, I like them mild and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>almost too expensive to get a great review no matter how good it is.  </li>
      <li>It is the best product so far that I have tried of Dead Sea Premier.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Very much worth the time and price to try out this cream.</li>
      <li>Is well worth getting.</li>
      <li>Those who I give it to seem to like it very much as I do not use it I can not say for myself.</li>
      <li>This is my 2nd jar and I still love it....</li>
      <li>First the product sold on amazon is in a glass jar.</li>
      <li>I bought 3 jars to give to my daughters because they like it so much and were using mine up!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product ... especially on Amazon where I found it to be more affordable &amp; delivered right to my door.</li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this tremendous body cream.  </li>
      <li>This crème really keeps the skin soft.  </li>
      <li>I think this is probably my favorite product of the Premier Dead Sea line.  </li>
      <li>I live in a mountain community, 6,000ft up &amp; the high altitude plays havoc on my skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is terrific, I absorbs nicely into the skin, and the scent is not very strong but I can smell it on me all day.</li>
      <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually makes a difference ...</li>
      <li>it makes your skin so soft.  </li>

    <li> This stuff is amazing, and it is great to not have to pay Mall Kiosk prices!  Will order this again and again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before after purchasing it at the local mall.  The vendor has since closed down, but that&#x27;s ok because I get a much better price on line through Amazon.com    Thanks,    Margie</li>
    <li> This is by far the best body butter I have ever used. Bought it at the Charlotte Mall at the reduced price of $35.00 from a sales girl I could not get away from, but am now so glad I did. Even happier I found it again &amp; cheaper. Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It really makes your skin feel super soft after you use it. I love to use it after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the bath, especially when I&#x27;ve used the Premier Dead Sea Aromatherapy Mineral Body Treatment. The combo makes for super silky skin!</li>
    <li> Overall shopping experience was great with very quick shipping and the product was just what I was hoping for in quality.</li>
    <li> This lotion is my favorite. I would bathe in it if I could. I bought 3 jars to give to my daughters because they like it so much and were using mine up! It&#x27;s so rich and luxurious I feel like a queen when I wear it. Makes my skin so soft and smells so perfect. I love that a little goes a long way. I hope they never stop making this exact product because nothing I have ever used feels or smells so wonderful! Thank you Dead Sea Premier!!!!!</li>
    <li> Those who I give it to seem to like it very much as I do not use it I can not say for myself.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body butter from Premier Dead Sea; however, the ad promised samples of other Premier products and there were none in the box.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT! I use it bought for wife always gets severely chapped and cracked hands when it gets cold used last year worked wonders in days ran out had to get her more! I love it as well!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife. She loves the way it feels. It makes her skin feel so smooth, not greasy. Is well worth getting.</li>
    <li> I love this product, makes my 56 yr old skin feel so soft after laying out in the sun all summer. I love to put this on after my shower, feels like silk on my legs.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry hands, legs &amp; feet.  I use it for leg &amp; foot massages - feels wonderful and has a nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> My son was in the Navy in Norfolk and bought this cream for me for Christmas at a mall Keosk a couple of years ago.  When I ran out, I was so happy to find it on Amazon, it is a silky texture with a wonderful smell that is not over powering.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a mall last year. It smells so good and leave you skin really soft. Try to buy it in another location but the product is not for sale anymore. When i saw it on Amazon do not hesitate and bought it inmediatly.</li>
    <li> I am not sure that this is the real deal!  It smells the same, the jar is the same but it isn&#x27;t as thick as the body butter that I bought at the store. I also had someone else test for me and didn&#x27;t tell them anything and the only thing they said is that it isn&#x27;t as thick.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to lotion up all the time... But as I get older my skin is getting dryer.... Therefore I need the lotion. I bought this one after sampling it in the mall and I can&#x27;t find one thing I don&#x27;t love about it. The smell is terrific, I absorbs nicely into the skin, and the scent is not very strong but I can smell it on me all day. Will buy again!&#x27;n</li>
    <li> This is the best body butter ever. My skin has the same feeling I get from going to the spa.  I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I have been buying the Premier Dead See Milk and Honey body butter for the last year or so.  I think this is probably my favorite product of the Premier Dead Sea line.  I hope Amazon continues to carry it.  I leaves your skin so smooth and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Having purchased from a kiosk in June I wanted to find same item for less.  Unfortunately with that came less quality.  Cream was just that &#x3D; cream instead of heavier butter.  Color is now white instead of beige honey color. Scent is softer - nice but not as I had hoped. I don&#x27;t know if Premier changed the product or if this is a knock off but I preferred the original.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin! I use many Premier products and have enjoyed wonderful results with all of them.  Love the scent too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this crème.  It&#x27;s good for all over the body and the smell is wonderful.  I use this crème everyday and have bought some as gifts. This crème really keeps the skin soft.  I would recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this tremendous body cream.  The scent is perfect, the performance even better.</li>
    <li> Excellent complement to Premier Dead Sea salt scrub or alone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body butter.  Not only does is smell delicious it makes your skin so soft.  The product absorbs instantly into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily.  The aroma is very subtle yet it last all day.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to test if it was a fake. I also bough the real thing from the premier dead sea company for comparison. First the product sold on amazon is in a glass jar. The real stuff is in a plastic jar. Also the glass container only has a piece of plastic covering the lotion. The real stuff has a thin foil cover that says premier on it that has to be removed to get to the lotion. On to the lotion. The real stuff has a nice light honey smell where the fake stuff (from amazon) has a smell like Johnson and Johnson baby lotion. It was a total disappointment that the scent wasn&#x27;t even right. I&#x27;m not sure if the company knows that the products are fake or not but it is unfortunate. If you don&#x27;t believe me purchase from amazon and from premier and compare them for yourself.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used! Non greasy and absorbs quickly! Very nice soft scent. I have bought this quite a few times and got my mother hooked as well. This is not a thick chucky paste like most body butters, it is a very nice cream. Leaves skin feeling like silk. Great price, I first bought this stuff at the mall and paid $45.00 and it was worth it then!</li>
    <li> Dead Sea Premier Body Butter Rocks!   It is the best product so far that I have tried of Dead Sea Premier.  I love most of the products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Very nice body butter that goes on smooth and smells really nice .  Very happy will order more when I run out</li>
    <li> Very much worth the time and price to try out this cream. I am happy with it and currently sharing with family. will order more</li>
    <li> I love the light smell of this body butter!  After using the exfoliating scrub I use this body butter and it makes your hands feel so soft.  Highly recommend this along with the exfoliating scrub as well!</li>
    <li> This product makes your skin feel like silk.  The smells is light and very refreshing.  A great product for the price!</li>
    <li> This is beautiful body cream...thick, rich, creamy and nice scent. I would buy it again. Also would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!!!  Goes on nice, smells nice, and most of all it leaves your skin feeling silky smooth--not greasy or sticky at all!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> It was my wife that actually bought this, and she loves the cream. She says it rubs in well with no greasy residue. She also loves the smell of it, some body creams can be over powering, but this is understated and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fight&amp;#34; with your perfume.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - put it on after a shower at bed and next day my skin feels silky all day.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and received exactly what I ordered.  This is one of my favorite skin care body products even my husband is using it and always wants me to stock up on it.</li>
    <li> The product was top of the line, cost effective and the same quality product I use too purchase at the mall&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have used in years! I live in a mountain community, 6,000ft up &amp; the high altitude plays havoc on my skin. This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually makes a difference ... &amp; I have used them all. It is wonderful &amp; makes my skin feel great! I highly recommend this product ... especially on Amazon where I found it to be more affordable &amp; delivered right to my door.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd jar and I still love it....Make my skin so soft and last for a long time...It does not take much so the jar last a long time too.</li>
    <li> Just as I had hoped. Very pleased with the priced compared to the mall kiosk&#x27;s outrageous cost! Definitely a candidate for repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> almost too expensive to get a great review no matter how good it is.  there are commercially available products that do just as good a job with dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item before at a store, and I loved it! The milk and honey scent was very light and such a nice scent. This time around, its not as nice and just seems off. It still does a nice job moisturizing my skin, but I wasn&#x27;t happy with the scent. I don&#x27;t like perfumey scents, I like them mild and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The best body butter ever!</li>
    <li> Best absorbing lotion I have ever used.  Smells great and a little dab goes a long way. Try it! you will love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful thick cream that makes your skin feel like silk.  I&#x27;ve used it for 4 years and I love it.</li>
