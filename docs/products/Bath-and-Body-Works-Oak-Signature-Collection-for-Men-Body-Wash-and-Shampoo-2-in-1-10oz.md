      <li>the product is really amazing feeling after you took shower.  </li>
      <li>Well the stuff smells wonderful, but for the price I was expecting something very concentrated.  </li>
      <li>This product worked well, also I liked how the smell was not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I guess more of just my opinion.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend loves the smell even more.  </li>
      <li>Bath &amp; body Works realizes how many men are hooked on this scent and starts having it again.</li>
      <li>I am sure it would be awesome for some, especially if you wear cologne.</li>
      <li>Smells nothing like oak, even a rotting tree smells better.</li>
      <li>Pretty much the best smelling body wash for men, ever.  </li>
      <li>Anyway you will not disappointed about this product.</li>
      <li>It foams and gives the body a clean and silk feeling.</li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t feel super clean.</li>
      <li>which is good since it cost a little more than stuff in the store.</li>
      <li>This is great soap - just a little too perfumey for my tastes.</li>
      <li>It has a great scent even after you dried yourself.</li>
      <li>I personally recommend this one for all men who really wanted to be feel good after the shower.  </li>
      <li>This product works well, produces a nice lather, and the scent will linger for several hours after a shower.</li>
      <li>I am reviewing these body washes and so far this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Formerly a soap and washcloth dude, He has broadened his bathing experience with a spongee (no pink please) and this great smelling and cleansing wash.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to get clean</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to someone who wants a unique scented body wash for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It has a sickeningly sweet aroma similar to a cheap Joop cologne.</li>
      <li>Ingredients of Aloe and vitamin E mixed with a nice masculine scent is what you get here.  </li>
      <li>Not too strong but definitely noticeable.</li>
      <li>Thanks guys.</li>
      <li>Very musky scent like wood and cinnamon.  </li>
      <li>Cleans the grime of the day off reasonably well.</li>
      <li>The smell of this body wash is absolutely fantastic: subtle yet sexy.</li>
      <li>This smells great and the small bottle last longer than you&#x27;d think.</li>
      <li>If your objective is skin health, this is not the product for you, however, if you want a subtle sexy smell, and an okay cleanser, this is for you.</li>
      <li>It does the job as a decent body wash though I suppose.</li>
      <li>It is definitely a masculine smell, but it was too strong and long lasting for me.</li>
      <li>However you can buy this product directly from the Bath &amp; Body shops</li>
      <li>Stay far away from this.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>Apparently gouging the crud out of everyone.  </li>
      <li>Also, as I state about the others, this lathers up really well with just a little bit in the hand.</li>

    <li> Not as concentrated as it should be. I&#x27;ve used the same product bought directly from Bath &amp; Body Works and this stuff must be slightly watered down or something. It does the job as a decent body wash though I suppose.</li>
    <li> This truly is a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Ingredients of Aloe and vitamin E mixed with a nice masculine scent is what you get here.  Very musky scent like wood and cinnamon.  I am reviewing these body washes and so far this one is my favorite.  Also, as I state about the others, this lathers up really well with just a little bit in the hand. A very good buy for men who want a nice smell after the shower and good soap for cleaning their skin and nourishing it as well.</li>
    <li> This product works well, produces a nice lather, and the scent will linger for several hours after a shower. Cleans the grime of the day off reasonably well. Would recommend this to someone who wants a unique scented body wash for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> If you like to smell like a man, buy this body wash. This smells great and the small bottle last longer than you&#x27;d think.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff through Amazon, though it is paid a bit extra shipping charge the product is really amazing feeling after you took shower.  I personally recommend this one for all men who really wanted to be feel good after the shower.  However you can buy this product directly from the Bath &amp; Body shops but you need to pay and then traveling time sort of hassles you may face.  Anyway you will not disappointed about this product.</li>
    <li> This body wash is definitely my type of soap. It has a musk smell that is also sweet-definitely manly. It doesn&#x27;t take much to get clean which is good since it cost a little more than stuff in the store. Not watery at all. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me. If anything it moisterizes. I want a cologne that smells the same way. Not too strong but definitely noticeable.</li>
    <li> This product is the best body wash I ever used. It foams and gives the body a clean and silk feeling. It has a great scent even after you dried yourself.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell. Just didn&#x27;t feel super clean. I guess more of just my opinion. Gotta find the one the Mrs. will like!</li>
    <li> Just wish it was still being produced.</li>
    <li> Pretty much the best smelling body wash for men, ever.  Bath and Body works discontinued it. Fail.  All their other men&#x27;s fragrances stink or smell too girly.  I see some are still trying to sell left over inventory here on Amazon. Apparently gouging the crud out of everyone.  I see it&#x27;s going for $55.  Shame on the seller.</li>
    <li> If I could give it less stars I would. The smell is detestable. It has a sickeningly sweet aroma similar to a cheap Joop cologne. It&#x27;s over powering, even after you rinse it off. Smells nothing like oak, even a rotting tree smells better. Stay far away from this.</li>
    <li> This is great soap - just a little too perfumey for my tastes. It is definitely a masculine smell, but it was too strong and long lasting for me. I am sure it would be awesome for some, especially if you wear cologne.</li>
    <li> Too cologne like smelling</li>
    <li> This product worked well, also I liked how the smell was not overpowering.  My girlfriend loves the smell even more.  The only complaint I have is that it contains sulfates.</li>
    <li> The smell of this body wash is absolutely fantastic: subtle yet sexy. It cleans you no better than any generic soap or body wash.

If your objective is skin health, this is not the product for you, however, if you want a subtle sexy smell, and an okay cleanser, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Love this scent!  Hope Bath &amp; body Works realizes how many men are hooked on this scent and starts having it again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. Formerly a soap and washcloth dude, He has broadened his bathing experience with a spongee (no pink please) and this great smelling and cleansing wash. A happy man.</li>
    <li> Well the stuff smells wonderful, but for the price I was expecting something very concentrated.  It is not and makes for very expensive showers.  Back to the regular priced washes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to purchase something, and be pleasantly reminded of it.  Like whenever I shower.  Products are just as expected.  Smell is great.  Thanks guys.</li>
