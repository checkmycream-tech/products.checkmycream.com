<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product. The cream feels good and refreshing under the eyes.</li>
    <li> It was ok, didn&#x27;t find it moisturizing enough</li>
    <li> After about a week I noticed that my dark circles have definately reduced which is great as I have gad them for as long as I can remember and I am 51.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry under my eyes so I have tried more eye creams than I can count but this one surprised me. While I still needed to add a more emollient cream on top of this one, I noticed something that I have honestly never experienced with any other eye cream. My dark circles started to fade! In all my years of crossing my fingers and handing over my credit card, I have never found a product that did what it claims in this respect. They are not gone but the difference is noticeable and wonderful. The texture of this cream is lovely and the packaging is light and easy to travel with. If my under eye area weren&#x27;t so freakishly dry this would be a perfect all-in-one product. I haven&#x27;t had anyone ask me if I am okay or if I am tired in a while now, something that has happened constantly most of my adult life and it feels fantastic. I know that everyone is different when it comes to dark circles but if you struggle with them, you need to try this product - you just might be able to uncross your fingers.</li>
    <li> This really works... my dark eye circles were lightened after using for less than a month.  And it was my beautician who realized it!  Have placed another order for this!</li>
    <li> Gentle cream and easily absorbed. I amanita sure of it&#x27;s effectiveness just yet.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out with just about anything. My skin would get dry, I&#x27;d use a lotion, skin would break out, stop using lotion and let the cycle begin again.  I use this for my entire face and it&#x27;s amazing.  My face is soft and no breakouts.  I also use the Poppy Austin Rhassoul Clay with Rose Water as a face mask.  I have ordered many of their other products over the past few months and can&#x27;t say any of them disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;They also have great customer service and make sure to reach out to return customers and thank them.  When was the last time you had that happen?</li>
    <li> This is great eye cream. It is light and after only a few weeks I see my lines disappearing. I use it on my lids also and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Sadly, I am a mid 40s guy who looks pretty young, other than the bags under by eyes.  I look in the mirror and cover my bags, and BOOM, I look 10 years younger.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m that vain; I buy like $15 shirts and $25 pants, literally.  But the bags are just rough to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for $20 and after about 4 weeks, I DO see a difference.  It&#x27;s not major but I do see a difference and I&#x27;m hoping after a few months, maybe half the bags go away??  If so, I would be thrilled.  $20 for a small difference that may be big over time.  I recommend you try this too!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for better results but I really can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference but I&#x27;ve had a really bad sinus issues and that could be the reason so I&#x27;m going to send a second bottle to I ordered by accident to my mother and get her take on it 😊</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  I love having a pump for eye cream rather than sticking my fingers or whatever down into a jar.  The product goes on so smoothly and is a great around the eye moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles so I can&#x27;t testify to that - but I do love this eye cream and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is really good eye creme and a fantastic size for the money.  I was so pleased I bought one for my daughter as well.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy Austin is a company I have fallen in love with over the last year!  They make great products that not only work but are sensible and safe for the skin. So far with the exception of one ingredient that they used in one of their products, I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyes, hands and neck are the first thing to reveal your age as we get older.  So its important that you always use properly formulated products that will make a difference in those areas.  I normally use retinol around my eyes, however being pregnant its a &#x27;no no&#x27;.  So instead I have to pick other products that are just as effective without potentially harming the baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that Poppy Austin came out with an eye cream I was so psyched to try it.  However when I realized that I was going to have the chance to review it as well, I was totally over the moon.  This product contains &amp;#34;organic Aloe, organic Jojoba Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Rosehip Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Tamanu Oil&amp;#34; to name a few.  It also lacks all the silly fillers, alochol and other ingredients that are harmful to the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this around my eye area four weeks ago and I have to say I am amazed at the results.  It has helped greatly with puffiness, tackling my very fine lines and wrinkles and seriously hydrating my eye area.  I was amazing when one day I touched my eye and realized just how awesome it felt!  It felt literally like fine silk I kid you not.  I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my eyes and get over how soft my skin felt. I love the fact that it has NO smell to it which is great. Fragrances in skincare products are actually harmful to the skin and break down collagen.  Moreover fragrances around the eyes are a serious potential irritant.  So its important to me that all my skincare products be fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now in regards to dark circles there was no help there are dark circles are genetic and no eye cream can help with that.  That is a proven medical fact that in order to get rid of dark circles only plastic surgery works in that area.  However lack of sleep and dehydrating helps to make them look worse.  So while this did nothing to help with my dark circles, however it did hydrate the skin well enough on days I was lacking on sleep so it didn&#x27;t look any worse. So that was truly a bonus for me! Any help in the dark circle area works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is that this eye cream isn&#x27;t your normal small size bottle.  While it isn&#x27;t large, however for the price you get a decent amount.  I hate buying eye cream that comes in a tiny jar and paying a lot for hardly nothing.  Moreover this eye cream comes in an air tight and light protected pump bottle.  So the integrity of the product remains stable and doesn&#x27;t lose it value since no air or light gets into it.  I personally NEVER use a cream product form of any kind that comes in a jar.  Reason is with its constant exposure to light and air (not to mention bacteria from your hands) it breaks down and destabilizes the ingredients.  So I appreciate that Poppy Austin understands not only about using quality ingredients but how to protect them when it comes to packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this product if you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to use a retinol product and are in the market for a good eye cream.</li>
    <li> Fristly after using it for few days I don&#x27;t see any improvement but the texture quite smooth so I decided to keep it.  After using it for a month, I started to realize the skin surrounding my eyes had grow a lot of tiny grease so I stop using it but its too late to return for refund.  Very disappointed. Not recommed</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  My eyes are definitely less puffy and the all natural ingredients are the best.</li>
    <li> Just received our second bottle. My wife and I both use this and we find it does a very good job of nearly removing the dark circles under our eyes and smoothing out wrinkles, too. I am a skeptic about skin care products (and a lot of other things) but have to say I was truly surprised that this eye cream works. The price is very reasonable, too. We are still on our first bottle and we both have been using it daily for about three months.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it ladies, none of this stuff we spend all this money on really works. I will say though I love the way this eye cream feels on my &amp;#34;baggy eyes&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but it feels very soothing. As far as helping wrinkles, I have so many it will take a miracle. I will update later if I find one had actually been softened. Then I will give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has lasted me nearly 5 months and has taken about 10-15 years off of my guesstimated age by others.  I actually use it almost all over my face because it is so amazing.  I am going to buy this for everyone in my life.</li>
    <li> really good product..you can see a difference around eye within a week.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer stays for long but does not creat film, I am enjoying the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very soothing to use.  No stinging or burning, as I&#x27;ve experienced with other creams. Just a pleasant cooling sensation of the eye area, and it does help with puffiness to some degree. Not as much or as quickly as I&#x27;d like it to work on the puffiness, hence the 4 star rating from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that being said, it is very good at keeping the delicate skin around the eye hydrated throughout the day! And it does so without a heavy or greasy feeling. The smell is light &amp; pleasant, and the texture of the cream is light and very easy to apply...not too thick, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re dragging it across your skin like some other &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; make you feel. And not so light that you feel you need to reapply it periodically throughout the day. It has &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little cream goes a long way, so this bottle will last a good long while.  Good product at a great price.  I would recommend it to my friends and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST eye cream I have ever used! I would recommend it to everyone and I plan to stick with it forever!</li>
    <li> very generous amount for the price. it goes on smooth and it&#x27;s very light. i love it.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an eye cream that helps with puffiness without causing an allergic reaction as my eyes are very sensitive. This one really does the trick!!</li>
    <li> A lovely, light cream which is easily absorbed by the skin. Provides a silky, soft sensation, and knowing it is all natural adds an important plus to the experience of the product. Highly recommended. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!.  I have very sensitive skin and eyes when it comes to facial products. This is the only eye cream that does NOT MAKE MY EYES WATER.</li>
    <li> I see no changes in my eyes wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! I have not used any eye cream in years, but now that I am in my late 30&#x27;s I feel like it is a necessity. In the week I have used this product I have totally loved the way it makes my eyes feel. And while I did not feel my eyes had too dark of circles, I do feel they have lightened some. I also love the packaging - the cream comes out very precisely, so I don&#x27;t feel like I am wasting it. I definitely feel this product is a good value for the money and I plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Very nice eye cream. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream!! Ever since using it, I&#x27;ve noticed my eyes don&#x27;t look as tired, and the skin around my eye doesn&#x27;t look as dry.  I highly recommend this product, especially for those of you who are on the fence about starting an eye care routine! Prevention is everything and this product delivers!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know, I didn&#x27;t feel nothing new in my skin</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks and have not seen a huge difference.  I am thinking it may take more time for results.</li>
    <li> great stuff, eyes dont look puffy or dark after this.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer but I&#x27;m not sure it is hydrating enough for my winter skin. It soaks in quick and my eye area is moisturized for a while but looking in the mirror hours later I look dehydrated again. If I reapply throughout the day that works best but I don&#x27;t always have time or access to do it. I will save it and try it when the weather warms up.</li>
    <li> Great product I feel it firming and brightening the eye area with no irritation.</li>
    <li> Since I received the Best Eye Cream, I have been using it on a daily basis, &amp; I have notice a good feeling under my eyes, like the skin feeling softer, the appearance is a more healthier look! I&#x27;m very pleased with this product so far, &amp; I&#x27;m going to continue to use it, as long  as I like the results! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Really nice purchase experience. I have already bought the rose water bebofe and I really believe everything is organic , they make me feel so comfortable. You deserve it!</li>
    <li> I have horrible bags under my eyes!  It does not matter how much sleep I get or what I do, these will be an issue for me.  I guess it is the Italian in me.  I have am constantly trying to find a new eye cream to help reduce the puffiness and dark circles under my eye, so I was excited to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the ingredients as they are all very well known to help with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing is to wash your face.  Then using only one small pump (Yes, I love when these products have pumps) put under and around your eyes.  I like how smooth this product was.  It did not have a funny smell and it absorbs nicely into your skin.  It does have a cooling effect as well, which I like when using something on my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a week and I can say I have seen a slight difference which I was pretty happy with. Like I said, my dark circles are almost hereditary so very little will help get rid of them, but this did seem to lesson the darkness so it was a win for me!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above fin exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just about a week now, I am extremely sensitive around my eyes and this has not caused me any issues, it&#x27;s very moisturizing. As far as fine lines or dark circles I have not noticed I mainly needed something that moisturized and was hypoallergenic and this is it, I will continue to use this!!</li>
    <li> Great product for your eyes can notice a difference within weeks of using it</li>
    <li> Poppy Austin, is a beauty company, which carries products derived from natural and organic sources. The sources may not be your everyday common lingo, like Barbary Fig seed oil, but that does not mean it&#x27;s not something that should be overlooked. The old ways are becoming the new ways, so look at it like you would your skin, new ways to find rejuvenation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent an eye cream from Poppy Austin to test-drive. The eye cream has green tea, vitamin C and 72% of the ingredients are organic. The base of the solution is mostly an herbal infusion and Aloe Vera, so the product feels light when applied. The skin quickly absorbs the product and the eye moisturizer targets these major issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness&lt;br /&gt;Dark Circles&lt;br /&gt;Increases Elasticity&lt;br /&gt;Fine Lines and Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Protects against signs of Aging&lt;br /&gt;and also Moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Being that this is an eye cream, a little goes a long way and I use a dabbing technique to disperse the product and then gently applied it to create an even layer. I waited for the eye cream to fully absorb, which ranged between 1 to 2 minutes time lapse, before applying any make-up. I did not experience issues during application of cosmetics to the area or hours later, when some eye creams can cause a &amp;#34;bubbling up&amp;#34; film that tends to make your foundation look like you forgot to blend. This eye cream gave me none of that, so I continued use for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (as listed on the bottle): Herbal Infusion, Jojoba Esters, Glycolic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Grapeseed oil, Green Tea, Licorice, Methylsulfonylmethane, Evening Primrose oil, Sodium Ascorbyl.Phosphate (Vitamin C), Wildcrafted Euphrasia Officinails, Tamanu oil, Oregon Grape, Helichrysum essential oil, Jojoba oil, Rosehip seed oil, Palm oil, Hydrogenated Castor oil, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Coenzyme Q10, Phytic Acid, Phospholipids, Tocopheryl, Lecithin, Apple, Lemon, Sugar Cane, Dipeptide Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate, Lemongrass, Vitamin C Palmate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-3, Sclerotium Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, and Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: On the first week of use, I noticed that the skin surrounding my eyes was moisturized and because I suffer from allergies, I continued use to see if I could get rid of some of the puffiness. I do not suffer from dark circles thankfully, so I could not test the cream against that. My skin remained the same but nourished with continued use. On week two, I still use my eye drops to get rid of my red eyes but also the puffiness and swelling I wake up with. I am happy with the way the product disappears after being absorbed. Zero residue and it does not haunt me later in the day by creating an oily film. The manufacture desires two applications per day for maximum results and I continue use into week 3. As I&#x27;m in California, the Winter we have has been mild but I did notice that when the nights are cold, my skin looks firm and feels like so, however not as moisturized. I have been needing to add a small droplet of oil (argan) on those evenings. I attribute it to my own needs due to my seasonal allergies that tend to be serious as we get closer to Spring. I will say for firming and protecting the skin around your eyes, this cream does the job as long as you keep in mind that puffiness will only go so much down without the use of eye drops but compared to the over-the-counter eye creams I have tried, this one fought the battle of the &amp;#34;Puffy Eyes&amp;#34; with great valor!

My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used this lotion for a few weeks around my eyes but I am not seeing a visable difference.I think that this type of product you really need to use it for a more extended amount of time in order to see real results. I’m always hoping for quicker results, as I have allergies and I’m constantly tired so my eyes always have dark bags and puffiness. I will keep using it to see if it helps with long term exposure to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like about this cream is how it was a light weight lotion with no real smell. I’m not much of a fan of scented products because often their smells are too strong for me and they trigger allergies or they don’t and I just don’t like the smell. Now back to being lightweight, it’s thick enough that it is not runny and can hold it’s shape. However once smoothed out onto your skin it quickly absorbs and doesn’t leave a greasy residue behind like some lotions. This is good as I have both sensitive skin and allergies so I have to be very careful as to what I use around my eyes. Because of the allergies I often rub my eyes, which means rubbing anything on my skin such as makeup and skin care products potentially in my eyes. Of course there is the obvious where it can make my eyes burn and water but also when I have allergic reactions to products it can make my eyes itch more and swell up. I had no issues with my sensitive skin or allergies while using this eye cream. Another thing about being lightweight is that I have combo skin and my eyes are near my oily zones so it absorbing rather adding to the oil issue is good.</li>
    <li> been using it for 3 weeks now and not noticed any difference but its easy to apply and very light. will keep on using it but i can&#x27;t see it being any better than my cheaper eye cream</li>
    <li> I was Not given anything free for this review! First, there are no quick fixes for the effects of aging and the environment on our skin but for the money, ease of use, quality product and service, this does a very good job! The air pump design dispenses a perfect amount with each pump. The cream is rich, thick yet absorbs quickly enough to apply makeup within minutes. There is a faint odor that dissipates within minutes as well. Upon the first use I noticed a visible lightening of the skin. The product contains no harsh chemicals and shares the proceeds with women cooperatives in Morocco. I am pleased thus far after a few weeks of use and would recommend to my friends that want a quality product that does a decent job without costing a fortune.</li>
    <li> A nice eye cream, but I am very sensitive to scent and this one has that slightly green &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent.  It seems to have some moisturizing effects, and feels nice, but as I am very sensitive and don&#x27;t like the fragrance wouldn&#x27;t use.  Gave it to my sister who liked it though.  Seems like a good product for the money.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of this eye cream. Feels nice and leaves a nice &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; under the eye.. before makeup application. Not greasy; absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without my eye cream but every once I awhile I like to try different brands. This works good. I migh.t order again for the price. It lasted me a long time. I use everyday day and night and it&#x27;s been three month and I stay have more use in it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
    <li> it doesnt do anything to reduce puffiness., but it does seem to offer refreshing feel</li>
    <li> I do think I have noticed some improvement to dark circles - they aren&#x27;t gone, but believe lighter and I started out using it just on one side so I could see if a difference or not.....and the price was good</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any results, guess I am a lost cause</li>
    <li> not fit me.because I&#x27;M a man? I DIDN&#x27;T SEE ANY PROMOTION OF DARK CYCLE</li>
    <li> Came in quick. Very moisturizing. My eyes are less puffy.</li>
    <li> I did not really notice any difference between this and drugstore brands - it was not as moisturizing as I would&#x27;ve hoped and there doesnt seem to be anythign that counteracts puffiness or lines.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this kind of product long time ago. Now I would like to tray the complet line of creams. Can you give more information to me?&lt;br /&gt;The presentation is also very nice and professional, I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect night time moisturizer for tired eyes. Good on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Nice texture and makes skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, my husband asked me if I had makeup on because I looked brighter!!! This was amazing because I have a 4 month old who never sleeps! I also love that this product is cruelty free!  Thanks Poppy Austin</li>
    <li> I have 4 children and this means I have a lack of sleep on most days. Well this morning was no different. I was kicked and hit from about 2:30 till I got out of bed from my almost 1 year old son. I was offered this Green Tea and Vitamin C Eye Cream from  Poppy Austin  for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, so I ordered of course. Well I needed it this morning so I applied it under both eyes and instantly had a nice warming affect and the smell was very light so I wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed with strong perfumes. Within a few minutes the puffiness went down a little and I started seeing it fade within the first hour. By mid-morning, my eyes looked fantastic! I definitely recommend this Green Tea and Vitamin C Eye Cream from Poppy Austin for anyone who wants to brighten their eyes fast!</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who falls asleep just fine at the beginning of the night but cannot stay asleep for anything. My eyes are so bloodshot and the dark circles look like I have black eyes. My eyes are so puffy that they look sunken in. I have interviews coming up for internships and possibly a new job so I need to look tip top shape. This eye cream from Poppy Austin is great. It is really easy to apply and I can feel a difference right away after applying it. The cooling feeling it has on my under eyes really makes me feel more awake and helps with the burning that I have from not getting enough sleep. I love the pump, it gives just enough of the moisturizer for both eyes and not too much. I have been using this product for a few days and I am seeing some results in the puffiness and the black circles, I am sure it will take more than a few weeks to start seeing dramatic results, but I am happy with what it happening so far. I was asked to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this eye cream long enough to form an honest opinion on results. As for consistancy and wearability I do love this. It is very moisturizing and feels great on the skin. Am anxious to try other moisturizers from this company</li>
    <li> not very impressed at all, have not seen any any any any improvement in my skin and I have been working in the skin care field for years and no a good product when I see one. I believe this is not one do not waste your time or money</li>
    <li> Love this under eye cream! Doesn&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles but does help with dark circles. Keeps under eyes moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful product. It really agrees with my very sensitive eyes. I highly recommend giving it a try. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, especially the De-Puffing part.</li>
    <li> Adore this cream. I have used it for my eyes and now for my entire face. Just a little dab works for my face. It feels so good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Feels nice, but no visible difference after a month of use.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a new &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in my skincare regimen. (Works very well with the clay mask Poppy Austin sells - I do that once a week.) Definitely seeing positive results. Highly recomended</li>
    <li> Works!  The only product I&#x27;ve had good results with on my dark circles.  Makes skin feel soft and hydrated without making it oily.</li>
    <li> not a big eye cream but i started using some of the products this company makes, and loved it. i gave this eye cream a shot and its really nice.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, helps, and feels good when you put it on.  Skip that expensive department store junk.  This does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. It seems to keep the appearance of wrinkles under my eyes from looking harsh. It seems to soften the look so it is not so noticeable. I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive products, and this seems to work just as well, is cheaper, and you get a lot more in the container.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive eyes!! And this product does not make me break out at all! It is a miracle. I seriously break out in hives, red skin, puffiness when I use just about every eye cream out there. No matter what it says (i.e. for sensitive eyes, all natural, organic, etc), it always makes me break out. I&#x27;m talking about Simple brand, Burts Bees, Garnier, Neutrogena, Oil of Olay, you name it...they all would start the vicious cycle after one application. Well, this stuff is gentle and so smooth and easy to apply. I love it. Have been using it for 1 month, daily, and no breakouts. Just moisturized eyes.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, freckles and dark circles. I have been using the cream at night for a couple weeks and notice the dark circles are getting lighter! Yay! I&#x27;m so excited to find a natural product that does what it&#x27;s suppose to do! Now I&#x27;m going to order some Poppy Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> Eh, if you like old lady smell. That really didn&#x27;t sit well with me, the smell was not what I was expecting, I thought the green tea in this would stand out a little more.  However, it does work well for dark circles, so no complaints there. The cream itself is thicker than most, but it does blend into your skin nicely, it feels as if it is sitting on your skin for a moment, but it ends up absorbing into it, and feeling very soft on the skin. After a couple weeks, my under eye circles have clearly gotten lighter, they have not gone away totally though. Sample received for review.</li>
    <li> I am being asked to write a review but I can&#x27;t honestly give one since I am seeing zero results, but wanted to give it some time to see if it will eventually work so I am giving this a 3 until I know more, I&#x27;m not sure how this has 5 stars but I&#x27;m still holding out hope that it will work</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this product.  I had read the reviews and the reviews of many other products before deciding to place my order. I can honestly say, I love it!! Nice pump, a small amount comes out so you don&#x27;t feel like you are being wasteful. Within 48 hours I noticed a difference.. The dark circles are no longer the focal point of my eye. Skin is tighter, but yet moisturized. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This might be a 5 if my under eye circles would improve more.....perhaps they will improve a bit in time.  The product has a lovely feel and absorbs into the skin very well!  I would certainly buy it again and would recommend it.  Service is excellent!</li>
    <li> Still using it after 2 weeks, seeing if I like it or not.  I still am not sure.  The container is not as large as they say???  Don&#x27;t know if it is the BEST, but it&#x27;s ok so far.  Maybe after I use it for a few weeks I&#x27;ll see improvement in puffiness and dark circles.  I hope so.</li>
    <li> This eye cream has been specifically formulated to target dark, puffy bags around the eyes, so when I had the opportunity to try this cream, I was excited, since I do have puffy dark circles under my eyes...I really like this cream, I can see that my under eye area looks so much better, but I actually use this cream all over my face. When I read in description that it can be used on entire face I gave it a try and I love it! &amp;#34;Not only is it the fastest working and most targeted eye cream for dark circles, eye wrinkles and puffiness, it is also an extremely effective anti-aging treatment for your entire face.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light on my skin and it moisturises and it absorbs super quick at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;A gentle infusion of naturally derived ingredients including organic Aloe, organic Jojoba Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Rosehip Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Tamanu Oil. Plus Poppy Austin strongly opposes all forms of animal testing. This product is naturally free from silicones, parabens, additives, fillers and alcohol.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvements of my dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have been using a week and can see improvement already.  A few dots and the puffiness disappears from under my eyes ( an allergy and sinus issue for me).  I really like this product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not even close to doing what is advertised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as directed for over 2 weeks and have seen no results at all !!! Very dissatisfied a waste of money</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream makes my eyes feel. It does not leave them feeling dry or super greasy like other creams I have tried before. Because of my allergies there was puffiness around my eyes and the dark circles were more noticeable and after using Poppy Austin eye cream they are not as noticeable any more.</li>
    <li> very disappointed in this eye cream.  I purchased it because I have dark circles, starting to get wrinkles and dryness.  I couldn&#x27;t even really put on concealer because in the inner corner it was just to dry.  After reading the reviews I thought for sure at least this would allow my makeup to go on smoother.  NO, it did not.  I do not notice any difference in my fine line/wrinkles.  The dark circles are still there but usually eye creams cannot fix that anyways.  When I put on my makeup it still gets that same look where the powder set in the dryness.  Even after about 20 minutes my delicate under eye area feels kind of tight, not moisturized at all.  Apparently this works for some but not me.  would not recommend this or buy it again and if I had the time to go to the post office I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> I always wake up lying on my left side, the result of which is a puffy baggy eye. Two weeks of twice daily use has minimized this annoying effect. I&#x27;m quite happy with this cream &amp; the ethos of the company.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream. I alternate between this and an eye serum and i have zero dark circles or puffiness. Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the cream and it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems but I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or baggy skin under my eyes. My only problem is darkness under my eyes and this didn&#x27;t help. I still use it to hopefully hold off wrinkles as long as possible. I do wish it wasn&#x27;t a pump. The first few times I dispensed way too much - which felt like a waste. I also think it will probably leave product in there I can&#x27;t get to.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I can&#x27;t live without this! Although it&#x27;s technically an eye cream I also use it as a night time moisturizer &amp; it works wonderfully. My skin is clearer and softer as a result (I have acne prone skin) As for the dark circles, they haven&#x27;t completely disappeared, but they have lightened up a bit though I do still have to put on undereye concealer.Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> *I received the following product for free in exchange for my unbiased review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all seem to have the same concerns when it comes to appearance and our skin concerns. At least, for me, the one thing about my skin that always concerns me or makes me feel less attractive are those nasty looking, puffy dark circles that are always forming under my eyes. Yes, I know I am mainly to blame since I do tend to not get enough sleep but I at least want to try to do something that will help benefit my skin. This is where Poppy Austin comes into the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different eye creams and eye gels but, as any beauty or skincare enthusiast will say, you can never have too many. I like to switch it up between products and Poppy Austin was the perfect brand for me to add to my collection. What I love about this eye bright cream is that it has a fantastic texture and consistency. While some moisturizers and creams can feel very heavy and feel like they are just sitting on the surface of the skin, Poppy Austin&#x27;s eye cream has a lighter but more dense feel to it, meaning that they pack so many good ingredients into one cream that your skin will be rejoicing after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream actually absorbs rather rapidly into the skin and once it is absorbed, you cannot feel any oily residues that leave behind that less than desirable shine. I love that this eye cream does contain green tea which has always done wonders for my skin. I typically use products that contain green tea in them to help combat my acne so I was eager to see how green tea could help with my dark circles and puffiness. One thing is for sure, it definitely helped get rid of my  puffy bags making the underneath of my eyes looking more firm and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy Austin uses natural and organic ingredients to make this wonderful formula. I have searched through the ingredients list and have not found a single paraben listed which is AMAZING! I am trying my best to stay away from any products that have parabens as they have been linked to some very serious health issues in high concentrations. I use this eye cream in the morning before I get ready for work and at night after I have washed my face. It is perfect for the mornings as you can flawlessly apply makeup over it without your skin feeling like it is being weighed down by so many products.ich is AMAZING!

    <li> This is the worst eye cream I have ever used!  I see absolutely no results of any kind since I have been using this stuff!!  It merely sits on the top of my skin; it isn&#x27;t absorbed in whatsover!!  For me, it is absolutely worthless!!</li>
    <li> Not enough moisture.After 3 minutes skin dry.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is GREAT! I&#x27;m pretty picky about my eye creams but this one is excellent. I received it for review purposes and have been using it about three weeks now. It has a light scent and makes my eyes feel really refreshed in the morning. It really really helps my dark circles and undereye bags. I&#x27;d definitely repurchase this eye cream!</li>
    <li> I am constantly looking for a hydrating, absorbent eye cream and this fits the bill.  This is the second Poppy Austin product ( Rose Water) that I have purchased and am very pleased with her products.</li>
    <li> At 59 years young, Poppy Austin has become my new go-to beauty basic!!!! ---I have purchased ALL of the oils and clay face masks. I use them (the oils and creams) every day --- morning and night. I LOVE these products! Pure, effective and reliable --- good chance, Poppy Austin is quickly becoming my one and only beauty regimen. THANK YOU for staying pure and honest --- please don&#x27;t ever change!  pj</li>
    <li> My wife tried this product for free and this is her opinion. She loves that the product is made of natural ingredients. It is scary not knowing what you are putting on your skin and it will do to it. This product soothed her eyes. She spends a ton of time in the books because she is an accountant. This product soothed her tired eyes. It also put moisture into her skin and made the area around her eyes look better and more alive. The product is easy to use and gives her face much benefit. From the first use, she loves how it feels on her face. It is easy to use and soaks into her skin, giving it the moisture it needs.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the way this product makes my eyes feel.  it goes on smoothly and feels cool.  As far as what it does for dark circles, I am not sure yet since I have not used it long enough yet.  I will continue to use it and hopefully my dark circles will at least fade away.</li>
    <li> Great all over face cream.  I don&#x27;t think the darkness under my eyes has been eliminated but I still continue to buy the cream.  I like the ingredients and it works as a face cream for me.  This is also my go to travel cream.  This creams lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> This is the only green tea product I use and I really like the effect!  I like knowing I&#x27;m using a natural product on my skin.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Received item before expected delivery date. I have only had the&lt;br /&gt;chance to use the product a few times, but I really like it so far. The product&lt;br /&gt;is as described. I love that there is no scent and the product moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;really well and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I love a good eye cream!  Eye Cream is another one of my skincare addictions.  Luckily, I have been able to test out A LOT of really great eye creams and this one that Poppy Austin sent me is one of them!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that it&#x27;s made with all natural and organic ingredients and that it helps reduce puffiness, dark circles and also helps diminish the look of fine lines and wrinkles.  Plus, you can also smooth it over your face, neck and decollete!  What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;I love using this as part of my a.m. skincare routine because the cream is really lightweight so my skin absorbs it really quickly and it helps de-puff my morning eyes and fend off my dark circles and fine lines!  Really great Eye Cream!!</li>
    <li> excellent! I love it :)</li>
    <li> It is a nice eye cream and seems to help smooth wrinkles a bit.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in dark circles yet but mine are minimal.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles and puffy bags. This stuff is great! I began to see results within 3 to 4 days. I&#x27;ve already order another bottle for myself and one for my mother. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this eye cream and I have to say that it is one of the best I own! Considering this is an eye cream, the bottle is pretty large. I am used to seeing small jars labeled 15ml but this one holds twice the product so you can be assured you are getting your money&#x27;s worth. Not only is it the fastest working and most targeted eye cream for dark circles, eye wrinkles and puffiness, it is also an extremely effective anti-aging treatment for your entire face. This cream is a woman&#x27;s best friend because it creates a firming and tightening motion that helps to smooth crow&#x27;s feet, fine lines and wrinkles and all while being super gentle on your face. This cream essentially makes you  appear more youthful. This eye cream is made of all natural ingredients including organic Aloe, organic Jojoba Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Rosehip Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Tamanu Oil. I absolutely love that it is not tested on animals and is naturally free from silicones, parabens, additives, fillers and alcohol. It is suitable for all skin types and won&#x27;t dry out your face. It has a creamy thick texture that absorbed right into my skin and immediately after I applied it I felt a cooling sensation that let me know it was working! It has a nice light smell to it that isn&#x27;t offensive at all. Within minutes I saw a dramatic change in the appearance of my eyes! My eyes seemed a bit brighter and alert and my eyes were noticeably less puffy! This was one of the main reasons I wanted to try this eye cream. I suffer from bags under my eyes. My dark circles literally resemble a racoon&#x27;s. It does not matter how much sleep I get because the outcome will be the same! I think mine are just genetic but with this cream they are getting noticeably lighter! I highly recommend this product because it is working for me!</li>
    <li> Gentle enough for my very sensitive skin. I have eczema and many moisturizers end up hurting and burning, but this one was only refreshing. I&#x27;m not sure of what the long term effects of using this will be, but the relief from the dryness alone is so wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great product! Cheap, good ingredients that are known to help, and visible effects. I have had bad dark circles from a combination of lack of sleep and smoking for about 6 years now. Various lotions have definitely worked in the past, but they seem to plateau at a certain point. Like a few of the creams I&#x27;ve tried (much more expensive though), after about 20 minutes the dark circles were reduced somewhat, but I noticed with this cream that it keeps working throughout the day. I also wake up with better looking eyes, even without applying it again at night, or even washing my face. It has continued to improve my circles for the last month, and they are almost gone now. The amount in the bottle is more than ample, only half a pump is needed split between both eyes. Ive noticed that the cream is significantly more effective if a very small amount of vitamen E oil is placed on finger tips before putting the cream on them. Only a light sheen, but vitamin E and vitamin C are known to be significantly more effective when used together. It does leave more of a sheen under they eye though, so give it more time to fully absorb.</li>
    <li> Poppy Austin Eye Cream is god in a bottle thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself and your skin a favor..&lt;br /&gt;STOCK UP ON THIS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;and you better do so before I buy them all!!!&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty This eye cream works and it works every time.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after using it just a few times. I can get really close to my eyes with this product without it making my eyes start to burn or water.</li>
    <li> It works exactly as advertised. It moisturizes, isn&#x27;t sticky, and improves the appearance of under-eye dark circles.</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;My eye bags are almost gone!</li>
    <li> When I first saw the bottle, I admit I was a little skeptical. I was like, &amp;#34;How in the WORLD can this little bottle enhance my face?&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t be fooled though. This little bottle packs a powerful punch! I was really impressed. Just after fifteen minutes of my first use, I noticed my eyes were less puffy and indeed brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, by no means am I saying its a miracle cream but indeed most of the claims of this cream is indeed dead on. I have yet to see if it will get rid of my wrinkles completely, but so far have noticed a huge improvement - and for the price it&#x27;s a great deal. My eyes and skin is brighter and tighter. I have only used it on my eyes, but am told you can use it on your whole face as well. I think that is pretty awesome, and will be next on my list of things to try. However, I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are my before and after pictures after just ONE use....</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any results, in actuality, my dark circles were more noticeable. I still use it in hopes that I will see results, but after all this time I&#x27;m convinced it won&#x27;t happen. I just hate to waste money on a product that doesn&#x27;t show any results.</li>
    <li> Although only using this product for a short time, I am very happy with the results.  I already have notice a reduction of darkness under my eyes, as well as a firmer, cleaner skin.  Also, a small amount goes along way, as well as I do not experience any skin or eye irritation.  Very fine product as a very good cost.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this eye cream to review. Poppy Austin Bright Eye Cream with Green Tea and Vitamin C contains naturally derived and organic ingredients intended to moisturize the skin around the eyes and reduce puffiness. I must admit, I rarely notice a difference when using an eye cream, yet I keep trying them. Will this cream be different? I have used it for a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first apply Poppy Austin Eye Cream I feel a lightly cooling sensation that feels invigorating. Then it feels like the skin around my eyes is “tightening up”. I applied to my under eye area on one side as a test, when I look in the mirror the side with the cream looks a little smoother and less puffy. The difference is subtle, I am not sure whether it is even strong enough to show clearly in a photograph. But I felt that I could see a difference. That is a little more than I can say for most of the other eye creams I have tried (though most I have tried do moisturize the delicate skin around my eyes). I suspect the subtle smoothing and de-puffing might be due to the caffeine and moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is lightly moisturizing, absorbs quickly and doesn’t irritate the skin around my eye. I felt I needed a little more moisture so I also applied a hyaluronic acid serum and that worked nicely. The eye cream wears well under my tinted sunscreen and eye makeup. But if you are like me, you might want a little extra moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I find my skin responds well to vitamin C over time, but I have been using vitamin C product for a while so didn’t notice anything new to attribute to the vitamin C in this eye cream (other than it didn’t irritate my skin as sometimes vitamin C can do). Green Tea contains caffeine which is popular in eye creams (and cellulite creams) because it can temporarily smooth the appearance of skin. Green Tea, along with vitamin C and several other ingredients in this eye cream are also anti-oxidants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes in a pump bottle. With skin care products, functional packaging can sometimes make a difference. I need just one pump for the skin around both eyes, 2 pumps for my entire face. A little goes a long ways.hat it comes in a pump bottle. With skin care products, functional packaging can sometimes make a difference. I need just one pump for the skin around both eyes, 2 pumps for my entire face. A little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with it. I have one year old twins and miss out on a lot of sleep. This has really helped with my circles. I don&#x27;t look quite so rough after being up half the night, lol. The cream goes on smoothly and soaks in quickly. It took me about a week to see a difference, but my eyes did look better. I never have time to put on foundation, so it is nice to have my eyes looking better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the eye cream.  The only draw back is the packaging, the print on the bottle has started smearing off and getting all over my hands when I touch it.  Would purchase it again if it had another bottle or different ink for the packaging</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks now and can already see lot of difference in the skin around my eyes. I had dark circles which will just change the shade of darkness but will stay there. The Skin above my eyelids is still not clear but the area between the eye lids and eyebrow is bright and there is noticeable difference in skin color. Other than that this cream does not irritate my eyes which is a plus :)</li>
    <li> Washing with Noxema and using this cream twice a day for the past week has lessened the puffiness under my eyes. Can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like in another week!</li>
    <li> One of the best eye creams I have ever used. I&#x27;m on my third bottle. I will definitely continue to purchase this high quality product.</li>
    <li> I only used it for few weeks and don&#x27;t see a lot of diference yet...but I love how gentle is on my face!  Not irritations!</li>
    <li> Dark circles, puffy and wrinkles around the eyes makes ones face look older and tired. That is how i looked. Tired all different types of products and this came around so i got it to give it a shot. Why not? It has organic ingredients. Tired it and loved it. IT doesn&#x27;t burn around the eyes especially it is the most sensitive area around the face. I dab the product around my eyes and whatever is left over i put it around my mouth area. It helps. Now my skin is starting to look lifted, lighter circles and puffiness has gone down. Great product.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend of mine to try and this is her review -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good amount of eye cream for the price - that is a fact - the bottle is large compared to all the other eye cream I have tried.  I like the scent - almost not there light and clean.  The cream is soft and silky to the touch and it absorbs fast and without residue on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes look less dark and dry- they are not puffy like they should be with the lack of sleep the holiday seasons brings along with it.  My eyes look fresher and more alive then before - I am not using a concealer under my eyes to cover the dark puffy moons that seem to reside there lately - maybe this cream has evicted them for good - I can always hope and keep using this eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone and especially those on a budget - it is a good price for the amount and the texture of the cream is wonderful -</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 month now. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in dark circles bags, but I do very much like how hydrated it makes my skin feel. I&#x27;ve used it under my eyes as well as on the rest of my face and have been very happy with my results.</li>
    <li> I usually use heavy eye creams, balm like but I am pleasantly surprised with this lighter eye cream. It&#x27;s creamy without being heavy and it hydrates just as good as my heavier creams. I put it on my lids and under my eye. It absorbs quickly but leaves my skin dewy. I have been very happy with all my Poppy Austin purchases.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a month now.  It applies very nicely and has a nice texture.  I have seen an improvement around my eyes.  It is a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> This is the second product I have ordered from Poppy Austin. This eye cream is FABULOUS!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for all you do!</li>
    <li> This silky, smooth eye cream is a treat to the eyes.  It goes on smooth and makes the eye area really hydrated. The ingredients in this eye cream are amazing. I really love this eye cream.</li>
    <li> Its an excellent product to minimize puffiness helps with wrinkles and getting rid of those dark circles. I have always had dark circles and i&#x27;m amazed of how youthful you can look by using a product to help with the eye area. Its not greasy at all. Thanks for all your help.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it this product it works well she is happy that a good think lol i will order some more thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product. As a Florida resident fighting the damaging effects of the sun is ongoing, and this is now a permanent part of my skincare regimen to maintain healthy and younger looking delicate eye skin.</li>
    <li> I do like this product,  I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, so I am to see results. It feels real soft and smooth on my skin. Thanks</li>
    <li> LOVE! LOVE! THIS EYE CREAM!!</li>
    <li> Nice light weight eye cream, that can actually be used all over the face. I use it in combination with the Poppy Austin Argan oil and it keeps my skin beautifully hydrated.</li>
    <li> A very lightweight eye cream! Easy to apply on with the one press pump out bottle.</li>
    <li> Amazing eye cream does exactly what is says</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Great item</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t see any difference but I normally don&#x27;t see with any eyes cream</li>
    <li> I really like this!  It goes on smoothly, is moisturizing, and feels very nice!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful eye cream.  It goes on very smoothly and you only use a littlest a time, so it lasts a long time.  I like that it supports Moroccan women.</li>
    <li> Have only used a week can&#x27;t tell yet</li>
    <li> This left my skin feeling a little tight and tingly, not quite as moisturized and soft as I thought it would. That tightening feeling is probably what makes my eyes appear less puffy but it is not a sensation I enjoy. The scent of the product is very light but almost medicinal.&lt;br /&gt;I love the container this is packaged in. The pump is very easy to use and easily gives you just the amount of cream desired. This product does help to reduce dark circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;As a review blogger I receive product samples at no cost or at a deeply discounted rate. Whether I pay for a product or receive a sample for review purposes my reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but I can say that it is not near moisturizing enough.  My skin is left feeling dry, unlike a very natural vitamin c cream I also purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. Best I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I have pretty dark circles no matter how much sleep I get and so I really wanted to do something about it so decided to buy this based on the reviews. I used this consistently for a bit but I didn&#x27;t really see that much of a difference (once a day at night before bed). I think I&#x27;ll try twice a day since that seemed to work for some people though. After putting it on it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or anything at all, almost as if I didn&#x27;t put it on at all. It has a weird smell to it though but that can be overlooked. I like that I only need a small amount which makes this product last longer. The thing I don&#x27;t like is that if I don&#x27;t use it for a few days, it&#x27;ll clump up so I have to pump it a bit so some of the cream will come out. It&#x27;ll come out in a larger amount than I need so I never really know what to do with the extra after I&#x27;ve already put it on under my eyes. I&#x27;m hoping it will work and I&#x27;ll see a difference if I try using it twice a day instead though.</li>
    <li> So far, I am very happy with this product.  I do think it&#x27;s help reduce the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks now, but I can see I real difference of improvement all around my eyes.  It actually works well on all fine lines, because I have been using it on the fine lines around my lips, and they have also diminished. YAY!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for almast a month.  I haven&#x27;t ever found anything to get RID of my dark circles, but this has done more than any other cream I have tried.  My daughter said she definately notices how much less puffy my eyes are.  (Did&#x27;nt even notice I had that problem.  HAHA!)  Guess I&#x27;ve been so focused on my dark circles.  That&#x27;s a plus.  Recieved the product quickly and a very nice e-mail from the company.  Will be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> Have just started using it but it feels good with no added artificial fragrances and it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Hello...........glad to share my experience while using Poppy Austin - Best eye cream since received....a week ago, moreless !!!!!!!!!! You can be sure that will go on abying the next very soon....and so on !!!!! Congrats for your job. Best regards for all of you. Pauline</li>
    <li> When I was younger, I never thought of using eye cream. Now that I am, well..older; I try to make sure I apply an eye cream at least once a day, hoping to hold off the wrinkles as long as possible and to make the ones I have less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received a new eye cream to try from Poppy Austin. It’s been a couple of weeks and I do like the way it applies easily, doesn’t have a strong scent and isn’t “heavy” on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is thicker than a normal lotion or moisturizer as it is made specifically for the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the best ever! I am a 63 yr. old woman &amp; this has helped with the puffiness, etc.  This product rocks!!  I am hooked &amp; will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream.  It goes on smoothly and does not sting or burn my eyes. It has reduced my wrinkles and dark circles!</li>
    <li> Light and has a light natural fragrance. Noticed the product worked its magic within the first couple of days; the green tea really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenser gives optimal control over quantity dispensed; I have found that past eye cream pumps dispense way too much cream by default and there&#x27;s no way to limit amount pumped out. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Product is moisturizing without being irritating to my eyes. I would recommend this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a dramatic change in my eyes but it feels great.  It&#x27;s light and tingly and dries very quickly.  My dark circles do seem a bit lighter, hopefully soon they&#x27;ll be gone!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 weeks and I am not impressed. I really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> It is a creamy lotion that dispenses easily and absorbs quickly. It contains natural and organic ingredients such as Aloe, Lemongrass, Apple and Licorice. It surprisingly has no smell. That was the biggest difference to me in such a varied blend of natural ingredients - to not encounter any aroma of any kind. If you like your beauty fixes fragrance-free, then this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will use this more in the warmer months since it is not as thick as I like my cold weather creams. That is a personal choice. If you have relative calm, &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; skin then this would work year-round.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this eye cream. Goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and it does help with the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This product has not made any difference for me. I have been using for about 6 weeks and see no change at all. I have large bags under my eyes and this product has not helped with that whatsoever. It is a decent moisturizer if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. Pretty disappointed, I saw some good reviews and thought this creme would work well for me. It didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my under eye dark circles but the cream feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> the circles under my eyes do seem to be getting lighter since i have started using this product.  It provides the moisture my under eye area needs as well and lasts all day.  I like it.  I received my order quickly.</li>
    <li> Since becoming a single mom of 3 kids ranging from 4 years to 8 months and working full time, it has started taking a toll on me. You could tell in my face that I was aging quickly. The bags under my eyes were horrendous. Thankfully I cam across the Poppy Austin Best Eye Cream and have been using it religiously. When others around you start noticing a difference you know it&#x27;s working. I love the bottle it comes in and it is easy to dispense. It is very easy to apply. There is no greasy after affect. No nasty scents. Since using the eye cream my dark circles are slowly going away and the bags that were very heavy are now easing up. Such a relief!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few different eye creams over the years, and I have to say that Poppy Austin Eye Cream is my absolute favorite. I have some significant dark circles under my eyes and dry skin on my eyelids and face. Twice a day, I apply just few small pumps of this eye cream to and cover my face and eyes. After applying the eye cream, it feels like skin just received some serious hydration. My skin feels soft and refreshed after every application. Since using this cream my dark circles have lightened up quite a bit. My eye area looks brighter and more youthful, which feels great! The cream itself is very mild smelling and is gentle. I have sensitive combination skin and have not experienced any skin irritation at all. The bottle is bigger than other creams on the market, so you are getting a great value along with a great quality cream. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new, reliable eye cream!</li>
    <li> It did not remove my dark circles under my eyes. Still using it</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife,she likes it. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Have been using it for almost a month and my eyes look exactly the same</li>
    <li> Always looking for that miracle beauty product, this eye cream comes very close. In a week&#x27;s time my puffy under eyes (that are partly a hereditary feature) looked a lot smoother and brighter. The cream is pleasant, fresh and soothes the creases at my eye corners which tend to get irritated and crusty. Amazon had a good price and if it continues to work well I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it works but it&#x27;s soothe and creamy and goes on well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to say at this time. ..only 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;using product. However, the eye cream feels good on the skin and I notice a tighten under my eyes relieving the bags. I&#x27;m a 60 + woman and I would recommend this to my friends. It just feels good. I like.:)</li>
    <li> wonderful eye cream, helps with puffiness around eyes for sure!!!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I really like that the eye cream comes in a little bottle with a pump because I really dislike sticking my finger into containers to get the eye cream out. One thing to note about the pump is that it dispenses way too much eye cream with a single pump. You really don’t need a full pump’s worth of eye cream to spread around your eyes. I would recommend just getting a small pea-sized amount or smaller. Just don’t push the pump all the way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly wanted to try this product to try to get rid of my dark circles, but unfortunately this did not happen. I can’t really blame the Poppy Austin eye cream for this though since nothing really seems to get rid of my dark circles unless it’s make-up. My dark circles are brown circles most likely due to genetics. It is supposedly prevalent among Asians. Considering I have had dark circles pretty much my entire life, I think it is safe to say that my dark circles remain due to genetics and not due to the ineffectiveness of the Poppy Austin eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, I thought it was nice that this eye cream had no strong fragrance. I couldn’t smell anything at all actually.  It applies very smoothly and easily, it is not too thick or thin, and it doesn’t feel sticky. The skin around my eyes feel well hydrated for hours long after I apply this eye cream. I have combination oily acne-prone skin and this eye cream worked fine for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a gentle eye cream that provides a good amount of hydration for your skin and doesn’t have a strong fragrance, then I would recommend that you try the Poppy Austin Bright Eye Moisturizer Revitalizing Eye Cream. If you are trying to get rid of your dark circles and yours are genetic like mine, then this is not the eye cream for you.</li>
    <li> *I received this product in return for an honest review*&lt;br /&gt;  With three kids there are nights when I don&#x27;t get any sleep especially during the plague season (cold/flu) so after sitting up at night with sick children I have bags that I could check for carry-on luggage and dark circles that make me look like an extra from the Walking Dead. And then add the constant battle with fine lines and wrinkles I am constantly looking for new eye creams to try for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;  So needless to say I am super impressed with this eye cream. It is thick and creamy and applies smoothly. While it is a thicker eye cream, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and absorbs quickly. So there is no issue with applying concealer underneath the eye nor does it cause creasing with your eye shadow as well. There is a super faint smell which it is essentially unscented however I made my husband smell it since he is SUPER sensitive to smells and has a super sniffer. He agreed that it was super faint however the closest smell he could associate it to was chai. I however can&#x27;t smell a thing. I apply this twice a day once in the morning when I wake up before applying makeup and in the evening when I go to bed. A little goes a long way, I only use a half a pump and then I gently dab it around my eyes. I have noticed that the skin around my eyes seems tighter and brighter after a couple of days.</li>
    <li> About a month ago, Poppy Austin offered to send me their Eye Cream with green tea &amp; vitamin C to try out. This moisturizer is very non-greasy and absorbed instantly into my skin. It was more light-weight than a lot of moisturizers that I&#x27;ve used in the past, and had a light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a mommy, you probably get 10+ hours of sleep every night just like I do, but this product is fantastic for those &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; nights where you may have not gotten quite enough. It does an excellent job at reducing swelling under the eyes and making those dark circles less noticeable!  I love the fact that even though it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;eye cream&amp;#34;, it can be used on your entire face.  This is actually my current go-to moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye cream.  I have very sensitive skin and I also have Lupus.  I have had a really hard time finding a good eye cream that my eyes could tolerate.  This product is very creamy and is absorbed quickly.  It is not greasy. After only using it a short time I can see an improvement in the wrinkles around my eyes and also the puffiness underneath.  It only takes a tiny amount so it will last a long time.  I love all of the Poppy Austin products I have tried.  When I sent them an email asking a question, I received an answer really, really quick.  Try this eye cream, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the best eye cream.  I definitely have noticed that my dark circles are not as noticeable. I will buy this cream again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of weeks and I really like it. It goes on smoothly and feels rich. I have a one year old that keeps me so busy, but I look less tired and worn out since I&#x27;ve been using Poppy Austin. I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my fine lines though.  I also like that they strive to keep their ingredients as natural as possible. Although the description says it&#x27;s okay for your whole face, I thought it was a little too heavy for anywhere besides the eye area.</li>
    <li> Now, just so you know in order to see the best results with this product you must take care of yourself; adequate rest, good diet and plenty of H2O. I rate this product 5 stars because after using it faithfully for the past week or two I have noticed a significant improvement with my dark circles. My under eyes look very hydrated and smooth. Again, I can&#x27;t stress enough the importance of taking care of yourself. There is no  magic in a bottle, however, good habits goes a long way. I will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Forty something</li>
    <li> This eye cream is so refreshing. I use it first thing when I wake up because it helps my tired eyes feel more awake.waking up early every morning i need something to make me feel refreshed.First thing is to wash your face. Then using only one small pump. put under and around your eyes. I like how smooth this product was. It does help with saggieness LOL. I really like the ingredients as they are all very well known to help with your skin.  I haven&#x27;t been using it very long so to see any results at all is amazing. The eye cream is different from other creams. It&#x27;s a lot thicker and smoother then other creams that I&#x27;ve used. I felt like there was less water as a filler in this brand. It felt similar to a primer on my face and I found that it didn&#x27;t have any negative effect on my makeup once I added it onto of the eye cream.and also it doesnt effect with the sun like make that spot burn ect living in flordia and in direct sun. I like how smooth this product was. It did not have a funny smell and it absorbs nicely into your skin. It does have a cooling effect as well, which I like when using something on my dark circles. I am very very happy with this eye cream and im going to continue to use it. And Hopes that it will continue to show the same effects it is now:) This is an awesome item and would reccomend it to others:)</li>
    <li> I have yet to use this product, but plan on it as I finish my current product that I am now using.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to start using your product and witness it&#x27;s results. I will be sure to leave a feedback comment. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product! It has delivered everything I asked for!</li>
    <li> I definitely looks to me like the puffiness under my eyes is reduced and I like that! Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I really like this item! The area around my eyes is very moisturized and soft since using the eye cream. It&#x27;s especially great under makeup. I will def be reordering.</li>
    <li> A little too soon to rate true results but it&#x27;s a nice non irritant cream</li>
