      <li>This stuff smells good too.</li>
      <li>I have used Clubman&#x27;s stick for a number of years, this aerosol is just as good.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Nice manly smell.  </li>

      <li>It smells great but what you get for your money isn&#x27;t worth the product.  </li>

      <li>Better for Winter than Summer.</li>

      <li>My husband and son love this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Not 100% sure if it&#x27;s this stuff, because I&#x27;m still using an anti-persperant, too.  </li>
      <li>Yes - I was finally able to get my hubby off the aerosols with something that worked for him.</li>
      <li>In the summer I perspire more and use one of the deodorant sticks sold at the grocery store.</li>
      <li>Guys, this stuff really works!!!!</li>
      <li>Great product, great company, affordable to the average person.</li>
      <li>Does a great job in the winter for a me and my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Also the fact that it is non-aerosol makes it easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>; the pump works perfectly to the last drop and the price is right on the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>spray and go for a clean fresh feeling that lasts.  </li>
      <li>Old times barber shop smell like many of the Pinaud products.  </li>
      <li>I used to love Ban Basic, but there does not seem to be a readily available non-aerosol product out there.  </li>
      <li>Clean, fresh, understated, manly, very complementary.</li>
      <li>, with this unique product you get a clean, crisp, masculine scent which even my «cologne-phobic</li>
      <li>This smells nice when first applied, but by no means does it last the whole workday.</li>
      <li>I use other Clubman stuff, so it&#x27;s nice to have something that doesn&#x27;t add to the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get irritation.  </li>
      <li>Good scent, but doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much staying power either.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely good for 24 hour protection with moderate physical exertion, but I wouldn&#x27;t push it much further than that.</li>
      <li>It burns when you first put it on like the old spray cans.</li>
      <li>Classic smell without all the ozone guilt.</li>
      <li>Does the job with decent staying power.  </li>
      <li>Has the same original Clubman scent that I expected and it did an adequate job of keeping my &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; to a minimum.</li>
      <li>It does the job, it will not last all day, but if you carry it with you, you can touch up when needed and always smell fresh.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it on light days and not heavy sweat days but am starting to believe it might work well on those days too.  </li>
      <li>great product, non-aerosol, very little waste</li>
      <li>no messy sticks.</li>
      <li>Classic Pinaud Clubman fragrance that is similar to the after shave.  </li>
      <li>It works and does not leave any goo, powder, or other remnants other than as light smell that reminds you of the old barber shop.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a masculine smell, related to the rest of the Clubman line, but not identical to the aftershave.</li>
      <li>I use it if going out for dinner or some social event, but use another deodorant during my work day.</li>
      <li>Works very well and this little bottle lasts for months.</li>

<li> I even tried the dove brand and the Arm and Hammer and a way to expensive prescription one.</li>
<li> dont use this if you expect to cover up your nasty stench after running ten miles.</li>

    <li> Yes - I was finally able to get my hubby off the aerosols with something that worked for him.</li>
    <li> Classic Pinaud Clubman fragrance that is similar to the after shave.  Does the job with decent staying power.  Pump spray bottle good for conserving the product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> What you don&#x27;t want: typical commercial deodorant sickening musty smells; ALUMINUM salts; aerosol anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, with this unique product you get a clean, crisp, masculine scent which even my «cologne-phobic» partner finds acceptable (he uses it daily).  PLUS, NO aluminum (this uses ZINC, a non-toxic alternative); the pump works perfectly to the last drop and the price is right on the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS for this product which is one of the best kept secrets in men&#x27;s grooming!  PLEASE buy it before the ad-sales beancounters decide its sales volume «doesn&#x27;t justify its spot on the shelf...».  THAT would be tragic, and my partner wld probably start smelling since it&#x27;s the only deodorant he can tolerate!</li>
    <li> dont use this if you expect to cover up your nasty stench after running ten miles. this is a spray for people with comfy jobs. im a preschool teacher, so i am in between. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Very nice smellsclike the talc .cant go wrong old sckool</li>
    <li> Small container.  Nothing special.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the fact it is not made with aluminum Clubman has zinc in the ingredients and is non-aerosol. Smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product, great company, affordable to the average person.</li>
    <li> Nice pump spray non-aerosol. Has the Pinaud odor in as with all the Clubman Pinaud products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to compliment the other Clubman products I use (aftershave, talc powder, and shampoo). I&#x27;ve used it without other Clubman products, and noticed that the scent fades substantially. It&#x27;s definitely a masculine smell, related to the rest of the Clubman line, but not identical to the aftershave. I find it to be average.</li>
    <li> Of course, great scent.  I use other Clubman stuff, so it&#x27;s nice to have something that doesn&#x27;t add to the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get irritation.  Not 100% sure if it&#x27;s this stuff, because I&#x27;m still using an anti-persperant, too.  I want to reduce sweat, not just cover up smell...</li>
    <li> Very good but light.  Old times barber shop smell like many of the Pinaud products.  Better for Winter than Summer.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve had to wait until I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s to discover something that should have been in my personal care kit all my life.  This stuff works.  And I start to break a sweat when the temp gets above 40 F!  Here&#x27;s to many fresh-smelling years ahead!</li>
    <li> My husband and son love this deodorant.  Also the fact that it is non-aerosol makes it easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a pump spray antiperspirant.  I used to love Ban Basic, but there does not seem to be a readily available non-aerosol product out there.  I found Clubman on Amazon and ordered it.  It works and does not leave any goo, powder, or other remnants other than as light smell that reminds you of the old barber shop.  My wife tells me I need to keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job in the winter for a me and my sensitive skin.  In the summer I perspire more and use one of the deodorant sticks sold at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I have used Clubman&#x27;s stick for a number of years, this aerosol is just as good. The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t last longer than 3 hours.</li>
    <li> great product, non-aerosol, very little waste</li>
    <li> I smell like a man, and this stuff is REALLY good at killing bacteria that causes odors. You don&#x27;t need anything else.</li>
    <li> Works very well and this little bottle lasts for months.</li>
    <li> If ya like the Talc, you will like the deodorant. Clean, fresh, understated, manly, very complementary. Not-perfume. For me, its for daily use and would recommend this product for any gentleman / dog. If ya know what I mean?  CJShakeSpeare</li>
    <li> This smells nice when first applied, but by no means does it last the whole workday. I use it if going out for dinner or some social event, but use another deodorant during my work day.</li>
    <li> It does the job, it will not last all day, but if you carry it with you, you can touch up when needed and always smell fresh. Love this product</li>
    <li> Classic smell without all the ozone guilt. Smells great lasts all day! Great working product will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> The best. Change the price by one penny and I&#x27;ll buy it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good scent, but doesn&#x27;t last long.  Wish they made an antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> It smells great but what you get for your money isn&#x27;t worth the product.  It doesn&#x27;t have much staying power either.</li>
    <li> Good but not as aromatic as the powder is. Spray is more compact when packing for trip.or to store at work.</li>
    <li> Very good. Doesn&#x27;t last all day but doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes either. Great fresh musky barbershop smell when applying</li>
    <li> I have been having problems with store bought deodorants with my underarms being irritated and breaking out. I even tried the dove brand and the Arm and Hammer and a way to expensive prescription one. This one does not break me out or irritate. and I have been using it a couple weeks. I gave it 4 stars because i wish it came in a larger bottle. It use to come in a 12 oz aresol can. The same size as their shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Nice manly smell.  I&#x27;ve only used it on light days and not heavy sweat days but am starting to believe it might work well on those days too.  It burns when you first put it on like the old spray cans.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Have used this product for a decade and is the best of the best - it works!   Purchase price, source handling and shipping was excellent as well.</li>
    <li> Guys, this stuff really works!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been want this deodorant for a while now because i use Gel deodarant and got tired of it getting on my shirts when ever i put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as i got this product i showered and sprayed it on my pits. It instantly dried and smelled well. None of it got on my shirt when i put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it doesn&#x27;t help protect as long as Gel deodorant. And i sprayed the recommendation amount(2 sprays). Then instead i started spraying 3 times per pit. But still doesn&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howeve</li>
    <li> no messy sticks. spray and go for a clean fresh feeling that lasts.  A +</li>
    <li> Smells like you just came out of the barber chair.</li>
    <li> I became allergic to the regular store bought stuff.  I&#x27;m not allergic to this.  It isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, but I&#x27;ve found that it works great.  I don&#x27;t need an antiperspirant anymore.  This stuff smells good too.</li>
    <li> Has the same original Clubman scent that I expected and it did an adequate job of keeping my &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; to a minimum. It&#x27;s definitely good for 24 hour protection with moderate physical exertion, but I wouldn&#x27;t push it much further than that.</li>
