    <li> Don&#x27;t  use as the only conditioner.  switch it off/on with other conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before.  It makes my hair feel soft, not heavy.  It has a refreshing minty scent.  I use it twice a week, in between the moisture shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> smells nice.  leaves hair soft. Highly recommend this. Very good product.  A little pricey--there are probably cheaper products that could do that same thing but I don&#x27;t know about them so I use this!</li>
    <li> I ♡ this shampoo!  It smells like a thin mint and works so well.  I normally have a very itchy scalp and was washing my hair ever day when using cheap shampoo.  I now can wait three days bf washing and have no more itchy scalp or dandruff.  It is expensive but I only use about a quarter size or less so it lasts several months.  I will continue to use.  Oh and if you add a little water to your hair after putting g the shampoo in, it will get more sudsy.  Love that it is pure ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner. Love them both. Conditioner made my hair smooth and shiny. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love both the NEUMA Renew Conditioner and Shampoo.  My only complaint is the shampoo does not qualify for Free Super Saving Shipping.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It has some sort of healing quality to it - if your scalp itches and you use this, your scalp won&#x27;t itch anymore.  My stylist uses Neuma after I get my blowout.  It&#x27;s INCREDIBLE!!!</li>
    <li> Very good for course hair as well as it is organic and a very little goes a very long way</li>
    <li> Pricey and does not work well on short fine hair.  Leaves it without any body and rather flat.  Nice smell.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has been a favorite of mine for over a year.  All ingredients are natural, only a small amount is needed and for half the price I paid in a salon, it&#x27;s a must have !</li>
    <li> I like this product because it leaves my hair frizz free, manageable, and helps to retain my color.  You only need to use a small amount to get good results.  Using too much causes my hair to go flat.  I did not give five stars because this particular time the product had a different smell then previous orders.  Not bad just different.</li>
    <li> I love the minty smell of this conditioner and it does a great job leaving my hair soft and manageable. Also the price is much better than in the salons.</li>
    <li> Not totally impressed but I&#x27;m spoiled by the Pureology line. This is a decent alternative if you&#x27;re looking for something cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have alergies to fragrance, but for some reason this product does not give me a rash.  It could be that there are no added ingredients and nothing artificial.  Has kept the red in my hair longer than usual too!</li>
    <li> Not as thick and creamy as the one I bought from the salon. I love the small of it though.</li>
    <li> Received just as expected, at a lot cheaper price than in the salon!.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great cleanser for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. .I use less than a quarter sized amount on my medium-long hair !!&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine colored blond hair.  Great product, Reneu is light weight and takes only a small amount of product.</li>
    <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive because it is my favorite conditioner and I can only afford to buy it once or twice a year.  I only use it a few times a month as a treat for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its performance well justifies its cost. And I can get it for a much lower price than at my haidresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the Amazon seller was great.</li>
    <li> Did nothing special for my hair.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo and conditioner for the first time two days ago and I can already see and feel a difference.

    <li> Works for me.  Sensitive scalp, fine hair.  Seems to stay clean longer.  Don&#x27;t understand how that works.</li>
    <li> this is an outstanding product. I don&#x27;t usually use conditioner because it&#x27;s too heavy. NEUMA is made from natural ingredients that make my hair shiny and light! CAn&#x27;t buy it anywhere near my town so thank you seller for prompt and easy ordering!</li>
