      <li>I keep changing from purse to purse very easy.  </li>

      <li>and this makes it so so easy to do.</li>
      <li>They fit the purpose.  </li>
      <li>This purse organizer is absolutely great,  it has so many useful pockets of all sizes along the sides and an area in the middle for your wallet, ect.  </li>
      <li>I think these things are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>The whole thing just kind of crumples into the bag -- and I have smallish midsize bags.</li>
      <li>The big one is quite good though and quite worth the price</li>
      <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t care for is the way the organizer slides around in my purse sometimes, but it is still better then having everything in my purse sitting unorganized at the bottom of my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I probably have WAY too much stuff in that purse anyway!</li>

      <li>I think if the center compartment had more sections (like a cutlery tray) with less sections around the edge, I&#x27;d feel more organized.  </li>
      <li>There was not enough room to put anything larger than a pen or pencil in most of the pockets.</li>
      <li>Even the elastic pockets are too tight to hold more than a lipstick; no compacts or notepads.  </li>
      <li>But if you are looking for anything that can carry more stuff, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
      <li>I have this huge expensive leather handbag that I really love.</li>
      <li>I like to change purses frequently</li>
      <li>The downside is that the compartments are all around the outer edge with one large compartment in the center.  </li>

    <li> Somewhat comparable to other items in it&#x27;s category.  Liked the fact that it came with 2 bags for your larger and smaller handbags.</li>
    <li> Not quite the size I expected and the pockets inside are really small.  And it shifts inside the purse turning over.  Just not quite what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> OK, just didn&#x27;t work well in my purses. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> lots of pockets but its black u cant see them in the bottom of a purse. black no good for me</li>
    <li> Its one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought!  I can change purses in one move!  And I can find everything at a glance.  All it needs is a light!</li>
    <li> One of the best things I have ever gotten.  I like to change purses frequently and this makes it so so easy to do.</li>
    <li> These organizers are just nylon bags so the sides collapse when you try to actually put anything inside, especially the pockets.  The sewn pockets are way too tight to hold anything except a credit card.  Even the elastic pockets are too tight to hold more than a lipstick; no compacts or notepads.  The whole thing just kind of crumples into the bag -- and I have smallish midsize bags.</li>
    <li> This purse organizer is absolutely great,  it has so many useful pockets of all sizes along the sides and an area in the middle for your wallet, ect.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This helps me out a lot ! but dont use this on a deep bag ,such as a tote it ends up being too deep in and eliminates it&#x27;s purpose .</li>
    <li> The bags (even the bigger sized one) are too small for anything.  Maybe cell phone?  But if you are looking for anything that can carry more stuff, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  Look at the picture carefully and see what the bags are holding before you decide to buy.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> If u are buy I g this, settle for just getting the big one as the smaller version barely holds anything, the pockets are so small. The big one is quite good though and quite worth the price</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again.  Needs to be heavy to hold its shape.  This is extremely hard to see in the picture that is shown.</li>
    <li> these are useful items for my new &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34; style purse but I probably have WAY too much stuff in that purse anyway!</li>
    <li> I ordered this organizer after seeing a coworker with one. It was the best decision for me since I change purses every day.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on my experience with a different syle purse organizer.  Although the product is as described it is not quite what I was hoping for but I&#x27;ll manage.  I like that there are two sizes and that I can now organize all of my purses.  The quality of the product is also very good.  The downside is that the compartments are all around the outer edge with one large compartment in the center.  I think if the center compartment had more sections (like a cutlery tray) with less sections around the edge, I&#x27;d feel more organized.  I&#x27;m considering another style of organizer from the same company which I think is very good.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed.  The pockets were very small.  There was not enough room to put anything larger than a pen or pencil in most of the pockets.</li>
    <li> They fit the purpose.  I keep changing from purse to purse very easy.  I use the small one in my purse and the medium one in my diaper bag.</li>
    <li> I have this huge expensive leather handbag that I really love. The problem is that it is so big my items  just sink to the bottom, and it takes me forever to find what I need. This Organizer has helped with the issue mentioned above. I flip open the purse, and there are small to large pockets for everything, from my small come, to larger pockets for my bigger items such as a wallet. It works reat for me. The only thing that I don&#x27;t care for is the way the organizer slides around in my purse sometimes, but it is still better then having everything in my purse sitting unorganized at the bottom of my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helpped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K.D.&lt;br /&gt;Wisconsin</li>
    <li> Helps so much in organizing your purse.</li>
    <li> It was very flimsy.It is very compact and does not have a lot of firm structure. It would also be hard to use in a small purse.</li>
    <li> I think these things are fantastic.  I had one and bought these for my daughter in law for Christmas.  (just a sm. side gift)  She likes them too.  Mine is actually beige and I plan to buy these for myself in black.</li>
