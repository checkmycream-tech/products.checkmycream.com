      <li>Very nice size for travel.</li>
      <li>This is a good price for the one you could find in brookstone&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>It is the perfect size, perfect magnification and the surround LED light is very helpful.  </li>
      <li>Works well and nicely compact.</li>
      <li>The suction cups seem to be very secure as well.</li>
      <li>perfect for travel and for my second bathrooms...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more in case</li>
      <li>Should have read the product specs more closely</li>
      <li>I love this mirror.  </li>

      <li>This is a great mirror but was too strong, even for my old eyes.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>Within a week of receiving, the light stopped working.  </li>
      <li>returned it and a replacement and the light did not turn on.  </li>
      <li>this has cheap material, but the important thing is the mirror</li>
      <li>Well lets say my mom got a free mirror.</li>
      <li>Well I was excited about getting this one, but when it arrived and I wanted to put eye make up on</li>
      <li>With a high power like 15x, you should expect to be limited to use at 3-6\\&quot; from your target for best results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a full size counter one for my master baths.</li>
      <li>This is a great mirror for applying make-up and finding all the black dots of mascara that manage to find their way on my eyelids.  </li>
      <li>My mom has cataracts and can&#x27;t see worth squat.  </li>
      <li>I was a little worried about the magnification after reading some of the reviews, but it seems to be exactly what I need at a great price.</li>

      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid much more for a brass mirror with the same magnification but wanted a backup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the size of the mirror in general, the center area of optimal magnification and the overall strength.</li>
      <li>Now she&#x27;s much happier.</li>
      <li>I needed something mainly for applying mascara, tweezing my eyebrows, etc.</li>
      <li>This one is very DIM</li>
      <li>The light flickered on and off a few times and would never turn on again.  </li>
      <li>My old mirror only had 2 suction cups and was heavier, would come unstuck and fall and crack.  </li>
      <li>Only clear &amp; sharp at certain length.</li>
      <li>The light is not bright and the mirror is distorted.</li>
      <li>I wear reading glasses primarily for small details and extreme close-up work.</li>
      <li>For most people this would be too much magnification unless your vision is really bad.</li>

    <li> Awful - about the size of a quarter!  Just kidding but I was disappointed.  Should have read the product specs more closely</li>
    <li> The manufacturer has changed the quality of the product making it of a cheaper plastic material.  The on an off switch was changed to the plastic fragile material that is hard to turn on and off.</li>
    <li> Very nice size for travel.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about the magnification after reading some of the reviews, but it seems to be exactly what I need at a great price. I wear reading glasses primarily for small details and extreme close-up work. I needed something mainly for applying mascara, tweezing my eyebrows, etc. With a high power like 15x, you should expect to be limited to use at 3-6\\&quot; from your target for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid much more for a brass mirror with the same magnification but wanted a backup. My other mirror only has about a 1 1/2\\&quot; insert with the 15x magnification. I&#x27;m very happy with the size of the mirror in general, the center area of optimal magnification and the overall strength. The suction cups seem to be very secure as well. I have no complaints and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The light is not bright and the mirror is distorted. The only way to focus is to move in very slowly until something (anything) becomes clear.&lt;br /&gt;It fell off the mirror I attached the suction cups to and the mirror broke.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It is the perfect size, perfect magnification and the surround LED light is very helpful.  My old mirror only had 2 suction cups and was heavier, would come unstuck and fall and crack.  This one is lightweight, has 3 suction cups and sticks quite well; I have to pry it off.  I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more in case they ever stop making this one.</li>
    <li> Works well and nicely compact.</li>
    <li> Within a week of receiving, the light stopped working.  It is still functional as a mirror, however I had specifically wanted the additional illumination.</li>
    <li> Well I was excited about getting this one, but when it arrived and I wanted to put eye make up on I had to be so close to it to be able to see anything that it was impossible to put mascara on. I guess my vision is not yet that bad :-) to use it. Well lets say my mom got a free mirror.</li>
    <li> My mom has cataracts and can&#x27;t see worth squat.  I&#x27;m talking almost blind and really need surgery. She couldn&#x27;t put on makeup before I got her this.  Now she&#x27;s much happier. For most people this would be too much magnification unless your vision is really bad.</li>
    <li> Mirror quality not great as the light is almost non existent.</li>
    <li> The light flickered on and off a few times and would never turn on again.  A complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and a replacement and the light did not turn on.  I am returning again for a refund this time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace one (another brand) I have that I cracked the mirror on..... This one is very DIM and I would not consider it &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; at all. I am returning it for a refund.</li>
    <li> viewing area too small and is difficult to focus. had to return it.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for applying make-up and finding all the black dots of mascara that manage to find their way on my eyelids.  It&#x27;s the only mirror I use.  I keep one at work, in my overnight bag and the car.</li>
    <li> this product does not stick to a glass/mirror and light bottom has a poor quality and it doesn&#x27;t work at all….</li>
    <li> Great little mirror! perfect for travel and for my second bathrooms...many of my guests need magnification for contacts, etc. I have a full size counter one for my master baths.</li>
    <li> Purchased for vehicle glove compartment. Works fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror but was too strong, even for my old eyes. I was very disappointed because the quality is there, I just couldn&#x27;t focus on my chin where all the action tends to be.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;1. The suction cups broke after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;2. The light is not bright due to poor circuit connection.&lt;br /&gt;3. Focusing is poor.  Only clear &amp; sharp at certain length.</li>
    <li> This is a good price for the one you could find in brookstone&lt;br /&gt;But this has cheap material, but the important thing is the mirror and it&#x27;s the same as the one in brokstone</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fulfill my expectations. Waste of money.</li>
