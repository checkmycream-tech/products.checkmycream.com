    <li> Great lotion. Big bottle for the price. I think it works great. I would buy it again. No orange colored skin or hands. Or fading on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it hydrates really well. As for making me darker, I was very disappointed! It didn&#x27;t do as well as the Australian Gold Black that I bought previously.</li>
    <li> I have gotten so dark from using this and I feel my skin tightening a lot.  Great value for the product!</li>
    <li> Great product..smells good also</li>
    <li> Did not seem to enhance tan</li>
    <li> Great way to build a base tan for a fair skin person.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical after reading other reviews, but decided to go for it. I&#x27;m glad I did because it worked great for me and my daughter. The bronzer is natural looking and not orange at all. It wasn&#x27;t streaky and the scent wasn&#x27;t too heavy. Strong scents give me a killer headache and fortunately that was not the case here. At one point I thought maybe I was at a plateau with my color, but again...fortunately was not the case. A friend actually requested that we order her a bottle too after seeing how quickly we tanned and how natural it looks. I should note that we are both brunette with fair complexions.</li>
    <li> I rotate products every couple months that I use because if using same product to long your body will baseline with it. I was not impressed at all with this one. Took three full time sessions to see anything. I did receive it for under $20 so maybe you get what you pay for is best said.</li>
    <li> Great consistency and natural looking bronzer.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell which a lot of bronzers do.</li>
    <li> Good stuff -- fake n bakes for about 2 weeks before vacay and this got me pretty dark!</li>
    <li> I research everything before I make a purchase to ensure that I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth. This product lives up to the positive reviews. I&#x27;ve never tanned easy and quickly reach a tanning plateau, but this product makes a visible difference after each use.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff, Good Price</li>
    <li> My friend told me that I bought a great product and she had tried quite a few.  I love the smell and I felt smooth after applying.  I haven&#x27;t tanned enough to give more of a review than that.</li>
    <li> Recomiendo 100% al vendedor. El producto me llegó en perfectas condiciones y en el tiempo que lo necesitaba. Realmente era lo que esperaba y mucho mas. Espero seguir comprando a éste proveedor en muchas ocasiones mas</li>
    <li> Works great, does not leave streaks and is not clumpy.</li>
    <li> It took a few visits to the tanning salon to see a difference, but this is a great product.  No streaks, no mess &amp; it has a great scent.  I usually have a problem with burning when I first start out tanning &amp; this has truly eliminated any redness!!!</li>
    <li> Works great....will leave streaks if you don&#x27;t rub in all the way. And wear gloves!!</li>
    <li> I tan indoors.  This product is easy to apply and I havent noticed any streaking or odd discolorations.  I did have a base tan with a different product but I am not clear if that makes a difference.  The odor is not offensive; it does not smell strong at all to me.  I like this product and most likly will purchase again.  The price here is far more reasonable than in the salons.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working great for an indoor tanning bed!  And I would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;And the price was so much better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many different lotions and this one is one of my favorites. I noticed a darker tan after the first use. I like to switch up lotions often because my body seems to get used to one kind. I use this one more often in rotation. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Is very good does not make you sticky and smells really good gets you darker</li>
