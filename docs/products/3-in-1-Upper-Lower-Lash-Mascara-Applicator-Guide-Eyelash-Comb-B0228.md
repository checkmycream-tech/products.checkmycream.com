      <li>only downside is it is a pain to clean</li>
      <li>I use a makeup remover towelette to clean it of excess mascara daily.  </li>
      <li>and I just want something a little more official.</li>
      <li>but i dont think it was 100% ready for use or its just way to big for me..</li>
      <li>I looked this up online to see how to use it, though it&#x27;s not hard to figure out if I had actually tried.</li>
      <li>It seems like such a simple little accessory but will make a HUGE difference in your ability to apply mascara.  </li>

    <li> I love this so much! I don&#x27;t do the business card trick because well, I don&#x27;t have any and I just want something a little more official. This is great! I have to order another one because I&#x27;m pretty sure my friend took this from me after she tried using it. She loved it as well.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Save your money</li>

    <li> Very simple principle. Works really well.</li>

    <li> This works.  It&#x27;s hard with baby boomer eyes to put mascara on without glasses.  And with glasses it&#x27;s a mess.&lt;br /&gt;With a good magnifying mirror,  I can see to get the mascara on and with this, it always goes on clean.  And no mascara clumps on lashes to fix.  If only I&#x27;d had one of these 30 years ago, would have saved a lot of misplaced globs of mascara.</li>
    <li> These are cheap and easily lost. Sadly I paid for them, when I should&#x27;ve just learned how to apply with better techniques.</li>
    <li> A total waste of money...don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for protecting the skin around the eyes from unwanted mascara. And very easy to clean and store.</li>
    <li> it defiantly wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting.. i wanted it to help keep from getting mascara on my eyelid and it only made things that much harder. also it uses more mascara using this, a lot more seems to get onto the comb than my lashes. other people said it worked for them but i feel like theyre using double or maybe more mascara by using this. it was a good idea but i dont think it was 100% ready for use or its just way to big for me..</li>
    <li> Hard plastic.  Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
