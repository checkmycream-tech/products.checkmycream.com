      <li>OK..</li>
      <li>It applies more in chunks</li>
      <li>.. think of applying pumpkin pie to your face but with even more chunks.  </li>
      <li>Also, I love the smell of pumpkin.</li>
      <li>hi there love this pumpkin mask made my face tingle</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>I really love the way it smells</li>
      <li>I purchased the 2 oz size and I was able to get about 10 applications from the jar.</li>
      <li>Incredible price; received super fast!</li>
      <li>It literally smells like pumpkin (maybe because it is :) it tingles and when it comes off, my face felt smooth.</li>
      <li>A good gentle scrub you leave in a while then rinse.  </li>
      <li>you put it on the face and thrn doesnt come off easily.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t find it overly strong.</li>
      <li>but it smells divine and tingles pretty nicely while it is on.</li>
      <li>dont know if i see results but skin is smooth</li>
      <li>imagine you are trying to smooth over your face an already congealed gel or something of that sort.</li>
      <li>Does its job, I liked my old pumpkin face mask better.</li>
      <li>Because this product was so tiny, I probably used it too sparingly to get good results, but I feel like it was just OK anyway.</li>
      <li>Good way to naturally exfoliate your skin.</li>
      <li>sry took so long was great</li>
      <li>This is wonderful, i use a thin layer on my face twice a week and sleep with it on and  in the morning my skin glows love it.</li>
      <li>When I do the entire combination, my skin looks smooth, buffed and bright</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very good as it helps to dissolve the desmosones that bonds the dead cells on the epidermis.</li>
      <li>On the bright side my skin is soft &amp; glowing ;)</li>
      <li>This kind of thing may irritate sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>if only it was not that unbearable to apply it could be a nice part of a maintenance routine for someone who wants a mild, non-irritating but effective product.</li>
      <li>if only it was not that unbearable to apply it could be a nice part of a maintenance routine for someone who wants a mild, non-irritating but effective product.</li>
      <li>It did make my skin more vibrant.</li>
      <li>Just more youthful and vibrant skin.</li>
      <li>It is nice to add into your facial routine because your face feels clean, you&#x27;ll feel pampered and the smell is yummy.</li>
      <li>My skin is not overly dry because I do use a really good acne lotion after I take the mask off.</li>
      <li>and i tried a fan brush first, then a finger, then a spatula - nothing works!</li>
      <li>For this price, I say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Some people may have more sensitive skin than I do, therefore take precautions.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so fresh and glowing after using it.</li>
      <li>every time i tried to spread it out by patting it, it only migrated from one area to another, like some kind of gigantic amoeba colony...  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture though, its more of a clear gel with bits of pumpkin in it.</li>
      <li>Pumpkin is also naturally full of anti oxidants so your skin will be very happy.use</li>
      <li>The one oz jar can sustain three to four weeks, definitely will buy more.</li>
      <li>After that it&#x27;s not uncomfortable for me.</li>
      <li>You can get upward 6+ uses from it, but the consistency is different from the picture, the mask is more brownish and crumbly.</li>
      <li>When it finally came I immediately tried it, I looked better in the morning</li>
      <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t get the big one.</li>
      <li>This is safe enough to apply a couple times a wk but be mindful of sun exposure.</li>
      <li>i once paid $50 for a different possibly better pumpkin enzyme mask.</li>
      <li>I was using it twice a week for the first two weeks</li>
      <li>5% glycolic acid turned out to be not strong enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;However the product smells nice and has a nice texture</li>
      <li>a little bit made my face really smooth like glass love it would order again  </li>
      <li>I had reddish acne scars/splotches after a flare up that lasted about two months, and this mask really evened my skin tone back to its healthy complexion, even after the first use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been so excited about a product... by the way it also makes your skin look so alive.</li>
      <li>My skin looks brighter and softer, I use it weekly, but I leve it more than 10 minutes (because my skin is not sensitive)</li>
      <li>Smells just like pure  pumpkin</li>
      <li>It does leave my skin feeling nice, but there are lots of products the work as well without the mess.</li>
      <li>These masks can be very expensive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you feel burning, monitor the length you keep this product on your face very closely.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Incredible price; received super fast! My skin feels like I just came from the Spa - glowing; moisturized and refreshed. I use this one a week and am feeling very comfortable NOT wearing foundation! Will definitely buy again and again - oh and it smells heavenly and comes off very easily too!</li>
    <li> Worst pumkin mask i have ever used. It remains in clusters qhen you put it on the face and thrn doesnt come off easily.</li>
    <li> Really this is a mask???? Its clompy doesnt look like the picture at all. I have used 3 times and nothing bit a mess. I do at home glycolic acid peels 24 k masks and lactic acid peels. So I have experience with masks and peels. This is terrible. I gave it two stars because of the smell. It smells great. After a bad day I glop it on and just inhale the delicious scent. Thats all this is good for. I really don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what.I read the reviews. This just isnt for me. Will not be buying again. So glad I didn&#x27;t get the big one.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but this mask just softened my skin. I never noticed any tingling and even left it on a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with adult acne my entire life and I&#x27;m soon to be forty-one. I&#x27;ve tried everything from prescriptions to over the counter and infomercial products. I ran across this on YouBeauty by Dr. Oz and Dr. Roizen, the article on acne treatments suggested using a pumpkin mask with glycolic acid on pimples overnight and how it dries them up literally overnight. It took me almost two weeks to get the product, I was having a horrible flare up and I felt miserable. When it finally came I immediately tried it, I looked better in the morning but my skin was such a mess I felt it would take a while to clear up. Well its been exactly two weeks and not only am I almost completely clear but, my dark spots are going away and my skin is poreless. I tell you this stuff is amazing. I do use it every day and the company suggests twice a week, but I&#x27;m extremely oily and I read that oil feeds the acne. I guess that explains my problem. My skin is not overly dry because I do use a really good acne lotion after I take the mask off. Now that I&#x27;m almost clear I&#x27;m going to cut down on the usage and see how it does. I&#x27;ve never been so excited about a product... by the way it also makes your skin look so alive. At this price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask for almost 3 weeks. I use 2-3 times a week for my acne scars and I have a big improvement. I have a lot of acne scars and this has been helping them fade. I leave it on for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I COULD OF BOUGHT THE GLYCOLIC ACID, AND ADDED 1 16 OZ CAN OF PUMPKIN AND MADE THIS IN MY KITCHEN.WHICH EXACTLY WHAT I WILL BE DOING IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, i use a thin layer on my face twice a week and sleep with it on and  in the morning my skin glows love it.</li>
    <li> the smell is delicious and the effect on the skin incredible!!! My skin looks brighter and softer, I use it weekly, but I leve it more than 10 minutes (because my skin is not sensitive)</li>
    <li> This is a small size and a small price for a product that works great. These masks can be very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2 times a week and it really brightens my skin. I see a nice difference. I don&#x27;t find it that strong, I have used much stronger and it was painful So I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I see that some people have allergic reactions. This kind of thing may irritate sensitive skin. I have no problems with it and will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt; Also, I love the smell of pumpkin.</li>
    <li> I had reddish acne scars/splotches after a flare up that lasted about two months, and this mask really evened my skin tone back to its healthy complexion, even after the first use. It was not abrasive, and I can leave it on longer than the directed ten-fifteen minutes without any problems. It smells great, and a little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> I do like this besides the fact that it goes on nothing like they advertize it.. in the picture it looks like any clay mask but when you apply it it goes on wet &amp; chunky. The wetness covers the skin but the actual pumkin just balls &amp; chunks up. On the bright side my skin is soft &amp; glowing ;)</li>
    <li> i once paid $50 for a different possibly better pumpkin enzyme mask. But the price of this one is pretty great. Warning: it does NOT apply like in the picture. It applies more in chunks.. think of applying pumpkin pie to your face but with even more chunks.  That being said, I feel like this does work and while it might be near impossible to actually spread it all over your face, I recommend putting it on problem areas.</li>
    <li> Because of the inconsistent texture, I think it would make a nice base for other masks or scrubs. Does the trick. Very natural.</li>
    <li> It does not go on evenly..I didn&#x27;t really like it...</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a skeptical package; the label on the container was crooked and the seal was open with product dried in the threads. The product was dark like it was spoiling; looked nothing like in the picture. Speaking of which, the picture used on this product is being used by two other pumpkin facial products. Despite all of this I still tried to use it. Applied very thin and did not do anything after I left it on for five minutes. Very dissapointed. It was like someone blended some raw pumpkin and threw it into a cup to ship as is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just ran out of this mask... and I believe that it&#x27;s a good mask. It sort of lightened my acne scars. It did make my skin more vibrant. No burning or peeling. Just more youthful and vibrant skin. I knocked off two star because 1oz is very small and $7+ for 1oz? Meh. Also I knocked off another star because it&#x27;s not a fantastic skin-changing mask. You can get upward 6+ uses from it, but the consistency is different from the picture, the mask is more brownish and crumbly. But I&#x27;d probably re-purchase, probably not. I&#x27;ll try other Glycolic acid masks and come back to this one if I can&#x27;t find exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I use this mask as an exfoliator in the shower about twice a week, I apply it on my face, neck and decollete area, I leave it for about 6 minutes, and I notice my face cleaner afterward, it&#x27;s very good as it helps to dissolve the desmosones that bonds the dead cells on the epidermis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it has helped my skin at all but it smells divine and tingles pretty nicely while it is on. It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture though, its more of a clear gel with bits of pumpkin in it. Goes on nicely with a brush.</li>
    <li> from an aesthetic dermatology nurse perspective: there are two news about this mask - the bad one and the less bad one. i will start with the bad one: the texture of this mask is terrible! actually worse than terrible - it is  nerve wrecking! imagine you are trying to smooth over your face an already congealed gel or something of that sort. no matter what you use - and i tried a fan brush first, then a finger, then a spatula - nothing works! the product goes on in terrible clumps. absolutely impossible to cover the surface evenly!. i used half an ounce (usually absolutely enough to cover the whole face and neck with a good product) and all i saw were scattered blobs and conglomerates of stuff here and there. i then diluted the remaining half ounce (thank god i only bought a 1oz size!) with 15ml of distilled water, hoping this would improve the application process. of course you can imagine the concentration of glycolic acid after that was already lower. well, this produced, honestly, if 20% improvement in application, but i doubt it... so i just smeared the remaining mixture angrily all over my face and neck as good as it was possible with this disaster formula. it still failed to cover all of the surface evenly - there were spots with too much product and spots with no product at all. every time i tried to spread it out by patting it, it only migrated from one area to another, like some kind of gigantic amoeba colony...  make sure that what you see on the picture is NOT the mask you get! there is no way in heavens it can go on like that! even if you just smash raw pumpkin and spread it all over your face it will go over much, but much smoother than this mask! OK..but to be entirely honest and objective i do need to say that the mask DOES produce an appreciable skin moisturizing and softening effect, despite all the mental anguish and immense irritation it comes with. i can say that after 15-20 min it definitely peeled a very superficial level of epidermis, and that is what you need on a 2 times/week basis at home..it&#x27;s just such a pity.. if only it was not that unbearable to apply it could be a nice part of a maintenance routine for someone who wants a mild, non-irritating but effective product. manufacturers of this mask, please make you formula spread!is what you need on a 2 times/week basis at home..it&#x27;s just such a pity.. if only it was not that unbearable to apply it could be a nice part of a maintenance routine for someone who wants a mild, non-irritating but effective product. manufacturers of this mask, please make you formula spread!</li>
    <li> Because this product was so tiny, I probably used it too sparingly to get good results, but I feel like it was just OK anyway. I didn&#x27;t like the pumpkin smell as much as I thought I would and it&#x27;s kind of globby - if you wanted to look like the model in the picture you would probably have to order two of these jars! There is no way I could have gotten that thickness out of such a small jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29yr old dark African American female. Generally my skin has texture issues and hyperpigmentation. I used glycolic peels through my dermatologist office twice before so I know how effective it is for the issues I have. I purchased 15% glycolic mask and I apply it twice a wk. I use vivite glycolic care gel as well and now just 2.5 wks later my skin is butter. This is safe enough to apply a couple times a wk but be mindful of sun exposure. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this mask doesn&#x27;t look as on the photo. and doesn&#x27;t apply as on the photo. it&#x27;s really small package. i&#x27;m not impressed with it&#x27;s quality...</li>
    <li> MY SPA USED IT ON ME AND THE RESULTS WHERE AMAZING... SO AMAZING I REMEMBERED NAME AND BOUGHT IT NOW I CAN SAVE 50 BUCKS OUCH!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I needed a pumpkin glycolic mask cause I get blackheads on my nose and this one had the perfect price. It works as well as the one from the salon Dermatologica.</li>
    <li> Love this mask! Smells great and leaves my skin feeling and looking great. Just what my congested skin needs.</li>
    <li> My mother uses a different pumpkin mask (I still haven&#x27;t got the name, argh) and I absolutely love it. I thought this was the same brand or at least similar in texture by looking at the pictures; however, it wasn&#x27;t.  I would probably be happy with it had I not initially tried hers; but, the texture makes it difficult to use.  It goes on very clumpy and a lot of the product falls into the sink below.  The tub is quite small too. It isn&#x27;t creamy as shown in the picture. It does smell wonderful and works well in conjunction with the Neutrogena Wave Sonic Power Cleanser (I use it with the exfoliating pads).  When I do the entire combination, my skin looks smooth, buffed and bright so overall it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> This mask is great for my skin. I use it a couple times a week and my complexion is glowing! It smells like some delicious pumpkin pie and does not burn me at all. I exfoliate my skin quite regularly, so my skin is used to being abused by my beauty regime. Some people may have more sensitive skin than I do, therefore take precautions. If you feel burning, monitor the length you keep this product on your face very closely.</li>
    <li> Cleans skin, pores tighter younger looking.  A good gentle scrub you leave in a while then rinse.  Next day you look fresher</li>
    <li> After using this product my skin is instantly improved, in fact my husband has commented how my skin looks clear and my under eye area is lightened. Furthermore I was walking in the mall with my daughter a few weeks ago, and someone guessed my age to be 26-27 when I am actually 34!</li>
    <li> I like the mask, I do use it however it is not as other people described it. it doesn&#x27;t burn your face nor feels as  the miracle mask. It is nice to add into your facial routine because your face feels clean, you&#x27;ll feel pampered and the smell is yummy.</li>
    <li> sry took so long was great would order again dont know if i see results but skin is smooth ty</li>
    <li> I do not think this had any glycolic acid in it!  I did not see any favorable results from its use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much result after a couple of application.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this is a tiny sample size.  You&#x27;d get only a very few uses out of it.  It does smell delicious though.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how this product has improved all facets of my skin. Texture, smoothness smaller pores and on and on and on. I will be adding this to my skin care regimen for a very long time to come!</li>
    <li> Shipment was fast. I read good and bad reviews, but I&#x27;m afraid to try it...ahh</li>
    <li> Makes a huge mess and is hard to use. It does leave my skin feeling nice, but there are lots of products the work as well without the mess.</li>
    <li> I can fell the cleanness and see the natural glowing after use.The one oz jar can sustain three to four weeks, definitely will buy more.</li>
    <li> It his product seems good after the reviews , but it did not work for me :(  hope that I will fing something for sensitive skin because this one burned my face</li>
    <li> This is the best online product I ever brought on line. I&#x27;m going to order some today. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> I got my package in a speedy time. I opened it up and it came with a brush to apply the mask on. It literally smells like pumpkin (maybe because it is :) it tingles and when it comes off, my face felt smooth. For this price, I say it&#x27;s worth it. I have heard for twenty years how pumpkin is GREAT for the face-so buy this and the price is awesome. I really love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice super light peel! Smelled great and went on smooth. Transaction as expected! Would like it in a larger size.</li>
    <li> 5% glycolic acid turned out to be not strong enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;However the product smells nice and has a nice texture but I didn&#x27;t expérience any peeling effect.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel. It tingles a little while on your face as suppose to. Good way to naturally exfoliate your skin. Smells just like pure  pumpkin</li>
    <li> Love this mask! I purchased the 2 oz size and I was able to get about 10 applications from the jar. I really love the way it smells and I look forward to using it. I was using it twice a week for the first two weeks, now I&#x27;m only using it once a week. I am using Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep Masque twice a week now. I am a stay at home mom so I really have time to beautify myself now :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it overly strong. I do a scrub about an hour or two before applying this mask and I find the tingling/burning/reddening effect climaxes at about 3 minutes of wearing the mask. After that it&#x27;s not uncomfortable for me. After the first use I really felt like my 25 year old skin was glowing. After continued use I am very happy with my skin. I see a brighter and more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t tackling my blackheads on my nose and my enlarged pores on my cheek area under my eyes so I&#x27;ve started using the mint julep masque again. Together they have made a great team! My pores are shrinking! The enzyme peel is just a nice touch but it&#x27;s more imperative that I use a scrub everyday. I like Clinique&#x27;s 7 day scrub and St. Ives Apricot Scrub (I use the Equate, Walmart, brand now.)  Unless you have really sensitive skin I would recommend buying the new 12% strength they have now. I haven&#x27;t ordered mine yet, but I feel like I could handle a little more power.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I look forward to getting the 12% Mask too. I leave it on for 15-20 mins.</li>
    <li> I really love this product it works great and smell so yummy! I would definitely buy it again. There was only one thing I was disappointed in and that was the bottle size I didn&#x27;t realize it would be so little.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so fresh and glowing after using it. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am a Licensed aesthetician: this mask helps clear out old skin cells, oily, dull, lifeless skin. Mature skin to thick skin prone to black heads. It&#x27;s such a mild acidity level I can use it several times a week. Pumpkin is also naturally full of anti oxidants so your skin will be very happy.use 3 x a week before bed for best results. also can use on neck and chest. I will buy larger ounce next time. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Served no purpose unfortunately. It&#x27;s still sitting in my drawer...I used it three times. It does smell good but that&#x27;s not why I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask, I can feel it working (tingly) after I put it on and it has brighten my complexion.  I didn&#x27;t realize how small 1 ounce is, it came in this little itty bitty jar.  But a little goes a long way.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> hi there love this pumpkin mask made my face tingle a little bit made my face really smooth like glass love it would order again  simply adore it</li>
    <li> Do not purchase, felt like I was rubbing plain old pumpkin on my face!</li>
    <li> Does its job, I liked my old pumpkin face mask better. This one smells bad and has a chunky texture that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
