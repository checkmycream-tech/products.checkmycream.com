<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This thing is the absolutely perfect companion for the sauna! I love using the dry brush beforehand, and then the exfoliating gloves while I&#x27;m in the sauna. Say goodbye to dead skin, and get ready to feel super fresh and clean!! Nothing like it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someday, I&#x27;ll have a sauna in my house... until then, I&#x27;ll be taking my trusty dry brush &amp; gloves to my favorite local spot! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, too that the quality of the construction is also excellent. It feels very well built and high quality. So many brushes feel cheap or plasticky. Definitely not the case here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I spent so many years of sauna&#x27;ing without these things! Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Received it and it looks great but I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to use the long handle. Have used the hand brush though and it feels like it will really help keep my lymph system in good working order.</li>
    <li> The brush feels like the perfect stiffness and my skin just loves the results. Very happy I decided on this brush.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that dry brushing would feel so good all day long?  I&#x27;ve tried it now for 3 days now.  1st Surprise, how lovely the brush is.  I&#x27;d like it even if it were plastic, but it&#x27;s almost a work of art. 2nd Surprise, how energizing dry brushing made me feel, not just in the first hour, but 12 hours later my skin had a pleasant tingle I associate with taking a brisk walk outside. 3rd Surprise, I woke up the first morning after using the morning before and thought, &amp;#34;I feel happy..why?&amp;#34; (Mind you, this was with 5 hours of sleep, 100 degree temps, and before my morning coffee!) I can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s because of the dry body brush, but I&#x27;m happily surprised that such a low-tech, fairly fast (3 min) daily routine yields so many pleasant benefits for me.  I haven&#x27;t yet tried the exfoliating gloves (which are to be used wet) so that&#x27;s another surprise awaiting me, I guess.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried when I received this that it wouldn&#x27;t stay on the handle because the brush just slid on instead of having some type of clip. After some vigorous use, the brush still remained firmly attached to the handle. The exfoliating gloves were a nice bonus and stretchy so they will fit a wide range of hand size. I would recommend this product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best dry brush I&#x27;ve found. Most are either too stiff, (irritating the skin and causing discomfort) or too soft (not really that beneficial). This one is just right. Very invigorating and also lightly exfoliating. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Came quickly and am very pleased with it. The curved handle does make it easier to reach your back.  I recommend this brush as the quality and quick delivery is great.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to continued use. Instructions are easy to understand &amp; it takes very little time. You definitely feel energized long after using it.</li>
    <li> I had read about dry brushing so was anxious to receive this product.  I was not disappointed!  The set comes in a very nice box suitable for gift giving.  Included are exfoliating gloves, the body brush, and a lotus wood handle.  Also included are detailed instructions explaining the benefits of dry body brushing and instructions suggesting directions to brush your body to get the best results.  The brush is great quality and the wooden handle can slide easily into the brush to give you an easy option to reach the hard to reach areas.  I use this brush every day before I take a shower and my body feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> The body brush was purchased as a gift for a senior with arthritis.  They were very pleased since there is the strap at the top and a string at the bottom and there is a curve to the handle, so it&#x27;s not so straight.  It&#x27;s easy to hold onto and easy to clean.  It was a great gift and it help keep the individual independent.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove dry skin and improve your circulation.  brush made of lotus wood and smoothed so that it is very comfortable in your hand. You get the brush with a strap to hold your hand in place, a nice long handle that is easily slid into place on the brush with a loop at the end for hanging that will help reach those areas beyond arm&#x27;s length and a pair of exfoliating gloves for the shower as a bonus.It does help very well</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;The workmanship:  I rarely give something five stars but I think this eco friendly dry body brush deserves it. It is made very durable, conveniently splits to a handle-less body brush for easier use on other parts of the body. The brush is made of sustainably farmed Lotus Wood, which is just pretty to look at hanging on the wall. When the handle is in use, I don&#x27;t see the brush falling off easily. I have used it a few times now all over my body before i get in the shower and have had nada problem. The cloth handle on the brush is really nailed in there, so that&#x27;s not going anywhere either. The wood is very nice and smooth and the handle is comfortable to hold. I love that it has a rope loop at the end for hanging as these brushes really need to be hung upside down for thorough dryness after washing. Getting this wet for long periods of time ( it is meant for dry brushing only, they provide you with free exfoliating gloves for the shower) may depreciate the wood over time, so i would not suggest it. I also love the added touch of their name engraved inside the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way it feels: The bristles are not soft nor too hard. You do feel slight discomfort at first, as any one would with anything scratchy, but you adapt to that rather quickly. For me personally, I love how it feels and the scratch even feels invigorating. I get the chills, especially when I go around my neck and shoulder area. I start at the soles of my feet, as the pamphlet suggests and work my way up the body with circular strokes toward my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way it performs: I felt refreshed and sort of tingly after I did my whole body. I&#x27;m sure this is going to take a good amount of use before I notice a major difference in how i feel, but I like the feeling of it and will continue to use it. So I am hoping this will help me after my exercises.  This would also be great for a pre-massage ritual I think. Get the circulation going and work out those kinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims it will do a lot, such as stimulate the lymphatic system, activate muscle fibers, create new cell growth, reduce cellulite and more. So I will have to update on if I see any changes, especially if my chicken skin (small bumps)  gets any better along my forearms and elbows. Maybe the gloves will help more with that. Regardless, this is my first time dry brushing and I really think it is something everyone should try.

    <li> Excellent quality brush for dry brushing.  Good, sturdy bristles.  It comes with a diagram showing you the correct method/direction of strokes.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brush was almost a surprise to me. I was not expecting it to be as nice as it is. The way the handle attaches to the brush is genius. Zen Me also sends detailed instructions (PDF) on how to dry brush. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in starting a dry brushing routine. I am glad I chose this one to start mine...</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have lymphedema and it has helped! Great bristles and sturdy. Would recommend it for sure. I was a little skeptical but I cannot skip doing it!</li>
    <li> Wow, this really works. I have been using this brush for a couple of weeks now and can feel the difference. I am feeling immediately more energized and the overall quality and texture of my skin has indeed improved. thank you! Great product!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush! A must have!</li>
    <li> I could not believe how awesome dry brushing feels. I wish I would of found this brush and technique years ago.  This is worth the money. The exfoliating glove is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  After I shower I apply coconut oil and my skin glows.</li>
    <li> I just came back from a high end spa retreat where I had a 5-Element (Wood) massage. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect until I actually received it and it was done by a body brush. The sensation was soothingly stimulating and invigorating which led later to feel deeply relaxing. It&#x27;s hard to describe because it sounds like a paradox, but I fell in love with this massage technique that I wanted to get a body brush so I could do it on my own. I&#x27;ve never purchased a body brush before, but this brush seems to have the perfect texture - not too coarse, nor too soft, so I&#x27;m very pleased.  I love the feeling on my body and especially on my back. After brushing my body, it seems to give me the same sensation I get from taking a cold shower, which supposedly has many health benefits. I really love this brush and have been using it every day.</li>
    <li> Only used once so far hoping to reduce the look of cellulite on my thighs</li>
    <li> I know that they say that this is a dry brush, but I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower to get used to the sensation.  I felt the difference in my skin after the first use.  Go easy with it because it does take time to get used to.  If you do use it in the shower make sure that you dry it really well, otherwise these things tend to get moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used all sorts of brushes before and like this one the best.  The bristles are slighty curved which is a big difference.  I would highly suggest this.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to replace my old dry brush, which had many years of use and was falling apart.  Fortunately I discovered the Vitality Dry Brush, and I can say that I am more than pleased!  The product came in 3 days with regular shipping and I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of this brush.  I love that you can detach the handle and that the brush stays in place when the handle is affixed.  I have now used the brush every day since my purchase and have followed the easy to read, detailed instructions in the convenient user guide that came with the product. My skin, which tends to be dry and flaky, felt silky and smooth after the very first use!  I have to admit that I was a little reticent to try the brush at first because I thought the stiff bristles would irritate my already dry skin. In following the instructions, however, I found by brushing my skin lightly, it was enough to have the desired effect and not irritate my skin.  I highly recommend this brush to anyone who is seeking to improve the tone and texture of their skin.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how continued use will improve circulation and reduce the appearance of cellulite too--an added bonus, for sure! A+++ for this product!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! I felt no tpye of discomfort and iy did its job</li>
    <li> I bought the ZEN ME dry brush as a present for someone, but once it was delivered, I decided to keep it! It is so well made. I love the Vitality message. The brush is very soft but the bristles are strong enough to do their job! Dry brushing is such an important part of self care and being healthy as it helps detox your body. Don&#x27;t miss buying this product! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Great brush set. Bristles are high quality. The free loofha glove is wonderful. Packaging is excellent and so is the information on the insert. Going to buy as gifts this year for friends and family.</li>
    <li> Using this body brush has become a meditative ritual for us now. Yes it exfoliates your skin...  Yes it calms and soothes as well as invigorates your senses..  But honestly, don&#x27;t overlook the sensual benefit of using this on your partner. It can be a rewarding experience for both. Turn the lights low, sip on some wine, gently follow the patterns shown in the included instructions on your partners body. Take turns soothing each other  with this amazing brush, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of dry brushing and had the opportunity to purchase this brush at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.  OMG, I&#x27;m going to love this thing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful brush made of lotus wood and smoothed so that it is very comfortable in your hand.  You get the brush with a strap to hold your hand in place, a nice long handle that is easily slid into place on the brush with a loop at the end for hanging that will help reach those areas beyond arm&#x27;s length and a pair of exfoliating gloves for the shower as a bonus.  There are instructions in the box to let you know there is a correct way to use the brush and a diagram showing which directions to brush.  (In general, always brush toward your heart and use circular motions on your joints)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if we all realize just how much dry skin is on our body?  I had no idea there was so much, I knew my skin was dry but wow!  My husband was watching me use the brush and was the one who asked me if it was snowing inside.  This was with my first use and the flakes were really flying (I know, kind of gross) but I am sure in time with regular use that won&#x27;t be a big issue.  My skin feels softer and kind of polished after use.  They advise washing the brush monthly with a mild detergent, I think if you have very dry skin like mine you&#x27;ll probably want to do it a bit more often at the start and then monthly after your flakiness settles down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Zen Me for giving me the chance to try your dry body brush - a product I had absolutely no idea I needed but now won&#x27;t be able to do without!</li>
    <li> Very nice dry brush, great for exfoliating the skin.  Can be used with the handle or just use the brush, which has a strap you can use  with the palm of your hand.  Amazing the difference how my skin feels after a couple of uses.  I also like the gloves included in the kit.  This brush would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> The dry brush has a nice long handle that will easily reach my back. I also dry brush my legs, arms, tummy, and all those places that brushing can be done. The bristles are not to hard or not too soft. It also came with a hand glove that its great for scrubbing your whole body. This dry brush by Zen Me is a quality crafted tool. It is made out of the finest smooth polished sustainably farmed Lotus Wood. It has a long, curved handle to comfortably get to those hard to reach areas like your back and feet.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. Easy to use, the bristles are firm but not painful. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I have to honestly say the body brush is awesome and it does work on cellulite smoothing</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love that it came with a detailed instruction to help me (a dry brushing novice) better understand the method and the bennifits to daily dry brushing.</li>
    <li> It has only been a few days...so far my skin is softer.  I hope to see a reduction in cellulite but expect that to take a while. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> After using this brush for a week - I absolutely LOVE the way my skin feels.  I am eager to see how I feel after more time of regularly doing the dry brushing for purposes of detox.</li>
    <li> Love this set!  The quality and craftsmanship is top notch.  I love the positive word engraved.  You can feel a lot of love and thought went into creating this.  The bristles are softer than I expected.  The wood is smooth to touch.  This is something to keep in mind not just for yourself, but as a gift too.</li>
    <li> Love this body brush!</li>
    <li> prompt service and a quality product!</li>
    <li> Very Nice!! Simply works as expected.</li>
    <li> Wonderful dry body bush.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new dry brush! My favorite thing about it, the handle comes off! Thanks for a great product! Such a simple process for amazing benefits!</li>
    <li> This is one heck of a brush. I never understood how a brush could make tour skin feel so good. Since I got this and started using it I totally understand. It is soft bristled and when it is rubbed over your skin it feels great. It comes with a pair of gloves and they are supposed to be used for the same thing but let me tell you. These gloves are wonderful when used in the shower. I squirting my body wash on them and I rub down just like I would with a wash cloth except the light roughness of the gloves makes it feel like you are really doing some good with getting off the dry skin. I would recommend these to anyone. I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!! The gloves are a great bonus whenever I have time to sit in the bath.</li>
    <li> Just received your body brush yesterday. It&#x27;s a complete package with great instructions and explanations. Takes a while to get used to it. You do provide 5 star service.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more..........! I am very pleased with the two brushes I ordered for my husband and myself, they are  wonderful quality and&lt;br /&gt;leave a wonderful rejuvenated sensation on the skin, after each use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have severe dry skin, and I have been looking for something that will really attack that dead skin and help me to properly exfoliate my back. When I saw this, I thought it would be perfect for exfoliation. I was very pleased and surprised that the handle is removable. You can easily pull it off, even if you have arthritis or carpel tunnel, like me. Don&#x27;t think that just because you can easily remove the handle, this product isn&#x27;t sturdy or well made. When you slide the handle onto the back of the brush, it absolutely stays put until you choose to remove it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrives, packaged securely, in a sturdy box. One thing I like about this brush is that it comes with detailed instructions on the benefits of dry brushing. It also shows you, in a diagram, the directions you should move the brush to achieve the best results from dry brushing. This method helps to decrease cellulite and aids in draining the lymphatic system, which, when working properly, boosts your immune system and rids your body of harmful toxins. I am going to practice dry brushing, in the hopes of achieving great, healthy results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also very happy to receive the free gift, which is a pair of wet exfoliating gloves. I owned a pair of these years ago, and they alone, cost me around $15. This set is very fairly priced and there is an incentive to purchase, clearly stated on the box. I am going to take them up on this offer and see if I get lucky! Upon immediate inspection, you can tell the brush is very high quality. I honestly purchased this to use in the shower. I discovered it is not for use in the shower, even though I am sure it could be. However, I am going to try the dry brushing techniques described in the manual. I already use a rubber-based cellulite brush, but it is not good for more bony areas. This brush can be used all over, and the handle is made of sustainably farmed lotus wood. It is light, and very smooth, with no splinters or rough areas. I am so glad I was able to get this at a reduced, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and review.to get this at a reduced, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> What an awesome dry brush this it!  It worked like a charm on brushing off the flaky skin and making my skin glow and feel soft again!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this wonderful brush.  I am telling my friends about it too.</li>
    <li> I loooooove the Zen Me Vitality Body Brush!!!! It is of superior quality and easy to use with the handle extension. Thank you for your wonderful product! A+++++</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful!  I really like the feature of the brush head being removable.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love it!</li>
    <li> never body brushed before ... really like it ... skin feels great..</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Works great. A little costly but worth it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great stuff.  I adore my  ZEN ME BEST DRY BODY BRUSH.  Ahhh to my body soul.&lt;br /&gt;Anything offered by Claudia Seifert and ZEN ME will rock your Vitality world.  Get everything She-They have!!</li>
    <li> Well-made, and the brush (while still new) stays on the handle but is easy to remove. The handle is a great length. Nice texture of bristles.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment. Good quality brush and full benefit and usage guide included. Used it for the first time this evening, bristles feel nice on skin, not rough at all. Will update review after us by it for a few weeks to see if I begin seeing the detox or cellulite reduction benefits mentioned. But if you&#x27;re already convinced of the benefits of dry brushing, this is a great one to purchase.</li>
    <li> First time body brushing, but so far so good. It seems like the bristles are too soft but i dont know. Now I&#x27;ve just got to remember to do it every day.</li>
    <li> Granted, I have just had this brush for a few days. Appreciated the directions--I proceeded to follow them. However, I have not experienced much of anything--either bad or good. Based on the research, I will keep doing the dry brushing. The quality of the brush is all that it was promised. I realize that an overnight transformation doesn&#x27;t usually happen but I confess to a bit of a disappointment--not in the quality of the brush but in the results.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product and felt I needed to try it.  I feel my skin looks healthier and due to my stressful lifestyle, I feel more relaxed.....I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love it, great quality!</li>
