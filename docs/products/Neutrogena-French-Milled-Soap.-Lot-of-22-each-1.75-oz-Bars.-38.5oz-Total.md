    <li> Great Soap... my wife and I both love it. I just wish the bars were available in a larger size. Each bar is individually wrapped in a cardboard box. Seems like a waste of paper for such a small bar.</li>
    <li> Another high quality Neutrogena product.  A very mild, yet good cleansing, scentless soap. I often use this as shaving soap.</li>
    <li> We were staying at a hotel and they furnished the rooms with this soap and we liked it so much we went on a search for it and you all had it in stock.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews on this soap, I was hopeful it would be skin-moisturizing and be perfect for my skin. I am allergic to a lot of things and unfortunately this is one of them. I also found it to be drying. It sounds like I&#x27;m in the minority as there were a lot of other people who found it to be perfect for their skin. If you have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this soap for you. I love other Neutrogena products but this one doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I use this soap every morning and night when I wash my face to keep my clean and moist - keeps my skin from that dry feeling.  Cannot get this product anywhere else.  Yes, I recommend this to my friends, and have shared some with them.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have Hilton&#x27;s soap at home now :)</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this soap during hotel stays when traveled cross country last year. Wish they made a bigger bar!</li>
    <li> Not harsh like most soaps, mild fragrance&lt;br /&gt;and soothing to the skin.  just wish bars lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Love this face soap, started using it after finding it in a hotel and couldn&#x27;t believe how different my skin felt and looked. I search every store I went to trying to find the full size bars of it, they just don&#x27;t make it. So glad Amazon carries it..... PLEASE DON&#x27;T STOP.</li>
    <li> The soap has a lovely mild fragrance that I like. My guests also liked it. The sizes. Handy for your guest room and to travel with. If it came in the regular size bar soap, I would buy that size also.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Used it from a recent hotel trip and noticed my skin was better. The scent is very light, not overpowering, and it&#x27;s very smoothing, makes your skin soft.</li>
    <li> Used this in a hotel once and was trying to find it again ...this is it! Wonderful! Wish it came in bigger bars, but these are perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! I first encountered this soap and loved the way it really makes my skin feel really clean. Neutrogena does not sell this publicly do it&#x27;s good to have these small sized soaps. Glad that Amazon stocks them!</li>
    <li> The reviews said that this was the soap that Hilton Hotels used. This is not there soap that they use. This is a fake china market soap. The reviews are lies. This is not the soap that have little dots on the bottom.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It has a soft clean scent and really wish I could get it in larger bath sized bars. I received my package promptly and it was packaged well. Thank you</li>

The travel size bars are great for trips or to tuck in a gym bag. Thanks so much for offering it on Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the moisturizing qualities of this soap.  I have sensitive complexion but even using it on my face has been fine!  I, as everyone else, am mystified as to why it isn&#x27;t offered in a larger bar?  Perhaps it is just manufactured for hotels??  Nonetheless, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> These are the soaps you typically find at a nice hotel. My hubby suffers from eczema and it worked well on his skin so I bought him some for at home!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and smells great!  I used some in a hotel and I just had to order more.  I just wish they had it in stores, and in full sized bars.  The ones on here  are \\&quot;hotel\\&quot; sized.</li>
    <li> Was pleased to find this French Milled Soap which I used on an off for years.  Very pleased with the price.</li>
    <li> I liked this soap so much that I will gather up the bars in the morning at my hotel and put them in my luggage so housekeeping would leave more when they cleaned the room each day. Like everybody else I wish they sold it in stores and the bars were bigger.</li>
    <li> Finding Neutrogena french miled soap in hotels,like the Hilton, I liked the feel of this soap.  Coming home I got some samples,but I needed more.  I used it on my entire body when I bathed!  Found it on Amazon and took a chance it would be the same. It was what I wanted, only wished the bars are bigger.  You can get other soaps by Neutrogena, but I prefer french milled!!  It&#x27;s not drying and leaves your body feeling clean and fresh!  It has very little scent, which I love too!  Shipment was easy and packaging was great! Thanks for having this option to get a product the customer wants! Diana</li>
