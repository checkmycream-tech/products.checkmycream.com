      <li>I love the big container and it works just like it should.  </li>
      <li>After some research I found PFB Vanish, and after his first use  my husband was hooked.</li>

      <li>He has very sensitive skin and always breaks out after shaving.</li>
      <li>Some of my spots have faded a very little bit but seem to look better.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I finally got fed up and did some research; PFB Vanish came up as the most highly-rated vanishing topical, and I fully back up that rating.</li>
      <li>I had almost given up when I decided to order PFB Vanish, and I&#x27;m so glad I did because this is the ONLY product that&#x27;s been effective at preventing bad razor burn.</li>
      <li>It is VERY drying, to the point that it&#x27;s actually made my skin peel in places.</li>
      <li>would recommend this product to anyone with a skin problem that to do with shaving rash or sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is relatively inexpensive for the amount given, and doesn&#x27;t 100% stop ingrowns, but aside from electrolysis what really does?  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and really does prevent ingrone hairs in my underarms as long as you remember to do it right after shaving and get out of the shower.</li>

      <li>Unless you&#x27;re into bikini-area razorburn covered in liquid fire - but if you are, it&#x27;s pretty clear we don&#x27;t have a lot in common, so why listen to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razorburn</li>

    <li> This product works very well!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this regularly for a few weeks now and have seen noticeably fewer ingrown hairs around my bikini line. Also, it made quick work of some of the rather unpleasant ingrowns I already had.</li>
    <li> I have my legs waxed and deal with ingrown hairs even though I exfoliate. Using this really helped but it seems expensive and I almost used it all in a bit over a month so I came up with another plan. I now lightly distribute ( using my hands) 20 percent  glycolic acid peel over my legs every night or so. I leave it on overnight. I don&#x27;t have any visible signs of peeling. Wow, this has really improved the texture of my legs. I no longer have dry dry skin and my legs are more smooth than they have been in years. I still exfoliate but not as much and with better results. Some of my spots have faded a very little bit but seem to look better. I haven&#x27;t found many ingrown hairs yet either. Anyway I think this product started me on the path of thinking of a peel-that is what this product is really.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it would do. No added fragrance and once the alcohol evaporate, no smell (vs the chromawhite kind has a lingering fragrance all day).</li>
    <li> This stuff, while smelling merely like rubbing alcohol, is made of mystery winsauce.  I tried just using rubbing alcohol, that was a painful mistake I do not recommend. Unless you&#x27;re into bikini-area razorburn covered in liquid fire - but if you are, it&#x27;s pretty clear we don&#x27;t have a lot in common, so why listen to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razorburn disappears overnight, probably less than that if I did it during waking hours to check. Great for folk who spend a lot of time in bathing suits, live in muggy climates, and don&#x27;t wield a razor with total samurai control. Has also prevented any incident of ingrown hairs on the suit-line as well. 0 incidents since I started using this stuff after shaving *ahem* at-risk areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It costs a stupid amount of money, but for how much you need to use per go, it will last you approximately half a human lifetime. So if you&#x27;re buying this at ~25 year mark, you will need to get another one at ~75. But maybe you won&#x27;t be shaving so much by then. Or it can be an heirloom of your house, passed on to your survivors. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the big container and it works just like it should.  My husband even uses it for his face.</li>
    <li> I used to use Tend Skin and it&#x27;s very hard to find where I live now so I&#x27;d gone without any product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I always get bumps around the sides of my lips (mustache area) from ingrown hairs.  I got a sample of this at a salon and I was SO PLEASED with how much it has reduced the inflammation and bumps.  So glad I found it online.  It just works!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It lasts a long time and really does prevent ingrone hairs in my underarms as long as you remember to do it right after shaving and get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product is one of the few that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t cause me irritation.  It is relatively inexpensive for the amount given, and doesn&#x27;t 100% stop ingrowns, but aside from electrolysis what really does?  I also like the roll on applicator.  Give it some time to dry before dressing.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to stave off ingrown hairs from shaving, it works!</li>
    <li> This product works well. I recommended to others.</li>
    <li> Takes care of razor bumps or rash and ingrown hair better than anything!!  Been using for 8 years now and it&#x27;s the absolute best.</li>
    <li> My skin is very prone to rashes and ingrown hairs and I have tried countless products trying to fix and/or prevent this problem - safety razors, waxing, Bikini Zone, Tend Skin, expensive spa aftershave lotion, etc. I had almost given up when I decided to order PFB Vanish, and I&#x27;m so glad I did because this is the ONLY product that&#x27;s been effective at preventing bad razor burn. I still do get a few ingrown hairs but not many, and there&#x27;s no redness or inflammation like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to take off a star for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does not play nice with lotion or cotton pads. Really if I try to do anything with my skin after applying this I end up with little white clumps of goop on my skin, even if I wait 15 minutes to let it dry. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is VERY drying, to the point that it&#x27;s actually made my skin peel in places. Again, yuck.</li>
    <li> great way to clear up any razor burn and some zits!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best when it comes to preventing and eliminating razor bumps after shaving delicate areas.  My only complaint is that I hate the strong smell, which almost smells like chemicals.  The smell lingers and gets on your clothes, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best after shave my husband has ever tried. He has very sensitive skin and always breaks out after shaving. He gets horrible bumps and ingrown hairs. My husband tried numerous after shave products and  all types of home remedies with no success. After some research I found PFB Vanish, and after his first use  my husband was hooked. He has not had any break outs and his skin looks amazing. He now refuses to shave if he does not have his PFB Vanish.</li>
    <li> Love how it takes care of any unwanted ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It really works.</li>
    <li> Wow..this stuff is amazing. I was paying top dollar for Anthony Logistics but now im gonna make this my go to product after shaving. ive only been using it for 2 weeks and already its working wonders on my neck.</li>
    <li> Wow! My face seems to have cleared up and my skins dark spots are disappearing.</li>
    <li> The only thing that has worked!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Vanish for years. It really helps to reduce irritation after shaving your bikini line. One container lasts a very long time so I was very happy to see they still sold it.</li>
    <li> The best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. My ex-girlfriend turned me on to this for when she shaved and waxed, and using this I have no shave irritation.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I would always recommend it to clients at the medical spa I used to work at. It&#x27;s great for clearing up ingrown hairs/razor bumps, especially for bikini lines and men&#x27;s faces. It&#x27;s like a super mild chemical peel (salicylic and glycolic acid) which exfoliates the skin so that the ingrown hairs never have a chance!&lt;br /&gt; I had many a convert after just one or two times using it. This is a fairly good size and will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> If you get certain areas of your body waxed, you want to use this product. It helps preventing ingrown hair and it does not have any scent at all.</li>
    <li> The best ingrown hair treatment I ever tried,I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> While other reviews are correct in saying it dries out your skin, that is necessary for drying out the site of the ingrown hair. I have had a really bad bout of ingrown hairs this past winter (I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re connected but it sure seems like it!). I finally got fed up and did some research; PFB Vanish came up as the most highly-rated vanishing topical, and I fully back up that rating. My ingrown hairs were BAD… there were multiple ingrown hairs under one bump, and they bruised my skin. PFB made all of them disappear. I kept my skin from drying out by putting lotion on after the PFB vanish. It works like a dream!</li>
    <li> Works great for calming skin, preventing ingrown hairs and is gentle. I Have been using PFB for almost a decade</li>
    <li> This product works like a charm. After two weeks of usage, I began to see results. Now it&#x27;s about a month and I clearly see that the appearance of my face is becoming normal again. Thanks PFB, you have work  wonderfully.</li>
    <li> it was a work colleague who mentioned the product to me so tried some and it worked a treat 12 out of 10 would recommend this product to anyone with a skin problem that to do with shaving rash or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I guess it works...on swelling.</li>
