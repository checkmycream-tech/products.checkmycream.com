<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If I could give this product 0 stars I would! I have used Conair water jets for years but this is a disgrace to a once well made product! If you purchase this be sure to save all the packaging because most likely you will be sending it back for a refund! The water reservoir does not fit tightly so there will be substantial leakage and if you like to use it with it turned up to max or almost max, the head continuously falls out no matter what position you put it in. After waiting on the phone for at least 5 minutes,I got a very snotty Conair customer &amp;#34;service&amp;#34; rep to send me another package of heads thinking that perhaps I had a defective one, but these did the same thing as did the head from a previous one I still had. After 2 weeks of use the motor stopped working, making lots of noise but not putting out enough power to work the water jet. However, the bright light is Amazon Prime, which refunded my money before I sent the product back and paid for the shipping completely.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon you are the exact opposite of Conair!</li>
    <li> Best pik I ever owned.  Uses more water, but does a much better job.</li>
    <li> A very good water jet, we have had many Conair water pics.</li>
    <li> Use it daily. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was glad to see there was a product with all the functionality this purported to have... I should have known it was too good to be true for the price.  I wish it had a guarantee so I could return it. The toothbrush bristles are too short and hard. The handle too short for easy maneuvering. The water pic function is a joke - it the stream of water is too heavy, but does not have the pressure to actually clean teeth/gums - you would be better off using a squirt-gun - which would be much quieter, since the sonic function on this will wake up the whole neighborhood, it is so ridiculously loud.&lt;br /&gt;A terrible product. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> My teeth love it, my dentist loves it and I love it. It does the job better then flossing. I do both and my dentist has seen an improvement in my gums. I really do love this product and use it every day. Will save me money at the dentist in the long run.</li>
    <li> Works great but a little noisy.</li>
    <li> I love it, just what I need. The attachments Are too very useful specially the one for the tongue massage</li>
    <li> I bought this jet one year ago. Yesterday first time i used this,  it didn&#x27;t  work. No water pump out.The pump could be broken. Fortunately, it is still within 2 years.</li>
    <li> Good for cleaning out stuck food particles but it won&#x27;t remove plaque.</li>
    <li> Greatest thing since buttered popcorn...plus it get&#x27;s all of the left over kernels&lt;br /&gt; out of your gums</li>
    <li> Does a fantastic job. The dentist is happy with the health of my gums and teeth. So is my wallet!&lt;br /&gt;Have had no dental bills beside cleaning since I am using the water jet. This is my second one.&lt;br /&gt;The other lasted about 8 years.</li>
    <li> In general, I find this to be a very good product.  There are many attachments, all of which have held up fairly well with use.  It is easy to change out the attachments, easy to fill the tank, and easy to adjust settings- in general it is a user-friendly product.  The very first time I used it, with the sonic vibration, I felt that my teeth were much cleaner.  Using the water jet to rinse also leaves a fresher feeling in the mouth.  I only have 2 cons:  One is with the water system- if you turn the dial on the tank to release the flow of water, you better be holding down the &#x27;pause&#x27; button on the handheld jet.  Otherwise, water will start spraying out!  I wish the water flow was normally set to off, and you had to push the button to release the water, as opposed to the opposite- which is that the water will spray continuously and you have to hold the button to stop it. (note- when you are brushing your teeth, you can simply have the tank turned off, so you don&#x27;t have to hold the button while brushing).  Second con:  this system comes with several attachments- water jet, gum massager, tongue scraper, etc- but there is no stand of any sort for the attachments.  So when you are switcing from one to another you have to either lay them in a clean place, or have your own cup or something to set them in.  I wish the system came with some sort of stand for the attachments.  Over-all, a design that works well and definitely gets your mouth clean!</li>
    <li> first off it leaked from the base I sent back and got a refund. as far as the actual water spray I didn&#x27;t think it did much I get better results with good old  fashion dental floss</li>
    <li> Works fine. I think it was the only one with a removable tank for draining and cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought a Waterpik and this is a zillion times better. This is easy to use, has a stop button on the handle and the tubing is long enough so you don&#x27;t have to hug the wall when using it. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Conair All-in-One Sonic Water Jet works great.</li>
    <li> smooth transaction - excellent!</li>
    <li> I had the lower cost Interpak w/o the sonic feature for 5 years until the hose cracked.  This is a step up from that unit with the larger reservoir and sonic pulsation with the battery in the nozzle holder.  I would prefer that the on/off button was a rotary knob instead of a two position button only for reliability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy overall with this purchase, but only gave it 4 stars because I think the force of the water should be stronger.</li>
    <li> Awesme and very much a nassessary item in any home.</li>
    <li> Very happy with our purchase!</li>
    <li> After turning 50 and having both kids out of the house, I decided to take care of myself (for a change) and get braces.  This item is invaluable.  I am shocked every evening after brushing the amount of food items that are still removed with the water jet.  I have had it for a few months now and it still works great.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
    <li> I love it and the way it makes my teeth feel.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my b and he loves it</li>
    <li> Previous one lasted 5 ys and loved it because it was compact and light.  The new model is even better bacau se it has a push button vs dial that was hard to turn.  The hose is still too stiff and kinks too much.  Love it nevertheless</li>
    <li> I have used the [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] for years and love it, but thought I would give the Interplak Water Jet a try as a vine reviewer. My first impression after taking it out of the box was that it wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as my Waterpik.  I filled it with water, plugged it in, but found that it was significantly louder than the Waterpik. In addition, the very highest (hardest water pressure) setting is just about equivalent to the lowest setting on the Waterpik. (The WaterPik range has a 10-90 PSI range with 10 various setting in that range. The Interplak only goes up to approx. 10-30 PSI).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a variety of attachments you get with the unit, including a water jet tip which I use the most. I was disappointed that only one was included and I will have to order additional tips separately. You also receive 1 subgngival tip, 1 tongue cleaner, 1 soft finger massager, and 2 full size brush heads (which I really won&#x27;t use since I am pretty much sold on traditional brushing). To tell you the truth, the only attachment I&#x27;ve ever used on my WaterPik is the water jet tip; this is the attachment you will probably use the most on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Interplak has \\&quot;sonic pulsing action\\&quot; which is obtained by inserting batteries into the hand device. (My Waterpik doesn&#x27;t have this feature.) There is a separate button on the hand device to turn this function on or off. It really didn&#x27;t improve the effect using the water jet tip, but could be useful if you use the brush tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a lot of bells and whistles, this may be the unit for you. Truthfully, I won&#x27;t use most of the functions and prefer the very basic functionality of the WaterPik unit. Current cost for the WaterPik on Amazon is $47 (reg $60) and the Interplak is $40 (reg $50). In my opinion, for the extra $7-$10 the WaterPik is the best buy. You will get better quality and will last you for a good long time.</li>
    <li> there is no option to switch to 220 volt</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Great, Like it better than the Waterpik</li>
    <li> It worked moderately well, lasted 11 months</li>
    <li> It seems that the water pic devices will only work for about a year since this one is the third one for me. This unit, at a very low cost, seems to do the job as well as the others I have owned at much higher prices. Its a bit noisy and I have no idea if the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; feature actually helps, but it works and its powerful enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tank holds more then enough water- would run about five minutes I would guess.</li>
    <li> The Interplak has a compact footprint.  The removable water tank can hold up to about 26 oz of water.  The base where the tank gets seated contains the power button and pressure control knob, and has a bottom drawer for storing the cleaning attachments (water jet tip, toothbrush, etc.) that are not in use. The handle where the cleaning tips can be attached to contains a Pause and Sonic ON/OFF buttons.  The handle is easy to grip and long enough to support the cleaning of the back teeth comfortably.  When using the water jet tip, I also turn on sonic vibration (as I do when using the Interplak toothbrush).  At the maximum pressure setting, the water stream from this Interplak feels just a little bit less powerful than the water stream I get from my old WaterPik, but it&#x27;s powerful enough to loosen food particles.  The toothbrushes have bristles that are softer than those in my Oral-B toothbrush, so brushing with them feels a bit gentler.  I use the other attachments only when I&#x27;m in the mood to give my gums or tongue a special treatment.  I use the Interplak only once a day. I still brush with my Oral-B and do feel a need to floss.  In my opinion, the Interplak cleaning tips do work well enough and the issues I have with it revolve more around the mess it makes (and the cleanup it requires), and the poor construction of the various buttons (sometimes I have to press hard or twice to get them to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; in place or to \\&quot;unstick\\&quot;) and the bottom storage drawer (sometimes it&#x27;s hard to pull out) than its ability to help me maintain my dental hygiene.  I do think that it provides good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Product is easy to set up.  I used only the subgingival tip and the water jet tip.  Mostly, I used the subgingival tip because I have gum disease already.  Although the manual states the subgingival tip is not for \\&quot;general use\\&quot; which I took to mean not to use it on a daily basis, I do use it on a daily basis as the water jet tip sprays too much water even on the lowest setting.  The subgingival tip caused some sensitivity on a few teeth and I was hoping that meant it was working to improve my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have deep pockets so wanted something to tighten and help heal my gums.  Although when using this I felt that my teeth were cleaned, I did get some plaque when I flossed afterward but it was minimal.  According to research, home oral irrigation is effective in controlling gingival inflammation, with reductions in gingivitis scores, bleeding scores, and pocket depths.  Before using this irrigator, I had been flossing and was experiencing no bleeding.  I used this for 3 weeks and when I flossed I had bleeding again mainly in the back, so my gum pockets increased on a few teeth when using only this product.  If I had not used it though, my other teeth would&#x27;ve bled and they didn&#x27;t.  My technique for reaching the back teeth is not as effective, so I will have to concentrate more on the back teeth I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated from another user, using the brush is very messy and I prefer to stick to my toothbrush.  I didn&#x27;t need or use the gum massager or the tongue cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I will have to continue flossing for a while to ensure the gums are actually healing, but will still use this on a daily basis too..maybe in time between the two my gum health will improve.  I do recommend this product, but it takes some practice to use because the water is messy.  I did learn to do one section at a time and that seemed to help.  The manual shows doing the inside of the teeth, well there is no way to do that without opening your mouth and you cannot open your mouth or water will go everywhere.er will go everywhere.</li>
    <li> This does an excellent job on cleaning and massaging the gums.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product performs exactly as advertised.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I would suggest, however, that the design for the on/off switch would work better if it were a toggle switch instead of a push button.  I find it difficult to turn it on or off, using my left hand.  My right hand is occupied holding the cleaner.</li>
    <li> It is not as powerfull, however I like it better and use it daily. It also was cheaper. I put a bit of vinegar in the water.</li>
    <li> Interplak ok just not a water pic. Really noisy with less pressure . It takes up less space on the counter.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I don&#x27;t know. It was a gift, and I don&#x27;t know how it worked.</li>
    <li> I got mine today. It works well it has a nice little drawer on the bottom to keep all the attachments. The only reason i give it 4 instead of 5 stars is its not very powerful, its perfectly adequate for flossing and massaging the gums it would just be nice if it had a more powerful stream. After one use though of the gum massager my gums actually looked healthier so i like it and would definatley recommend it. I doubt for the price you would be able to find a more powerful one.</li>
    <li> Very good product, I like it very much and use it daily, cleaning results are great for oral health. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.  This water floss is a great complement for your dental hygiene.  The water flows great through your teeth and it is much better than the battery   operated one I had.  It hold a pretty good amount of water and stores easily.  It comes with all the 6 attachments. I have tried all of them and some of them can be messy to use  but with time and practice you will be able to master it.  My mouth feels fresh and clean after using this water jet. Not going back to the battery operated one.  And the value is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of flossing, and for my entire life I have been happy using the good old floss string. I finally took advantage of a vine promotion to try this out. First, I was a little apprehensive because it seems that this device could get messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this device was simple to get going and easy to use. It puts out a pretty good amount of pressure and is great for cleaning those hard to floss places. It also gives your gums quite a work out. The first couple of times I used it, there was some slight soreness on a couple of spots on my gums (places where I guess I don&#x27;t get up under the gums really well when brushing or flossing), but after several more uses this subsided. My gums feel healthier and stronger as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem would be buying this device, using a few times, then forgetting about it. I regularly clean and empty the reservoir (we do have mold and mildew issues in Oregon). And I use daily. If you floss already this is a great substitute or add on to your existing regimen. If you don&#x27;t like the regular way of flossing, try this out, you might be surprised with how much you enjoy this and how fun and easy it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Nice water jet, kind of bulky, but beneficial because the reservoir holds a lot of water and can do a thorough clean.  The Interplak has seven different adjustable settings for pressure control and a lot of attachments (there also a storage unit for each tool) and even comes with a gum massager and tongue scraper (I like this tool better than using my toothbrush).  The Interplak is fun to use and an effective dental instrument, but make sure you have enough space in your bathroom before purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> The sonic vibrator works very well, as does the whole unit.  I use it with undiluted Listerine, and use the gingivitis tip (wish they would provide more than just one in the package).  The adjuster knob provides a good range of jet strengths.  I just fill up the large tank, which lasts a long time.  The O ring seal at the bottom of the tank has not leaked while sitting full of Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water pics have definiely reduced my pocketr depths over the years, from some 6&#x27;s down to 2-3mm.</li>
    <li> I ordered one then swapped it for another. Both of them leaked out onto the counter, cabinet and floor. Finally returned last one for refund.</li>
    <li> a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; loud, but works perfectly</li>
    <li> I so badly wanted my review for the Sonic Water Jet to be positive that I&#x27;ve put off writing one for a while.  First, I found the instructions not describing the interchangeable heads adequately, but it&#x27;s not rocket science and I figured them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought the little drawer located at the bottom of the unit was a clever place to store the interchangeable heads, but after real-life use it&#x27;s just too small.  Sure they all fit in there perfectly when you take your time and line them up properly, but when you&#x27;re getting ready in the morning you want to be able to throw the head in and shut the little drawer.  Not so easy.  The drawer jams and you end up having to take your time to neatly align all the heads so the drawer slides in all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint is the cord that attaches the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; to the actual water tank unit.  It&#x27;s so coiled up that it gets in the way when you&#x27;re done and want to replace it in the \\&quot;cup holder\\&quot; type thing.  It reminds me of a cup holder, but of course, no cup can fit in that space.  I thought that after a couple weeks use the cord would slowly straighten out, but it&#x27;s just not the type of cord to do that.  It&#x27;s coiled in such a manner that it wants to fit into the compartment backwards so you have to use 2 hands: 1 to hold the cord out of the way and the other to rotate the handle so that you can get it in straight.  Again, not very user friendly when you want something quick and easy during your morning rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally the interchangeable heads: it only comes with 2 \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; heads.  One of which has a red dot and the other one with no dot in order to differentiate between which one is which.  I wish they both had a dot (different colors, of course) and I wish there were 4 heads.  I could buy a replacement heads pack for $8.99 (according to the user manual) but I don&#x27;t want all the other heads in duplicate.  The tongue cleaner is really odd.  It sort of makes sense that there&#x27;s a water spraying function to go with it, but when you use the heads that are multi-use (i.e. you can spray water while performing another function, like tongue cleaning) water gets EVERYWHERE and usually bounces back out of the mouth and onto the mirror in front of you and on the counter space all around the sink.  It&#x27;s just so messy, even with the water spraying on its lowest setting!  So much for quick and efficient because you have to clean up your counter space and mirror when you&#x27;re done with the whole system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we just use the toothbrush head and when we use the other heads we just don&#x27;t spray the water.  I could have just gotten a plain old electric toothbrush because we&#x27;ve ceased using the water storage unit altogether.it, but when you use the heads that are multi-use (i.e. you can spray water while performing another function, like tongue cleaning) water gets EVERYWHERE and usually bounces back out of the mouth and onto the mirror in front of you and on the counter space all around the sink.

    <li> This item is easy to set up. Yet you get way more set up instructions than use instructions, honestly.  That&#x27;s the real weakness of this product as a reviewer. I know most of us skip manuals anyway, but sometimes, it&#x27;s nice to have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things: if there&#x27;s water in the tank, the attachment will leak unless it&#x27;s set upright in its little holder. So if you put it down for a second to do something else, like get a new tube of toothpaste, even if the machine&#x27;s not turned on, you will get leaking. It&#x27;s not broken, but, yeah, be prepared for that. Also, and I base this on my friend&#x27;s experience, which actually was pretty funny in a Lucille Ball way, uh, how do I put this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing should be in your mouth before you turn it on and after you turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say that otherwise?  Prepare to get shot in the face. *giggle*.  If it happened to him, I&#x27;m pretty sure it could happen to someone else out there, so, fair warning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use, once you figure the above out! :P  And gives a really good cleaning.  Really, you feel like you&#x27;ve just come from a dentist, but without the dental hygenist&#x27;s lecture. My own gums tend to bleed a lot with a traditional brush, but, for some reason, when I use this, my gums barely bleed at all. And trust me, it&#x27;s not from lack of water pressure!  It&#x27;s also waaaaay easier using this device to really clean the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a fantastic product. Maybe not for kids (I could so see my sister and I having waterfights with this!) but it does its job, does it well and is far superior than your usual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I suffer from gum disease so my dentist suggested that I get a product like this , I decided to get this one since my husband has the model a step down from this and really likes it.  There are parts I like about this water jet system and other parts that I don&#x27;t.  The instructions are very basic and could have been a bit more detailed for a better first time user experience. As it was I had my husband help to set it up and tell me how to best use it.  I really like the little drawer that it has to put all your utentsils in when you are not using them.  I like that I can put a little bit of mouth wash in with the water and that you can brush your teeth and have mouth wash all at once.  I like the sonic brushing part but I feel I get a better brushing by just using my regular motorized toothbrush.  It is a bit awkward turning the system on and off to control the flow of water and how much you want.  It can be very messy , the first couple of times I used it the water got everywhere. I do like the water jet tip for getting a really good flossing and I will be using the other tips more often in the future (I have only used each of them once so far).  So I will sticking to my regular toothbrush for brushing my teeth but using this for getting them really clean.</li>
    <li> not a good product. After three days of use the tips keep popping out of the handle. Had it replaced and the second one did the same thing.</li>
    <li> I had a recent visit to the dentist and they recommended that I start using a water jet. I seen this one and I couldn&#x27;t resist. This is the first one that I have ever used. The first thing I noticed is a ton of attachments; brush tips, soft gum massager, water jet, subgingival, and tongue cleaner. I was very over whelmed, especially since I all ready have an electric toothbrush. I will admit that I was a little lost with the sparse instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using it, there seemed to be a lot of pressure and my gums were sore for the first couple uses. I also managed to get more water all over than in my mouth. But after using it a couple times, I managed to not soak everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I don&#x27;t really like flossing so this worked great for me. I didn&#x27;t really use the other attachments. If there were a version just with the water tip I think it would be a big seller. Over all, I really liked the Interplak. It works well, once you get the hang of it. My mouth felt super clean when I was done. If you are looking for a water flosser, go with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Kovacich&lt;br /&gt;Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.</li>
    <li> 1) the variety of accessories really covers the gamut of dental cleaning needs.  Whether you&#x27;ll use them all is up to you, but they certainly have you covered with a water pik, brushes, massager, tongue cleaner, and an under the gums tip.  2) In water jet mode, it is loud.  Not hurt-your-ears loud, but won&#x27;t-be-hearing-your-significant-other-talking-to-you loud.  Whether this is a problem depends I&#x27;d say on the proximity of your bathroom to anybody trying to sleep  3) It has a relatively big footprint for a bathroom device. If you don&#x27;t have much counter space, that may be an issue.  It isn&#x27;t all that wide--a few inches--but it is pretty long and tall.    4) The reservoir holds a lot of water.  So you never run out using it, but personally I&#x27;d have preferred a smaller footprint and just refilling it if I needed to.   5) It has variable pressure control, but to be honest, I&#x27;d call it minimum, medium, and strong--can&#x27;t really tell much difference between settings otherwise.  That said, the strong does give good pressure and that&#x27;s what I just leave it on; the lower pressures just don&#x27;t feel like they do much, but someone with sensitive gums may prefer them.  6) The sonic pulsing is decent. I actually have a separate one, a waterpik sensonic, which I prefer--it feels like it brushes at a faster rate and cleans better (I have no actual evidence of that--it just feels that that way).  But this one does a decent job.  I usually alternate days between them and just use the sonic toothbrush at night.  7) You can use the sonic pulse at the same time as the water jet, which I like and which feels really cleansing, but fair warning. You can \\&quot;pause\\&quot; the water jet in order to spit by pushing a button on the brush--you really, really need to PUSH and HOLD it.  If you do it casually or partially, you&#x27;ll spray everywhere.  Be prepared to get wet your first time or two as it really is surprising how hard and fully you need to press it.  All in all, I&#x27;m quite happy with it. It certainly leaves your mouth feeling clean and feels like it does an easier and better job of cleaning between teeth and in the back of your mouth. The sonic is a solid extra, though as mentioned, I prefer my stand-alone sonic. The under the gums is a nice accessory.  Recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help correct a problem I was having with a permanent bridge. I was unable to thoroughly clean under the bridge (even with special floss designed for this purpose) and as a result, my gums were swollen and had developed pockets of infection. Aside from the discomfort, my dentist told me that if I did not correct the problem, I was probably going to need a specialist to help save my teeth. I saw this product on Amazon and thought I would give it a try. After a couple of weeks, my gums were back to normal again. I just visited my dentist last week and she told me that my gums are fine, no signs of infection and that I would not have to go to a specialist! I credit it all to the Interplak Sonic Water Jet. It&#x27;s easy to use and really does the job. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> packed well ...good product</li>
    <li> I bought an older version of an Interplak unit 5 years ago and I always ran out of water. I would have to say to new larger/more powerful version works for me and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Is really great ....works great cleaning around braces... Would recommend it ...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud and the tooth brush is very small and a bit awkward to use , I&#x27;m going to give it a month or so and if it&#x27;s still not right I may have to switch back to water pic</li>
    <li> too big stuff, not convience to bring it in travelling!  and actually I dont think is good for my tooth.</li>
    <li> The water pressure is not as strong as my last one &amp; the design is not at all practical.  The water tank falls off so easy.  The first week it fell to the floor &amp; the top broke off.  The buttons are in a bad place.  Every time I grab it to move it I hit the on button &amp; it shoots water all over the place.  I&#x27;m still using it but hoping it dies soon so I can get a different one.</li>
    <li> I have never used a system like this before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, and I did make a mess the first time (unexpected spraying... which only happened once). But once I got used to it, it was easy to use. This is a great dental hygiene aid.</li>
    <li> I like this thing LOL makes my mouth feel so fresh and with luck it will help with \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; or at least I&#x27;ll be able to rinse my mouth often and keep the teeth clean and moist. When I was given this to try I hoped it would be helpful and it has been.  It has taken me a few weeks to get the hang of it--for some reason I kept spraying my face with it LOL  Thank you for the opportunity to try!</li>
    <li> cheap construction, the hose came apart from pick after a couple uses.....I wasted my money</li>
    <li> Performs pretty much as expected except for the water pressure. Even at the highest setting, the pressure does not get high enough for a thorough cleaning. The sonic option appears to be a gimmick and doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> Just great, very powerful. Just the right size for our sink, doesn&#x27;t take up much space. Hope it last as long as my first,( was Conair Interplak Classic Dental Waterjet, which still ok, but the presser is done.)  This one I will buy again. Now update, had now for 1 and 3 months, and it&#x27;s done. I was hoping would make it til March when I get my braces out, which would of been great, that why i really needed for. I would if just, buy after later. My husband hated it. Lol This one is good for if you just want to have one, to use once in a while. If you want one for long run, pay a little more. All and all it was ok.</li>
    <li> The Interplak Sonic water Jet provides a lot of uses to do a wide range of teeth, gum, even tounge cleaning. The unit has two main pieces, a large water basin and the cleaning tool where various types of heads are available to be put in. The cleaning tool has two buttons, a &#x27;sonic&#x27; button and a pause button. The sonic button gives you an agitating motion while using any of the cleaning attachments. There is also a variable pressure switch on the main unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning tool has its own battery power source and can be used indepently of the water jet itself. For instance if you want to use the gum cleaner, you put that unit in and use the &#x27;sonic&#x27; button to clean your gums in a &#x27;massaging&#x27; action. I do not know how much good this is doing me, but this is the second most common tool I use after the basic pik head. It does leave my gums feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the &#x27;water jet&#x27; tip the most frequently. I also use the highest pressure. It has definitely removed debris that brushing has not gotten, especially between some of my close together teeth. I have had other waterpiks in the past and I like this one the best. Esepcially the pause feature. When I use waterpiks there is a copious amount of water in my mouth. The pause feature lets me spit this out without spraying water everywhere and then resume cleaning. You do get 2 full brush heads. I tried them and they worked ok. Not better than my Oral B. I would expect most people who order this to already have an electric toothbrush, but if you didn&#x27;t you could use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of different attachments but you get nothing to hold them, you will have to find a container for them. A small but annoying product choice. On the plus side, I like the large water tank. I can use the water jet, do a gum cleaning, and then my wife can do both as well. All without having the tank go empty. I am impressed by the unit. For the price point, you get a lot of cleaning options, good design, and something that works well, and has helped me supplement brush cleaning nicely. Recommended.ed me supplement brush cleaning nicely. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Needs some time getting use to using water pick sprayed the mirror on more than one occasion</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my son&#x27;s birthday.  He used all the attachments and told me,&amp;#34;I feel like my gums are breathing for the first time every!&amp;#34;  I am so happy I got this item.  It was reasonably priced and it has a lid.  That is important.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this unit and the accessories work very well. I like the Sonic Tooth Brush with Water Pressure. This Interplak Oral Care does an excellent job on my teeth and gums. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel real clean after using this water pic. I especially like the gum massager and the gingivitis tip.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2PO396AJO1GJ3]]Really good product, with convenient storage for the tools.  Reservoir lasts a long time.  You can also add mouthwash to the water, which tends to create some foam.  Overall effective.  It&#x27;s a little noisy to run in the early morning, and it&#x27;s always difficult to control splash with these things.  Other than that, a very good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Your dentist--and particularly, your dental hygienist--will thank you for using the Interplak SWj1 Sonic Water Jet.  The Jet system allows cleaning in places your normal toothbrush--even an automatic one--misses.  In addition to the pulsating water tips, the system includes brushes, a gum massager and a tongue cleaner, all of which gets your mouth about as clean as you can get it this side of a dentist&#x27;s chair.  Anyone with the beginning of or a history of gum disease should get and use a Water Jet daily; it may keep you out of the periodontist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this Water Jet system is that the larger tank, designed for fewer refills, is a little bulky.  No problem for those with big expansive bathroom counters, but a possible space hog for anyone with pedestal sinks.  Even so, the Interplak All-In-One Sonic Water Jet System is a great addition to fighting the good fight against a gunky mouth.</li>
    <li> just got braces and brushing and flossing is a task love it used it twice the first day lol easy to use mouth feels very clean</li>
    <li> I already broke the lid off.  It is flimsy but so was the Waterpik I purchased from a local store.  Okay so the lid is not attached but it still fits perfectly over the top and this one was my fault on the Waterpik my bird flew into it and broke that one - long story.  It would be great to get one of these units with a lid that comes on and off that doesn&#x27;t cost $100 but back to this unit.  My teeth like to get stains around my gum line.  This has been solved by using the Sonic Water Jet about 30 minutes after drinking my last cup of coffee for the day.  My dental hygienist complimented my oral hygiene, which is a first, so shall this be contributed to the Swj 1?  It probably helps but so does flossing and brushing :)  For the price it seems to be doing its job.  If the price was right I&#x27;d buy it again but would really prefer having one with a removable lid so I can&#x27;t break it which seems like I have a knack for doing.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t particularly interested in anything but the simple water jet, and this product works great in that respect.  To be honest, we just needed something to help get the food out of braces and brackets in the kids&#x27; mouths.  I guess this would be considered &#x27;jet flossing.&#x27; Some of the other products ended up just ceasing to function after a couple of months, or the reservoirs&#x27; seals began to leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the seals on this one are holding, and it is doing its intended job nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;* Adequate capacity to handle at least two kids without requiring a refill -- as they&#x27;ve gotten better at using it, we can probably get 3-4 sessions from a full tank of water.&lt;br /&gt;* Compact design means it can sit on the counter in a small bathroom&lt;br /&gt;* Convenient storage drawer in the base for extra tips&lt;br /&gt;* Simple dial control for adjusting water pressure&lt;br /&gt;* It includes several different types of tips&lt;br /&gt;* Simple to use&lt;br /&gt;* The kids enjoy using it and it gets their mouths much cleaner than brushing alone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;* The coil in the cord is pretty tight. As the tank empties the device becomes lighter, it is fairly simple to pull it off the counter if you&#x27;re not aware. (I&#x27;ve got younger kids using this and tend to supervise them while they&#x27;re using it -- this is something to watch for, in addition to the &#x27;squirt gun&#x27; factor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t use the brushing, massaging, or vibration features, so I can&#x27;t comment on those, but it is good to understand that the brush handle uses batteries to provide the vibration functionality -- they&#x27;re included, but separate from the plug-provided power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips are Interplak standard tips and available pretty inexpensively on Amazon [[ASIN:B00511M6IW Interplak Replacement Attachments for SWJ1 Sonic All-in-one Water Jet System]] or elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I love the variance in the water pressure but the brushes are very soft. I&#x27;d prefer a firmer brush. The vibration device really is effective. What you can&#x27;t see is a nifty little tray - right there under the blue buttons - which conveniently store all the other picks and brushes. I love it.</li>
    <li> This water jet was not as great of ones I have used in the past.  The wands that insert into the handle would always &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off on the higher pressure settings.  And of course when it did water would flood the handle and comes out everywhere.  One thing I did not like was the design on the pause button.  You must continuously apply pressure to keep water from coming out.  Unlike other similar products that have a switch on the handle, if you let off the pressure just a little bit water will go flying.</li>
    <li> Efficient Excellent after meal rinses</li>
    <li> this unit replaces my panosonic water pick which had a frayed hose leak after 3 yrs of extensive use 2-3 x&#x27;s a day.&lt;br /&gt;the interplak is much more noisy than the panosonic, almost to the point of annoyance as the sound gets louder as it empties.&lt;br /&gt;the handle/brush stem  is shorter than than standard size. it would be a draw back if you have large hands as more of the handle needs to enter your mouth for back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;the appearance is clean, however the reservoir top is attached which means you need extra space to flip the top open and back. otherwise you&#x27;ll need to place it under the faucet to fill and hand dry it to avoid bacteria.&lt;br /&gt; the push button on/off needs allot of push to turn on which causes the unit to slide. i use a gripper under it. it&#x27;s backed to a wall so it is stead fast to push on. and i need to  hold the top reservoir in place as  there is no snap connection to the base. it only rests in place with the connector. if nudged or jarred the top easily dislodges from the unit regardless if it is filled or empty.&lt;br /&gt;the pulser button located on the handle works independently of the pump. its best to turn the pulsar on first, have the spray face down to the sink, then turn the pump on. otherwise water jets around which always hits the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;the pulse feels good on the gums and i always use the brush spout to help remove debris.&lt;br /&gt;the pulse is an excellent feature but the unit requires allot of attention to function neatly.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd of these we have purchased.  Yes, eventually, they wear out (buttons stop working, but it is great for getting the job done!</li>
    <li> I read reviews about this and one said that it leaked. It had other features I really liked--a push button for easy on and off, brush tips, a good selection of water pressures, a drawer for the tips. So I decided to keep it, hoping it wouldn&#x27;t leak for me. It leaked and continues to leak until my new Waterpik arrives. I am sorry to have to junk this--it had so much going for it. But the leaking makes it unacceptable.</li>
    <li> cord could be longer and so could the brush handle</li>
    <li> Brought  first. For. Daughter,  She. Was very pleased, so another. Has been. Ordered. For. A grandchild.</li>
    <li> I have recently bought the product for Auckland New zealand. I have tried many times to switch it on it but does not work at all. I have contacted the company regarding a replacement or repair but have not heard anything back from them yet.</li>
    <li> Very loud and very small. Tips over easy</li>
    <li> This thing was incredibly loud and lasted half the amount of time that a waterpik lasted.  Do yourself a favor and shop directly from the WaterPik site, the markup at Amazon is too high.</li>
    <li> works better than i expected.</li>
    <li> This product does not have the power that Water Pic has. There is not enough jet force to get between the teeth. I&#x27;m disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend whose old model broke after many years and she loves it! She said that she was even glad her old one broke so she could get this one. She especially likes the toothbrush feature. It looks great on her counter too and has convenient storage for all the parts. This has all the bells and whistles! Recommend this to anyone who loves this kind of tooth care.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely loud but it&#x27;s a cheaper unit than I&#x27;ve been using with Water Pik so that&#x27;s okay.  The reservoir comes off easier than the Water Pik brand.  I hope to get much longer life.  My last Water Pik died after a year.  That is nuts.  I like that this Interplak brand has a hinged top, IOW, one piece.  The attachments fit into a cute little drawer under the controls.  (EDTIED TO SAY THAT THE HINGED TOP CRACKED OFF AFTER DROPPING THE WATER RESERVOIR ONCE.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; feature is a load of crap.  It does nothing except make more noise.  The water doesn&#x27;t pulsate any different.  It&#x27;s a total joke.  The water pressure started decreasing after 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited on 3-20-14:  it died and is now in the recycling box.  I will now most likely buy the Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser for $80 but with a 3-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY, FOLKS!!</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully, is quiet, and the setting I have chosen is neither too strong which risks damage to fillings nor too weak which would make it ineffective.  It is considerably less expensive than its main competion and looks good on my counter.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  I have been to several local discount stores and was unable to find this. I did find it at a drug store chain but didn&#x27;t want to pay what they were selling it for.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped fast. Works well. Compact for the sink. Has lots of power.&lt;br /&gt;hoping less trips to the dentist.</li>
    <li> It was great, cleaned out debris I never knew I had and then the first problem... the top snapped off.  I could fix it by just setting it down but it was an inconvenience and I was also thinking a sanitary hazard.  Then came the worst part- the sonic button has stopped working so there is no more thrust than a regular water jet.  Very disappointing and I know the company isn&#x27;t going to do anything about it because I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months.  Was it great?  Yes-  Would I buy it again?  No; with those kinds of problems after only limited use, it might be best to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Lasted 2 weeks and since I live outside the USA and I have to return the item  to get a refund and it would cost as much to return it as I paid for it I just had to accept the loss. Now I have to buy a new one and would not buy this brand again</li>
    <li> Had a waterpik flosser for 4 days until it decided to stop working.  The interplak works really well and also has the sonic feature.  Seems to do a great job of cleaning out those deep pockets.</li>
    <li> This one is so much better than my old one by the same manufacturer. I would recommend to anyone. Thanks</li>
    <li> This review is after conceding that the first one I bought may have been a defect. Well, the first one lasted about 3 weeks and I was able to return it.  The second one just  broke in exactly the same way as the first, but it took 6 weeks for it to happen this time!  I am stuck with a worthless piece of cheap plastic.  I have had an older model of Interplak , years past, and it performed beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product. The design is fatally flawed - during very normal (and I must say gentle use after the first failure) the supply hose disconnects from the handle and the little sucker quits working!  Two trys, two failures. Maybe I can use it as a tank for Siamese fish . . .</li>
    <li> We have used the Interplak All-In-One Sonic Water Jet System by Conair for about six months now and feel we can give our opinion on it.  Although it works ok, it doesn&#x27;t have as much force as other water picks we have tried.  In fact, my wife ended up buying a different water pick because she didn&#x27;t think there was enough water pressure with this one.  Overall, I would consider this a \\&quot;starter\\&quot; type of product and the quality is not as high as it could be.  The cover ended up getting a nice crack in it (not sure how).  The crack doesn&#x27;t affect the use, but it does affect the appearance.  This product is also louder than the other two water picks we have tried.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works, but it didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations we had because the products we tired before and after this one were much better.</li>
    <li> Was delivered quickly and intact. Has a good selection of attachments. Jet works well and is adjustable. Love that clean feeling in my mouth after using it, and my dental hygenist really recommends using it.</li>
    <li> I got 2 kids in braces and it works well.  It is not as expensive as the water pic brand but it does the job just as well.</li>
    <li> Design is not wonderful, hose is always tangled and in the way.  The plastic feels weak.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always dealt with bleeding gums and bad breath since I&#x27;ve been&lt;br /&gt;reading this novel my gums actually healed up. I really like using&lt;br /&gt;this product it makes my teeth feel clean and fresh. I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product to anyone with bleeding gums.</li>
    <li> Money very well spent. Works great for my teeth.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the performance of this Interplak.  Highly recommend this Water Jet, works much better than the other brand</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to this product because I used one of these when I was a kid (about 25 years ago) and I had good memories of how it worked and cleaned my teeth and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used it and memories came back as to why we stopped using it 24 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It makes an incredible mess.  Water goes everywhere.  On the sink.  In the sink.  On the mirror.  On the floor.  There is no controlling it.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The water cord that attached the brush/pik to the tank is cumbersome.  Think of the old days of telephones that were attached by cords to the wall and you will get my idea.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The tooth brush assembly (there are two... for two partners in the bathroom) are very small.  The brushing surface is about 1/2 an inch.  Not like the toothbrush that I am used to using.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The water pik is just not as effective as a normal piece of floss.  I have a tooth that has a crown, and sometimes when I eat meat, I have incredible irritation until I am able to floss.  This pic did not help.  After water was all over the bathroom, I resorted back to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I will be tossing this in the trash.  I feel bad because it was free through the Vine Program, but I can&#x27;t really offer it for someone else to have since it&#x27;s been used for a month.... that would be a bit gross.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes included, makes your mouth feel like you just left the dentist office after you got your teeth cleaned! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The water line  has not clogged up. The other manufacturer&#x27;s products water lines clog. However, this might be because I have stopped leaving water in the reservoir between use. Nevertheless, I never had the cloging problem with the older Water Pik line produced by Water Pik. Interplak is not the same company as Water Pik. I like the lid which keeps things from falling into it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and looks good enough to leave sitting out on bathroom vanity.  Wow on all counts for us.</li>
    <li> I bout this mainly for the water pick and I&#x27;m fairly satisfied with that. I have a sonicare toothbrush that I prefer over the one on this kit, but others may like it OK. The gum cleaner is a plus and has actually improved my gums noticeably. I didn&#x27;t care for the tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> This works good, its made kinda cheap tho, its not sturdy.</li>
    <li> Good product. It has definitely helped with our gums. I was having gum problems after I had a wisdom tooth removed. I tried several things before I tried this. I purchased this from Amazon at a decent price. When I use it I put warm water and then mix in salt, mouth wash and some hydrogen peroxide into the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;I can get well below the gum line and kill the bacteria reside in hidden pockets. Within 1 week of using this my gum issues cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;It is made a little cheaply though. The plastic cover over the reservoir broke in 2 days but it does not affect the use of the device.</li>
    <li> My only problem is the hole in the bottom. I wish I could just pull the blue thing off and fill it up. but you have to hold the whole thing in order to put water in it. Plus it leaks a lot. Also, i wish the electrical cord was longer but other than that it is a great.</li>
    <li> I did not order the water pic because this one had more stuff with it. It is ok. I am thankful to have one.</li>
    <li> Perfect, cost effective, multi purpose irrigation system.Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price or function. As a dental professional I would have no problem recommending this model over some of the higher dollar models.</li>
    <li> My last rating of this model was &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Okay.&amp;#34; The update is that they last about 1 year. Production is faulted as evidenced by the wide variety of flaws. The most annoying flaw to date has been the on-off switch. More on that in a moment. My second most annoying flaw is that the nozzles on some machines are able to spin around, making aiming them useless. For aesthetic reasons, I returned one that had a pinkish colored wand that stood out against the base. See that alerted me to the fact that they all have some degree of pinkish coloration in the wand. Some more so than others. Back to the most annoying flaw: The on-of switch works poorly if at all. Turning it off is the problem. While holding the squirting wand in one hand, ones other hand must push the power button to turn it off. If the wand is left free, it will spray wildly about like a free garden hose on full blast. HINT: To turn this machine off after it reaches the stage of being difficult, first touch the power button lightly but with enough force to hear a click. One would expect the thing to turn off, but not yet. Then lightly push the switch again and it just might turn off. I returned two of these as faulty and am going to stick with the faulty one I know how to control. Its lid has fallen off and it is difficult to turn off, but I love it.  (NOT) But I am going to keep it until it finally refuses to turn off, and then I will buy from a different manufacturer. Armed with the knowledge that everything is made in China, I have extremely low expectations for all manufacturing. To be fair, the design of this machine is flawed by using an inappropriate power switch. Not sure who gets the blame of the other faults. But that would take inside info I don&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> Compared to the old one I still have, here are my complaints:  1)  it&#x27;s much noisier; 2) the water doesn&#x27;t come through sometimes and I have to play around with the knob; 3)  the pressure is much less; 4) the container itself is bigger but flimsier.</li>
    <li> This water pick does the job. It was affordable and has a couple of pressure settings to choose from, however I keep it on high all the time. The sonic pulse setting is good for the toothbrush attachment.  I also like the tongue attachment it comes with. It is still working great after 3 months of use.</li>
    <li> This is the worst waterpik I ever had. With either of the  nozzles, the stream is so tiny, that it&#x27;s not even worth doing. I am not using it anymore. Should have returned it right away.</li>
    <li> Works well and having a lid makes it  really  easy to store. The little storage drawer is very practical.  Great.</li>
    <li> water reservoir holds adequate supply&lt;br /&gt;combination of sonic and water pic actions is excellent feature&lt;br /&gt;best product in this line of dental devices I have used</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  My first purchase of this unit lasted less than one year, but the company replaced it with no problems.  The second unit lasted just a little over a year.  I accidentally hit the pulse button and the water went crazy coming out o the bottom of the wand.  I did not bother to try to replace it.  I purchased a new brand and hope it works longer.  At first attempt it works as well if not better and offers a few details improved over this unit, in my opinion. FIRST REVIEW:  I&#x27;ve used a Conair Interplak for so many years I don&#x27;t even remember buying the old one that finally lost its pressure.  This one is an upgrade due to a press &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button and the ability to stop the stream with a button on the wand.  I don&#x27;t use the pulse, so I can&#x27;t evaluate that.  I have not tried the toothbrush attachments.  I pretty much use just the single stream attachment.  Over the many years of use, I&#x27;ve had lots of positive feedback from my dental technician and the dentist.  If you&#x27;ve never used a water flosser before, this is an economic version that works great and gives just the right amount of pressure at full force.  I don&#x27;t know what a higher pressure would do, but the pressure on this unit is satisfactory and obviously does a great job.</li>
    <li> This works well, but is very loud!! It is high powered and will get anything between your teeth out. I don&#x27;t recommend turning the pressure all the way up as it can hurt, especially if you have sensitive teeth.  Overall very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Got it for my dad and he loves it. Really cleans your teeth and the adjustable pressure makes it usable between the whole family.</li>
    <li> the tubing from pump to handle vibrates to the point that it rubs a hole in tubing. it has not happened to current unit yet, but it did on a previous unit i bought.</li>
    <li> I recommend this item to anyone needing the extra cleaning ability this product provides. I am very pleased with this purchase and the price  was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Just good enough nothing special</li>
    <li> If this one lasts as long as my previous one, it would be great. The pump lasted longer than its competition by far.  What gave it up was the white line hose between the body and the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one is considerably larger than the last one I purchased and the amount of water it holds could pressure wash your house, way more than is needed to do the job.  It comes with a variety of different heads for different uses, but the one most used will probably be the standard jet that clears out junk between your fangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration feature is nice also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars only because I liked the old one so much and found this one to be just slightly overkill but I would recommend it to anyone who asked.</li>
    <li> Plastic breaks easy...</li>
    <li> this item is defective after 30 days using it I want to replace it with one that does not leak</li>
    <li> the nozzle (tip) is so tightly fit in the handle that to change to another is like fighting it... b/c the tips are slippery. Then, after 1 month of usage the stupid handle starts to leak water after use!!! Horrible product. Water pressure is ok, and good, but otherwise it belongs in the trash bin...</li>
    <li> I used to have the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable which did okay until I dropped it and killed it.  I was looking for a compact water flosser to replace it, and this one is so far great!  It has a lot more power than the cordless one (I would have been superbly disappointed if it didn&#x27;t), and it&#x27;s nice to not have to keep refilling it for a single use.  The Conair Interplak comes with a bunch of attachments which I probably won&#x27;t use, but it&#x27;s good to have options I guess.  The unit itself feels a little cheap and lightweight--if it wasn&#x27;t for the water in the reservoir, I feel like it would tip over.  There is a little drawer on the bottom of the unit that is for storing the other attachment heads.  I feel like if I was constantly interchanging the heads though, the drawer would get pretty gross with all the moisture.  I used the toothbrush attachment, but the bristle head was really tiny.  The sonic feature is cool, but I could only see using it for the toothbrush, which I don&#x27;t use.  Basically though, for the price of this, you get a product that works and looks decent on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> It works well enough but tends to be on the loud side. If my husband uses it while I&#x27;m asleep it wakes me up.</li>
    <li> easy to use and I love it</li>
    <li> It was an improvement over the last model. I would recommend it. The only 2 problems for me were I felt its maximum spray could have been stronger and it only came with 1 tip for spraying water. 2 should be the minimum.</li>
    <li> The Interplak Swj1 Sonic Water Jet was a great price.  Waiting for my next dental appt to see how well it works but so far like it.</li>
    <li> It works but I do not like that  it always flows and you have to push a button to get it to stop flowing. Would be better if it was the other way around that you have to hit a button to turn it on. Also it is loud when it is running.</li>
    <li> the water res. cover is not good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as my dentist told me I had gum disease.  The toothbrush ( and I even ordered extra) didn&#x27;t fit right.  The waterpic attachments do and perform just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a short while and both of the toothbrush attachments  have broken. Now I have ordered another toothbrush from a different manufacturer which creates a lot of clutter on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> best water jet ever. I love it &amp; price was lowest ever. thank you amazon. you &amp; my new water jet enriched my life.</li>
    <li> I have used four different types of water jets, this by fare is the nice unit.  The holding tank is larger than most so doesn&#x27;t run out mid cleaning.  The lid is attached by hinge so cleaning is a bit more awkward but no biggie. I pour about 1oz of mouthwash intp a full tank and this helps with cleaning and freshening breath at same time.</li>
    <li> Okay so I had to get a water pik as recommended by my dentist.  This was the recommendation and it is working quite nicely for me.  It&#x27;s not particularly something I want to do, but a necessity, and love the results.</li>
    <li> I have my jaw wired shut and can not brush the inside of my teeth, this thing is a life saver!</li>
    <li> I confess that I bought this as I freaked out about an upcoming - and loooong overdue - dentist appointment.  I had a horrible experience at a dentist a few years ago, and although I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my teeth, I could tell that things are starting to detriorate (probably due to late night eating while pregnant and nursing, but I digress...).  I hate to floss, and I have sensitive gums that bleed and recede if I brush too enthusiastically.  So I read the reviews and took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first use, I could tell a difference.  I love my morning coffee, but I know it stains my teeth and leaves them &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; even after brushing.  Use this after coffee, and you will believe.  My teeth were - and are - smooth and clean.  A few problem areas are already feeling better.  I haven&#x27;t used all of the tools yet, but the brush and flosser are great.  I look forward to brushing (uhh...what?), and am really pleased with how this performs so far.  If it holds up over time, I will be thrilled.</li>
    <li> Works great. would recommend to anyone who has a hard time flossing.  I have a really crowded mouth and this allows me to floss now without an issue. It was recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> After trying other brands unsuccessfully (they were weak, more expensive and broke down early). The great idea was to combine power of flush with ultrasound action.</li>
    <li> my dentist recommended I use the water pic type cleansing. this one is one of the easiest I&#x27;ve ever bought, has many advantages over some of the other products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;as expected Amazon was fast in delivering the goods. its becoming my favorite way to shop.</li>
    <li> got it for two teenagers with braces and they use it which is saying something...a must have if you have braces</li>
    <li> excellent product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> It has a jet setting on hand pik to give an extra squirt when needed in and underneath my bridges.  It is much better tan the last water pick I bought. That one did not last long.  I hope this one lasts long.</li>
    <li> Having to hold down the button to keep water from spraying from the unit has become quite the difficult challenge. They could have made the button much easier to depress, but this thing you have to really apply some serious pressure if you want to keep the water off. The good news is that my forearm strength and my grip are getting a good workout, so one less thing to do at the gym.</li>
    <li> I bought this for one of my kids, who ust got braces. Works great and has many different tips to use, each with a different need. Works great to remove the debris in between the braces. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really gets my gums clean and all the debri stuck in between. I like to add a little capful of my favorite mouthwash to give me that minty, re-freshing feeling.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27; t know it was 110 volts instead 220 v.; all is broken now.&lt;br /&gt;Why 110? It&#x27;s 220 all over the world.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, worked well!  The lid was flimsy and broke right away, but it still served it&#x27;s purpose. It is a good value for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> In addition to the electric motor drive, the jet sprayer attachment, which is battery operated, works more efficiently than the larger Waterpic models. Hence, a veritable &#x27;sonic water jet&#x27; for better, deeper, and more efficient cleaning below the gum. Of course, it&#x27;s not on par with what one gets at the dentist office, but for daily periodontal maintenance in tandem with flossing and brushing it&#x27;s ideal. If this purchase proves effective in the long run (i.e., long-lasting), then so much the better.</li>
    <li> This is okay.  The jet stream is not as strong as the water pik product and the reservoir is not as large.</li>
    <li> An efficient  product.</li>
    <li> great advantage with the tooth brush attachment</li>
    <li> Affordable considering what else is available. Gives a very good pressure and comes with multiple heads (of which you&#x27;re probably going to use 1 or 2). Has a &amp;#34;vibrate&amp;#34; option which may or may not be providing added benefit. In any case, compared to the expensive water jets out there, this one surely holds its own.</li>
    <li> This product was affordable.  I use it everyday, and can&#x27;t say enough about what a good deal it is.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The Interplak water jet was a little getting used to but is a must have now.  I like the sonic function which seems to improve the overall effectiveness.  I didn&#x27;t give it a 6 star rating because there are a couple of things that could be improved.  1) The start/stop button is in a place that is difficult to avoid hitting when moving the unit out of the way.  I have had an extra surprise shower or two.  2) The handle doesn&#x27;t seem to support rotation when covering the inside of the teeth.  The shape makes it a little difficult to hold.  A rotational fitting for the tube would help as well as prevent the tube from cracking within a years time.  I would recommend the Interplak over the Waterpik product to anyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;Dennis</li>
    <li> Did I mention it&#x27;s noisy?  I&#x27;m very displeased with the vibration and noise produced by such a simple to make product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item on May 4th.  It was broken by July 6th - the water was no longer coming out of the pik.  What a poorly made machine.  Will be sticking to Waterpik brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the interplak the only complaint is it is quite noisy.</li>
    <li> Oh this is the best! Refreshing after I use it.</li>
    <li> I got this recently for my son to use with his new braces. He uses it and it really works in all those many different places food can now hide.  Good investment.</li>
    <li> I have used a waterpic unit for years and it finally died.  I saw this unit at about half the price and ordered it.  It works fine, but does not have the force of a waterpic unit. the supplementary untrasound vibration in the handle does not seem to do much except make sound.  I may be too critical and not adaptable to the unit, but I will go back to waterpic when this one dies.</li>
    <li> In one&#x27;s 60&#x27;s, just keeping your teeth can be a full-time job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I brush and floss carefully, my dental hygiene specialist recommended a water-jet device as well. That&#x27;s because the pits next to the teeth below the gums are not reachable when flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this particular model better than the Water-Pik (tm) units.  It&#x27;s easy to fill and has a good power-adjustment range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great for Sinus Irrigation too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: I love the Interplak all-in-one, and hope it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FEW CONCERNS OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED: more on sinuses further down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accidentally hitting power switch when picking it up. Yes, if you grab the left side. Solution: use both hands, especially right hand, gripping the wand and its dock, left hand under the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover hinge fragile: I can see that, but just be careful. It is more convenient than the last Waterpik, with kidney-shaped combined cover and tip storage. Hard to seat, easy to just drop into reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reservoir o-ring too loose. It&#x27;s easy to disconnect if you try to pick it up by the reservoir. O-ring does not leak, however, and to prevent that, I&#x27;ll just leave it in place, and pick up the whole unit for filling and emptying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip does not have a release button. Okay, but it seems the Waterpik lock has a way of letting go, tip flies across the room. So Interplak seems better on that account. And I don&#x27;t plan on swapping tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATERPIK HISTORY OF PROBLEMS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power switch failed, odd design. Rocker button is NOT the switch, but moves a lever inside, sliding switch, fragile. Solution: hot-wired it,  unplugging to turn off. Inconvenient, but it still works. Tube broke, hard to patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a new one, just in case. It just stopped. Took apart, switch seems to be working, so maybe hard water deposits in pump??? Hate to say it, but Waterpik seems to change designs, not for better reliability, but for lightness and cheapness of components, and, of course, higher purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INTERPLAK PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful cobalt blue reservoir, cute face that appears to wink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capacity is 3 cups, enough for floss and sinus irrigation with one fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better ergonomics on wand/tubing storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coiled tube is softer and more stretchy. Should be less likely to break as Waterpik often does. Also, tube enters the wand at a right angle, good design, less stress on tube at that critical point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pause button does not stick closed as latest Waterpik did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power switch feels very robust, but time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pressure Maximum may be less than Waterpik, but middle power setting is fine for me, both for flossing and sinus irrigation, no nose bleeds, no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not overly loud, but sonic function does add to the sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: at 39 bucks, heck of a deal, if it lasts. And the sonic function, switch on wand, is just icing on the cake. Does it work? Well, the wand buzzes, the tip buzzes if you touch your teeth with it, not a bad thing. I believe that the sonic energy is transferred to the water. It feels different when turned on. Tingles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SINUS IRRIGATION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE CHRONIC SINUS PROBLEMS, YOU NEED TO RESEARCH THIS. Most info will be referring to Waterpik, but applies to Interplak. You need an adapter, which can be bought, or just make one out of a disk of dense foam, poke a hole in the middle. Works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you believe that sonic energy will dissolve plaque, imagine what it will do to mucus accumulation. And you are giving the sinuses an intense, not unpleasant, massage. Can&#x27;t do that with a neti pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water comes out of opposite nostril, once sinuses are filled. Avoid swallowing by forming a Guh sound in the throat. Suck and blow with nose, and be appalled at what comes out. It&#x27;s really good, but does require practice. After the first couple of irrigations, I sneezed several times, tickled. That never happened with the Waterpik, so I conclude that the sonic energy is transmitted by the water, not just the hardware, or the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salt and baking soda in lukewarm water is the standard recipe, and that worries me regarding mineral buildup. Abrasion and wear? Baking soda has the lowest abrasive rating for tooth brushing, and there is a salt based tooth paste, almost as low, so perhaps wear on pump is not a concern if additives are fully dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan to prevent deposits is to irrigate/floss using tap water. Then empty reservoir, holding all components together, then pour in a few ounces of distilled water. Running for a few seconds produces &amp;#34;zero water,&amp;#34; TDS is zero, so I feel safe storing it with that water in the system. I.e., no dissolved solids to be deposited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you empty it completely after treatment, it may lose its &amp;#34;prime.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t correct that running at high speed, as the manual advises. Just put the wand down in the sink, let it drain. Or better yet, just suck on the tip until water comes through, then power on briefly at any speed, and you are primed to proceed with treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Flushing and feel free to ask questions of the review!st as low, so perhaps wear on pump is not a concern if additives are fully dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan to prevent deposits is to irrigate/floss using tap water.

    <li> feels cheap but it does work</li>
    <li> My new water jet functions well but I think the water tank seems to be loose. It would be nice if the tank had a more secure mounting.&lt;br /&gt;I have had great service from previous Conair products and expect to get the same from this unit.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like it messy and cheap made</li>
    <li> I have used a Waterpik for years and have been fighting gum pockets the whole time.  I floss and use a sonic toothbrush too.  The Waterpik kept the pockets from getting worse but didn&#x27;t really help.  Even getting my teeth cleaned 4 times a year didn&#x27;t help.  This wonderful little Water Jet fixed my gums in the three months between cleanings.  My dentist couldn&#x27;t believe it.  He had been trying to send me to the periodontist and suddenly Look Ma no pockets!  I use warm water for comfort and a touch of Listerine to give it a slight antiseptic property.  Last thing I do before I go to bed.  I&#x27;d give this thing 10 stars if I could!  There is a little battery in the handle that creates the sonic feeling and I was worried that it might need to be replaced too often but it lasts for several months.  These aren&#x27;t the most rugged devices so you have to be careful with them.  I dropped my first one.  This is a replacement.</li>
    <li> No good water leak under bottom &amp; broken on the cap .</li>
    <li> this item works really well, I only wish that the handle was operated with the unit and not battery powered,</li>
    <li> I bought it because I had another one before. So far it seems OK.  I like it very much, but I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is. My other one lasted only 2 years. Can I return it if it breaks in the near future?</li>
    <li> It is a bit noisy, but it sure does a great job of cleaning after flossing....I was amazed!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this water jet.  It is true it&#x27;s not overly powerful, but the highest setting works fine for me.  I like the large tank.  It gives me enough time to do a good job without refilling.  I really only use the water pik feature.  I tried the toothbrush once, it was okay but I prefer manual brushing.  I haven&#x27;t tried the massage feature yet. I like the sonic thing, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just bells and whistles but I like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Sonic aspect not clean as well as expected.  Works fine, though a bit noisy</li>
    <li> I did not realize that the unit would function on110 V AC only. I presumed for Australia would deliver a 220 V AC unit. Now I have to get a converter as well !</li>
    <li> WaterPik is better. This doesn&#x27;t have as much pressure as the previous mentioned. For some people that might be okay, but for me it does nothing. I do like the way it looks better than WaterPik&#x27;s choices though...However when it comes to my teeth&#x27;s health, I can&#x27;t  choose style over substance.</li>
    <li> It does the job and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for, great product.</li>
    <li> Terrible ; the device dose not even work !</li>
    <li> I had been using a WaterPik Ultra since the beginning of the year due to a diagnosis of periodontal disease.  The Waterpik has made an amazing difference in my oral health,(pink, healthy gums, less plaque, firmer teeth, etc.).  Unfortunately, the build quality of Waterpik&#x27;s devices aren&#x27;t the best and my unit decided to die after six months of regular usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to purchase another Waterpik but saw the Interplak listed on Amazon and placed my order. The sonic feature sounded intriguing and the price was a good bit cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Interplak arrived and I was excited to try it out.  That excitement, however, was short lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concerns started upon unpacking this unit.  There is a good assortment of tips but they are made of cheap, opaque plastic that push into the units handle,(compared to Waterpik&#x27;s clear tips that \\&quot;click\\&quot; firmly into place).  I was wondering how these would stay in place when the pressure from the water jet was initiated.  That question was soon answered...there is no pressure. The pressure on the Interplak, (when set on high), is equivalent to the 1-2 setting on the WaterPik Ultra.  There wasn&#x27;t enough pressure to remove food particles from between my teeth so I am sure it has minimal effects on plaque.  The high pressure of the Waterpik is necessary to remove harmful biofilm and has been well studied for efficacy and safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other issue with the Interplak is design.  The units power button is located on the lower front side of the base.  This was an issue for me due to the setup of my bathroom.  I do not have a lot of space around my sink and must store things away until use.  When I would pick the unit up to place on the sink I would inadvertently tap the power button and the unit would spray water everywhere when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water tank on this device, while large, also causes issues.  The Interplak will work until 2/3 of the water has emptied from the tank.  Once it reaches this level the pump will intermittently start and stop.  I realized this is due to the weight of the tank getting lighter as water empties from the device.  When there is minimal weight the tank isn&#x27;t heavy enough to set on the motor/pump and form a proper seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; feature feels nice but I feel it has little effect on dental health and is more of a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Interplak may be appropriate for children but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with serious dental needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Price&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; feature&lt;br /&gt;- Size of Water Tank&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Low Pressure&lt;br /&gt;- Design&lt;br /&gt;- Effectiveness of removing Biofilm and Plaque</li>
    <li> works well, like that it&#x27;s all in one. didn&#x27;t know I was getting a toothbrush also.</li>
    <li> The pressure didn&#x27;t seem as strong as other water piks I&#x27;ve used.  i will no more when I go to the dentist and see if my gums are in good shape.</li>
    <li> it arrived on tome as expected and will replace a very old but identical one. s for being soprompt thank</li>
    <li> The product has a good performance considering that the look and feel is a little bit cheap. It doesn&#x27;t include the power converter if you are outside USA.</li>
    <li> This actually surpised me with the power it has. I love that is all in one with a large tank. The storage drawer is also a plus!</li>
    <li> The tooth pick part of this was pretty helpful, but the rest is not.  Overall, it&#x27;s ok, but more of an inconvenience than a help.</li>
    <li> Sore gums from Implants, helping soooo much!!!</li>
    <li> It was everything I needed &amp; more.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it! And</li>
    <li> well it was ok for the first 4 months.  Then it just quit, the motor makes noise, but no water is being pumped...... It no longer works...  I expected better...</li>
    <li> Connection to base is good, cover works well, and product does an excellent job.  Takes a little time for jet stream to start, and just a little tricky trying  push start button and jet stream as well.  In my opinion, using a separate toothbrush is easier than switching to brush and back to pik.  All in all, this device is better, by far, than all previous Interplaks I have owned</li>
    <li> The water jet is very good for keeping my teeth healthy and strong. I have used one for years, this one has an interesting vibration the other one didn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> Based on initial use, the product works well and as-advertised.</li>
    <li> I previously owned an Interplak Water Jet, without the sonic function and a Water Pik before that. I had to throw both of them out&lt;br /&gt;because their very similar vinyl hoses cracked and leaked  - even though they were working fine.  This one has the same type of flimsy hose which cannot be repaired or changed. I expect this one to fail the same way.&lt;br /&gt;The design of this thing is not very well thought through and I doubt any of the designers actually tried to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The sonic function is just a little vibrator in the handle that works with a battery. The toothbrush attachment for this is too short&lt;br /&gt;and annoyingly does not lock in place but swivels around its axis.&lt;br /&gt;I also see no reason for having the water reservoir be that big. It makes the unit way too clunky.&lt;br /&gt;The water pressure at the highest setting is still not very strong - it&#x27;s probably just as well because the higher pressure would  shorten the life of the hose.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy this unit rather than a Waterpik brand unit but I shouldn&#x27;t have. I love it! The sonic vibrations paired with the jet cleans my teeth and gums better than they ever have been cleaned other than at the dentist. I use a whole reservoir of water each time I floss or brush (that is what my dentist recommended). I kept the water pressure dial turned about halfway for the first two weeks and then turned it up gradually over the next week or so until my gums got used to it. You could certainly cut through weak gums with the full pressure right off the bat. We have had the unit for several months now it it works as good today as it did when we bought it.</li>
    <li> The Sonic water jet works good and im well pleased with it .&lt;br /&gt;Earl Darnell. Mo.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed! I have a Waterpic brand and love it! This one is so cheap! The lid broke off right out of the box! It is loud, obnoxious and I hate it! Spend the extra few dollars and get a Waterpic!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this for a waterpik and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Says it works great and likes this brand, Interplak the best.</li>
    <li> It was fine to start with but the handle and nozzle began leaking badly after only three months of use. Not returnable to Amazon, but completely unusable.</li>
    <li> They have got smaller over the years, and this is by far the smallest I have seen them: but I wish it was smaller still as it is to some thing you can&#x27;t leave around, and storage can be an issue for any bathroom size.  However, the larger base does give the punch in a stronger engine to pump the water up and boy does it feel like a waterfall has just gone through your mouth.  The applicance comes with an assortment of extension for cleaning your mouth: my preference is the water jet contraption that washes between your teeth!  Even flossing couldn&#x27;t do such a great job!  my teeth felt really clean afterwards.  There is also a brush extension, which I used for cleaning the surface of the tongue, a little painful!  For such a large water capacity, at least I had a good clean without filling it up, which is something that I had to do with a portable gum washer (Panasonic brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job, but wish it was not so bulky for storage reasons.</li>
    <li> I have been using water jets to flosh my teeth after each meal for many years. This one is one of the best I have ever tried. It is very easy to use and cleans your teeth and gums very well. It also seems very sturdy and should last for a long time. I also like that it holds a lot of water so you can flos for as long as you want.</li>
    <li> I recently had my wisdom teeth removed, and was having a hard time keeping the sockets clean and free of food.  I received this Interplak unit and put it to the test.  It did a great job at what I needed: keeping the back of my mouth clean.  The flossing effect is pretty useful as well and helps keep my mouth feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:&lt;br /&gt;-Water pressure seemed fine for everything I would need, although competing brands appear to be a bit more powerful&lt;br /&gt;-Controls are fairly simple, and I figured them out without bothering to read the manual&lt;br /&gt;-The water effect is plug in rather than battery powered, which makes it more powerful and less of a hassle&lt;br /&gt;-Vibration requires an extra battery, and is an interesting effect with some of the attachments, making it a bit like the sonic toothbrush I use normally&lt;br /&gt;-It includes 6 attachments, 2 of which are toothbrush heads&lt;br /&gt;-Pause button is a bit hard to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a first time water jet user, I enjoyed this unit.  I would recommend it whether you are having dental work done, or want to do some daily flossing.</li>
    <li> I think the on and off switch will break easily it appears to stick</li>
    <li> small but powerful with the right tip</li>
    <li> Quality and priced well.</li>
    <li> Very hard to change picks.</li>
    <li> I bought Interplak Swj1 Sonic Water Jet for my mom. It is a very good product, very easy to use, for a good price. The only recommendation I could give is to modify the AC/DC adapter, so it could be used for 220 V. But for the rest it is great.</li>
    <li> I like it, the container you fill with water seems a little flimsy but no problems thus far.</li>
    <li> Received quickly, Looked great...But put water in it and left for about an hr. Come back and water is all over my counter. It was leaking from everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Return and won&#x27;t even think about getting another</li>
    <li> Using it almost every day and so far have not had any bad reviews to report. But should that happen I will edit this report later.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this it is weak</li>
    <li> Tubing broke in under a week. Now the pressure isn&#x27;t even strong enough to kill an ant.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended  works well fairly priced</li>
    <li> I like the the Conair Interplak, the jet setting is strong yet it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums. The drawer for the attachments is great, they are out of sight but easily available when needed. The tank is large enough so you don&#x27;t have to refill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an electric toothbrush owner/user for many years and I&#x27;d never go back to a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Conair Sonic All-In-One Water Jet system was a great addition to my daily oral cleaning. This system comes with 6 tools for cleaning and enhancing your oral care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonic water jet pic is the tool I use every day in addition to the toothbrush and I love it. It&#x27;s so easy to use. Just fill the tank with water, choose your tool and you&#x27;re good to go.There&#x27;s an added benefit to using the jet pic after you brush and floss, your mouth feels so clean! For people who need deeper cleaning due to dental issues..there&#x27;s instructions for the subgingival tip that is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are also included explaining in diagram how to use all the tools, jet tip, full size brush tip, gum massage tip, subgingival tip and tongue cleaner tip. There&#x27;s a storage draw to hold all of them on the system as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 2 year warranty on this product as well which seems pretty rare today.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after learning the relation of gum disease to general health. I cannot floss because it aggravate my gums and this has been huge improvement to my daily health routine. Easy to use, lots of attachments, and more effective than brushing, flossing, and gargling all put together!</li>
    <li> It came as promised. Works as described.</li>
    <li> So far I like this a lot.  It is a bit noisy but I can put up with it.</li>
    <li> No complaints!! Easy to use, maintain &amp; pleasant experience for your teeth.</li>
    <li> awesome works fantastic...</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll see how well it really works when I have my next dental appt.  My old one didn&#x27;t have an intensity control or sonic.  I see a lot more stuff coming out.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull device, works fine...</li>
    <li> I find great difficulty in correctly inserting the various tips.  I made a watery mess.  Not a good choice for elderly, weak gripping hands. Trouble trying to open the storage drawer as well.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to a friend who really enjoy this device</li>
    <li> It works well. The water pressure is good. It is easy to attach toothbrush water pick etc. I have no complaints. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product does as intended. It cleans your teeth!</li>
    <li> this works nicely but it is very flimsy in its construction and the hinge of the lid at the top, it breaks. one can still USE it but the plastic parts could be more durable.</li>
    <li> VERY noisy, but it works great</li>
    <li> My bottom line on this product - The brush apparatus is too short. I had to put up to both buttons on the handle into my mouth to reach my back teeth, and that was beyond awkward and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told that I have teeth like a shark by dentists because all my wisdom teeth came in straight enough to keep. I have to reach pretty far back to clean, which is why even the handle control buttons went into my mouth no matter which attachment I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have a cavernous mouth, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. ^_^</li>
    <li> I dropped the container to my old Interplak Water Jet one time too many and needed to replace it. I looked on-line and saw a slightly better-looking one by Interplak. It arrived and I tried it out right away. It may have a slightly less powerful pump but the maximum setting more than does the job I want it to do. It seems to work better than my old one and the \\&quot;ultrasonic\\&quot; feature is OK but not necessarily of great efficacy. I avoided buying a Waterpik because of previous problems with their longevity. My old Interplak worked flawlessly  for much longer, until I dropped the container! So far, I&#x27;m well pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great water pick for the price. I hate to floss.. The pressure is great..Easy to use..&lt;br /&gt;The vibrating toothbrush works awsome...</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly and it is very good, we are very happy with it. The price was very reasonable as well. Thanks.</li>
    <li> the water pick does not work properly.  I am returning it for credit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a traditionalist when it comes to brushing, but I have a hard time flossing because my molars are quite close together, and I have a number of crowns.  I worry about pulling one off (I&#x27;ve done it!) with my flosser.  So I haven&#x27;t  been as good about flossing as I should be.  And recently I paid for that with a tooth abscess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I couldn&#x27;t get in to see the endodontist for over a week, and because I wanted to blitz the heck out of the infected area to make sure it didn&#x27;t get worse while I was waiting, I finally decided to order a Water Jet.  I have friends who swear by them, but a combination of money being short, and that old, traditionalist streak that kept me from making the leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad I finally did it because I love this thing.  I don&#x27;t use the brushes, I really do prefer a low-tech toothbrush.  But the flossing tips are fantastic.  My gums haven&#x27;t been this healthy in ages!  And the abscess was much reduced when I finally got it treated.  I filled the water compartment with a mix of warm water and peroxide and gently cleansed the tooth several times a day.  Now that the problem has been taken care of, I add some mouthwash to the water to freshen while I clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the best I could afford, and it turned out very well for me.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I can&#x27;t really stop the water flow effectively while moving the jet into my mouth.  Yes, I actually have squirted myself in the face a couple of times.  You may laugh now.</li>
    <li> Very nice water pic... has several attachments, several levels and other features alot others don&#x27;t have... We have used it several months and would highly reccommend..even had a better dental visit after using it for a couple months...you can&#x27;t beat the  price for such a great product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD 3 OR 4 OF  APPLIANCES LIKE THIS ONE OVER 25 YEARS. I LIKE THIS ONE THE BEST SO FAR.. VERY NICE LOOKING ON THE COUNTER. GOOD PRESSURE. I LIKE TO MIX HALF AND HALF WITH MOUTH WASH SOLUTION, AFTER BRUSHING.  A GOOD BUY, WOULD RECCOMEND.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went most of my adult life without one of these!! I love it, and my mouth feels so clean after using it. One caution, the book says to use the perio-tool on the lowest setting. BE SURE to do that, or you will cut your gums.</li>
    <li> DOES THE JOB, FOOD IS DISLODGED AFTER ELECTRIC BRUSHING.  LITTLE NOISY. I PUT MOUTHWASH IN WATER AND GET 2 FOR 1. AFTER ONE YEAR STILL KICKING.MOTOR SOUNDS THE SAME.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a present and it has been put to great use. It is all in one so it does good.</li>
    <li> Product works great! Althought be careful when you turn the waterpik on...water instantly starts coming out of the pik and I have squirted myself in the eye! :)</li>
    <li> It was a super deal as a lighting deal one day. I had been looking for a more expensive one but this one has been perfect for its need.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing so I was eager to try out this water jet system.  I used it after brushing and it did get at a lot of debris that was left behind but no more than my Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks do and I find them easier to use.  I had a little trouble controlling this device and more than once it sprayed all over me and the mirror, sink etc. Of course this probably would have improved with practice - I only used it for about 3 weeks.  The jet stream doesn&#x27;t feel that strong and water pours out of your mouth while you&#x27;re using it which I didn&#x27;t enjoy.  I also didn&#x27;t find that the toothbrush attachment was as vigorous in brushing as my Braun electric toothbrush.  I have not used one of these water irrigation systems before so don&#x27;t know how it compares to other brands but I plan to stick with my Brush Picks  On the plus side, it&#x27;s fairly compact, doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the counter (and that&#x27;s including a brush).</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a water pic type of device to help get my gums clean. I looked at quite a few, but this particular one does everything I wanted it to and more! I had one decades ago, and this one is so much better. It has enough power for me, it is easy to fill yet difficult for the cat to drink out of! There are several tips, that can massage gums, clean below the gum line, and even clean your tongue! I like the full pressure setting, and having the sonic switch on the machine. While this is not as powerful as the gizmo the dentist uses, thank heavens, I expect the cost of one with a blast strong enough to clean your deck would cost a couple of decimal places more!</li>
    <li> I used the Interplak for a couple of months before finally knocking it off the vanity and breaking it. Other than the bulky size, it&#x27;s a great tool to have for complete oral care.  I really liked the range of adjustable settings.  My other unit only has a high and low setting. I also like that the reservoir is large enough to hold enough water to do a thorough cleaning job. I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the sonic toothbrush because it didn&#x27;t vibrate as well as my electric toothbrush.  The only piece I didn&#x27;t use was the tongue scraper because I just use the toothbrush. I enjoyed using this before I broke it, and I would purchase one if I had enough room to safely store it on my vanity.  I recommend this product for anyone searching for a complete oral irrigation system, as it has everything needed and even comes with a handy drawer to store all of the attachments which is a nice touch.  The only drawback of course is the size.  For those with small standard vanities, storing it on top of the vanity may present a problem.</li>
    <li> It was a difficult decision when selecting an oral irrigation device. Waterp*k is much more well known and readily available (in local stores). However, after reading reviews and checking things out, the Interplak looked attractive. It is slightly less expensive. Holds ample solution in its tank. It does feel somewhat lightweight but hey its plastic! Comes with many tips, although I wish they would add more jet tips. The rest are frumpy!  Feature wise it is pretty simple to use. There is a pressure dial, on/off switch, and the jet tip features a \\&quot;pulse/vibration\\&quot; switch. Make sure to hold the pause button until you are ready to let the water flow.   My only other concern is that I have not see it in local stores. This means all tips, etc have to ordered via the net.</li>
    <li> The Interplak Sonic Water Jet was a gift, so I cannot comment on how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was shipped to my workplace and it somehow was turned on during shipment (so it was vibrating).  My co-workers delivered it to me laughing, stating my vibrator has arrived.  Upon opening I told them it was my Mom&#x27;s gift  . . . they replied &amp;#34;Sick&amp;#34;.  We all got a big laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that it had not been on as I am sure that it has compromised the battery.</li>
    <li> I have another Water jet and it puts this one to shame. The pressure on the product is very low at its maximum and sometimes it take time for the water to start working. Very poor product.</li>
    <li> Had had 2 water jets before..  The last one was a chargeable, portable one.  It was very disappointing and finally died.&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews, etc. and, even though this model was not loved by all, it wasn&#x27;t a Water Pik and it was a plug in with&lt;br /&gt;a good capacity.  Also, the price was reasonable.  On the plus side...it works better than either of my others, although the first one lasted about 5 years and was adequate.  It has the power and then a bit more.  It holds enough liquid for more than one quick cleaning.  The controls seem to work consistently...that is...when you hit the switch to turn it on, it comes on.  Hit off, it stops.  Pressure is nearly instantaneous.  The extras are fine...especially the sonic tooth brush.  Had it for about 3 months or so and it hasn&#x27;t stopped working...a problem I kept having with the other two.  It does seem rather a flimsy device...thin plastic.  And, the pump doesn&#x27;t always just hum right along...there seems to be intermittent short periods where it seems to labor for a few seconds.  But the flow at the tip doesn&#x27;t seem affected.  Its a little noisy, but that&#x27;s ok with me.  I like to know when something is working well, or not, and motor/pump noise variances give me some of that information.  Overall, if it keeps on working for a few years, it will make me a happy tooth cleaner.</li>
    <li> The Interplack works well and all of the tools are cute but the basic \\&quot;Water Pic\\&quot; style jet does the best job of the attachments as far as clearing trapped items in between your teeth such as celery strings, etc. I owned an original Water Pic and this brand seems to use a larger volume of water to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Interplack Water Jet is NOISY! You can&#x27;t use this thing with someone asleep in the next room. It&#x27;s difficult to tell if the \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; option helps or not.</li>
    <li> my teeth feel fabulous after every use!</li>
    <li> I am just so diapoointed. If I could give a 0 star rating I would. I read reviews thoroughly I post honest reviews and this was bad! I bought my kids one and bought us one as well. The reviews were OK but TRUST the reviews the first use was OK but by the 2nd the cord that connects to the handle and the water tank poured water all over the counter. I tried to put it back together but same result. Then I left the tank on the counter one morning with water in it and it leaked all over while I was gone. I am VERY disappointed and would vise all to steer clear from this one. Con air makes some good products but this was bad and a waste of money!</li>
    <li> After happily using my original Interplak until it finally died of old age, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy the same brand again. But something terrible happened to this product in the meantime and there is no resemblance to my old one in either looks or performance. This unit has several problems, the worst of which is that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to pick up. The reservoir fits very loosely on the base and falls off easily and if you try to pick it up by the base one of your fingers is almost guaranteed to press the on button. To compound that problem, the button tends to stick in the on position so you are spraying water all over the bathroom trying to get the darn thing shut off. I have given up on the button and now just plug it in to use it, unplug it to turn it off. This thing is junk.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> i bought this because it seemed to have better options compared to waterpik but i didn&#x27;t think about the power output.  it works but seems cheap in design and doesn&#x27;t hold that much water. nice and compact though for my small bathroom</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;vily.e had Interplak water jets before,  This was so noisily disruptive, I couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of its noise da</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I loved my old one. This model is flimsy and poorly designed. The on off button is located right where you put your hand when you want to move it causing me to accidentally hit the button and squirt water all over my bathroom on a regular basis. Call me stupid but my husband has the same problem</li>
    <li> Ample water container to do the whole mouth with one fill up; compact; strength is good, The battery powered sonic piece is a little strange but it intensifies the power pick. I am not sure what it does besides vibrate. Definitely better than Water/Pic brand some how. Better quality. I am satisfied for the price.</li>
    <li> worked wonderful at first, I neglected to keep box or receipt nor turn in warranty card, my BAD, It suddenly stopped working</li>
    <li> Im dissappointed with the fact that they are 120volt and australia id 240volt. The chinese are smart enough to send the right voltage to different countrys so thought you guys should be also.&lt;br /&gt;Without fittings i will send it back as no use if no fittings.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy a 240 to 120 volt transformer to use it, bit of a pain.</li>
    <li> It does everything  your  mouth  needs to stay healthy.  I am well  pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this via a lightning deal and I must say I think it is GREAT! I have seen the reviews saying you end up with water everywhere... and as long as you hold the pause button you wont have a problem. It also isnt very hard to hold. I have accidentally let it slip a few times and ended up with a bit of water on the walls though. haha</li>
    <li> The sonic brush is great, but for me, the water flosser pressure is too low. I have always used Waterpick and comparing, this is a lot lower. I you have gum problems and need less pressure this would be good enough.</li>
    <li> My personal experience has proven that brushing my teeth the conventional way was not enough to ensure healthy protect teeth and gums.  After using the Interplak twice a day for about three weeks, I was amazed at how much more affective cleaning was being accomplished.  I recommend this product to anyone with teeth, especially young people ( kids).  I am well over 60 with most of my teeth, but I know that if I had been using this product I would have avoided gum surgery and other procedures needed to preserve my teeth.  It really works!</li>
    <li> wonderful product, recommended by my dentist</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a waterpik that gave up.  While this does an OK job it&#x27;s not as good as the waterpik.  My main complaint is the lack of power.  With this unit turned up to it&#x27;s highest setting, it&#x27;s about half as powerful as my old unit.  I do like the hinged lid but it&#x27;s a little flimsy, and the bottom tray to hold the extra tips is handy.  The ultrasonic feature is a little gimmicky and mostly just vibrates your hand more that doing anything to help your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> What else can I say, I love it!  It gets food out of my teeth that I missed with my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;easy and convenient to use</li>
    <li> I  like the sonic water jet. Previously I owned a waterpix 360 and it lasted for 1year, 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a water flosser that you could insert into the electric outlet.</li>
    <li> I needed to attempt a rescue of a bad tooth situation. A root canal done 20+ years ago was finally giving out and I will need an implant to replace it. For years previously I used Water Pik and later on, the Dr. Woog Perio-system - unparalleled in quality but no longer available. For $35, and the possibility of reversing some root or gum damage, what did I have to lose? The mechanics of the system are reviewed by others, and I have no major complaints. It works as promised. What you find out though is pretty unacceptable. The tips - both oral irrigator and toothbrush fit really tight. You need an assist to change them. By the 2nd week I broke the toothbrush head off of one, and then the 2nd toothbrush. Not from abuse; they simply weren&#x27;t strong enough to survive the pulling off to change tips. The unit has already begun to mis-fire during operation. I can only imagine how it would operate after 2 months if it is at this stage 3 weeks into use. Really, look to another product.</li>
    <li> A waste of money!  Better off just gargling!  There is no jet stream, water just slowly dribbles out, even at the highest setting; I threw it away &amp; went back to my waterpik!</li>
    <li> Hinge broke when container fell. I must sometimes put pressure on container to gut pumping action.Container is somewhat alkward and difficult to grip.</li>
    <li> Because I can&#x27;t swallow, some kind of oral irrigation is absolutely  necessary for me many times daily&#x3D;&#x3D;just to live! I have owned three Interplak Sonic Water Jets. The first one  lasted quite a while, and I liked it a lot (the sonic feature!), except for 2 major problems: The on/off switch was very problematic (a big pain!), both in usability and in its lasting power.  The lid/handle \\&quot;hinge&#x27; was very fragile and easily broke.  I bought a second, and a third one as back up, with the hope that these two would be different. But the last two were disasters. Such things as the on/off switch soon became dysfunctional, and the the water jet ceased to function on the third one. And they didn&#x27;t last very long  (It wasn&#x27;t a matter of wearing out from use) I would have returned them but I had lost track of the purchase slips, and didn&#x27;t want the hassle of tussling with the Interplak people. At one point, more recently, when the Interplak sonic gave out on the road, I bought an inexpensive non-sonic Interplak (the only one available in the store). Sadly, It produces so little water pressure that about all it does is to wet my mouth.  It is of little use for cleaning teeth which, of course, what its for.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, until Interplak can produce a better product, I was forced to turn elsewhere. Indeed, I just ordered--from Amazon--a new Watepic, on the basis of strong user recommendations. (I will miss the sonic feature of Interplak--but that&#x27;s not enough in itself.)</li>
    <li> bought for my mother and she loves it for the great price and all you get.</li>
    <li> Works very well!! I have all of my wisdom teeth and they are the only teeth I can&#x27;t get to with a brush and floss. Those 4 wisdom teeth are also the only teeth that I have cavities and constant infections in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product got out all food, plaque, and anything else that was living on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it right after I oil pull with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m highly impressed and very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip--&amp;#62; use Luke warm water if your teeth are sensitive.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good, but I only used it for 5 times and now it leaks when I use it. lots of water leaks from the bottom of the electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> big storage and a lot cheeper than water pic for same use</li>
    <li> Work well but not as powerful as my old one.</li>
    <li> I prefer the waterpik dental flosser.</li>
    <li> Very messy.. Not the best</li>
    <li> After going through 2 Waterpik water Flosser WP-60W (I was hoping the first one was defective) I decided to give up on WaterPik and go with the Interplak SWj1 flosser.  What a difference. I have been using it now for over a month and very happy with it.  It comes with several tips including one with a rubber tip to get down to the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid seems a little flimsy and I have been waiting for it to break off from the container where you put water or mouthwash but as of now it is still on there.</li>
    <li> What are u people selling. I bought maybe two weeks ago and the first time used it ....it didn&#x27;t work because water squirted everywhere .now I used it and there is no water coming out.  This is after I threw the box because I thought this was a new product.  But i think a lot of the products are old</li>
    <li> Hard to think what all to say about an appliance like this other than it&#x27;s nice to have. A definite step up from a regular toothbrush. My dentist recommended this type of machine to help ward off gum disease, and it also feels nice to use on sore gums.</li>
    <li> good product to keep your gums in good shape in between dentist visits and cleanints just wish it didnt squirt water all over the bathroom i ended up haveing to use it inside the tub or i would make a mess in the sink but works great though</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m not one to bother with flossing, this is perfect for me. I had 1/2 water &amp; 1/2 mouth wash. The dentist said it will work since he knows I won&#x27;t floss. Thank you for a very good product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a waterpik waterflosser which had broken.  This is lighter weight and when not filled with water is more likely to fall over....frustrating but not the end of the world.  Definitely smaller space required for storage and I like the storage drawer in the unit rather than sitting on top of the water tank.  The handle feels good in the hand and the various settings work well to personalize it for the needs of the user. I would not be without some type of water jet for oral hygiene and this works well.  It is a bit less expensive than the earlier product I had so decided to try it.  The differences are not great enough to caause me to spend more money for a better known name brand.</li>
    <li> This unit adds the use of a sonic tooth brush. Works well and it a great addition to the standard waterpick</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for a broken water pik.  Love that the water chamber is enclosed, that alone is a big plus.</li>
    <li> Better than the waterpik I used previously.&lt;br /&gt;Could have used another regular tip with unit.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> Works well. Easy to use and very effective. The flow of water can be adjusted from soft to very firm.</li>
    <li> I ordered under my name Carol Reichman but you insist on asking Fred.  I like the Water Jet  . it&#x27;s great and I like that it&#x27;s small and that the top can fit on top while not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol Reichman</li>
    <li> More water pressure and lasts far longer than expensive Water Pik.</li>
    <li> my son loves this and it inspires him to use it more than flossing</li>
    <li> Great product for the money</li>
    <li> It works great and it was a good price. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Better than the original Sonic  water jet that I had, which worked fine until the hose broke.</li>
    <li> Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++</li>
    <li> verygood product betterthan waterpic</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed for my new braces</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it.  Much more affordable than the other brand name.</li>
    <li> I love this. Your mouth feels so clean the first time you use this. And the price is worth it</li>
    <li> This does the job, but the on/off button sticks and won&#x27;t always turn off which is very annoying. But otherwise it does okay.</li>
    <li> I like the way it is set up and especially all the different heads. Great price and it has worked fine for me</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do more than dribble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use in Australia.  i tried several different adaptors which all said power was flowing fine. but no matter what i tried, the best i could get out of this stupid thing was a gravity feed dribble. there was no noise or any lights to indicate it was or wasn&#x27;t on. i even left it on for 15 minutes in the hopes it would eventually start. the vibrate thing on the handset worked ok, but overall a waste of money. i bought it because i wanted to try out whether an oral irrigator would help keep my tonsillar crypts and gums clean without having to fork out for the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as amazon will take the cost of returning it out of the refund if they decide it works fine and it costs a fortune to ship to the US from here, it&#x27;ll probably just go in the trash. really disappointed</li>
    <li> My gums have never been healthier due to this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and has a powerful enough stream to really get between teeth and under bridges. It reminds me of my grandmother&#x27;s old water pic that she loved and with how reliable and solid this product appears to be, it may last just as long. It&#x27;s far superior to rechargeable pics because you don&#x27;t have a time limit and can really get at every space and crevice without worrying about any battery dying. The only downside is it&#x27;s very noisy, but that can be rectified by placing a small folded towel under it keep it from vibrating on your bathroom sink area.</li>
    <li> It runs but will leak and water runs down your arm when using the water pik. I will be buying a different brand</li>
    <li> iT DOES A GREAT JOB. tHIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WATER PIKS i HAVE USED. i HAVED ALWAYS USED THE wATER PIK BRAND, BUT  ITHINK I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER.</li>
    <li> Pressure stream doesn&#x27;t adjust well.</li>
    <li> After about six months of use, the attachments (waterpik) etc. stopped functioning. I performed the cleaning maintenance listed in the instruction book, and I still can&#x27;t use the attachments. i will have to send it back to the manufacturer for repair.</li>
    <li> I use an oral device such as this each and every day  and had given up locating one of these and sure enough there it&lt;br /&gt;was and better than the one before.</li>
    <li> The 1st one did not last 3 months. The button in the bottom of the tank broke. Amazon replaced it for me for free,but the 2nd one did the same thing. Not very well made.Stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> When turned up high it vibrates all over the place.</li>
    <li> Item arrived with a major crack in the bottom of the reservoir rendering it useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the plastic I could see how cheaply made it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just spend the extra money and get a Water Pik.</li>
    <li> It works well.  I would prefer a larger water tank.</li>
    <li> I liked the device when I got it, but only after a few weeks of use it&lt;br /&gt;started leaking water from the sprayer unit, and this of course dropped the&lt;br /&gt;pressure to the point where it was almost useless. So I returned it for&lt;br /&gt;a refund, and bought a WaterPik product instead.</li>
    <li> I had a Water Pik before and it kept breaking.  Hope this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smaller footprint and storage drawer.  I also like the ability to alter the force of the water jet.</li>
    <li> At the beginning, it worked fine. But, after a few months, the power button start to get jammed often. So, it&#x27;s hard to turn it off. Other than this, I like it very much.</li>
    <li> As advertised, Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Works good but loud as hell. Dont use this at night because people will think your doing naught things if you live with someone. It sounds like a personal back massager but louder. So use it in the morning with the door open and you should be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the attachments work well. The unit puts out a very high pressure spray at the max setting so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as advertised just wish it was quieter and the stream of water could be more gentle on the lowest setting.</li>
    <li> I bought a waterpick before this one.&lt;br /&gt;But waterpick hurts my teeth ,so switched to interplak and this is the one I like.</li>
    <li> I think water jet systems are so cantankerous.  I have been through so many.  This is one of the better ones, but eventually the on/off button acts as if it has a short in it.  It will work fine for a while, and then it will become difficult to turn for a while. I would so like to purchase just a simple, basic water jet system that holds up.</li>
    <li> order this to replace old one the plug cord is a little short compared to my other one and a little noiser but over all good</li>
    <li> I needed a new water pick and this was a good deal.</li>
    <li> Absolute garbage. The reviews for this item range wildly from great, to terrible so I took a chance. It was the best rated for the price but my pragmatism bit me on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near enough pressure, runs very loud, and is made from a very brittle plastic. Save yourself a lot of frustration and buy something else.</li>
    <li> For this price, the product works well enough.</li>
    <li> Best waterpik ever. I had an old and still have one that works. The new improved  with the sonic is really great.  Will recommend it to everyone that needs a waterpik.</li>
    <li> Still going strong after a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Water Jet has performed as advertised. Has good pressure and no leaks. Hinged lid a bit awkward and not removable but certainly not a deal breaker. Plenty of attachments. Great price.</li>
    <li> A little noisy but all in all the unit seems to do the job.  I like the general design and functionality.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The Interplak brand is something my mother has recommended over and over again...so I finally bought one.  Boy was she right.  My mouth instantly feels really clean, way better than just flossing. And the price was right, too!</li>
    <li> This water pick system is really powerful. We recommend starting on the lowest setting and work up to a power level that is comfortable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several attachments to choose from. The straight pick works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent size reservoir. Make sure you fill it using filtered water instead of tap. Filtered water will help to keep it clean and free of hard water particles.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t always work. I have to fool with the dial. The lid broke. It&#x27;s just too plasticky weak. I do like that it has a holder for the squirter thing</li>
    <li> have been using it for about a year and it still works great.  it generally stays clean, although the base of the handle can collect mold if you don&#x27;t wash it weekly.</li>
    <li> It has done the job i wanted it to do.. !&lt;br /&gt;It came fully functionaly so im happy!&lt;br /&gt;All tho.. i had to buy a adapter to make it run on the European electricity .. but no big deal!</li>
    <li> This product works really well. I hate flossing and I admit I usually don&#x27;t do it.  The Interplak does an amazing job of cleaning along gum line and between teeth.  I had no idea I was missing so much junk with brushing alone until I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;better price/value than competitors&lt;br /&gt;adjustable pressure setting&lt;br /&gt;comes also with 2 toothbrushes, tongue cleaner&lt;br /&gt;can use mouthwashes in it&lt;br /&gt;storage tray on bottom for attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;only complaint is the start/stop button is a little quirky. I have to press it a little hard to click it off, which often pushes the whole unit around the countertop.  This is why I can&#x27;t give the full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to friend or buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice unit. The only complaint is that the water pressure is not as strong as I would prefer. Otherwise it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Waterpik flosser. The Interplak has barely enough power when set on highest setting. The handle consistently hits your teeth. Very noisy. Covering came off of one instrument the first time I used it. I would repurchase the Waterpik and wish I had.</li>
    <li> I used the &#x27;other&#x27; leading brand for many years and by far the Interplak SWJ1 is the BEST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larger water tank (with hinged cover!), small footprint, quiet enough, accessories storage drawer,&lt;br /&gt;good design, good value, and it&#x27;s attractive.</li>
    <li> I had some dental implants put in and there&#x27;s not much space in between to be able to floss. This waterpick as hepled in maintianing health gums and keeping my mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I sent it back the same day. when I filled the reservoir with water and turned the unit on, it leaked everywhere. tried it again- same thing. the seal b-tween the base and the tank did not seal. I think it was just that one unit- others will possibly be fine.</li>
    <li> It works as per specifications. It is user friendly too.  I am planning to buy a lot of  and give them as gift</li>
    <li> I received the INTERPLAK Swj1 Sonic Water Jet yesterday and used it last night.  My wife woke me this morning yelling there is water all over the bathroom vanity.  Every last drop of water left in the reservoir leaked through the lower housing, into the pull out tray and then all over the place.  I have used a water pik for years and I have never had this problem.  I tested it myself.  Any water left in the tank slowly leaks out.  Another American Company having their product made in China... and it shows.  I have just printed my return label.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give it four stars and say I like it, which is what I would do if I had not discovered just how sensitive my teeth actually are - even to water at room temperature. No issue drinking water or eating ice cream, but this little unit, due to no apparent fault of it´s own won´t really work for me. May retry with warm water, but due to not wanting to use it with water from the warm faucet (not from the RO system), that´s a bit a bother...</li>
    <li> This product has been really disappointing. It leaks every time we use it, though we are faithful about emptying the basin and cleaning it out. The storage tray for the extra water pik tips fills with water every time we use it. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Last night I gave up and threw it in the garbage bin. Tomorrow my WaterPik should arrive and I can hardly wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What severe and constant frustration I had trying to use this thing!  The main problem was making a secure connection between the water tank and the base.  Sometimes it worked on the first try, sometimes it took repeated and repeated tries and last night it didn&#x27;t work at all.  And then of all things, it would take two hands to break the connection should I be lucky enough to make one in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaked on my vanity.  The base pads are small and slick and the vibration caused it to dance all over the place.  And as someone else stated, the coil gets in the way of replacing the handle so it always took two hands to replace it in its holder.  The drawer is too small to be of any practical use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s another very irritating characteristic.  I am right-handed and after each use, I would have to pick up the machine to wipe under it.  My left thumb would hit the off/on switch as it is the natural place for my thumb to land and there really isn&#x27;t any other place on which to grab it - and on came the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive is that if and when the water comes out, it&#x27;s steady and does a good job.  I would give a rating of zero if it were an option.</li>
    <li> This item works well,and has a good number of attachments. My only complaint would be that I expected a stronger jet stream from the unit and it is pretty noisy. This is the first water jet dental device that I have every owned so this unit may be as strong as they get. I guess i had high hopes that it would be like a mini pressure washer, but then again someone might do some damage to themselves. For the money I would say this is a good deal.</li>
    <li> I had a ViaJet Pro Irrigator for about a 2 year period so noisy it was very loud sounded like a washer machine was going off in the house it was good the jet stream but the water pick tips woudl constantly brake and I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use ViaJet Pro Irrigator device such as this  Interplak Swj1 Sonic Water Jet, each and every day and had given up ordering the ViaJet Pro Irrigatorone and Im so glad I ordered this  Interplak Swj1 Sonic Water Jet, since its way better than the one before.</li>
    <li> Very good water pressure for blasting debris from between your teeth without making your gums sore from repeated attempts with floss.  I like this model better than the previous square box model, but the box does tip over easily if you brush against it when it is empty.</li>
    <li> I was purchasing this for my father he has went through some pretty serious surgery and it has caused eating the be a little more difficult. With the aid of a WaterPik it really helps in get his mouth cleaned out and just in general get along better. At first he had some mixed feelings about this WaterPik, but after he used it a couple of times and got more and more used to it. He is now very pleased with it. The way the spray was done it was a little different from any of the WaterPik he had in the past, but after he has used it a few times he has found he really likes it and thinks it is a nice improvement. He&#x27;s very happy with the factory went ahead and purchased it and recommends it. This is coming from somebody that has been living with using the WaterPik&#x27;s for like 40 years now and he had no problems at all saying he thought it was the best one so far.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. So far has worked well.</li>
    <li> Make sure you push the nozzle all the way into the handle, or you might be wondering why there is low pressure and water leaking out the bottom of the handle (like my mother was).  The disk of the nozzle should be down flush with the top of the handle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t jet the water into the gum line as well as it should, have to push the blue water container very firmly down sometimes several times before it even flows, only used it for a few months, and fed up with the hassle. I like that it takes up less sink space. But compared with others used in the past, that unfortunately are no longer carried. I have turned the small wheel on the front and really makes no difference to the water pressure coming out.</li>
    <li> Just perfect in every way, has all the right attachments and lots of power.  Would recommend to others who want a clean, fresh experience</li>
    <li> I really like the sonic feature and the easy to load tank. I have found in the past that similar products have very poor durability. That remains to be seen.</li>
    <li> This little machine is some DYNAMO! Great power features and even has massage. Highly REC2ALL. Can not beat the price.</li>
    <li> I had this flosser for 11 months when the motor died. It did not have the power of a Waterpik from the beginning but I was satisfied with it. Eleven months is not bad but it did come with a two year warranty so I sent it back. It is six weeks later and all I get from customer service is the repair department is backed up. That tells you something in itself. They gave me a claim number but I decided to go back to a Waterpik WP-100 that I liked. The handle cracked on the first one I bought which is a common problem on the WP-100 models. I found that replacement handles are now sold for the Waterpik and can be easily replaced for under $10. If I ever get the Interplak back, it will be a backup.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Within a week of my review above, I received from Interplak a completely new flosser with all the accessories. I consider this going above and beyond. They did not even cash the check for return shipping. I had given up waiting for the repaired motor and I started using a Waterpik WP-100W/WP-100C model. This is not like the original WP-100 I owned initially. It is a lot less powerful even on the highest setting from the older model. I am switching gears and going back to the Interplak which I now like better. I changed my review from 2 to 4 stars because of the integrity of the company&#x27;s policies and the comparison to Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy the Waterpic, because I have been using one for 40 years, I by error ordered the Iinterplak. I am so glad I received this new product, it is so much better, has a sonic tooth brush, which works like a miricale on my theet. Great value and better quality than just a water pick alone. It does not hurt to try some new products, I am so happy I made this error. I recommend this highly. I would like to mention, I have excellent teeth because of a waterpic.</li>
    <li> For the price-point this thing is great!  Super vibrating handle in addition for jet for cleaning, Multiple tips and variable pressure.</li>
    <li> have enjoyed using this item</li>
    <li> I love this.  I used to think my teeth were clean, but never like this.  My gums are healthier, my teeth cleaner, I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance for gum cleaning with accessory. Adjustable setting for flushing. Love it very much!</li>
    <li> I was a little scared to plunk down money on a water pic but this was well worth the price paid. I haven&#x27;t had any issues yet and it&#x27;s been several months.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Water pik, and the Conair unit&lt;br /&gt;out performed it and the price difference was&lt;br /&gt;significant for me to use the sonic, and I have&lt;br /&gt;never looked back.</li>
    <li> This product has caused problems since the first use. I would not recommend it to anyone. The attachments are incredibly difficult to remove, &amp; the head of the toothbrush attachment was ripped off when I tried to remove it. The gum cleaning attachment plugs up regularly &amp; works better now since a small nail was inserted into the tip to open it up some. And the power button is sticking &amp; often needs pressing several times to turn off. Overall, it is cheaply made. Conair&#x27;s customer service representative did respond to an email request for an additional toothbrush head &amp; promised to send a new one, but never did &amp; does not respond to subsequent emails. We will try Waterpik once again.</li>
    <li> The first one we got was good.  Pressure is high enough to actually cause pain on the highest setting.  We were impressed so we ordered a 2nd.  Sorry to say, the second one was defective and leaks water.  Kind of a dangerous situation &#x27;cause water runs right onto the power switch!  We&#x27;re returning it for one that hopefully works.</li>
    <li> is Amazing, a great product.</li>
    <li> There are many expensive water jets on the market and I have tried some, but for the money this product is the best. A little noisy but performs well.</li>
    <li> Reservoir cheaply made.</li>
    <li> very csatisfied with purchase</li>
    <li> This product has become my all time favorite tooth brush. I use the water jet which is better than my waterpik and have come to enjoy the brush system which also flushes excess toothpaste and is as good as my sonic. Two devices in one and cheaper than either one by themselves!</li>
    <li> works awesome. does the job and affordable</li>
    <li> Requires re-priming on each use.  Otherwise, when primed, the Jet functions perfectly well.  I would buy another were it not for the priming problem.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use</li>
    <li> Excellent. Price good.</li>
    <li> I have been using a WaterPik unit for decades.  The Conair is even better.  It is light so it&#x27;s easy to move around on the counter.  It has multiple attachments which are stored in a drawer below.  I especially like the sonic feature.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as described.  No need to contact the seller! :)</li>
    <li> Light-weight junk.  Vibrates along the shelf.  Stopped working after a few weeks.  Good riddance.  Went back to the&lt;br /&gt;far superior WaterPik.  So much for trying to save a few bucks!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Happy with my purchase.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> not very powerful  doesn&#x27;t always set in base easily</li>
    <li> I feel this product works well and does what it is supposed to do. However, it is noisy.</li>
    <li> this works well but the on/off button on the lower left side is in the worst place as far as design. if you grab this unit from the bottom to lift it then invariably the on/off button gets pushed and you have water everywhere. outside of the this design flaw the unit works well and is adjustable for your preferences.</li>
    <li> Everything in this product is great</li>
    <li> I know this product is reliable.  I like it but notice it&#x27;s louder so I put a layer under it and that helps.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs dental cleaning often.</li>
    <li> Works great and arrived quickly. It does what it is supposed to do. The on/off switch is a little picky, but that is a small thing.</li>
    <li> Minha esposa usa este produto por recomendação médica e ela e a médica então muito satisfeitas com os resultados, pena que a manutenção seja cara, vale mais a pena comprar um aparelho novo do que consertar.</li>
    <li> I ordered a waterpik on the advise of my denist and I must say I was surprised at how refreshing it made my teeth feel.&lt;br /&gt;It works well with one exception; it is very noisy. This is the first waterpik that I have ever used so I cannot compare it to another model, but I am happy with this one, except for the loud buzzing noise that it makes. This noise prevents me from using it at night because it my wake-up somebody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work well in the mornings, however, I am glad that I purchased this one.</li>
    <li> Very poorly made.  The plastic is fragile and thin.  It broke within the first week of getting it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, who recently got braces.  The rinse feature is great for him and more importantly, he uses it.  The brush seems to holding up well and he has no problems using it.</li>
    <li> Worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best water jet on the market, at least it is my favorite, but have never been able to get one to last over a year. I have tried using only distilled water, cleaning it religiously, keeping it empty after use, keeping it full after use and every other thing I can think of but eventually they all quit pumping at full strength. I keep buying them because I like them so much better than any other water jet but get mad every time I have to replace it. I have been replacing them yearly for many, many years...way over a dozen units. My husband has a separate one and has had the exact same experience. We are the personification of someone doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result!!!</li>
    <li> Just love this.  I have been using for a couple months and my teeth feel so clean.  Just like having a professional cleaning every day.  I have not yet had a dental appointment, but hoping for better results with the use of this product.</li>
    <li> very good product that cleans between teeth what the toothbrush has left behind. The material could be a little better since its all plastic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, butI think I would prefer the name brand item instead.</li>
    <li> When I received it it worked a little but the water pressure was not strong enough. Also the pause button did not work. After 3weeks it had no water pressure what or ever! So I returned it, and got a refund but I still did not get a refund for the postage that I payed in the first place. So you better of to buy this kind of things in a store near your house.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Interplak Water Jet for years.  This is a replacement for the old one that sprung a leak in the tubing.&lt;br /&gt;I like the addition of the sonic water jet feature in the new one.  It massages the gums.</li>
    <li> I love it and keep using it</li>
    <li> The Swj1 only includes a single standard water jet tip. If you have another person that will be using it, it will be necessary to purchase another tip! The four piece set only includes one standard tip, so if you&#x27;re like me, the other 3 will end up in a drawer. My guess is Conair leaves out the tip so you&#x27;re forced to buy a set. At that point you&#x27;re about close to the cost of the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. Additional standard tip are not available in a pair or as a single item, only a single  with the other tips that you may not need. The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser includes two standard tips, as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big (only?) selling point of the Swj1 is the sonic vibration technology. There&#x27;s a battery in the handle, and when switched on, will vibrate. The vibration will be felt in your teeth, jaw, and all through your cranium. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a pleasant sensation. Also, if you Google it, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any solid science behind the benefit of the sonic vibration. At least when used as intended. My main issue with the functionality of the device was the low pressure. As stated in other reviews, it&#x27;s significantly less than the Waterpik&#x27;s. I sent back the SWj1 to Amazon and am loving the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. Excellent water pressure, two tips, reservoir under the tank. Overall I think it is a generation ahead of the Conair. Unless you have a use for the vibration feature, don&#x27;t try to save a few bucks, the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is a great product and the best value. At the time of this review, there are 3,681 reviews for the Waterpik and 147 reviews for the Conair. I generally go for the underdog, but this time The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser wins.</li>
    <li> This waterjet flosser was a real disappointment. It has so little pressure that it does not remove food particles as it should.  I have already ordered a genuine waterpik brand to replace it.</li>
    <li> well, it&#x27;s a waterpik, but it only lasted me 6 months, so i&#x27;m now ordering another one,&lt;br /&gt;so I cannot say I didn&#x27;t like it.  I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Single best purchase I&#x27;ve EVER made. Bar nothing. This system beats all others for quality and capaility. I am so hooked on the Interplax system that I will NEVER be without it. And I will be buying this for xmas gifts for my family. Thank you! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is my third (generation) water jet. The first two were Water Piks. The original lasted for 15 years, but I did not use it enough (my dental records prove that!). It was &amp;#34;worn&amp;#34; but still functional when I replaced it with a newer generation Water Pik. Wow -- they reengineered it into a fragile piece of junk that lasted only two years before it started to &amp;#34;not start&amp;#34; and sprung a leak on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is a decent substitute so far. I almost gave it 3 stars because the On/Off sticks and the unit is so light that the pressure it takes to turn On/Off is enough to send this thing in motion (hint: replace the switch a capacitive touch sensor and charge a few  bucks more). It&#x27;s annoying to have to hold it down to turn it on or off, but workable. This, like my previous Water Pik (2), have lids that seal off the reservoir. The problem is that if you don&#x27;t dry out the bowl (and I don&#x27;t), mildew will develop, so I just leave the lid up (the original had no lid). I was thinking about drilling a few holes on top, to let the residual water evaporate better, but so far I&#x27;m too lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the extra vibrate (lower button) that helps to massage the gums more. Something I read somewhere indicated that bones need vibrations to stimulate growth (or to reduce loss). Since replacing my uppers with &amp;#34;Clear Choice&amp;#34;  choppers, I need this to flush debris out from underneath the appliance and this does that well. Part of my twice daily cleaning ritual now.</li>
    <li> works well.  Water sometimes feels stronger then other times - could be guns are sensitive.  It has really helped to get the food out from between my teeth.</li>
    <li> This thing works great.    At first I was skeptical of the pulsating feature. It seemed like an unnecessary gimmick.  But the more I&#x27;ve used it, the more I find that it does seem to work well, and the battery in the handle (which I figured would need constant replacement) has lasted and lasted.  It seems to me that what it really does is rapidly move the point-of-aim of the nozzle by vibrating the whole handle.  And that actually seems to be a benefit because it allows the aim to cover a slightly larger area rapidly.  Switching it off, I miss having it.    As with any of these water jet gadgets, they don&#x27;t last forever.  The pumps in them seem to fail regularly.  But I get a few years out of each one, and for what they do, I wouldn&#x27;t be without one.    My dental hygienist says I have the gums of a 20 year old!    Seriously.  One of the main advantages of a water jet gizmo is that it gets down under the gums and massages the daylights out of that area, strengthening and cleaning it to keep your gum pockets small and your gum tissue healthy.    I have a couple of places next to teeth that have been repaired with crowns, etc., that collect food easily, and that irritates the gum pockets in those places.  It&#x27;s great to be able to blast those areas out easily.  And everywhere else where tooth meets gum, it&#x27;s nice to be able to scour out plaque that&#x27;s starting to grow there.  It feels great once you get your gums built up and \\&quot;in shape\\&quot;.    You can adjust the pressure of the water to start off gentle and work your way up to higher power as your gums become more healthy.  As with other similar units, the water temperature also affects the pressure.  Warm water comes out more gently than cold water.  There is obviously some sort of plastic or elastomer part(s) in the pump, or maybe the tube, that creates more pressure when it&#x27;s cold and rigid and less pressure when it&#x27;s warm and more flexible.  So you can vary the pressure that way, too.    I&#x27;m not sure what else to say.  It&#x27;s a water jet gum cleaner, and it works as well as any I&#x27;ve tested.  The tank holds plenty of water and the reliability has been as good as any others I&#x27;ve used.  Not perfect, but then none of them seem to last all that long.</li>
    <li> This pic works well for me! great power.</li>
    <li> This unit replaced a Water Pik that I had operated twice daily since 2008.  The good news is that I think the Interplak unit with the sonic function cleans better than the Water Pik.  The bad news is that it is decided louder (about the same as a drill) and that my unit stopped working in the middle of use on the second day.  I had to take off the water tank, turn the pump motor upside down and tap it to make the on/off switch function again.  I&#x27;ve asked for a replacement unit to see if this is a problem specific to the unit that I bought, or is a systemic problem with all these units.  If my replacement doesn&#x27;t work properly, I&#x27;m back to Water Pik.</li>
    <li> Various attachments need to have easier way to grip base to rotate while working in mouth. There&#x27;s nothing for fingers to grab onto.don&#x27;t like the action of the brush....water flow washes away the toothpaste regardless of whether you put it on the bristles or right in your mouth. So it&#x27;s back to manual toothbrush and use this machine for water pik and gum tools. Sonic action isn&#x27;t that great IMO.</li>
    <li> Had this about a year and use it daily. I found it bettter to keep my left hand on the base unit and and gently press on the power button with my left thumb. The idea is to not fully engage the switch so that when I release my thumb the flow of water stops. This works great and prevents unwanted showers on my face and the bathroom walls from my right thumb slipping off the handheld water cut off...my dentist says my gums have improved (less bleeding during cleanings) and my mouth feels cleaner after meals after a quick blast with this thing...</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Wish it had more power.</li>
    <li> This is a nice system at an affordable price.  It was my first experience with a water jet system so I cannot compare to the more expensive models (like Waterpik) but I think it has adequate power to perform.  My only complaint is that the unit is pretty noisy.</li>
    <li> Works great, specially the optional water pressure setting.  Large water reservoir ensure you don&#x27;t have to rush through the cleaning or require refill.  The attachments are a bit on the short side, making it somewhat differcult to clean the back gums.  Would have been a 5 star review if the attachements are an inch longer.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it more stars but it leaks at the pick part. I don&#x27;t know how to stop it from leaking, I might have to send it back.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son, the dentist recommended a water pick to help get around his braces. After using for 6 months, his last dental visit had an excellent report &amp; they could tell a difference. Plus the price is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Interplak Water Jet for years and this new version is the most powerful of all.  I am always amazed at how much debris accumulates between and around my teeth that the Jet cleans out.  I&#x27;ve even tested it after brushing my teeth with a dentist recommended toothbrush and it still finds stuff that the toothbrush missed.  I purchased the portable, rechargeable version, which I take with me on vacation.  The water jet was recommended by my dentist, and I&#x27;m glad I followed his advice.</li>
    <li> I have implants and use this everyday.  It is loud and I usually get water on my sleeve.  It works great and has several attachments to use including 2 toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Hygienist gave my teeth/gums raving reviews.  Used this for six months and she noticed the difference.  For those who (hate) flossing this works in its place.</li>
    <li> This product broke after 90 days the hose began leaking and both Amazon and conair warranty expired.  I called conair and they said they would possibly replace it and send me a new but an internal review is needed.  Needless to say I never received a replacement.</li>
    <li> has large enough container that I do not have to stop and refill it before that I feel my teeth are clean</li>
    <li> Had the Interplak for a little less than 3 years and the pressure is now going. I tried bleach and white vinegar (thinking it could be mold or buildup) but nothing seems to help. I tried to take it apart to see if it was clogged but couldn&#x27;t quite get it apart. So I just put in an order for a  WaterPik tonight. Funny before the Interplak I had the WaterPik Ultra and that lasted for a little over 4 1/2 years. So taking into consideration the Interplak is cheaper, the price you get out of them (per year) is about the same. I will say the Ultra was well made. Let&#x27;s hope the Waterpik Aquarius Professional lasts about the same as the previous Waterpik I had!</li>
    <li> Never want to be without this.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son and his braces and /MARA system and it works wonders. The little drawer is difficult to keep lined up, but is a great little storage place to keep all attachments.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Incompatible with Australian power points - it might be an idea to specify this in the description of the item.  very disappointed</li>
    <li> the lid hinge is flimsy and the cord is short but overall this is an excellent product and value for money</li>
    <li> I expected this water jet to be good, since my last one was and I was not disappointed. It seems that  rarely these days do I find a product that is made with high quality, performs so well that I am thoroughly satisfied and cannot think of even one critique. It gets the job done, is easy to use and I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone who is interested in dental health. In addition, Amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected.  Much less than I would pay in the store.  Many more options also than I was aware. Very pleased</li>
    <li> I received this as a present for Christmas and though initially excited by the manufacturer&#x27;s claims, I was immediately let down by it&#x27;s lack of performance. First of all the &amp;#34;water jet&amp;#34; has no power at all, so it doesn&#x27;t matter how many &amp;#34;Exclusive Tips&amp;#34; they give you, it really isn&#x27;t  good for anything other than rinsing toothpaste out of your mouth. As for the &amp;#34;Sonic Technology&amp;#34; Conair knows better than to claim theirs does anything to remove plaque. First of all it runs on an AAA battery. The system plugs in, why couldn&#x27;t they have made it at least rechargeable? Second, if you compare it to a $5 Crest Sonic Toothbrush and try brushing you can feel how much better job the cheaper Crest model does. I also tried sticking it in a glass of water like the advertisements and the Crest easily creates twice as much water disruption. Consider too that a replacement brush head is $8, twice the price of the Crest model as well.&lt;br /&gt;Please trust me folks, if you buy this you will be severely disappointed. Look on Amazon for a Sonicare brush instead. I have seen them as cheap as $20 for the entry level ones. If you have normal, healthy teeth, this product is a Waste of Money!</li>
    <li> Works fine. My dentist is happy.</li>
    <li> Wish I discovered this product years ago. Makes my mouth feel so clean after using it. It got 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t feel solid, but it is working great so maybe it does deserve 5 stars. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> When pushing the On/Off button the unit it will slide away or tip over and not start. It takes one hand to hold-down the unit, one hand to push the button and  one hand to hold the hand set. Since I have only 2 hands, to get it going, and to stop I put the sprayer down into the sink and generally need to clean the mirror and wipe the counter top and my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s flimsy and cheaply made, it does it&#x27;s job but for the price, I expected something much sturdier. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Strong jet when you want it. Switches are not as hard to use with damp hands then some other units I&#x27;ve had. I like the tool variety, too.</li>
    <li> Rarely, if ever, do I take the time to write a review.  My experiences with products from Amazon sellers and Amazon as well, have been exceptional.  But I needed to pen this note about my recent purchase of the Interplak Swj1 Sonic Water Jet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As kids, we had our first Waterpik in the mid-70&#x27;s.  It had a rechargeable tooth brush and water pick feature all in one.  The second I owned was about 15 years ago.  It was a single function appliance with a water pick only.  They were both compact and  did the job without any flourishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the Interplak Swj1 Sonic Water Jet and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  At first glance, it looks the same as a Waterpik:  Water reservoir, handle, a coil of hose, storage for tips.  But using it was a completely disappointing experience compared to my past experiences with Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s flimsy.  It has an unnecessary lid on the reservoir (the Waterpik design simply allows the lid to be inverted and used as a cover for the appliance).  The &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; feature?  It&#x27;s nothing more than an A-battery driven vibrator.  It no where near approaches the vibratons-per-second of a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water picks, brushes, and other attachments insert into a bulky handle that&#x27;s tethered to a wiry coil of plastic tubing.  Unlike the Waterpik, the water picks on this Interplak appliance cannot be rotated with your fingers.  You must use your wrists to navigate the bulky handle sometimes depressing the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34;  or &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; buttons also located on the handle.  The water pressure on the appliance is weak, as well, even at it&#x27;s highest setting.  It&#x27;s timid, in fact, compared to a Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interplak offers, &amp;#34;...this water jet is very reasonably priced and costs less than most full sized water jets.  When you consider buying a water jet, sonic brush, and massaging tip, All-In-One is a real value.&amp;#34;  All-In-One is not a real value but an over-designed, underpowered imitation of its competitors, Waterpik and Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I am pleased about being able to do all aspects of oral care with one appliance.  I especially wanted the sonic feature.  My previous appliance did not have all the features of this one.  I will probably be able to comment more later as I have just begun to use it.</li>
