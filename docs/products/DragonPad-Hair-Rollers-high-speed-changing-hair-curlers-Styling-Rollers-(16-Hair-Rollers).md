<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too time consuming, impossible to sleep on them. Pool my hair out, when remove them. There is a better way.</li>
    <li> I had already bought Curlformers from Sally&#x27;s and loved them, but they were very expensive.  So I bought 2 more sets online (I have 3 girls and they all want their hair curled at the same time). One of the wands broke during the first use and many of the curlers had ends that were sealed shut!  I had to use a razor to open them up, so I could use them.</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME!! My daughter has very fine hair. Finding a way to give her mid length hair body, is really tricky. I dont want to use a curling iron, because it will damage her hair. So, we gave this a try.  I put some styling gel in her hair last night after her shower, and these were SUPER easy, and fun to put in. She slept very comfortably in them, and this morning taking them out was fast, and totally painless! She looked in the mirror and was absolutely elated!!!! Thank you so much, whoever came up with this idea!!! You are a genious!</li>
    <li> First of all, I haven&#x27;t tried these out on my hair yet. I have checked them out visually and have put a couple of them in my hair to see if the product will work for my hair. I haven&#x27;t set my entire head and let it dry yet. Why? There are not enough of these in the box!!! So here goes ... Visually, I don&#x27;t see any difference between these and Curlformers. Here&#x27;s the thing: if you have shoulder length hair, as I do, 9 of the rollers will be too short for your hair (that&#x27;s half the pack). Yet, 9 rollers will fit, and if you get a good price like the $7.99 it&#x27;s selling for today, that&#x27;s not bad for 9 rollers. Yet, I paid 12.99, so in reality, I paid $12.99 for 9 rollers b/c the 9 short ones won&#x27;t work for me. So just compare prices. How much does it cost to buy the long and wide rollers at Sally&#x27;s and how many do you get in the pack? I haven&#x27;t thoroughly checked yet, but I do know that the small packs of Curlformers are pricey. So .... overall, it&#x27;s a matter of comparing the price of this pack to the price of the Curlformers packs. I do hate that there are so many short curlers in this pack b/c I think this makes the advertisement and the picture on the box misleading. Most people who use these types of curlers have at least shoulder length hair, so why would half the curlers be soooooo short? For the false advertisement, I&#x27;m giving 3 stars. But because it is probably still a good price deal when compared to buying the individual packs of Curlformers, I&#x27;ll probably keep them. Wish I could send mine&#x27;s back and get the better price though! The price went down right after I ordered mine.</li>
    <li> I was quite pleased with these rollers.  I&#x27;ve heard others complain that they cannot sleep in these, I did not have that problem at all, but my hair is almost to my waist so maybe that&#x27;s why??  I also thought I was going to have the biggest tangled mess ever!  Nope! The only thing I am not crazy about is the plastic wand, it tends to come apart in mid pull!  I may buy a long, metal crochet hook.  It is also easiest to take them out by unrolling the curler (while in your hair) and then sliding out.  Others also complained that they didn&#x27;t get the full amount of 18, I did, but 1 was damaged (a small one).  I would like to buy more of the longer ones.  I found, too, that if I wanted a really long curl, I just used 2 of the curlers (either 1 long and 1 short, 2 long, or 2 short).  Also if you&#x27;re like me and live in a very humid state, the curl doesn&#x27;t tend to last long.  There was still a wave to it though the next day!  I have fine, long hair and most curls tend to be gone within an hour because of the length (and gravity), but not with these!  OVERALL I would recommend these curlers!  Very impressed and pleased with the cost, too.  I see the price is more than double what I paid, so I guess I got mine at the right time!  Hope this information is useful to someone :) Thank you!</li>
    <li> This pruduct is very gentle on the hair it works and you don&#x27;t have to apply heat. I put them in and went to bed beuatiful look in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I am thrilled with this product for the following three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) It take only about 10-15 minutes for me to set my hair in these rollers. The giant crochet hook pulls your hair through the rollers, and I can set my modest amount of long hair in the 2 longest sizes of rollers included in one package. I would like another package, but my hair curls well with the 10 or so rollers I&#x27;m putting in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Sleeping in them is easy! Unlike traditional foam rollers, these are easy to sleep in. I often wake up in the morning on my side with the rollers under my face. This sounds really uncomfortable, but it isn&#x27;t. (In full disclosure, I will move the rollers out from under my face if I roll over and hit the snooze button.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) My curls last pretty much all day, even in the moderately humid climate of the Northeastern US. I attribute this to the fact that I can wet set my hair (thus breaking the hydrogen bonds, as all you cosmetologists know), which provides a stronger set. I also use mousse before setting my hair. Because I&#x27;m using so few rollers, I do recommend using damp hair, as opposed to wet hair. If my hair is too wet, I sometimes wake up with damp hair in the rollers. Unlike foam rollers, however, I don&#x27;t have to set my hair completely dry, because my hair does dry in these curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to friends and coworkers, but I do think you should buy two sets. If you have long hair, you&#x27;ll definitely need 2 sets of the pink and yellow rollers (the longest). If you have short hair, one set might be enough, but I suspect you&#x27;d have the opposite problem I do: half of the rollers would just be too long for your short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t bought a second set yet, mostly because I&#x27;m cheap and can get away with one set. Any short haired folks want to go halfsies with me on a second set? I&#x27;ll send you my short rollers... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and yes, the directions on the box are hysterical and nonsensical, but the bottom line is thread your hair through the roller with the giant crochet hook and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I just received these yesterday and I slept on them last night.  This morning I have beautiful curls that have lasted through the morning (usually my curling iron curls are dead by the time I get to work). I have fine blonde hair, but kind of a lot of it, and it comes down past my shoulders, to about about where my armpit starts.      I put them in last night with more than damp but not sopping wet hair.  The process was pretty easy. I had watched a bunch of youtube videos before I did so I could really see the process.  My hair got stuck in them twice, but it was easy to get it out and redo it.  They are a little short for my hair, I had to pull them down farther from the root to make sure the ends got curled, but in the end I think it made for a more natural look.  Sleeping on them wasn&#x27;t too bad... I think it would have been worse is the curlers were pulled up closer to my roots.    I was afraid that the curls were going to come out too tight and perm-y but they came out great.  I only used the larger rollers because my hair is on the longer side.  That also forced me to put more hair into each roller, which I think is what helped it come out looking natural and not like I got a weird perm.      Overall I&#x27;m really happy with them, and I&#x27;m glad to have an alternative to heating my hair.    Edit:  I&#x27;ve had these for over a month now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them!  The curls last all day and into the night, especially if I put them in really damp from showering and then sleep on them.  Although if I spritz my hair with water and put them on the drier side I can sit with them on for about an hour and they&#x27;ll last through the day but they look a little tired at night.       I always get compliments when I use them to do my hair, and it takes less than five minutes to do them in the morning.  I brought them along when I went to a work conference and it worked out great.</li>
    <li> When I receive the product, the first thing I noticed is that there is no instruction and the wording on the package is just grammatically incorrect and doesn&#x27;t make sense.  I searched online for other tutorial videos and figured out how it is used.  It is fairly easy to use (took me a couple tries to figure out), but the rollers have a very strong smell of plastic.  When they are so close to your face it&#x27;s definitely a negative.  If you are sensitive to smell, you probably want to avoid this product!    After I washed my hair, I blow dried my hair and put the rollers on, and heated with blow dryer for another 2 minutes.  This is when the plastic smell became intolerable. The first time I left them on my head for the whole night and my hair became too curly.  The 2nd time I left them on for about 2 hours and the results are much closer to what I had wanted.  My hair was wavy instead of curly.  The effect does not last very long (maybe until the afternoon next day) since I don&#x27;t use any styling product with it.  I am generally happy with the product because it&#x27;s pretty cheap compare to the &#x27;real&#x27; one and it&#x27;s easier/faster than a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have 4a/b type natural hair, which is just about shoulder length, and is typically difficult to curl.  Yet when I tested a roller or two in my wet hair, after about an hour, my hair was (loosely)curled. Just a note, if you have my hair type I would not recommend a wet curl.  You may want to blow dry and/or straighten you hair before you set in rollers to avoid a frizzy curl.</li>
    <li> This product was a great purchase..it was quick,it was easy,and the results were amazing..Normally it takes hours for you to curl your whole head&amp;your arm ends up cramping and hurting.And also the curling irons damage the hair..this took me 7 minutes to do my whole head,and i have long hair down to the middle of my back and i let it dry naturally with out a hair dryer and i had full lovely spiral curls..i wouldnt recommend sleeping on them though. They get a bit ouchy unless you wear a cap over them..i tried it once and woke up with a head ache..</li>
    <li> I bought these curlers because they are less expensive than curlformers.  They arrived very quickly.  The packaging does not have good directions, but you can find directions on youtube and the curlers are pretty easy to use.  The only time I had problems with the hook coming apart was when I trying to pull through too large a section of hair.  I bought a package of curlformers out of curiosity.  Both products are very similar and I feel work very well.  I used a very light hold spray before using the curlers and after allowing my hair to dry (naturally or with a blow dryer) the curl stayed until I washed my hair the next day.  If I use a curling iron I lose the curl within hours.  The only issue I have with this product is that all the curlers curl in the same direction.</li>
    <li> These curlers make beautiful curls, i use it for my 3 year old and she just thinks they are hair bows. She even took a nap in them. However these are meant for short hair if it is past your ears it will only be useful to curl just the end of the hair. Curlformers are made for people with longer hair and are way more expensive. I got these when it was six bucks. still need 2 packs for the best results.</li>
    <li> These really are amazing curlers. I&#x27;m so surprised by all of the negative reviews... I can only assume they are by users who don&#x27;t know how to use these. The instructions on the box are just jibberish. I suggest you just go to youtube and search \\&quot;curl formers\\&quot; and there are plenty of instructional videos. I have shoulder length, very thick hair and ordered 2 boxes and I think I&#x27;m going to need a third and thats with using every single curler.</li>
    <li> I have no complaint with the product. I works really well. I just wish there where more. And this is where my only problem with it(the seller/manufacturer?) is. The description clearly says: \\&quot;18 Hair Rollers in a package along with the hair feeding tool.\\&quot;, but I only got 14 rollers. I wasn&#x27;t shocked by this because some of the other reviewers complained about it. So maybe the product description needs to be updated to just say 14 or something is up.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a cheap alternative to the curlformers and found this product. I didnt know until after I purchased it that it was a complete bootleg of them (curlformers inventor wrote a letter).   When I used it on my thick hair the wand kept coming apart in 2 the plastic it is made up is cheap and wouldnt stay. But once I ggot over that hurdle and put them in it actually worked. The next morning my hair was curled.   I dont like that there is no option to buy different sizes.</li>
    <li> This product should not have this lady  with long hair. This curlers are too short. Definitely not for har longer than 10\\&quot;. Some curlers might fit only short hair. Eventually I returned this product.</li>
    <li> These rollers were easy to use, but probably hold curl better when put in wet hair and allowed to dry.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers! I bought them for my daughter who, like me, has thin fine hair that does not hold curl from a curling iron for more than an hour. We just put these in at bedtime on her wet hair with a little gel and she has perfect curls all day long!</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 boxes after reading reviews but I should have ordered 3. My hair is short but kinda thick and is curly. Didnt think this would work for me a black girl but it works dried fast and better than I had expected. It made the hair look flat ironed. I dont know my hair type but Im going to add pictures so that if you have my hair type and want to try something different you might give these a try. The first time was time consuming and I had to keep spray handy because my hair was drying faster than I could get it done. Im sure it would be quicker next time though</li>
    <li> Material is a very hard and cheap plastic. Such a struggle trying to get these into my hair, plus the cheap rod occasionally snagged and pulled my hair out. Anything that damages my hair &#x3D; NO THANKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and invest in some Curlformers.</li>
    <li> Hair gets tangled too easily and it is extremely difficult to get it through the roller without riping out hair.</li>
    <li> This product is based on a brilliant idea. The original product is what I had purchased, but since I had more hair I got this cheaper substitute to see if it was good. The product still makes bouncy, long lasting curls - but they are smaller so make sure you don&#x27;t buy this if you have long hair. Also, the edges of the rollers have already started to fray after a few uses. It&#x27;s worth it to buy the more expensive versions of this if you plan to use it a lot - but if it&#x27;s for only occasional special uses then this is a great purchase. Put mousse in your hair while it&#x27;s damp, put the curlers in and let your hair dry and you&#x27;ll have waves and curls and body that last till your next wash!</li>
    <li> Works exactly how they said. My girlfriend loved and recommended for all your friends. good buy this hair Roller. try it</li>
    <li> I received my knock off Curlformers and counted 18 in the package which I was happy about and they are so easy to use. Makes the hair smooth and curly as advertised. Worth the money! [[ASIN:B003YTMG5Q Hair Rollers - high-speed changing hair curlers Styling Rollers]]</li>
    <li> I tried these curlers on my four-almost-five-year-old-daughter. They were as easy as everyone says... BUT I needed some tips before hand. Don&#x27;t count on the instructions to help you (at least not the \\&quot;english\\&quot; version of them) It was pretty ridiculous. Even if the google-translated words were used and spelled right, it just didn&#x27;t make sense.     I found a helpful youtube video that gave some great pointers. I think by using the pointers in the video I was able to do it more quickly and without hurting my daughters head (both putting them in and pulling them out) The video can be found here (cut and paste &#x3D; youtu(dot)be/B11tbSmaDJI) [update: it looks like Amazon doesn&#x27;t care for my youtube link. So... go to youtube, search curlformers and find \\&quot;wunderwoman910\\&quot; -- She explains it best]. If you take the three minutes it takes to watch this video, you will be very glad you did. I watched a few others on youtube and this was the best -- showing tips for wrapping the hair, pulling the curlers out and shaping the curl. It was VERY helpful.    Here are some things that may help you...    * Like everyone said, there are only 14 rollers (NOT 16) in each pack. 6 long, 8 short.   * The long rollers stretch out to be about 12-13 inches. So if your hair is longer than that, from scalp to end, you are out of luck. I even tried to put two short ones together. It might work for someone    who doesn&#x27;t wiggle like a 4 year old, but you would still end up with a kinky curl.  * The short curlers are about 8 inches long when they are stretched out.  * I purchased two packages, based on the reviews, and I still think I should have bought more. I sectioned my daughters long hair into quarters. Each quarter held 2-3 long curlers... they were large sections of hair so I was worried how they would turn out... but the curls looked beautiful. Still, I would like to try it again with smaller sections of hair and more rollers.  * Like I said, my daughter is close to 5. She has an ultra-sensitivescalp (or maybe I&#x27;m just too rough on her head) These rollers didn&#x27;t hurt her at all. Even when I thought for sure it would hurt her, she said it didn&#x27;t. I was very pleased.   * Her hair is probably 13 inches long and it took me about 20 minutes, first try, to \\&quot;roll\\&quot; her hair.  * These are soft rollers but not really soft enough to sleep in. If you want to let it air dry, you will need to plan several hours. I actually did it before bedtime and hoped my daughter would fall asleep. At first she was uncomfortable and complained a little. But the draw of bouncy curls in the morning was enough to help her keep them in (which she couldn&#x27;t have done on her own anyway because they are too difficult for a child to remove) It only took her a little longer to fall asleep and eventually she gave in.  * The curlers are surprisingly secure, but not in a bad way. There is no way these will just \\&quot;fall out\\&quot; over night. The curls didn&#x27;t look kinked or weird from sleeping in them all night.  * After a bath, i put a little curl-friendly mousse in and set the curlers for her to sleep in. I sprayed some curl-friendly hairspray on the curls when we were done styling.  * When my daughter came home from a long day at kindergarten, her hair was barely wavy but it was VERY full of body. I was disappointed the curls didn&#x27;t last but I guess that is what I get for living in AZ where, on the first of September, it&#x27;s 110 degrees. Nothing can withstand this heat. So, I am interested how it will turn out when it is cooler outside.    That&#x27;s it. My biggest suggestion is to watch the video!    Good luck -- the curls are beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I learned about this product from clients at my old job and was very excited to use them on my stick-straight hair. When I received the box it looked like it had been used. It was ripped and smashed but the products inside appeared to be ok. It took a couple tries to get it to work but eventually got the hang of it. My complaints are that the wand used to pull the hair through comes apart almost with every pull. I&#x27;m either going to buy a new one or use electrical tape to hold mine together. With such an important part of the process, you&#x27;d think that wouldn&#x27;t happen. Also, very uncomfortable to sleep in. I don&#x27;t recommend it. And last, there were not enough curlers for my long hair. I have fine hair but it&#x27;s long. I had to double up the short curlers and still ran out. Again, I am going to have to buy more. I think I am going to buy the more expensive curlers just to see the difference and to know I am getting only the longer set.   The positives are they do work. And again, I have stick-straight hair. The first time I tried them I didn&#x27;t let the hair dry enough and there was still a little wave. And when I let them sit overnight (aside from the lack of sleep) the curl was great. (again, where I had curlers in) Since there weren&#x27;t enough curlers, the uncurled hair looked funny so I tied it up for the day. When I took my hair down that evening there were still curls!! That is why I am going to buy more. With a little tweaking, it&#x27;s a great product and believe it or not, I recommend it. I&#x27;ve seen how it looks in others hair as well as mine. For those having trouble, be patient and try again.</li>
    <li> I have long, thin hair, but lots of it.  I found these very difficult to use.  I could not comfortably pull my hair through these using the hooks.  Waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> These work great if you have shoulder length hair. I had long hair that stretched just below my shoulder blades and they werent long enough to cover the full length of my hair.  So I ended up buying two sets.  However they work well and was quite happy with the results.</li>
    <li> The picture clearly shows 18 rollers but there were only 14 in the box.  I had to order a whole other box to have enough.  4 rollers isn&#x27;t worth $30!  Hopefully the new box has the full amount.  Will re-review if this happens with the new box!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe no one came up with this earlier.  Don&#x27;t take too large sections, have a sprayer with water handy and keep the hair very wet and it will be easy after a few attempts.  I screwed mine up the first time with too much setting gel but can&#x27;t wait to try it again.  I just wish there were a few more rollers in the pack.</li>
    <li> The curlers do work which is great but I have own ones that were a lot better.  I thought the quality was poor. I ordered 2 sets and both sticks broke the first time I used them. Also with over half of the curlers, one of the ends were still stick together so in order to actually use them you have to break them. It was more time consuming and pretty ridiculious that I had to break a new purchase to use it.  Also these are really short, I have a short 4c afro so it was the perfect length but if your hair touches your neck these will probably be too short for you. And you will need atleast 2 packs</li>
    <li> This item arrived within the 2 days promised-and that&#x27;s where it ended.  I was missing rollers, the hair tool to use the rollers AND the price had gone down within 2 days of me ordering!!  Thank goodness I have Amazon Prime and they responded to my issue within hours.  Full refund, already done.  I didn&#x27;t have to worry about returning the unusable product either!  I do quite a bit of shopping on Amazon and will continue to do so because of their great customer service!  As for this product, don&#x27;t bother....</li>
    <li> this product is not for short hair it may work on longer hair and the hair is hard to pull thru the roller with the needle and it tangles.</li>
    <li> Best for shoulder-length hair or shorter, these are so easy and do exactly as advertised. My 6 year old loves them - she looks like a birthday party with all the colorful curlers in, and she sleeps comfortably in them overnight.  They make the sweetest curls!</li>
    <li> I ordered these curlers with the best of expectations, but they came minus the hair feeding tool.  They aren&#x27;t much good without it.</li>
    <li> This set works just as well as the original Curlformer set I bought but at a lower price.  I&#x27;ve got long thick hair so I needed more than the 20 rollers that came in the original set but didn&#x27;t want to purchase another one at that price.</li>
    <li> This product is just as good as the expensive brand I purchased in a local store. I&#x27;m so glad when I need to buy more the store was out of them because I saved a lot of money buying this set. I needed these for my daughters Middle School Show Choir and I would recommend at least a couple of packages if you don&#x27;t already have some- this package isn&#x27;t enough to do my daughters thick hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I don&#x27;t know why people would pay more for the expensive ones from Sally. They do what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> First off, they take forever to put in. By the time I was ready to curl the back, I had to re-wet my hair and I had just washed it. Second the hook ends up pulling out your hair. The curls were just ok, but my hair was left with a lot of static. The only good things these have going for them is they are super quick to take out.</li>
    <li> I too only received 14 instead of 18 curlers! Would have given it a zero if I could. Don&#x27;t buy from Improving Lifesytle! Curlers may be great. Don&#x27;t know since I will have to send them back without trying them. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> they came in a weird japanese bag with no directions. so im not really sure how to use them, sorry</li>
    <li> Arrived early, they really work as well as the name brand. I love love love these. I have short, shoulder length, thin hair and all 16 rollers are plenty enough for my entire head. If I&#x27;m in need of more curls, I just separate the existing curls. It only takes me ten minutes of touch-up time and I&#x27;m out the door. These rock.</li>
    <li> The positive reviews on this product have got to be made up.  When I got this package it was smashed to crap. The wand broke when I tried to use it on the first try and half of these were sealed shut on one end.  I am angry I wasted my money on these. I&#x27;d be happy to send you a picture if you want proof. The material used is similar to the plastic they make Chinese finger traps out of.  You know, because says I have sexy curly hair like having to shave it off after getting trapped in plastic for a year.  Not the mention that the directions on the back of the package is complete nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation Steps (Yes, let&#x27;s operate on something, Doctors)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Control the hair at 60%-70% of humidity of the zone. (um, do what now?)&lt;br /&gt;2. Make stick according to shape you want. (Yay, just like play dough but stiff plastic that&#x27;s called a stick)&lt;br /&gt;  A. Count the stick with cirde (yes, it says cirde) that you want. (Yes A, not #3)&lt;br /&gt;  B. Aelect the stick flow direction of veins. (What the heck does aelect mean? I didn&#x27;t know hair had veins, no one told me this was going to be a bloody operation, nurse get me some bandaids!)&lt;br /&gt;  C. Select the stick according to size. (Awesome, where my sticks at?  I have one and it already broke.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Select the liquid medicine and the time according to the hair. (liquid medicine?! Did you mean hair perm solution? Let&#x27;s not all drink perm solution at once)&lt;br /&gt;Hotting perm time 5-20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Colding perm time 15-20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash clean hair (Hurry, wash your clean hair, stat! What sort of operation do you think we are running here?)&lt;br /&gt;5. Dry the hair with towel after the fix the shape (yeah, I got nothing out of this step)&lt;br /&gt;6. Remove the stick, wahsing hair and styling hair. (wait, where was the stick suppose to go? and more importantly what does &amp;#34;wahsing&amp;#34; mean?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this review turned out to be silly but I&#x27;m serious about my advice, don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> Curls come out perfect. Hair just have to be soaking wet and use setting lotion so curls will last longer. No frizzy hair and hair dries fast. I have a 4b hair texture and this product is amazing and fast to dry.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re amazing I love them my hair looks fabulous . And it&#x27;s great that I don&#x27;t have to dammage my hair with a hot iron</li>
    <li> This version of Curlformers are great to have curls in short time with no heat and no hair damage for e cheapest price. I tried it on my 4b hair and leave nice curls, also tried in long relaxed hair and the result was beautiful. If you have a beauty salon and dont wanna damage clients hair with heat tools this is a great option!</li>
    <li> Same as curl formers! They worked great! I have relaxed hair and they worked great on my hair. They also worked great on my friends&#x27; hair and they both have natural hair. They were worth more than what I paid for.</li>
    <li> it works it does curl my hair, however they are poorly made, the hook doesn&#x27;t even snap in place so you you are using a long one the hook get stuck  and you have to push the roller up to get to the other half to pull the hair though, but shipment was pretty fast for international shipping.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED 3 SETS , THEY TOOK 4 WEEKS TO ARRIVE , BUT THEY WERE WELL WORTH THE WAIT, MY 10 YR OLD HAS FAIRLY SHORT HAIR , THESE GAVE HER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPIRAL CURLS EVER</li>
    <li> There was an assortment of sizes which I liked. The ends of some of them are partially opened, I have another brand that does not gap open. Some of them are sealed on the ends and you have force them apart.</li>
    <li> Shipping was good. Product arrived earlier, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy with actual product. There were some units with sealed opening that hook could not go through.  needed cutting with scissors. Also some mesh had plastic stuck to it.....guess it is an aftermarket product ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not curl transitioning short hair nicely. Will try smaller diameter before I completely write off product..... Nice idea but is not as easy as others say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully smaller size gives better results</li>
    <li> All the curlers curl the hair in the same directions and unlike other brands all the colors are the same size. As a result I am disappointed and will have to buy additional items elsewhere</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dolls actually, For boil washing curls.&lt;br /&gt;Not much to say since I doubt most people looking at these are buying them for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They worked good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;d work on real hair. I already have super curly hair soooo.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them, but they seem to be just like curlformers…can&#x27;t go wrong for knock off curlformers at a way cheaper price.</li>
    <li> When you buy generic, yo get generic. I Remember using this 2x. you don&#x27;t get enough rollers in the kit, i had to use 2 curlers on one piece of hair. I don&#x27;t have rock long hair. Had to super glue the pulling tool together. It kept falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;With patience you Can Get nice curls. May take 1 hour for hair to dry while using hand dryer. use of bonnet might be faster. I slept, uncomfortably in mine.</li>
    <li> it is really what I needed, hope to make beautiful hair for universary dinner, can&#x27;t wait !!!!!!!! thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Saved a lot of time in my salon this year with doing  updos!!! Great results!!! Would highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to create curls, but its quality is too bad. The stick was broken while I was using it second time. I had to return it to Amazon. I thought I wasted my money on this.</li>
    <li> Ow ow ow! Even if you get past the awkward and painful snagging of the hook pulling your hair through the tube, these are extremely difficult to sleep it. They are plastic and dig into your head. Also there are a lot of tiny ones in this package and would only be useful to someone with very short hair. If you were to try this method, get a pack of long ones. My hair is usually shoulder length or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have better luck with softer bendy rollers if you want to sleep in them.</li>
    <li> I did read the reviews but thought they would be ok for my daughters bobbed hair. Nope. More than half are waaayy too short.</li>
    <li> Okay works just like the real ones</li>
    <li> And I didn&#x27;t unwrap it from its original packaging until 6 weeks after I got it. Now the curlers are completely useless until I find a similar hook</li>
    <li> When they arrived, I had to look up how to use them (no directions included). . .more than 3/4 of the curlforms were sealed on one end and I had to pry/ cut them open.  I had ordered two sets.  Good thing, because one of the feeder tools broke while I was trying to pry the tubes open.  The other one broke during normal use (curling me hair)  The listing says the two lengths are over 7&amp;#34; and over 13&amp;#34;.  Not even close.  The lengths are 6&amp;#34; and 9&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated as &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; because they are easy to use, and the curls are phenomenal.</li>
    <li> It hurt my scalp. Maybe its because i have 4c type hair. I would not recommend it for women with very thick natural hair</li>
    <li> I also bought the 50cm (blue and green) and the small ones rolled my hair perfectly. These were inexpensive and you get same results as the curlformers at Sally&#x27;s. I would definitely recommend the rollers if you want to save money.</li>
    <li> Curl very well very easy to use.</li>
    <li> If your hair is longer than neck length, most of these rollers will be too short for your hair. Also, if your  hair is regular or thick, this box does not contain enough rollers. If you have short, thin hair, it will be okay for you. The girl on the box wouldn&#x27;t be able to use these rollers at all!   Also, the handle on the stick used to pull hair through the roller falls apart with every attempted use, you need to wrap strong tape around it to keep it together.  Bottom line, this product does work but only if you have short/thin hair. If your hair is longer, a product like this will work, but the assortment in this box is basically useless. They should do a better job of informing customers of this so that people like me don&#x27;t waste our money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product yesterday and was so excited to use it. So I washed my hair and then I put a lot of extra hold mouse then I began. I let my hair sit in the rollers for 4 hours until my hair was completely dry. Once the curlers came out, it did look like nice for a mere 10 minutes!!!! Once I ran my fingers through it, the next thing I know my hair was literally straight like I didnt waste 4 hours with it!!! I am really disappointed! I will try to use this once more before I return it to see if there is any hope but I doubt there will be. And this is my first review that I have ever done.  A lot of times, I think the reviews are fake so dont get fooled</li>
    <li> Good product to add to your curlformers. The stick was not as strong. I used the curlformers stick and they worked perfect!!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets, because I have below shoulder length hair. The directions on the box are a joke - I viewed several you tube tutorials (you should too, if you choose to buy these) and STILL could not operate these things smoothly. My hair would get tangled while trying to put them in place, not go in smoothly, etc. I&#x27;m usually very good with hair implements, and love the look of spiral curls, so these were a big disappointment.  I&#x27;ll try again, but so far 2 thumbs down!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3TWTNU4TEKEJM]]I broke the stick within the first 5 mins! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
    <li> Still waiting for them. It&#x27;s been almost two months, I still don&#x27;t have the product. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My stick broke before I even finished my whole head. That sucked. I can go to my local beauty supply and buy another tho. The rollers seem to be of good&lt;br /&gt;Quality</li>
    <li> My hair, at the time of buying these was only to my shoulder and these things were way too short. They also didn&#x27;t set curls very well in my hair, so I gave them to a friend with very thin hairs and a decent mop on their head.</li>
    <li> I ended up throwing away a number of these rollers. They are poorly constructed.</li>
    <li> Cheap cheap cheaaaaap! The want broke after my second go at using it and the was so poorly put together. I have thick hair and I honestly implore Black women with THICK hair NOT to use this product. Terribly made and does more damage than good</li>
    <li> I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THESE MOST OF THEM DID NOT HAVE ONE END OPEN.&lt;br /&gt;I AM GLAD I DID NOT SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON THEM. I WILL CHECK OUT THE&lt;br /&gt;REALL ONES. THNAK YOU.</li>
    <li> ehhh...they&#x27;re ok. I purchased these to supplement the real curlformers I already had, so I was able to compare and contrast. Here&#x27;s what I found (also, I have &amp;#34;4b&amp;#34; natural African-American hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;These actually hold their tension longer than curlformers do. After continued use, curlformers can lose their shape, and therefore the tension used to smooth the natural curls suffers. The material of these rollers is a bit harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem a bit more durable. The curlformers also, after continued use, begin to wear and tear at the openings. There are plastic caps at the end of each roller to cover the wiring or netting or whatever the material is, so it doesn&#x27;t snag and rip one&#x27;s hair. These haven&#x27;t had that issue yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The plastic caps aforementioned are really poorly made on these. There are bits of plastic remaining along the caps&#x27; seams that can rip the hair. If this were a quality product, those parts would&#x27;ve been shaved and rounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hook thingy is also unusually sharp at the seams, which made me scared to use it. When applying these, I used my curlformers hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, both these and the real curlformers make beautiful curls- these work just like curlformers. They&#x27;re just poor quality in different ways than the real ones are poor quality. Both are not extremely long-lasting lol. I gave these a 4 because in my book, they&#x27;re on the same level as the real curlformers they&#x27;re imitating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use either anymore because of risk of breakage, and it just takes too long, but when both were operant, I gravitated toward the curlformers, as they were much gentler on my hair before the caps started to break.</li>
    <li> I just love thses rollers!!  They really do work, and my hair held the curl all day long.  I have mostly natural, neck length, Black (AA) 3A/B hair, and these curlers gave me tons of curls, with no frizzy ends.  It was super easy to use them (WATCH THE CURLFORMER TUTORIALS ON YOUTUBE BEFORE USING!!), and the first time i used them i didnt lose any hair or hurt myself in any way.  I found the curlers to be more gentle on my hair than traditional foam rollers, and they weren&#x27;t harder to sleep on than normal rollers.  If you&#x27;re used to sleeping with curlers, or rods in your hair, this is exactly the same.  The first time I used them it took me about an hour or so, and that was because I was going as slow as possible, and watching tv.  The second time I was done in half the time it takes when I use traditional rollers.  I received all my curlers in the box, and I also ordered two boxes to make sure I had enough of each length.  The quality of the rollers are great, and I had no problems with any of them.  Only caution is they might not work as well for ear length, or shorter, hair....but my NL hair curled just fine!     Best part is the box...those instructions are HILARIOUS!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great because it comes in multiple sizes. Basically what you do is put the \\&quot;curlformer\\&quot; on the rod, attach the rod to your hair, pull and the roller lies vertically against your head in a spiral (look a youtube videos. it really helps!) They are easy to use once you get the hang of it.   Tips  -don&#x27;t force too much hair into one curler  -wear overnight with hair slightly wet  -and put hair/gel product in before use  What i didn&#x27;t like is that they are meant for shorter hair (not like the girl on the box in the picture with long hair)  I would recommend curlformers for Sally&#x27;s Beauty. More expensive, but better sizes.</li>
    <li> The product is simply shoddy and poor poor quality. The rollers are made of stretchy plastic. So it&#x27;s ok. But the packaging, the hook and over all feel of the product is poor. Looked as if you got it from a dollar store. For hair styling, you would expect some standard of quality. If you are into &#x27;if it works-the rest don&#x27;t care&#x27; attitude, go ahead with the WSWS product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hook is narrow. So definitely not made for thick hair or medium thick hair-even if your hair is short. The WSWS curlformers works fine only if you want thin tight curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather prefer wide curlers where there isn&#x27;t much strain on the hair. I am returning these and will try the extra wide curls.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 2 stars because I had a terribly long wait to recieve it. After about one month and my contacting the seller, I was told there was some problem with customs. I asked for a refund which I did receive and the seller also still sent the product. As for the rollers, they were somewhat difficult to install and the wand was very flimsy and kept pulling apart. Once my hair dried, the results were not as good as I expected but I have coarse, kinky textured hair. I think they may work better with a setting lotion applied or on dry, stretched hair with a styling product.</li>
    <li> Just no. It doesn&#x27;t work. They ripped out some of my hair. The stick bends and will almost break. No.</li>
    <li> very hard to use. most of the rollers were messed up and broke my hair. not user friendly at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try these so I finally bought some because they were on sale. Unfortunately I had a really hard time putting them in myself and when I got them in right the ends always left a funny crease in my hair, especially closer to my scalp (really hard to start directly at the root). Maybe these would work if I had someone put them in for me, but the whole process was kind of a disaster and very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This product workmanship of this product is poor.  Most of the rollers I received in my package had to be cut open at one end because they were fused together during construction.&lt;br /&gt;The  hair roller wand /hair feeding tool falls apart with every attempted use, you will need to wrap strong tape around it to keep it together.&lt;br /&gt;These are for shorter length hair.  If your hair stretches below your shoulder blades these are not long enough to cover the full length of your hair. If you have thick hair you will need about two packs.  That said, after cutting these &#x27;curlformers&#x27; open and taping the hair pulling wand they worked to give my hair some lose curls.  I kept these but I would not buy this particular item again.</li>
    <li> I have loved using these on my daughter&#x27;s shoulder length hair.  The long ones are just right for her short hair, and they give her a lot of cute curls.  Unfortunately I bought them to use on me!  With my hair (about the length pictured on the box), they will curl only the ends and only the front half of my head.  I&#x27;d need a second set to get all the way around my hair.  Also, if you haven&#x27;t used this type of thing before, note that they take some time to work.  You start with wet hair and it needs to be completely dry before you take them out or you lose the majority of the curl.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and purchased 4 packages. Each package had different amounts of rollers and a different assortment of long and short rollers. I ended up with mostly short rollers that I can&#x27;t even use. 3 of the 4 packages came with an extension piece, but no hook to pull the hair through the roller. (Can&#x27;t use the single extension piece without a hook to attach to it.) So it&#x27;s not like I can even give these extra boxes away... I later used the product on a 11 year-old with very thin hair. It worked for her, but I used tiny amounts of hair and gel to keep the hold. If I did the same thing for myself, I&#x27;d need another 4 boxes to get the amount of the longer length curlers I needed. I would have returned the product but we were in the middle of a move, and the time limit passed for me to send them back.</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair product I have ever purchased.  Stay away, this is cheap and not worth the material it is made from</li>
    <li> These curlers are top notch, high quality and easy to use, even for extreme beginners. The one thing I do want to warn you about is the hair damage that can occur with very fine/thin hair like mine. First, it will seem to work fairly well, but you will see several hairs in the curlers once you&#x27;re done. Second, the style looks too harsh and forced, like you burned your hair in the curler, or went to sleep on them. (To be fair, I did sleep on them.) But the curls definitely stay for a while. For me, they stayed through 2 days sleeping on them, and only washing my hair caused them to flatten. For the girls with thicker hair, I would recommend you try this for sure!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review this item I didn&#x27;t get it. Was told it was out of stock. Wish I had the others were out of sight. My daughter gets great reviews every time I do her hair.</li>
    <li> Be warned this is not as good a quality as the ones that cost a fortune.  However, they do work great!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughters very thin fine hair. The curlers take a little time and practise putting in,  but once in made pretty curls. However the plastic wand that u use to put them in broke,  so now they are useless.:</li>
    <li> Great product. They are the exact same as the real Curlformers. Nothing different except the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter. They work great if you have long hair. I thought they would be soft enough for her to sleep in but they are not the best for that. But they do give you the curl it promises.</li>
    <li> These thing are more complicated than I remember them as a child. I tried them once and it took  so much time, I haven&#x27;t touched them since. I prefer just waking up in the morning and using the hot iron.</li>
    <li> This is a great item and my daughter loves them the are easy to use and give you great curl. I think everyone who likes spiral curls should own them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved these high rollers the first time I ordered. So I waa always searching for more. Delivery on this was alittle slow but Im awaiting it..</li>
    <li> no direction as to how to use them. They are just sitting in my closet.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews that gave 1 star, it was obvious that those people did not do their research before purchasing the item.  If you hair is past shoulder length you need the long/extra long and narrow/wide.  Being that I knew what I was buying, these were GREAT.  I am growing out my relaxed hair, and decided to use Carols Daughter Curly transition kit, and I needed something to make my hair curly so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about damaging my hair with a flat iron.  These were recommended by the CD&#x27;s website, and they were a great investment.  I first bought a 36 pack (ebay)because I know it would take more than 16 to do my hair, so these were to supplement.  I ended up using 34, but next time I can separate the sections smaller for more definition.  The curls came out great.  I am not a person who does their own hair ever (I go to a salon every week), and this was SO simple.  Took me about 45 minutes to complete.  I decided to sit under the dryer for 30 minutes, and sleep in them, then another 30 minutes in the morning.  My curls look so good.  I wish I could insert a picture.</li>
    <li> Usually with this type of roller, one color is clockwise and another color is counterclockwise, but not with these.  They all go in the same direction.  If that is what you want, then they work fine, except for the fact that some of the ends are stuck together and you have to force them open.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product unless 1) you have access to extra curling wands 2) you have very short hair and 3) you have time to pry open one end of each curler as they are sealed/stuck together. I purchased two sets of curlers and both wands broke IN THE SAME TWO PLACES (where the two sticks adjoin and on the hook itself) before I was halfway done curling my hair. The curlers were stuck/sealed shut on one end and were very difficult to get open to pull the wand through. Also, the &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; curlers where shorter than listed, only 6 inches long NOT 7 inches. In theory, this product should work.There is nothing high speed about only being able to complete half a head of hair and no way to finish it because the tools break.</li>
    <li> These are great for curling thick hair but, the only problem is if you have longer hair there 8 for shoulder length hair and 8 for shortert hair. You need to have longer ones if you hair is longer than shoulder length. I really do like the hair rod in this package.</li>
    <li> I think this product is primarily for longer, processed hair as oppose to natural hair.  On the very first day I received this product, I broke the curlformer rod.  I&#x27;ve since ordered 2 more which is more money I&#x27;ve spent.  For that reason, I don&#x27;t care for this product and may try to resale on Ebay.</li>
    <li> They work wonderful and stay in overnite. If you have natural hair this works and easy to use. They are much better then traditional rollers.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely the worst! You get what you pay for! Number 1:  the needle rod would not stay connected. Number 2: There were 3 different lengths of shapers that would not cover your entire head.  Number 3:  They didn&#x27;t work. If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that my money was refunded, then this would have been a 1 star I Hate It review.</li>
    <li> I got great results on my African American natural hair.  After the spirals fell a little, the hair was still straight and flat enough for me to pull it into a bun. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Loved Them.....Excellent product at bargain prices!!! I highly reccommend them. Compared to the name brands, these were just as effective!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for your hair, even the packaging is cheap.  I returned it after trying to use it for an hour.  I&#x27;m mad at myself for even buying it in the first place.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment! just what i needed! The wand that came with it is a better wand than the one i had previous</li>
    <li> Very good quality,  great for price. Took to long to ship  but they are nice items that work. My hair is to short right now since I just cut it but once it grows  out this will help with the awkward grow out stage.</li>
    <li> The items I received were tossed in a baggie with no instructions, labels or original packaging.  For all I know, they could be used or from who knows where.  This is not a reliable way to provide products.</li>
    <li> I bought this curl former with my friend&#x27;s amazon account and as I read from other preview, my curl former pin also broke off the same day of first use!! Very poor quality plastic!! Even for a cheap product, i expect more than one use before it breaks off. Will have to buy another pin seperately now.</li>
    <li> This item is in no way comparable to the Curlformers. The hook tool broke the first time that we used it. There were not any instructions in English to explain the correct way to use the product. It was very poor in quality and some of the curlers broke during the first night of wear. I ended up purchasing the Curlformers brand and was very pleased with the difference. The quality was much better, the instructions were in English, the hook has lasted for six months so far and the curlers are still looking new. Do not waste your money, buy the real thing the first time.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me, but that could be because I have such fine hair....</li>
    <li> Generally I like these soft rollers. Mainly because I can sleep wearing them which saves me a lot of time in the morning. It took me a while to practice pulling my hair through and its still work in progress, but I think I got it. It is good invention for hair curling, but I wish the rubbery parts weren&#x27;t as atrong. They tend to pull some hair out while taking them off. Just based on that I can&#x27;t use them very often or I will end up bold. But for special occasions, it&#x27;s a great easy to use product.</li>
    <li> I have fine, long hair down my shoulders. I use the yellow and bright pink curlers to sleep in and they are okay. However, I don&#x27;t like all of my hair curly, just the bottom half. So, I add some curling spritz to my hair and divide it into 4-5 sections. Each section gets one curler. The front curlers start just at the height of my earlobes, the rest a little lower. When I remove the curlers in the morning I still have my straight hair on the top half of my hair, while the bottom part is nice and wavy. Now I can either leave them down or pull them up in a curly pony tail. Either way, it looks great. I just wish the curlers were a little softer for more comfort while sleeping.</li>
    <li> My product came really fast. I was excited that I did not have to wait long to try them. They work just as good as the expensive, name brand rollers. My curls came out beautiful and I have natural hair (no perm). You still get a really straight root when using these rollers. However there was one problem most of the rollers were too short for my hair and at the time my hair was a little past shoulder length. I would not recommend this product for people with medium to long hair.</li>
    <li> I love it. I am getting used to using these type of rollers. I am old school and used to doing a wet set the old fashion way. I went on you tube and learn how the young people do it.It works your hair will curl in half the time.</li>
    <li> I have heavily bleached, bright blue hair. As such, I try to avoid using heat on it. These are the perfect solution. The hook is easy to use, once you get the hang of it (google a few video how-tos). I personally use Beyond the Zone mousse to make the curls stay. My routine is to shower at night, half-dry my hair, then use the mousse one section at a time, and liberally (I have very thin hair). These are very easy to sleep in. Caveat- You may need to buy another pack for your hair, as one set is not enough to cover your whole head.</li>
    <li> These would be great dor medium length fine hair. .not for long thick</li>
    <li> Takes a little while to figure out which way goes what. Once you get used and stop tearing your hair out, it&#x27;s fantastic! I cut my hair short weeks after I got it, and it still works great with short hair!</li>
    <li> I was able to use these curlers twice before the applicator broke. The curlers were reasonably comfortable to sleep in. The curls were pretty good. They are pretty easy to get in AFTER you watch ytube. There&#x27;s several demos. The biggest problem after the broken applicator is they are too short for most of my hair. I will be looking around for another set that are longer so all of my hair is enclosed instead of sticking out of the end of the curler.</li>
    <li> These  are pretty easy to work with, but do not put too much hair in the curler, make sure you have conditioned the hair so it glides better and the plastic needle needs to be a bit stronger, mine already broke, but the concept outcome is cool.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend these curlers. I tried them several times and they did not even make my hair wavy. I would not waste my money on these. I wish I had returned these.&lt;br /&gt;Deb from NJ</li>
    <li> That black thing (puller) broke first time we used it. For a full hair head you need few kits, one is definitely not enough. It only takes like few hairs. Only if your hair is by shoulder length then it&#x27;s enough, but not longer. The picture showing girl with long hair all curled is not very accurate. Either you need to spend whole day curling it part by part, or have like 3-4 kits. Didn&#x27;t work for us, waste of money.</li>
    <li> I chose 3 stars because the curlers themselves are fine. But I didn&#x27;t even use the wand and it broke. It is very poorly made. I managed using a topsy tail to thread through the curler and it did curl my daughters hair just as I hoped. So I am still able to say most of the item ordered worked.&lt;br /&gt;- If you want the curlers and don&#x27;t want to spend the $$ on the real brand, these are fine. But be sure and order the actual curlformer wand separate. It costs less than $5.00.</li>
    <li> I do love the way the curls turn out, super cute, but my hair is so fine it gets ripped easily when pulling it through the rollers. And my scalp is fairly sensitive so there is no way I could sleep with those in.&lt;br /&gt;I found foam roller sticks with pliable wire at Target that are gentler on my hair but don&#x27;t look quite as cute.</li>
