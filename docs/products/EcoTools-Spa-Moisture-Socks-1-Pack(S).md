### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product I have been using it for months and its a good investment</li>
      <li>not even foot shaped lol</li>
      <li>Great.  </li>
      <li>and I have experienced some improvements</li>
      <li>Apply moisturizer and slip these on; your feet will look and feel amazing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like that they have a nice nature-y print on and also that they have a heel sewn in</li>
      <li>Threads coming apart after two washings ( in warm water).&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I wear a size 8-9 women&#x27;s shoe and this was a fairly snug fit</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>I have never seen so many seams on a pair of  socks.</li>
      <li>I have problematic dry skin all over my feet, so these were the best I could do.</li>
      <li>These barely fit over the ankle (I&#x27;m size 9), but are better than the booties that don&#x27;t cover the achilles tendon at all.</li>
      <li>The socks shipped quickly and are very good for overnight moister retention to keep you your feet soft and free from dryness and circulation issues.  </li>
      <li>Easy to wash and maintain.  </li>
      <li>These socks feel very nice and soft and fit well.</li>
      <li>I bought 5 of em to get the free shipping and now always have a clean pair when I need to wear them.</li>
      <li>The moisturising gloves by the same company are just as good too.</li>
      <li>This was such an amazing price for this product.  </li>
      <li>Even after slathering my feet with foot cream, the socks absorbed the lotion.  </li>
      <li>They do what they are supposed to when worn after applying a good natural heel moisturiser cream and are comfortable enough that you almost don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing socks ar all.</li>
      <li>Nothing to really right home about here.</li>
      <li>I got is still ok - white cotton blend spa socks that do their job.</li>
      <li>they might fit a doll&#x27;s feet but the angles are too sharp to be comfortable for humans with curvy, rounded heels and toes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s surprising how hard it is to find moisture socks that will extend over the ankle.</li>
      <li>so if your feet are bigger, this might not quite fit.</li>
      <li>They fit my size 7/12 foot easy, not too tight and perhaps just a tad loose.</li>
      <li>These are thin, making them perfect for summer and even though I put heavy lotion on, they did not seem to leak through onto my bedding, which was a plus.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone needing a light sock versus heavy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;FYI, I purchased one for myself and one for a friend and neither one of us felt that they did not reach high enough on our heel/ankle.</li>
      <li>The seams may be a bit thick, but they help with the fit.</li>
      <li>The fit is a little loose, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>When I first received them I washed and air dried them.</li>

<li> These socks keep the moisture of the foot cream on my feet and not absorbed into the sock.</li>
<li> Socks are soft but they kept falling off and were uncomfortable to wear.</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> These socks were so big that when I wore them to bed they twisted all over the place that I would just take them off.</li>
<li> cheaply made, very disappointed.</li>
<li> tried these for spa night with my bff and we eventually ended up just using big socks because these were too awkward</li>
<li> The material is thin, but seem to retain moisture longer than cotton.</li>
<li> the dirty side stays on the bottom and they don&#x27;t move around or slide off.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> The socks shipped quickly and are very good for overnight moister retention to keep you your feet soft and free from dryness and circulation issues.  Easy to wash and maintain.  I bought 5 of em to get the free shipping and now always have a clean pair when I need to wear them.</li>
    <li> These socks keep the moisture of the foot cream on my feet and not absorbed into the sock.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s surprising how hard it is to find moisture socks that will extend over the ankle. The vast majority of them are only concerned about the bottoms of your feet. These barely fit over the ankle (I&#x27;m size 9), but are better than the booties that don&#x27;t cover the achilles tendon at all. I have problematic dry skin all over my feet, so these were the best I could do. The fit is a little loose, but I don&#x27;t mind. Sometimes they stay on overnight and sometimes they fall off. The material is thin, but seem to retain moisture longer than cotton. When I first received them I washed and air dried them. They took a lot longer to dry than I expected. They do seem to help keep the moisturizing lotion in longer, but not as long as I&#x27;d hoped. It is an improvement over standard cotton socks, yet they are a breathable material so you&#x27;re not holding in sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the seams - there&#x27;s one seam across the heel and one at the toes. They don&#x27;t bother me because I don&#x27;t go exercising in them or anything. The seams may be a bit thick, but they help with the fit. If a thick seam across the heel might bother you, try the LOVE socks which are shapeless tubes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine putting these on to sleep in while moisturizing.  I have never seen so many seams on a pair of  socks.</li>
    <li> Socks started to fall apart after two washings. Threads coming apart after two washings ( in warm water).&lt;br /&gt;Very cheaply made, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Socks are soft but they kept falling off and were uncomfortable to wear. There was no elasticity to hold up socks.</li>
    <li> not even foot shaped lol they might fit a doll&#x27;s feet but the angles are too sharp to be comfortable for humans with curvy, rounded heels and toes. tried these for spa night with my bff and we eventually ended up just using big socks because these were too awkward</li>
    <li> Excellent product I have been using it for months and its a good investment and I have experienced some improvements</li>
    <li> These are thin, making them perfect for summer and even though I put heavy lotion on, they did not seem to leak through onto my bedding, which was a plus.

They fit my size 7/12 foot easy, not too tight and perhaps just a tad loose.</li>
    <li> Nothing to really right home about here. I have seen similar socks in the dollar tree and will stick to those as opposed to spending the extra money then having to wait on these to be shipped and delivered.</li>
    <li> I ordered these socks from MayaBeauty, but I never received the EcoTools socks. They sent me a similar product instead.&lt;br /&gt;What I got is still ok - white cotton blend spa socks that do their job. And, of course, since the shipment is almost the same as the price of the item it makes no sense to return them. I will be using my socks, but I would not recommend to buy from MayaBeauty.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  These socks do not even remotely help moisturize your feet.  Even after slathering my feet with foot cream, the socks absorbed the lotion.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Having discovered BALEGA sport socks, these are totally passe.  Bye-Bye bamboo.</li>
    <li> Great.  Apply moisturizer and slip these on; your feet will look and feel amazing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I purchased one for myself and one for a friend and neither one of us felt that they did not reach high enough on our heel/ankle.</li>
    <li> These socks feel very nice and soft and fit well. I like that they have a nice nature-y print on and also that they have a heel sewn in so you always wear them the same way up, so the dirty side stays on the bottom and they don&#x27;t move around or slide off. They do what they are supposed to when worn after applying a good natural heel moisturiser cream and are comfortable enough that you almost don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing socks ar all. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more. The moisturising gloves by the same company are just as good too. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This was such an amazing price for this product.  The material doesn&#x27;t feel like my other bamboo moisture socks and the product package didn&#x27;t say it was bamboo (as far as I could see) so it might not actually be bamboo.  But they are in some ways nicer than the other ones I have that were much more expensive.  I wear a size 8-9 women&#x27;s shoe and this was a fairly snug fit so if your feet are bigger, this might not quite fit.</li>
    <li> These socks were so big that when I wore them to bed they twisted all over the place that I would just take them off.</li>
