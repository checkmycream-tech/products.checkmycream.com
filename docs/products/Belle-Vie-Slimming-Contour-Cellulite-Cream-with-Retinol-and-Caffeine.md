      <li>I will continue to use the cream and if I get brave enough may add my before and after pictures to this review.</li>

      <li>My legs are very muscular but i wont ever wear a baithing suit without a skirt because of the dimpples forming at the top of each thigh.</li>
      <li>So I waited for almost a month to write this review because I wanted to make sure that this product really works.</li>
      <li>However when my wife got wind that I had been given the opportunity, she quickly changed my mind.  </li>
      <li>That concerned was quickly quieted, as it has somewhat of a fruity smell to it.  </li>
      <li>Being a guy, when I was asked to review this item in exchange for a free sample, my first response was &#x27;I dont think so&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Besides the smell I&#x27;m satisfied with my results so far and will continue to use.</li>
      <li>While my cellulite was still there, my skin appeared a bit more tight and smooth, which is good enough for me for a first application since I know that a product like this takes time to show true</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is non greasy and absorbs right</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different creams but so far this is the best one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>pleased with this cellulite remover cream/lotion, will definitely recomend this to my sister!!</li>
      <li>I first received it, my first concern was how this was going to smell on her.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Very faint, and not as strong as many of the lotions she buys, but a nice hint.  </li>
      <li>I have instead decided to try a couple of their competitors product as they are offering their product at half of the price and claims to produce the same results with many more favorable reviews.</li>
      <li>I plan to also start using the cream on my arms to smooth out some of the extra skin as well.  </li>
      <li>The texture was very...</li>
      <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
      <li>I gained so much weight after having my boys so close in age that I started to get cellulite and stretch marks.</li>
      <li>and you really need to rub it into your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Watch out guys, this is a trap for free massages twice daily ....</li>
      <li>So much so, that I tried to coerce my wife in to letting me post the before and after pictures we took for reviewing.  </li>
      <li>It is quick and simple, just put on before I go to bed at night and don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore.</li>
      <li>I am a skeptic and was really pleasantly surprised, not a miricle</li>
      <li>So far the cream is working.  </li>
      <li>My skin is firmer, soft to the touch and my problem areas is minimizing.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s soft and silky without being too greasy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Right after opening the jar, I was pleasantly surprised by the scent.</li>
      <li>Right after applying the cream for the first time, I noticed a small difference in the appearance of my legs from the caffeine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the smell when I use it. I still have yet to wait some time if there are any changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> Being a guy, when I was asked to review this item in exchange for a free sample, my first response was &#x27;I dont think so&#x27;.  However when my wife got wind that I had been given the opportunity, she quickly changed my mind.  She has been fighting a celulite build up around her upper thighs for a while now, and exercising wasn&#x27;t seeming to get her anywhere.  So I placed the order.  Little did I know what I was getting in to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received it, my first concern was how this was going to smell on her.  * I do have to sleep with her you know*  That concerned was quickly quieted, as it has somewhat of a fruity smell to it.  Very faint, and not as strong as many of the lotions she buys, but a nice hint.  The texture was very... well, creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this isn&#x27;t some fly-by-night review, and like any herbal supplement or cream I&#x27;ve reviewed, you need time to see if it actually works.  This is definitely no overnight miracle cream that instantly erases any blemishes.  Twice daily the cream was applied to her upper thighs, and the supply lasted about 2 weeks before running out.  Let me tell you, there is definitely a visual change in appearance of cellulite!  So much so, that I tried to coerce my wife in to letting me post the before and after pictures we took for reviewing.  *As you can see that didn&#x27;t work*  However a statement she made sums up how well this product is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Buy me 2 or 3 more jars of it, and we will talk!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out guys, this is a trap for free massages twice daily .... but boy does she look good!</li>
    <li> This cream smell good. After I use it ,my skin start to burn. I think that is a good sign. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it work after I using it everyday.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic and was really pleasantly surprised, not a miricle but it helps that saggy craggy skin.</li>
    <li> On my second jar and not sure if it&#x27;s helping yet but it smells good and it&#x27;s soft and silky without being too greasy.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a cellulite cream, I must say that I am impressed.  After a short period of time I can say that my skin on my upper thighs have become firmer and softer.  It is quick and simple, just put on before I go to bed at night and don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore. I received quick shipping and great customer service, I will continue to order once I run out.  I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, and in my opinion it is worth the purchase and you receive a good amount.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this product. I purchased a jar to try it out and see if it actually works. The smell of the product is great. Its smells fruity and pleasant. It absorbs into the skin and dries very quickly so that you can get dressed quickly in a crunch. My only issue with the product is that it only lasted for 2 weeks before the jar ran out of cream. That means to continue using this product it would cost me about $80 per month to apply this twice a day. I have instead decided to try a couple of their competitors product as they are offering their product at half of the price and claims to produce the same results with many more favorable reviews.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  for me it does help with the cellulite on my upper legs.  I do walk and exercise  5 days a week.  So combined I am seeing a difference.</li>
    <li> UNFORTUNATELY, I SAW NO NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENT AS INDICATED IT WOULD. DOES HAVE A CREAMY,RICH CONSISTENCY.</li>
    <li> Can see a small difference after about 5 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using the product on my lower stomach before I worked out in the morning and before I go bed. I have seen a noticeable difference I&#x27;m my skin. The cream goes on like a thick lotion and you really need to rub it into your skin. Only con is the smell of the product. Besides the smell I&#x27;m satisfied with my results so far and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> A full refund is required.  Did not work at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I gained so much weight after having my boys so close in age that I started to get cellulite and stretch marks. I received this right on time to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion. I have tried many different types of creams and treatments to get rid of these horrible cellulite and nothing seem to really work. After using this cellulite cream I have found my miracle cream! My skin is firmer, soft to the touch and my problem areas is minimizing. Watching these cellulite go away is just wonderful! Working out and using this cream is boosting my confidence and my husband is noticing the physical and emotional changes in me, and he loves it. The cream is does not leave a nasty greasy residue and absorbs into my skin no problem. I also love the light scent, I use this cream after showers!</li>
    <li> So far the cream is working.  I apply the cream twice a day after I shower.  In the shower I also use a cellulite brush.</li>
    <li> I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review and I was so excited when it came in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;I imediately started using it! I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with cellulite but my thighs are starting to get that &amp;#34;cottage cheese&amp;#34; appearane. My legs are very muscular but i wont ever wear a baithing suit without a skirt because of the dimpples forming at the top of each thigh. This product is firming up areas that even excercise could not even help!&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice light scent and feels great on!&lt;br /&gt;It is non greasy and absorbs right in so I don&#x27;t have to wait to get dressed!&lt;br /&gt;And it has the most retinol you can get without a perscription.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this cellulite remover cream/lotion, will definitely recomend this to my sister!! wink wink!!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars from this girl!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and it is easily applied to the skin and it absorbs very quickly. I personally tried this on my hips and it did not leave any residue or sticky feeling. I will be using this with my derma roller to see how much more effects I can get from this cream. It can be used twice a day too just make sure you are really rubbing it into the skin. I also like the container it looks really cute. I received this product an exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Severe rashes on legs did nothing but harm my skin refund please</li>
    <li> I have only been using the cream for a few days, so I cannot speak to it&#x27;s effectiveness as a cellulite remover, yet.  I love the scent, and it glides on smoothly, and absorbs very well.  I am trying it on my arms to begin with.  I will update my review after using for a couple of weeks.  Was a great transaction, with fast shipping.  The cream is packaged nicely, as well.</li>
    <li> So I waited for almost a month to write this review because I wanted to make sure that this product really works. I&#x27;m usually a skeptic about these type of firming or getting rid of cellulite creams. Thankfully, I was able to try this product at a discounted rate. Well, about close to a month of using this product at twice a day, I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t seen additional stretch marks on my belly, and I&#x27;m about 8 months pregnant. My thighs legs feel firmer, and I&#x27;m sure this cream helped. What I also like about this cream is that it doesn&#x27;t smell and it feels smooth and silky without the oily feeling after you put it on.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a couple of weeks and I see slight results already.  I&#x27;ve tried several different creams but so far this is the best one I&#x27;ve used.  I plan to order more and continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Smells good! I&#x27;m excited to start seeing the results.</li>
    <li> After losing 125lbs recently I have really been struggling to get rid of the cellulite and dimples that have been left behind on my upper thighs. No amount of exercise or weight training seems to be helping, so when I had a opportunity to test and review this cream I was open but still a bit skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after opening the jar, I was pleasantly surprised by the scent. It&#x27;s light and fruity, with a bit of citrus, which I really enjoyed. The cream itself is thick, but absorbs well and I found that a little goes a long way. Right after applying the cream for the first time, I noticed a small difference in the appearance of my legs from the caffeine. While my cellulite was still there, my skin appeared a bit more tight and smooth, which is good enough for me for a first application since I know that a product like this takes time to show true results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using the cream daily for about two weeks and have a noticeable reduction in the cellulite on my legs. I will continue to use the cream and if I get brave enough may add my before and after pictures to this review. For now, I&#x27;ll save your eyes the horror of seeing my before pics. I plan to also start using the cream on my arms to smooth out some of the extra skin as well.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Sample Provided]</li>
