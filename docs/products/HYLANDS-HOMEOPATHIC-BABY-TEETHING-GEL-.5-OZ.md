### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Hyland&#x27;s has some teething tablets too that are wonderful!</li>
      <li>I am still very happy with the gel.</li>
      <li>we were using the teething tablets until the recall and switched over to the Hyland&#x27;s teething gel and it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Hylands makes great products.</li>
      <li>Lol</li>
      <li>Why they can&#x27;t make a product that works AND tastes good for babies is beyond me.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that it was a good replacement for stronger medicines and loved the idea of a homeopathic remedy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this product because my baby was happy even though he was teething.  </li>
      <li>They work great and are way better for your baby than Orajel.</li>
      <li>We love this product!</li>
      <li>Tastes better too!</li>
      <li>I would give it zero stars to be honest..</li>
      <li>I put it on my own gums and couldn&#x27;t feel a dang thing.</li>
      <li>Excellent  product and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Put it on your own tongue.</li>
      <li>I tried this product on my own gums and nothing happened - I  felt nothing at all.</li>
      <li>I love Hyland&#x27;s teething products.</li>
      <li>The tablets work better</li>
      <li>I love this gel but the tablets are better.  </li>
      <li>My daughter inherited my propensity for canker sores and got one with her latest virus...</li>
      <li>I notice she sleeps better when I give her the tablets.  </li>
      <li>I used babyganics and that works much better.</li>
      <li>I heard great reviews prior to purchasing and am glad I listened!</li>
      <li>I just wish I had it when she was originally teething!</li>
      <li>I prefer the gel to the tablets as you can more quickly and easily apply this to the effected area and you have that closeness and bond with your child when applying this with your own hands.</li>
      <li>It works quickly and easily for baby, and is homeopathic!</li>
      <li>Your baby earns your trust more quickly and remembers how rubbing your finger on their gums will soothe them.</li>
      <li>I was happy when I seen this gel in local Wal-Mart, but we&#x27;re using it for a week</li>
      <li>The tube has all the contents as advertised on the web AND some more intriguing \\&quot;natural\\&quot; artifacts:    </li>
      <li>But one thing is true...</li>
      <li>Then I quickly give her a bottle</li>
      <li>I am happy to have found something that is more natural than the other brands out there.</li>
      <li>, It works, It calms my baby down pretty good, I also pair this with the teething tablets and so far both work wonders, and baby more relaxed :)</li>
      <li>This is such an amazing product.</li>
      <li>If you want an equally as effective product, simply turn on your kitchen faucet.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Babies will let you know right away weather or not they work</li>
      <li>It works great and my boys actually open their mouths for me when I give it, unlike when I tried other gels.</li>
      <li>Side effects - largely dialated pupils of the baby.    </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really thankful that I did.</li>
      <li>and I am very thankful for Hyland&#x27;s Teething Gel.</li>
      <li>so I son&#x27;t have to worry so much about them harming my baby or causing unwanted side effects.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Much cheaper at walmart though.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about this product, since my daughter used 0rajel teething gel (10 years</li>
      <li>most simple gels that are not \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; and are available at a half price work much faster.</li>
      <li>I think the gel works the same as the tablets (to calm)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised that there were no comments from the users of this gel on the real content of the tube.</li>
      <li>We have ordered this teething gel for our 6 month old baby.</li>
      <li>This teething gel doesn&#x27;t bring my teething baby any relief so far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>I was surprised and could bear him being in pain.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re all natural</li>
      <li>We have worked out five teeth so far</li>
      <li>Unlike the Orajel, Hyland&#x27;s can be applied whenever needed because it is natural.  </li>
      <li>It works fast and actually does help calm them down.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t calm him down at all.</li>
      <li>No other product like it</li>
      <li>A friend suggested Hyland&#x27;s Natural teething gel, which worked instantly!  </li>
      <li>I bought this for our daughter who was barely 2 months at the time.  </li>
      <li>It helped my little girl so much.</li>
      <li>The only good thing is that she doesn&#x27;t react badly like when I rub Orajel on her.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried this product on my own gums and nothing happened - I  felt nothing at all. I was hoping that it was a good replacement for stronger medicines and loved the idea of a homeopathic remedy. It did nothing for my daughter and I saw no relief coming from this gel. I would not buy this product or recommend it.</li>
    <li> Save your money. If you want an equally as effective product, simply turn on your kitchen faucet. I have to suspect fake reviews here. Absolutely no effectiveness on our 11 month old. Put it on your own tongue. Nothing. In fact, there&#x27;s no proof that any of these homeopathic meds work. Wish they did... I haven&#x27;t found one that undoubtedly works. Our baby hates the taste of OraJel. Why they can&#x27;t make a product that works AND tastes good for babies is beyond me. Our baby scream when he tastes the horrors of baby OraJel. Might as well fill his little mouth with cloves. But one thing is true... OraJel DOES numb the gums. Oh, the trials of a parent whose baby is teething. Midnight here. I hope he finally fell asleep. It has been a horrible day for the little guy.</li>
    <li> This gel does what it is supposed too, It works, It calms my baby down pretty good, I also pair this with the teething tablets and so far both work wonders, and baby more relaxed :)</li>
    <li> we were using the teething tablets until the recall and switched over to the Hyland&#x27;s teething gel and it works wonderfully. My baby hates the Baby oragel and will only use this product! We recommended it to another Mom to and her baby likes it as well.</li>
    <li> We have ordered this teething gel for our 6 month old baby. Amazon.com and Hylands.com websites claim that product is   \\&quot;100% Natural, contains Chamomile, free of artificial flavors and parabens, Homeopathic\\&quot;.    I&#x27;m surprised that there were no comments from the users of this gel on the real content of the tube. If anyone cared enough to examine packaging, it claims very different things. The tube has all the contents as advertised on the web AND some more intriguing \\&quot;natural\\&quot; artifacts:    * Sorbic Acid, also known as E200. Not a big evil, yet it would be good to be informed before ordering the product.  * Potassium Sorbate, also known as E202. Use of this preservative could lead to allergic reactions, nausea, diarrhea and nutrient loss in food.   * Sodium Benzoate, commonly known as E211. It is known to damage cells leading to cirrhosis and Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other diseases. Sodium benzoate may increase hyperactivity in affected children, asthmatics sometimes react badly. Even CocaCola is not using this venom.     The teething gel works (hence 2 stars not 1), yet most simple gels that are not \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; and are available at a half price work much faster. Hylands takes 15 minutes to take effect. Side effects - largely dialated pupils of the baby.    My recommendation is to stay away from a company that neglects its customers by hiding out one third of the ingredients in a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product thus trying to play fashion game and attracting customers with delusory label. Big shame on you, Hylands!</li>
    <li> We love this product! It works great and my boys actually open their mouths for me when I give it, unlike when I tried other gels. It works fast and actually does help calm them down. I have only given Tylenol once for teething since this works so well! I have recommended this to all my friends with babies and will always have it on hand!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at the store and I&#x27;m really thankful that I did. The gel works wonders and unlike orajel you can apply this every 15 mins if needed. It helped my little girl so much. It&#x27;s a teething MUST have!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about this product, since my daughter used 0rajel teething gel (10 years ago)---which worked!  Well I assumed that my son would be find with Orajel as well.  But....It didn&#x27;t work!  I was surprised and could bear him being in pain.  A friend suggested Hyland&#x27;s Natural teething gel, which worked instantly!  Unlike the Orajel, Hyland&#x27;s can be applied whenever needed because it is natural.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this product because my baby was happy even though he was teething.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My son hates the antiseptic taste of Baby Oragel.  This product eases his pain and he tolerates me rubbing it on his gums.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by a friend who I cannot thank enough.  The only product that worked for my 3 children to instantly help teething pain.  No other product like it and I tell all my mom friends about it.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product. It works quickly and easily for baby, and is homeopathic! Much cheaper at walmart though.</li>
    <li> I rubbed it on her gum when she seems like having gum discomfort and she&#x27;s still screaming.  The only good thing is that she doesn&#x27;t react badly like when I rub Orajel on her.  The tablets work better I think..  While she&#x27;s screaming,  I drop few tablets in her mouth then she instantly stop screaming (because she got distracted by the texture and taste).  Then I quickly give her a bottle and she sleeps well after that.  I notice she sleeps better when I give her the tablets.  I think the gel works the same as the tablets (to calm) but I don&#x27;t think it soothes her gum.  Another thing is, I notice both gel and tablets have same ingredient in it.</li>
    <li> This teething gel doesn&#x27;t bring my teething baby any relief so far as I can tell. I put it on my own gums and couldn&#x27;t feel a dang thing. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Hylands makes great products. The proof in homeopathic medicines are found after using them. Babies will let you know right away weather or not they work and this definetely works. I prefer the gel to the tablets as you can more quickly and easily apply this to the effected area and you have that closeness and bond with your child when applying this with your own hands. Your baby earns your trust more quickly and remembers how rubbing your finger on their gums will soothe them. Use often and don&#x27;t worry!</li>
    <li> I was happy when I seen this gel in local Wal-Mart, but we&#x27;re using it for a week and it doesn&#x27;t calm him down at all.Sorry,a waist of money!</li>
    <li> Teething is awful . . .&lt;br /&gt;since the hyland&#x27;s tablets went on recall, we decided to use the gel . . .&lt;br /&gt;seems to work and alieviate some of our baby&#x27;s discomfort . . .&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer the tablets, but the gel is a clsoe second . . .</li>
    <li> I would give it zero stars to be honest.. I tried to give this to my baby and it didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. I put it on my tongue and gums and literally felt nothing. No tingle or anything. I used babyganics and that works much better. Tastes better too! Oh and I found out this has been recalled. Why it&#x27;s still for sale fascinates me.</li>
    <li> I love this gel but the tablets are better.  I bought this for our daughter who was barely 2 months at the time.  She was teething and I didn&#x27;t know what to do.  I researched and found out that baby orajel was for 4 plus months and baby tylenol was for 6 months plus.  Then I found out about the Hylands products.  They&#x27;re all natural so I son&#x27;t have to worry so much about them harming my baby or causing unwanted side effects.  I am still very happy with the gel.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this all the time I keep it on hand for my grandkids</li>
    <li> I love Hyland&#x27;s teething products. They work great and are way better for your baby than Orajel. Orajel tightens their gums and makes it harder for the tooth to come through. It also burns their gums. Hyland&#x27;s has some teething tablets too that are wonderful!</li>
    <li> This gel works wonders on my son&#x27;s gums. We have worked out five teeth so far and I am very thankful for Hyland&#x27;s Teething Gel. I am happy to have found something that is more natural than the other brands out there. I heard great reviews prior to purchasing and am glad I listened!</li>
    <li> Excellent  product and fast shipping. My daughter likes this tablets. She goes to get them for me when she&#x27;s feeling irritable!! Lol (she thinks its candy)</li>
    <li> I am amazed, but this stuff works like a miracle.  My daughter inherited my propensity for canker sores and got one with her latest virus...and she was miserable.  I tried regular teething gel, and she hated it and was so mad at me.  I gave this a chance, since I have used the Calms stuff...and it works for me. Ten minutes after I put it on her sore, she was asleep.  I just wish I had it when she was originally teething!</li>
    <li> this product has been recalled by the FDA and should not be used</li>
    <li> Took forever to get this item would just pick it up at the store next time! Just not what I expected.</li>
