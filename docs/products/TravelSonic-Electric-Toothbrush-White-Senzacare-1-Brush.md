### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best travel toothbrush around.</li>
      <li>Happy travels!</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is the perfect size and price for a portable electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>A great find!</li>
      <li>I travel a lot for business and Senzacare is perfect.  </li>
      <li>perfect for the plane...</li>
      <li>It is ideal for overnight trips and/or extended periods away from home.  </li>
      <li>A great product for people on the go that don&#x27;t want to go to the dentist and don&#x27;t get home to brush.</li>
      <li>Happy Brushing...</li>
      <li>great transaction....</li>
      <li>This brush is so great to have at work</li>
      <li>great, well positioned product.</li>
      <li>The Senzacare is light weight and fits perfectly in my purse.  </li>
      <li>Save your money for a good Oral B brush.</li>
      <li>I have a feeling that this product will become very popular the more that people see it out there.</li>
      <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush!  </li>
      <li>Because it is not that effective, taking it with me in travel makes no sense.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t find it effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be more popular now.</li>
      <li>in the end, choosing between a travel oriented but ineffective brush, or an effective brush that needed a travel case, I am thoroughly pleased with the almost disposable Oral B.</li>
      <li>makes it even better.</li>
      <li>Okay, I have a Sonicare at home and am probably spoiled, but I think I could have purchased something at Walmart for 1/2 the price that worked have worked just as well.</li>
      <li>Compact, powerful, and a good value.</li>
      <li>Most of the vibration is in the handle, and not in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
      <li>This toothbrush is much better than a manual and more compact.  </li>
      <li>As a teacher I like to be able to brush my teeth after lunch,</li>
      <li>What I love about it is....</li>
      <li>I like the idea of this product, but most of the vibration is in the handle instead of the head</li>
      <li>Even better is when I take it motorbiking and camping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Which I also own and love very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I travel for work and pleasure and this little mighty electric toothbrush is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>gee, I sound like a dentist.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to be like the battery operated sonic care for the same price, but, great for your purse.</li>
      <li>I love my SonicCare toothbrush and was hoping this smaller (and battery run) brush would be as good.  </li>
      <li>The cleaning action does not resemble that of a good electric model.  </li>
      <li>It does a nice job cleaning teeth and then packs away nicely for the next use.</li>
      <li>they are not expensive ones, yet do 90% more cleaning than this</li>
      <li>My teeth feel clean after I brush.  </li>
      <li>I like to travel as light as possible but still with adequate clothes and good hygiene.  </li>
      <li>I use a sonic at home and the size of the brush is perfect for travel but overall the brushes barely moved.  </li>
      <li>It might make some OCD lunchtime brushers feel like they&#x27;re doing something more, but really, I would say not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Kind of wimpy but very good for travel, weighs very little and battery seems to be lasting well.</li>
      <li>, I came across a powered toothbrush that was very effective at half the price.  </li>
      <li>the end, I like the idea of a portable electric tooth brush, but this one is simply not that effective.</li>
      <li>My first senzacare was quickly appropriated by my wife,validating my belief that this product fills a void.</li>
      <li>The size is just right</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product for those who travel and enjoy their electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The brush head was bigger, much more of the vibrating action made it to the head, and I was pleased with it in every way.</li>
      <li>In no way does it match my full size, real, electric toothbrush, but I still like</li>
      <li>so I can easily pack it in my briefcase to use right after I get off an early flight or in between meetings.  </li>
      <li>It looks cool, and the cover keeps it clean and aired out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The senzacare passes the most critical test, that of the importance of oscillating motion of the brushhead.</li>
      <li>have two electric toothbrushes that I use at home, which are not expensive ones.</li>
      <li>At first I thought I ordered a child&#x27;s size in error.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my new favorite personal product!</li>
      <li>The little air vents in the cover are also a nice touch -</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>but it worked really well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>and it cleans really well.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really excited to take it on my next trip with me.</li>
      <li>Battery will last a long time, easy to clean, airtight chassis.</li>
      <li>The included cover keeps everything clean and makes it simple, so that I don&#x27;t have to buy a separate one.</li>
      <li>And in a recent trip to the dentist for my periodic checkup, I took up the subject of what makes a good electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recomend this pocket size brush for on the go.  </li>
      <li>If you take a chance and buy one you might want to bring a normal toothbrush as well otherwise you will be pissed off every time you brush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the type of person who likes a mid-day brush but don&#x27;t want to carry around a used tooth brush or try and buy a new one all the time.</li>
      <li>I did use a new battery to no avail.  </li>
      <li>I have an upcoming trip backpacking across New Zealand and Thailand for three months, and taking the TravelSonic with me is a must.</li>
      <li>I have been using the TravelSonic for the past two weeks and love it.</li>
      <li>I use a Sonicare at home so naturally I have been dissatisfied with any travel brush I have ever used- up until now that is!</li>
      <li>but this one cleans the tooth under the gums very easily, and might keep you out of some serious dental work over time.</li>
      <li>It does break loose some particles, but I find myself using a general back and forth and up and down brushing motion to do a good job.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s always dry and clean the next day.</li>
      <li>It was the adult size.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised  it was recommended by professional travelers.</li>
      <li>becuase sonic movements are so soft that it does not do anything to teeth or gums.</li>
      <li>I used it on a three week trip, at least twice a day with thorough brushng, and the battery&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
      <li>This fits well in my overnight case, but I found the head just a little small, and nowhere close to cleaning as effectively as I had anticipated.</li>
      <li>This battery powered toothbrush meets my general requirements, but with some considerations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>real well you don&#x27;t have to worry about plugging in to charge or have an adapter in other countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So quick, convenient it&#x27;s hard not to want to brush your teeth multiple times a day.  </li>
      <li>This brush is lightweight, small, but large enough and with enough precision and action to get the job done.</li>

<li> I got this before a trip down south.  </li>
<li> Broke less then a week after I got it.</li>
<li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to plaque heavily, so may I suggest that if you&#x27;re staying put for a while, buy a bottle of plague rinse to swish around before/after brushing.  </li>
<li> The toothbrush works as expected but the brush is very small.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s small</li>
<li> The head is too small, even for a travel model.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
<li> almost seems like they put a small tooth brush head on the end of this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Too small, too weak.</li>
<li> The email provided on their web page is no good.</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo10T3AFI2XU79V]]Looooove my Senzacare. We actually have two in the household now. What I love about it is....well, just check out the video.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Too small, too weak. I did use a new battery to no avail.  I&#x27;m surprised  it was recommended by professional travelers.</li>
    <li> Kind of wimpy but very good for travel, weighs very little and battery seems to be lasting well.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this product, but most of the vibration is in the handle instead of the head so I don&#x27;t find it effective. Why I wouldn&#x27;t buy again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Most of the vibration is in the handle, and not in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The head is too small, even for a travel model.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Because it is not that effective, taking it with me in travel makes no sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two electric toothbrushes that I use at home, which are not expensive ones. I have these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000QS59ZM Spinbrush Prowhitening Battery Powered Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002HWS9FW B002HWS9FW]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they are not expensive ones, yet do 90% more cleaning than this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost seems like they put a small tooth brush head on the end of this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0006UTYTW Conair MT3WB Mens 2 in 1 Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which I also own and love very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I like the idea of a portable electric tooth brush, but this one is simply not that effective. It might make some OCD lunchtime brushers feel like they&#x27;re doing something more, but really, I would say not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving this one a try and it failed my needs, I came across a powered toothbrush that was very effective at half the price.  The only drawback is that it didn&#x27;t come with a cover. The brush head was bigger, much more of the vibrating action made it to the head, and I was pleased with it in every way. That product was the [[ASIN:B000GGJDJW Oral-B Pulsar Medium Toothbrush 1 Count]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, choosing between a travel oriented but ineffective brush, or an effective brush that needed a travel case, I am thoroughly pleased with the almost disposable Oral B. If they made one meant for traveling I would buy it.d buy it.</li>
    <li> Best travel toothbrush around. I even use mine at home, because I don&#x27;t prefer electric toothbrushes but this one cleans the tooth under the gums very easily, and might keep you out of some serious dental work over time. This brush is lightweight, small, but large enough and with enough precision and action to get the job done. Battery will last a long time, easy to clean, airtight chassis.</li>
    <li> Product was disappointing. I use a sonic at home and the size of the brush is perfect for travel but overall the brushes barely moved.  You need to manually brush your teeth so what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush!  I hate leaving home without it.  The Senzacare is light weight and fits perfectly in my purse.  It is ideal for overnight trips and/or extended periods away from home.  It cleans, just as well as my Sonicare.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> perfect for the plane...great transaction....thanks</li>
    <li> With my extensive international travel, I was tired of bringing my sonicare with me...too bulky and ran out of power too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of my TravelSonic toothbrush!  It is compact, has a covered on/off button so that is doesn&#x27;t turn on by itself in my purse and I can take it through international customs without any issues.  Even better is when I take it motorbiking and camping. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the space and weight that a regular or electronic toothbrush requires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite personal product!</li>
    <li> Always keep one in my purse.Don&#x27;t expect it to be like the battery operated sonic care for the same price, but, great for your purse.</li>
    <li> becuase sonic movements are so soft that it does not do anything to teeth or gums. It is like regular tooth brush which I can buy it for $2</li>
    <li> This fits well in my overnight case, but I found the head just a little small, and nowhere close to cleaning as effectively as I had anticipated. Okay, I have a Sonicare at home and am probably spoiled, but I think I could have purchased something at Walmart for 1/2 the price that worked have worked just as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush to put in my schoolbag.  As a teacher I like to be able to brush my teeth after lunch, and I think my students appreciate it too. My teeth feel clean after I brush.  This toothbrush is much better than a manual and more compact.  I like being able to cover the toothbrush so it does not become dirty when I throw it back in my bag.</li>
    <li> I have been using the TravelSonic for the past two weeks and love it. I have an upcoming trip backpacking across New Zealand and Thailand for three months, and taking the TravelSonic with me is a must. It&#x27;s small, and will last me the entire trip without needing to be plugged in. I would highly recommend this product for those who travel and enjoy their electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I travel for work and pleasure and this little mighty electric toothbrush is perfect for me.  Whether I&#x27;m on the road for business or away for a camping or riding weekend, the Senzacare toothbrush is in my travel bag.  So quick, convenient it&#x27;s hard not to want to brush your teeth multiple times a day.  I have a feeling that this product will become very popular the more that people see it out there.</li>
    <li> worked real well you don&#x27;t have to worry about plugging in to charge or have an adapter in other countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this for people traveling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pat j</li>
    <li> Broke less then a week after I got it. It is just a piece of crap. Don&#x27;t bother buying it. If you take a chance and buy one you might want to bring a normal toothbrush as well otherwise you will be pissed off every time you brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company. The email provided on their web page is no good. It bounced back.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works as expected but the brush is very small.  At first I thought I ordered a child&#x27;s size in error.  It was the adult size.  I think it could have had a larger brush and still been a travel toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this little brush for one week and have used it every single day at work so far. It fits right in the small pocket inside my work bag and will probably become one of the few things I always have in there. I&#x27;m the type of person who likes a mid-day brush but don&#x27;t want to carry around a used tooth brush or try and buy a new one all the time. This thing is built to be the ultimate carry companion and the fact that it&#x27;s electric makes it even better. It took me a while to get used to the smaller brush head but it can actually reach a lot of places that the larger heads can&#x27;t. The little air vents in the cover are also a nice touch - it&#x27;s always dry and clean the next day.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for business and Senzacare is perfect.  It&#x27;s small so I can easily pack it in my briefcase to use right after I get off an early flight or in between meetings.  The included cover keeps everything clean and makes it simple, so that I don&#x27;t have to buy a separate one.</li>
    <li> I can finally hit the road with a travel size electronic toothbrush.  Highly recomend this pocket size brush for on the go.  I&#x27;ve been wanting this to hit the market for years.  Happy Brushing...</li>
    <li> My first senzacare was quickly appropriated by my wife,validating my belief that this product fills a void. I&#x27;ve ordered another. And in a recent trip to the dentist for my periodic checkup, I took up the subject of what makes a good electric toothbrush. The senzacare passes the most critical test, that of the importance of oscillating motion of the brushhead. (Rotary can actually cause wear of the enamel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great, well positioned product.</li>
    <li> I got this before a trip down south.  I love my SonicCare toothbrush and was hoping this smaller (and battery run) brush would be as good.  It took a bit of getting used to, as it&#x27;s a smaller brush but it worked really well.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to charge it and can just carry a battery with me if it needs to be replaced.  A great find!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is the perfect size and price for a portable electric toothbrush. It does a nice job cleaning teeth and then packs away nicely for the next use. I was looking for something to keep me from having to lug around my sonic care that I use at home. This does the trick! When I&#x27;m not traveling I keep it in my desk at work to brush after lunch. Compact, powerful, and a good value.</li>
    <li> I use a Sonicare at home so naturally I have been dissatisfied with any travel brush I have ever used- up until now that is! This brush is so great to have at work and I&#x27;m really excited to take it on my next trip with me. The size is just right and it cleans really well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like to travel as light as possible but still with adequate clothes and good hygiene.  This battery powered toothbrush meets my general requirements, but with some considerations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very compact and lightweight, it fits into my pocket.  I used it on a three week trip, at least twice a day with thorough brushng, and the battery&#x27;s still going strong.  It looks cool, and the cover keeps it clean and aired out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is small; it doesn&#x27;t vibrate back and forth or in circles.  It simply vibrates- gum massage!  It does break loose some particles, but I find myself using a general back and forth and up and down brushing motion to do a good job.  In no way does it match my full size, real, electric toothbrush, but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to plaque heavily, so may I suggest that if you&#x27;re staying put for a while, buy a bottle of plague rinse to swish around before/after brushing.  Also, don&#x27;t forget to still floss- gee, I sound like a dentist.  Happy travels!</li>
    <li> A great product for people on the go that don&#x27;t want to go to the dentist and don&#x27;t get home to brush. I&#x27;ll be more popular now.</li>
    <li> This is a very soft toothbrush which vibrates just a little bit when turned on.  The cleaning action does not resemble that of a good electric model.  Save your money for a good Oral B brush.</li>
