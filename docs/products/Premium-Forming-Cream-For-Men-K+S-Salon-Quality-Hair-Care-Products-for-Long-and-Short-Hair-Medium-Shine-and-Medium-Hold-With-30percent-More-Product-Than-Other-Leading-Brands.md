<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works great. Love the product</li>
    <li> This is a great cream for my husbands hair. Easy to use...doesn&#x27;t take much...and smells good.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Husband uses it to just have his hair stand up a little. Works great, and a little goes a long way. Did I mention it smells amazing?</li>
    <li> I know this is advertised for men but women like it too.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks and am very pleased with it.  I threw out my other products that are difficult to work with.  This isn&#x27;t sticky and hard to remove from my hands or hair.  It&#x27;s easy to work with and makes my hair look good and adds shine.  I have a short pixie cut.  This helps me get ready and out the door fast.  Will definitely keep using.</li>
    <li> My father uses it and likes it. I have not had any personal use with it. He says it works well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and smells awesome! My husband loves it for his short hair</li>
    <li> Works great for my sons hair!</li>
    <li> Great product for men&#x27;s hair. I holds the hair in place after styling it the way you want without making your hair feel or look stiff. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Definitely a must have for anyone with a defined hair style.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture and smell of this product.  It has a nice hold without doing any of that stiff hair thing.  It also works really great on little fly away hairs.</li>
    <li> Versatile hairstyles  for my sons! Easy product  to use, we can add to hair whenever for a wet, smooth look. I personally like this technique because my boys part and comb their hair to the side for school. But for the weekend we apply dry to hair for a textured piece-y look. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. I am always trying new hair products and I am sick of all the flakes and residue most hair products leave. No flakes or nasty residue.Smells good and holds well too.</li>
    <li> Two dozen reviews for this product all with varying vague descriptions of a fruity coconut scent. It&#x27;s pina colada. This cream smells like pina colada and yes the scent lingers for several hours after. It&#x27;s at least as strong as tgi BED HEAD separating wax and it leaves your hair softer then the BED HEAD. If you like the smell of pina coladas, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> my teenage son loves this cream , her hair looks much better</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome and has great staying power in my husbands hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great to use when my hair starts to get a little longer and I just want a light hold and some texture.  It also has a very nice, clean scent.</li>
    <li> So I bought this for one of my guy friends who is very picky about his looks. He absolutely loves it! He said it is really easy to use and makes him feel suave. The container is very sharp and seems to say &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34;. The cream seems very thick almost like a tacky type texture but not in a bad way. You only need a tiny bit to style. I have seen him play around with his hair a bit more, sometimes a smoother look sometimes a bit more textured and sometimes full on spikes. It has a nice smell to it, tropical and clean, but also reminds me of a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; fragrance. He told me that he really likes it because even using it in his hair his hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down and still feels clean/non greasy. He says it washes out easily as the first time he ended up using way too much and had to re-wash and start over lol.</li>
    <li> If you are a man, this line of products are top of the line. They work! Imagine that! They have masculine qualities that are unique to the brand. Highest possible recommendation.</li>
    <li> Pretty thrilled with this product. My friend&#x27;s boys love it and it arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Works great! Doesnt leave hair feeling sticky or greasy. My husband uses it to spike his hair and it stays in place very well.  He really likes this product and has already told me when it gets low, I will be ordering him more.</li>
    <li> OMG, the smell alone is AMAZING!  It boarders on manly and sweet and I can&#x27;t stop opening it and smelling it.  It holds my nephew&#x27;s thick head of hair in place and he looks like a little stud with his hair all in check.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Works great, good hold, but not to stiff. This jar will last a long time!</li>
    <li> works very well and doesn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
    <li> Great packing, looks real slick in the can - I look slick using this stuff. The hold is truly a medium with just a little amount of shine. Kind of cross between gel and some of the softer creams out there. I am giving it 4 stars for one reason - it may or not happen to you. I took it on a trip and it was in my bag apparently on its side/top. When I took it out and opened it up, a lot of the cream fell out, I salvaged most of it but maybe if it was a bit more viscous in the can - it would be a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Just used this on my husband and it&#x27;s fantastic. The scent is amazing!</li>
    <li> Smells refreshing, not greasy. Has a non-chunky hold that doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp or hair. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> It smells great!  Works wonderfully for light styling, look for a firm hold if you have spikes because it does not do well with them--what I did notice is my hair smells great after using it and it isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave the just showered put product in my hair look on you!</li>
    <li> Would not pay as much for this but its a good product.</li>
    <li> Best product ever! My son loves it!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! Smells amazing</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Bought this for my toddler boys hair. Strange texture you only need a tiny bit. Better than gel.</li>
    <li> great!  will buy again</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it should. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and actually forms hair!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. It holds his hair without the shine.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this forming cream. It&#x27;s light weight and silky. I use it for the whole family. It works well for my husband, my 6 year old and my 9 month old baby.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it. Held hair in place and lasted all day</li>
    <li> Husband likes it, but feels like sometimes it leaves a residue.</li>
    <li> Top of the line forming cream for any hair type.  This hair cream is more like a strong paste and really &amp;#34;HOLDS&amp;#34; hair in place.  I have such thick full hair that sometimes even the strongest gel or hair spray doesn&#x27;t quite give me the hold I need for an entire day.  I love how this stuff goes on and really holds down my hair.  I&#x27;ve started using this the next day I got it and have been using it ever since.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again once I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a little bit (about this size of a quarter) really goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He likes it very much.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this for styling his hair, it wasn&#x27;t greasy or stiff, and kept it&#x27;s hold all evening. We&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> This forming cream really seems to work well. I got it for my significant other and he has enjoyed using it. </li>
    <li> Not a fan. My husband doesn&#x27;t care for the odor.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Holds well. Just as good if not better than the salon version I just got!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff. Works best on wet hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Awesome product works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments on how good my hair smells! This stuff is AMAZING! I can&#x27;t believe I have been wasting my time and money with other products in the past. K &amp; S is now my go-to product for all my hair needs! Will be definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> Husband likes it. My son who is used to glue type products felt the consistency was a little runny. It did hold well though.</li>
    <li> Waiting on posting my review because I really wanted to see how my husband liked it.  So last night he asked me to grab him some more cus he was almost out.  He said it worked well &amp; was easy on his hair.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I like the consistency and scent of this forming cream. I use just a tiny bit to keep my hair from looking so frizzy. It does the trick without making my hair crunchy - and so far no flaking. I cannot tell you how many products I have tried that flake and make you look like you have a dandruff problem. This product will last a long time considering how little it takes to be effective. I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Smell like coconut lotion.  it medium held, it give moist look but no shine and wet, I think it good for short hair and spiky style.</li>
    <li> Great scent and great hold.  This cream adds thickness to hair.  It is best for short hair styles, especially to obtain a &#x27;piece-y&#x27; look.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Nice forming cream. Grandson has fine hair and he was able to style his hair the way he wants.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He only used it once so far, but seemed to like it. If I don&#x27;t forget, I&#x27;ll update once he&#x27;s used it more.</li>
    <li> This line of hair product is great.  The forming creams smells great.  My hair is still in place and it&#x27;s the end of a rainy day.</li>
    <li> Works great and keeps the style as you wanted it. No need to reapply this. Works all day good consistency. Not sticky.</li>
    <li> smells good. nice one.</li>
    <li> I loved the hair gel so I decided to give the forming cream a try. No complaints here. I love it as much as the gel. Easy to use and comb through my hair to style.</li>
    <li> Great product with fantastic delivery!</li>
    <li> Great styling product - reminds me of a palmade so it&#x27;s good for texturizing. It has little to no smell so you can still wear your favorite cologne or perfume without it clashing, or use it for styling perfect spikes on your kids. A great, overall, multi-use product.</li>
    <li> This hair cream is a good product, it holds well and smells great.</li>
    <li> Good shine, not the greatest of hold, my hair falls down a lot! overall a decent product</li>
    <li> Best hair cream ever!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, washes out easily</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft.  Wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice forming cream, good hold without being overly heavy.</li>
    <li> My husband looks so much more professional since he has started using this forming cream. The details matter.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works great not too heavy and doesnt flake.</li>
    <li> He loves this and how well it works.</li>
    <li> works great!It smells really good,My husband&#x27;s hair won&#x27;t be messy anymore,I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cream wasn&#x27;t my husband&#x27;s favorite. He wished it was waxier for a better hold because he felt like he had to sue a lot and really work with it to get any sort of hold from it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son for that spike-y but not greasy look. It is thick and rich but perfect once rubbed into hands and applied to dry or wet hair. It does not remain sticky just well structured.</li>
    <li> I use hair product to style my hair every day, and I decided to give this product a try. Got a sample from my friend and totally love it. It smells really great, and it does not leave any sticky residue on my hair.It leaves my hair looking natural and it holds for the whole day. Just add a small amount to my hair and I&#x27;m all set. Great quality and great price. I definitely recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Whipped texture.  Holds style well in humidity.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Seems like glue but I was pleased to find that putting on my fine hair when wet yielded a nice, not stiff, hold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as I expected, and was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> figured id try this for my husbands curly hair, he wasn&#x27;t completely thrilled with it he said &amp;#34;it was cool&amp;#34; which can mean it was excellent in men&#x27;s speak but ive seen him when he really enjoys a hair product... not the same. i wasn&#x27;t completely in love with how this made his hair feel. i suppose it would work better on other hair types.</li>
    <li> I was very timid about trying this new hair cream. I had it recommend it to me by a friend and he loves it. I bought some and tried it and honestly I LOVE IT!!!!! My hair has never been this way before and I receive numerous comments from both men and women. And yes I do recommend it to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Great product as always.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:45a103269954e84e145598dce5074e6a]] Wow.  The K and S forming cream is truly salon quality all the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forming cream arrived in a small Amazon box, well protected with some air cushioning.  The jar was in perfect condition when it arrived.  It&#x27;s a heavy duty, glossy, deep blue jar that you would might find in any high quality men&#x27;s grooming establishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid screws off and the contents are protected with a seal.  The forming cream is thick and rich and has a very pleasing scent.  The jar is a full four ounces which is thirty percent more than most other hair styling creams (3 oz. jars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This forming cream also comes with a 100% Money Back Guarantee, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be needing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount in exchange fro providing this honest review.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Kinda like a pina colada. Tight hold with a little stickiness/tackiness in your hands; but it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in your hair. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this product.  I had bought the shampoo which is great and ordered this when my American Crew ran out.  Give it a try - very impressed with the product.  Delivery quick and painless.</li>
    <li> I have possibly tried every men&#x27;s styling gel, cream, mouse that there has ever been. What I like about this is you don&#x27;t need much and it washes out easy.  The pricing is also very right for the level of product that it is !</li>
    <li> good product i love it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!  It holds his hair the whole day and it doesn&#x27;t smell nasty like other hair products that he&#x27;s tested.  Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> The hold and shine are good, the scent is a little fruity and intense at first, but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> a friend of mine recommended this new product for me last week so I tried it out. It&#x27;s perfect for me! I&#x27;ll definitely be getting some more of it soon!</li>
    <li> I keep an eye out for gels/creams that are a great bang for the buck.  Krieger + Sohne is the real deal, it works exactly as advertised and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking like a greasy mess.  Nice smell too.  This is my new go-to forming cream product.</li>
    <li> I chose to write a review on this product, because I felt that it was one of the only forming creams I&#x27;ve used that deserves a review! It is a fantastic cream, and very versatile! I would recommend this forming cream to anyone looking for the best new product out there for your hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> Love this Forming cream!! It&#x27;s only 4oz. but just a small amount goes a long way. It holds great for shorter hair. I&#x27;m not quite sure about longer hair. The smell is awesome and works perfect with the Shampoo. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described. Awesome customer service. It deserve every penny you spend on it.</li>
    <li> It really works, my husband and two son&#x27;s used it ,even me I&#x27;m using it everytime i go out to keep hair in place ,just put a little amount first ,last all day.Love it!</li>
    <li> Personally this did not meet my needs I like a little more of a stronger hold than this provides and the scent did not quite suit my taste it has a bit of a cocoa butter scent but I&#x27;m sure if your looking for a forming cream that has a medium to light hold and a more sweet scent you&#x27;ll like this</li>
    <li> Stuff is decent... if it is what you are looking for, personally I need something with more hold.  It isn&#x27;t for me but it does exactly as described.. med hold and shine, smells great, easy to wash out..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand... I LOVE the shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service... company called me, thankded me for the purchase etc.</li>
    <li> Skeptical about buying this at first as all other hair products have been a let down for me. But I was so glad I did because it is absolutely what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> I was hoping I would like this than the other two I used in the past (Suave styling paste and American Crew forming cream).&lt;br /&gt;The Krieger gets pluses from me with it&#x27;s size and price. It does have a medium hold, but not as good as a medium compared to the other two. And it does have a medium shine as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like too much was oily residue feeling after I put it on my hair. I wasn&#x27;t expecting for it to have this compared to American Crew, but it did. It does not wash off easily compared to the two. As for a washing it off my hair, it&#x27;s normal like the other two.&lt;br /&gt;Not a negative, but I did like the smell of the other two compared to the Krieger. Not a negative, but just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the medium hold does not hold as good and when I am forming my hair, it&#x27;s not as easy as the American Crew...I felt it had less control, but hair and hair styles are all different, so this is varying based on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I knocked two stars off based on my opinion and usage.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying it as I think it&#x27;s an awesome value. Y&lt;br /&gt;ou hair and style may benefit better from the Krieger cream than mine.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something different than my usual hair care product.  Saw this and thought I would give it a try.  And I found I really like i.  I am very used to the smell and feel of American Crew as I have been using it for years.  When I opened up this product it definitely did not smell as &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; as America Crew but then again I do not use a hair care product for it scent.  That is not to say it smell bad if is just different than what I was used to.  What I love about the product is how it works.  Is is an easy product to work with and holds all day long.  I feel it is far superior to my former forming cream.  When I run low on product again I will most definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling product and it works very well. Overall we are happy with it!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this stuff at a convention a few weeks ago. Let&#x27;s just say I ain&#x27;t going back to my usual american crew stuff! It&#x27;s a bit pricier, but when I think about the price per usage, it&#x27;s only a few cents per usage more. Totally worth the better quality stuff that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel so uncomfortable. Pain point relieved!</li>
    <li> Just got a free sample of this product and it was better than described! Worth Every penny! The Barbershop next to where I work just started carrying this line and I think the quality is better than any other out there! This is a must buy!</li>
    <li> Just received a free sample of this product. Love the great design. It&#x27;s professional product quality surely will find its way into the finest barber shops soon!</li>
    <li> Great product to keep hair in place without the sticky or crunchy hair.</li>
    <li> The best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. I have medium long hair and it works great. Not greasy, oily. Just right.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  A little too thick.</li>
    <li> This is great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, 100% worth the money. It will leave your hair smelling amazing and also will give you a great hold!!</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick and I&#x27;d compare it to &amp;#34;butch wax&amp;#34; for short-hair styles like spiked-hair, faux-hawks, or flat-tops. It has a somewhat tropical smell, very similar to coconut.  It&#x27;s not too overwhelming once it&#x27;s in your hair.  Good product!  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and feels on my husbands hair! Holds his hair great without being stiff!</li>
    <li> I started using the forming cream about three or four weeks ago, right before my last haircut.  It has great holding power without being heavy.  Also seems to stay clean after jogging the dirt trails in Austin around the lake.  Also it smells good.  Bottom line buy some you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This is single handedly the best product I have used in my hair. It holds well but is still soft and adjustable. I will be ordering again soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair cream. It really gives a nice shine and medium hold. It gives your hair so e nice texture. I have fine hair and it really worked with my hair well! The fragrance is intoxicating...</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I will buy again</li>
    <li> I wish Krieger &amp; Sohne would update the title on this forming cream because I have been the one using it on my very long light brown hair! I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I first wash my hair with their wonderful shampoo [[ASIN:B00JB6R7NM Best Shampoo for Men - Tea Tree Oil Helps Reduce Dandruff and Hair Loss - Krieger + S&amp;ouml;hne - 16 Oz]] (again, not just for men!) Then I follow up with this cream. I&#x27;m able use it on my hair whether it&#x27;s wet or dry &amp; it helps bring out the natural curls in my hair &amp; give it more body &amp; bounce. This cream also has a wonderful smell to it &amp; a little goes a long way so the tub I got will definitely last me a long time. I very highly recommend their products, this lady&#x27;s hair loves them!</li>
    <li> This forming cream product is great! I started using it about a month ago and love it. I&#x27;m the type who doesn&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time messing with my hair so I need a product that can do the job well and do it quickly. And that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve found with this cream. I also like how it smells. I highly recommend testing it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few hair styling products that will give me the hold I&#x27;m looking for without looking &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; it looks like there is no product in my hair. The smell is fruity and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on the scent. I only require a very small amount (the size of a small pea or a corn kernel) to style my hair, so the jar should last a long time.</li>
    <li> AGH I can only say good stuff about this product! The smell is amazing! It smells like pineapple and every time my boyfriend applies it I love it. It&#x27;s a very nice consistency, and way better than a regular gel. I would really recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s hair and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s easier to work with than any other hair gel I&#x27;ve used and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the way this stuff smells in my hair. That&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Great Scent!!</li>
    <li> This cream is much better than any other hair product I&#x27;ve ever bought.  It holds well and has minimal shine and while it does have a bit of a scent that I am not really a fan of it dissipates rather quickly so that is not really an issue.  My favorite thing about this cream is how a little bit really does go a long way, I use about half as much as I did when I was using other products so the &#x27;bang for your buck&#x27; is great.</li>
    <li> Ladies, if you are looking for a gift for the man in your life, this one is addicting. Smells so amazing. Light hold, but the good news is it doesn&#x27;t make the hair all stiff and crusty. This cream does it&#x27;s job while still making the hair look and smell great. And did I mention it smells amazing? ;-)</li>
    <li> Firstly, this smells amazing.  I originally bought for someone else - but thinking of keeping and ordering again.  I used this on my hair because it smelled so good.  I have dry coarse curly hair and frizz is a part of it.  I put this on when I got out of the shower and then towel dried my hair.  By the time I&#x27;d gotten around to drying it the cream made my curls more lively.  No frizz.  Amazing.  I have tried a lot of different products over the year - but this forming cream is awesome.  DefinitelyNo will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great smell!!  Doesn&#x27;t work well for my son&#x27;s hair, as it is a little too long but would work well for shorter cut</li>
    <li> Good hair product for all races. My husband loves it .</li>
    <li> I love all your products, and although I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis because of my hairstyle (I&#x27;m a woman), it&#x27;s great for special occasion &amp;#34;do&#x27;s&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Love it and smells good! Gentle on the hair, and scalp. Currently looking in other products off this line.</li>
    <li> Smells good! Not too fragrant! I buy it for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> This hair cream is amazing! I bought it for my 25 year old brother who more recently got into styling his hair. He has tested out lots of creams, gels, waxes, and sprays in search of the right product for him. Finally, he stopped looking when I gave him this hair cream as a gift. He loves how well it holds without leaving his hair greasy, sticky, or too stiff. It&#x27;s the perfect balance to hold his hair in place with a little shine, while still allowing for flexibility - and he has received many compliments (and phone numbers) when he goes out - so I&#x27;m happy. Plus, it smells great! I&#x27;ve already ordered more for his birthday. Makes for a great gift!</li>
    <li> it gives mid - strong hold for the hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good forming cream with a good smell. Easy to use. Personally, I like this more than the others because of the texture and it won&#x27;t hurt our hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product~! It&#x27;s a great styling cream and non-greasy! All my gels and fiber gums leave my hair greasy after an all day wear. This styling cream great for casual business use and then changing up at home for evening festivities. It is medium hold, so it works well for my short hair. I recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a natural-looking, non-greasy hold for their hair!</li>
    <li> It came quickly. Product Has a soft Consistency and is easy to apply unlike hair wax. Also smells great!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Bought this for my husband to style his hair and he loves it. It&#x27;s really creamy and not at all greasy like his old styling stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. Not only is he happy with how well it works, but we are both in love with the smell. It is not too overpowering and it is a natural scent. It smells like a pina colada. Love it!</li>
    <li> UPDATE:11/4/2015 I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for some time now. I love it! I use it on my 2 year old and I like that it&#x27;s not sticky but it has a good, flexible hold. I love the smell now and often get comments on how good my son smells. :) I definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to use for my boys ages 7 and 20 months. I&#x27;ve used it once on each of them. I like that it wasn&#x27;t too stiff. It held their hair in place for several hours and I&#x27;m sure it would last longer on someone who doesn&#x27;t touch their hair all the time. It has a very strong smell that I don&#x27;t care for, but it&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist, this stuff is awesome medium hold long lasting my guy, and my sons like it and want me to style their hair now, they usually could care less, great texture! :-)</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s hair won&#x27;t be messy anymore</li>
    <li> Love the way my boyfriend&#x27;s hair looks with this! It also smells really good!</li>
    <li> 5 star quality!!!!!! Grab yours today!!</li>
    <li> Really good hair cream for men. Smells good and is non-sticky.</li>
    <li> My boys and husband would not leave the house without this in their hair, we love it and it is easy to use for all ages</li>
    <li> Great product and price point. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My sons love this styling product. It makes it easy to get that messy/I woke up like this look that is popular right now.</li>
    <li> I got a men’s shampoo from the same company and my husband loved it. So I decided to try this one as well. It smells good and has a nice smooth texture. I used it on my boys hair for some special days and it was so easy to make the style I wanted!! It didn’t leave any sticky residue on the hair and comes off pretty easy. My hubby didn’t have a chance to try yet but I am sure he will like it.</li>
    <li> Son dosent like the smell but loves the way it fixes his hair. Diffentaly a keeper</li>
    <li> Smell great and you only need a little bit of it for it to work.</li>
    <li> Great product for price!</li>
    <li> Thank you!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold well and leaves flakes</li>
    <li> love the smell, forget my husband, I am using it :)</li>
    <li> This cream has a few great advantages - not sticky on your hands afterwards, not sticky in your hair afterwards, smells great, and keeps hold. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, but will stick with this one from now on.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well this works, couldn&#x27;t get over the smell to try it. :/</li>
    <li> My husband love the feel of this and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great scent...got this for my husband and he LOVES it! Its not greasy or flaky. It holds his style all day and washes out easily. I even use it on occasion to give my hair some texture :-)</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband when is very picky when it comes to hair products.  He doesn&#x27;t like the stiff feeling or the waxy feeling and this is just perfect and s per easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> Hubby is soooo picky with hair products he liked this stuff A LOT said it smells great, doesn&#x27;t flake, dissolves into hair nicely and is never crunchy with good hold! HTH.</li>
    <li> Works great, not super sticky which is awesome. Leaves hair feeling great.</li>
    <li> Holds hairstyle great but flakes.</li>
    <li> smells very nice and coconut-y :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Use for long hair and works great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he likes it a lot. Better than the drug store crap.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product as soon as he is out I will be purchasing him more.</li>
    <li> Got this as part of a gift basket. It smells great and the recipient loves it. He says it&#x27;s exactly what he needs.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with these products! This is no exception. My significant other says he loves this. It doesn&#x27;t make a mess of your hair and washes out easily. This is a winner!</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Son really likes this for his hair.</li>
    <li> My son loves this. He likes to spike his bangs, and this product works great. Doesn&#x27;t smell to bad either. Definitely a great product and his spiky hair lasts almost all day without having to reapply like other products we have used.</li>
    <li> Love how it styles my hair and smells great!</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:f07fd94e56a00ba808f5dbf14121d727]] This is definitely my favorite of all of Krieger + S&amp;ouml;hne&#x27;s brilliant products! The smell is totally out of this world! It is an exotic and exciting aroma that keeps its scent all day long and is sure to please you and everyone else who comes close enough to smell it! The consistency works great for varied hair styles as well! You can easily achieve firm, edgy spikes with short hair or messy, tousled locks when your hair is getting longer.  Every time I open the jar I get excited to try out a new style!</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he loves.  He had been using other hair products that just didn&#x27;t hold very well, and i think it bothered me more than him! This holds great and he looks so much better.  Girlfriend approved!</li>
    <li> This product is nice and thick. It works well in all kinds of hair. I use in my six and nine year old son&#x27;s hair. My husband also liked to use it. Holds hair week without being too stiff.</li>
    <li> My husband is very picky about hair products and usually spends ton of money on hair gels. I was offered this product during a promotional period, this review is written in my own words. I was excited to gift the gel to my husband and a little hesitant because I know he is particular about the products he uses. When I opened the package, I was shocked at the small size of the container! I thought to myself, this stuff must be amazing! When my husband came home from work I gave him the cream and he hoped in the shower so we could test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forming cream was well packaged and the scent of the gel is great. It smells very tropical, white color and pretty thick consistency. My husband had a hard time getting his hair to stay in place and we both had to work the cream in his hair. After a couple of minutes of styling, my husband got irritated and got some of his own get to get his hair to stay in place. Even though my husband said the gel did not work well for him, he really liked the packaging, the scent and that the gel is not sticky on his hands after use. My husband said he will continue to use the cream until he learns how to work it in his hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my son&#x27;s hair. Just the amount of hold, with out any stinky product smell or flakes. Love it and would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special about this product vs a store bought product but it still works as directed</li>
    <li> Loves this! Great Buy!</li>
    <li> Husband say it works,  and I like the smell a lot. :)  That usually don&#x27;t go together, this is one the a few products that can get both :p</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad, and he loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product.  My husband uses.  Nice find great deal.</li>
    <li> My goto hair cream is Difi, but this one feels a little bit better.&lt;br /&gt;My wife got this for me on a flash online deal.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out and i&#x27;m really impressed with the feel of the cream and how it holds.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy, almost lotion like. Similar consistency to Difi,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this again.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and smell. Good for those smooth styling</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great! Not to heavy and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky and oily looking. It allows flexibility of my hair to move and not loose it&#x27;s style in the wind. Also, the blue jar it comes is is great, matches the blue in my bathroom. Highly recommend this product and the other products from this company as well! Salon quality at better prices!</li>
    <li> Clean hold, smells great, and washes right out. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Bought for my boyfriend.  He likes the hold it has, not too stiff.</li>
    <li> Ahh this men&#x27;s forming paste smells amazing! I can&#x27;t pinpoint it but it smells fruity and citrusy. The product is very creamy and sticky which is needed to keep the hair in place or in a spiked up style. I used it on my little man and there was no residue and his hair looked really cute and stylish. I also believe this product can be unisex because when I had a pixie cut I also used men&#x27;s hair paste and creams or gels. So this is truly a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> This cream smells awesome and works perfectly!! Very creamy and goes on super nice. I can even use it on my kids hair! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This stuff is way better than Axe (totally worth the price).  I&#x27;ve used Crew for 5 years and this cream washes out faster and cleaner.  I use less product than the Billy Jealousy, so that is a no brainer as far as usage goes.  It&#x27;s hair cream so there isn&#x27;t to much to say, other than it is a better performer than any other one I have tried in the $10-20 range.</li>
    <li> I have used a few different products like this one over the years, but I usually stop because of the greasy feeling they leave in my hair.  This one does not do that!  It is creamy and goes on easily - having just the right amount of hold for my style.  I love the light, fresh smell it has.  I love this hair cream!</li>
    <li> Works really well to style my son&#x27;s hair. He has that messy spiked look! I love the smell too. This formula is not sticky, which I love! Great size and price!</li>
    <li> Gave item to my son who loves this product! I will be back soon for more product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> worked great in husbands tricky hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you, my son loves this</li>
    <li> smells great and works just as well as CREW. My son loves it</li>
    <li> My brother really likes how this product holds up his hair style.  It is strong and forms hair well.  Just be careful not to use too much cream because the scent can be over-powering.  He is not a fan of the strong scent.</li>
    <li> So this is officially my new favorite hair cream! The stuff I was using did work, but it was all sticky and it made my head itch. This stuff is super strong but has more of a creamy feel to it. If you are looking for the cheap crap, this isn&#x27;t it. This is high end hair cream and it is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the company is amazing! I will be a long time supporter.</li>
    <li> This forming cream is perfect for my little man!  My 3 year old son loves to have spiked hair and this smells great without being overpowering and its not crispy hard and when he messes with his hair it&#x27;s still cute with the messy look.</li>
    <li> This has a great hold and pleasant smell.  Only a small amount needed for a good hold too.  Great brand.  Especially love their peppermint/tea tree shampoo.</li>
    <li> Good product. Great scent. Recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I got it for my husband and he is very picky about his hair products. He loved it. It&#x27;s not sticky, holds really well. The smell is very subtle and very pleasant. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> this new entry into the market has a great hold, lasts longer than most in the same category and it has a great smell.</li>
    <li> We love all Krieger &amp; Sohne mens hair products!  Seriously try the line you will love it!</li>
    <li> Product does nothing except make hair after product dries look frizzy and unkept. worst hair product i have ever used</li>
    <li> This line of products are top of the line for man. Really make hair looks great and smell great!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this forming cream along with the shampoo . It is easy to use and it washes away pretty quickly . Plus it smells great .</li>
    <li> Exactly what you think you are getting.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Best product out there. I have been spoiled, I cannot go back to regular hair gel products.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son. Does a great job. Nice texture and fragrance.</li>
    <li> smells great.  I use it in my young son&#x27;s hair so i don&#x27;t really load it up, so it doesn&#x27;t have super solid hold.  It&#x27;s a nice light weight product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this since I never buy styling products on line. I am very influenced by other users. I saw this on YouTube and decided to try it. I love what it does to my hair. Very little goes along way. Great texture and great hold without feeling sticky. I can wash this off my hands without having to use soap. Thank you to Mark and Ethan for recommending on their YouTube channel!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my young sons&#x27; summer Mohawk haircuts.  It works great, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering cologne smell like a lot of hair creams for men, too.  Will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Not as stiff as advertised.  But great product</li>
    <li> This product did as it was supposed to. The only problem is that my son who is using it has naturally oily hair, and this really makes his hair extra oily.  I recommendthis for someone without the problem of oily hair.  It did hold really well.</li>
    <li> this product works really great, holds a good spike all day long, and smells really good</li>
    <li> I bought this forming cream for my husband, and he loves it! He is extremely picky when it comes to his hair so i honestly had no idea how this was going to go. I&#x27;m glad i listened to my instinct because this is his new favorite. On top of the amazing tropical smell, it actually holds his hair really well without making it look greasy. I know he would recommend this to anyone looking for great results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> It is basically like pouring maple syrup in your hair. . Smells great.  Thick and sticky but doesn&#x27;t do much for hold.  Leaves hair soft and fluffy. . Not wet and stiff. Not what I war looking for.</li>
    <li> My son loved this hair cream! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Smells great, like a coconut, or some other tropical scent. Gives medium hold like it says. This is not a pomade, it&#x27;s a little more gooey.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down like Crew, kinda sticky compared to BJ Ruckus but holds better. If it was less greasy and more shiny, I&#x27;d give stars. However, Considering that the quantity you get for the price is larger than Crew and Ruckus, I&#x27;d say this is a winner.</li>
    <li> Product is okay and does not hold thin hair very well. For the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff. Smells great.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this stuff! He said it&#x27;s like the stuff celebrities use. It smells amazing and I love that his hair is still touchable. I will definitely be buying this product again for him.</li>
    <li> Works great smells nice</li>
    <li> My husband is loving this product. It smells great and it has the perfect hold - not too firm, which can look straw-like, and not too weak - which would defeat the purpose. The amount you get it quite generous too. It should last for more than a few months.</li>
    <li> Perfect for countering my fly away hair in Winter.</li>
    <li> Medium hold looks natural but only held for about a hour in my son&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> Really makes my hair look awesome! Great product!</li>
    <li> Love the forming cream, the smell is great and works well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance. He loves  it and  it smells great</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good hair cream for a while, and I finally decided to give this one a try after reading a lot positive reviews. Let me tell you, it smells great and it does not leave any sticky residue on my hair. It holds my hair for the whole day and makes it look natural. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone I know, and would buy from this company again. Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> Great product!  There&#x27;s nothing better than a nicely groomed beard, and this product delivers and then some!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, he really likes it and it smells great. Would recommend.</li>
