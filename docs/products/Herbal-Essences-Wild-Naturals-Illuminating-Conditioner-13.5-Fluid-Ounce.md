<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this as a sample set. With the conditioner and the shine spray. I will start first with saying it smells fantastic. And the first day using it was great. However now, it builds up in My hair and makes it appear sort of weighed down. I would have been much better off with the detoxifying set. But I thank Influenster for giving me the opportunity to test this out. I have fine to medium blonde hair. If that helps any.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this conditioner from Influenster. I was worried it would just be like every other conditioner, I was wrong. It has a very fresh and light scent. It made my hair super soft, silky and shiny. My hair has been very dry and coarse and hard to brush. After ONE use of this product, along with the shampoo and dry spray, my hair has never felt better. I will for sure buy this line again.</li>
    <li> I got this via influenster as a test sample and it not only smelled very delicious, but it made my hair look and feel voluptuous.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary product to review from Influenster. This conditioner took me to a tropical paradise with its bold and lovely fragrance. It is extremely moisturizing and offered lots of slip for easy detangling.</li>
    <li> One of the best conditioners by far! It smells great and lasts long after the hair is dried. It stays silky and soft to touch. My hair was really dried out and by using the shampoo, conditioner and dry oil spray my hair has been rehydrated, shiny and silky ever since! I typically only was my hair every two to three days because I worry my hair will get dried out but this stuff smells and works so good that I want to use it more often! Seriously one of my new all time favorites!</li>
    <li> I received this great product as a free test sample from Influenster. I was please to find that it left my hair very smooth and tangle-free. It also cuts down on fly-aways. I would buy this!</li>
    <li> I received this sample from VoxBox and was really excited to use it. While it smells absolutely AMAZING it was just too light for my hair, even with the dry oil as a leave in. I have super thick, wavy hair that is halfway down my back.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing wrong with the product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Saying that, my mother with long, thinner hair loved it and has stolen the remainder along with the shampoo and oil!</li>
    <li> I have long, curly, &amp; highlighted hair, but this conditioner was average. While it smells fantastic, it didn&#x27;t do much in the way of moisturizing my hair. If you are looking for a light conditioner, then this product might work for you. However, if you need a bit more moisture on a regular basis, find something else. I might recommend this product to a friend who has fine or short hair, but I will not purchase it in the future. I received these products for free from Influenster to test and review.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals  makes my hair soft and I love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Detoxifying conditioner with 100% hand harvested Cassia.  Whatever is going on - I think the best thing about this product is the Thai Lemon Basil Essences scent.  It smells fresh and beautiful, without competing with the fragrance I wear.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would use Thai Lemon Basil in the oil elixir  they also make instead of the sweet smelling fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Not a deep conditioner like Pantene or Dove, this is more of a lighter conditioner. My hair still looked great after using it, but i need a little bit more than I would when using Pantene. My hair is over 2 feet long and i feel like i have to use a pretty good amount of this conditioner to get enough worked into my hair. This bottle will probably last me two weeks, taking a shower everyday. Cost wise, this probably isn&#x27;t the best conditioner for people with really long hair or that want that deep conditioning feel. I have used other herbal essence products and this is very similar to the conditioning strength of their other products. The smell is great, like wine grapes mixed with a tiny bit of floral, but not much.</li>
    <li> My daughter has the longer hair of the two of us, so I gave this to her for consideration.  According to her, it&#x27;s a 3 star product.  It applies thinly so she needed to use more than her regular conditioner.  Her hair felt good after the application, which is a positive.  However, she noticed that it left a citrus type of odor that she described as more sour than sweet smelling.  Not the best possible endorsement.</li>
    <li> I used Herbal Essences products years ago and always loved the scent and effect on my hair - not sure why I stopped using them; probably when I started shopping at Costco, and the brand wasn&#x27;t offered there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marketing team had a lot of fun with the labelling of this product: &amp;#34;Wild Naturals&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Illuminating Conditioning&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Ignite Your Inner Shine&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Be a Vibrant Vixen&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Fiercely Good for Your Hair&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Wildly Potent&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Wildly Good&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Wildly Illuminating&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Hand-harvested in the lush forests of India, this Ayurvedic herb brings ancient wisdom to modern hair care&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Ignite Your Spirit....&amp;#34;  etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All marketing hyperbole aside, this is a nicely scented product that leaves your hair silky, shiny and manageable. Since I have short hair, it only takes a small dab of the fluffy white conditioner to fully tame my mane. In fact, I have to be careful not to use too much or I spend too long rinsing it out. The convenient flip top lid on the plastic bottle makes the lotion easily accessible when your hands are wet and slippery, though the lid doesn&#x27;t fit snugly. You wouldn&#x27;t want to take it on a trip since it would probably leak all over inside your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I am now a &amp;#34;vibrant vixen&amp;#34;, but my hair does look and feel great !</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Conditioner is a nice product for the price. For a cheaper brand, this does a fine job of leaving my hair shiny and well-conditioned. And I really like the fresh smell.</li>
    <li> While it may seem a given, &amp;#34;Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Conditioner&amp;#34; is a necessary companion to &amp;#34;Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo&amp;#34;. When using just the shampoo, while my hair felt clean after washing, it felt a little dry and this conditioner fixes that. It has the same natural ingredients and pleasant smell of the shampoo and you only need a very little amount of conditioner to get the benefits of body and shine.</li>
    <li> This medium consistency conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny, smelling pleasantly fresh and fragrant. It rinses clean without residue to weigh down my hair. Massaging it into my hair and smoothing it down the hair strands before and during rinsing minimizes tangles. Overall the product delivers as advertised. It will be in my rotation of conditioners for it&#x27;s shine enhancing properties.  I&#x27;ll stock up when on sale.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  It conditioned without making my hair feel weighed down.  The scent was really nice too.  Would definitely use again.</li>
    <li> My hair is a lot smoother now thanks to this lovely conditioner!</li>
    <li> I got this product free to test and review.  I was pleased with it.  It left my hair very soft.  The smell was a little funky though.  If it had a better scent I would be more likely to buy these products on a regular basis.  Once I got over the smell, I had no other problems with it.</li>
    <li> This is relatively cheap conditioner but it leaves your hair soft and clean. I usually just use a product that has shampoo and conditioner in one and using a separate shampoo and this conditioner has definitely made a difference.</li>
    <li> After receiving a sample of this conditioner along with the matching shampoo and dry oil and trying all three for a few days I can say that it&#x27;s pretty deep conditioning for someone who has fine hair. I don&#x27;t need to use much before it feels like my hair is completely covered and I didn&#x27;t leave it on as long as I normally would have. As I mentioned in the reviews for the other two products, I think the big draw of Herbal Essences products is the smell. They smell great and unlike other hair products, the scent really lasts. So, using the shampoo, then the conditioner and the finishing with the dry oil will leave your hair clean, conditioned, shiny and smelling very pretty (if you like flowery scents that is).</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I got this in my Influenster box and I have used it every day since I opened it. It leaves my hair extra soft and shiny, but doesn&#x27;t cause a lot of build-up. I can still skip a couple days between washings, which is a problem I have had with other conditioners.</li>
    <li> Received from influenster to test and review resulting in this becoming my new regular shampoo!! Makes you hair feel beautiful, clean, and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that can frizz up easily, and this conditioner has worked great for me.  I recently received it free from Influenster to test and review, and I am impressed.  The formula is thick, which is a necessity for my hair type.  I finger-comb the product through my hair after shampooing and my hair is left feeling soft and not coarse when I get out of the shower.  I love the way it smells and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love love this conditioner, left my hair very soft . and this is coming from someone with thick, course and dry hair. Also it left my natural curls in place . in complimentary of influenster I was able to sample these products .all three together is like magic . I am so in love with my hair right now . not only it smells great, it works better .</li>
    <li> I received this set for free as part of a test group. I have loved Herbal Essences since the 90&#x27;s so I was so excited to get this kit! I&#x27;ll start with the scent, herbal essence doesn&#x27;t disappoint! It&#x27;s so fresh and clean and perfect for spring! My favorite part was the treatment, however, I wish it said how long to leave it in for before rinsing. My hair looks great! I&#x27;m very happy and would purchase!</li>
    <li> Love it! I smells wonderful, hydrates well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. It helps to tame the curls and the frizz!</li>
    <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection, complementary for reviewing purposes. I am a hairstylist, and am used to using high-end products. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the quality and performance of these products. Especially the Illuminating Dry OIl Spray. It is amazing. Perfect texture and amount of shine. I will definitely be repurchasing the dry oil spray. The shampoo and conditioner smell great and left my hair feeling silky and smooth. My hair looked gorgeous and shiny after drying and styling. Great job with this collection Herbal Essences! Thank You Influenster, so sending me these products to try!</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells very nice. It may be a bit fruity for some but sometimes it&#x27;s good to come out of the shower smelling like you should be sitting in a basket somewhere. Nothing wrong with that. The conditioner itself is silky smooth and not overly greasy like some conditioners tend to be. My hair is probably a bit too short to give you proper talk on whether or not it detangles or gives it a shine like it should but hey, my wife seems to think it does the job quite well. Take it from her if not me.</li>
    <li> Like the &amp;#34;Tuscan Fig&amp;#34; Herbal Essences shampoo, I was a little sketical of the scent of this product , especially because I have no idea what a Seaberry is.  However, just like the shampoo, I thought this smelled excellent and I was pleased with how little my hair ended up smelling after I rinsed out the conditioner.  The lotion itself is thick and creamy, and didn&#x27;t leave any funny residue on my hair, so thumbs up for that.</li>
    <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating conditoner says that it is cassia-scented, but it doesn&#x27;t have the spicy sweet scent of cassia spice.  Nor does it smell like seaberries, a.k.a seabuckthorn or Hippophae.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it has the usual strong floral and fruity alcohol smell of the standard Herbal Essences shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent lingers and I wasn&#x27;t a particularly big fan of the strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, thin-follicled straight hair.  This conditioner did leave my hair shiny and soft, so it does what a good conditoner is supposed to do, functionally.  I&#x27;m going to keep searching for something more in the tea tree or cinnamon scents spectrum, but your mileage may vary depending on what fragrances you like.  I advise taking a whiff of it in person before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I am big on scents and I love the cassia and seaberry in this conditioner that make my hair smell amazing. It also lives up to the claims on the bottle of adding shine and I also got volume in my naturally wavy hair that was unexpected. I love Herbal Essences products as they are affordable and feel like a luxury product when using the beautifully scented creamy textured shampoos and conditioners. I want to try them all.</li>
    <li> **I received this product free to test and review from Influenster**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot rave enough about this conditioner!  It&#x27;s so light!  It has a magnificent scent and didn&#x27;t leave my hair weighted down after rinsing like some conditioners can do.  This conditioner also contributes to an excellent shine after my hair dried.  Brushing my hair the next morning wasn&#x27;t painful--all my locks were perfectly conditioned and easy to smooth my hairbrush right on through.</li>
    <li> I was chosen to test and review this product. And i really love the smell and the non greasiness of it. I also love how shiny my hair is !!!</li>
    <li> I received this as part of my Influenster box. It smells really great and it conditions pretty well. But I have bleached hair, so I need something with a bit more conditioning power, but if you have normal hair it does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> I liked the way it made my hair feel and it even felt volumized but, for me, the only drawback was the smell...it wasn&#x27;t pleasant for me.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited when I received this product to test. The first thing I did, with any new hair product I use, is to check and see how it smells. It smells really good in the bottle, while washing my hair, and even after I blew dried by hair. Usually the smell from the shampoo and conditioners aren’t noticeable after you blow dry your hair but my hair still smelled good. I was able to see that the shampoo and conditioner did make a difference in terms of the shine when I just used the shampoo and conditioner alone. When I used them plus the Dry Oil Spray, it made my hair look more greasy and oily than clean and shiny. I will be buying the shampoo and conditioner but will not be buying the Dry Oil Spray in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free to test and review but the opinions are all mine.</li>
    <li> I recived a free sample from influenster to review. Honestly it does make my hair smoother, since my hair is super dry, conditioners are great for me! Love that it&#x27;s inexpensive so I can easily repurchase.</li>
    <li> Like the shampoo, it smells great and gives off a nice fragrance all day. It definitely conditioned my hair and made it smooth and soft. At the end of the day though, it&#x27;s still just a basic conditioner. If you&#x27;re looking to try a new conditioner and want something great smelling, then try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a sample of this product to test and review.</li>
    <li> This works nearly as good as Infusium, and smells good enough to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even got a compliment on how mice my hair looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silky and smooth, no sticky residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture filled, calmed my hair on the worst hair day you can imagine. VERY HAPPY!</li>
    <li> This smells really nice! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and thus far I have noticed no breakage. I usually use organic conditioners so I&#x27;m use to a gentle low suds formula like this. It&#x27;s not revolutionizing my hair care or anything it&#x27;s just a nice market brand conditioner that I Will probably rotate with another one I have so that my hair doesn&#x27;t get overly used to its formula. I still need to use a detangler though with my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> As with all Herbal Essences products it has a nice pleasant essence, but it&#x27;s lighter, and it doesn&#x27;t lingers too long. The conditioner is thick and a little bit goes a long way. It hydrates the hair in a mild way, my hair is being abused by the cold temps and the heater, which has been on all winter. And to be honest, I hadn&#x27;t spent much time styling my hair since the Holidays, why to bother with this weather? I&#x27;m using ponytails and hats all the time, but hey, spring is coming. However, I styled my hair for this review, I wanted to see the results on my hair after using both the shampoo and the conditioner, and the best way to see that is after it&#x27;s dried and styled. I&#x27;m happy to report that the results were great. The hair feels lighter, kind of fluffy. So, if you have regular dry hair, this is a good conditioner for you.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this conditioner so far is how soft my hair has felt post use.  I have noticed some brightening effect to my hair, but the biggest difference by far is the feel of my hair.  It has a wonderful smell and also comes in a bigger than normal bottle for Herbal Essence that are two extra bonuses!</li>
    <li> HERBAL ESSENCES WILD NATURAL takes the form of a white-colored hair conditioner in a 400 mL container. The product is secured by way of a flip-top cap. The flip-top has a flexible plastic hinge, but the hinge very small. As an experiment, I twisted it a couple of times and the hinge broke, releasing the cap. The bottle has a nice shape, with rounded corners. The product also has a gentle fragrance, which seemed a bit like ordinary perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFICACY. Although the product did provide a fluffy texture, when used by me immediately after washing, I did not do a direct side-by-side test with any competing conditioner. Hence, I cannot really comment on the efficacy of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGE LABEL. It seems that the main feature of this product is the wealth of creative phrases on the package label. I liked these expressions. The creative expressions are: (1) 100% hand-harvested CASSIA; (2) ILLUMINATING CONDITIONER; (3) IGNITE YOUR INNER SHINE &amp;amp; BE A VIBRANT VIXEN; (4) with REFRESHING SEABERRY ESSENCES; (5) FIERCELY GOOD FOR YOUR HAIR; (6) WILDLY POTENT; (7) WILDLY GOOD; and (8) WILDLY ILLUMINATING. The list of ingredients is inspiring, in that it discloses that the ingredients includes hippophae rhamnoides fruit extract and cassia hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride. The ingredients list discloses about ten components. One can reasonably assume that most of these have been proven to provide benefits to the hair. There is no question that chemists at Procter and Gamble (the distributors of this product) have a high degree of awareness of the functions of each of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDUCATIONAL. Reasonable minds may differ, as to whether this product has the fragrance of ordinary dime store perfume, or if this product has a more complex fragrance. At any rate, I decided to explore the subject matter of &amp;quot;seaberry,&amp;quot; in view of the fact that this conditioner contains essence of seaberry. Please note that &amp;quot;essence&amp;quot; refers to extracted oils. What I found was the following, all of which was educational to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seaberry is commonly known as, &amp;quot;sea-buckthorn.&amp;quot; The berries are edible, and though astringent and oily, unpleasant to eat raw, can be treated by being bletted, that is, by being frosted to reduce the astringency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the berries are pressed, the resulting juice separates into three layers: (1) a thick, orange cream on top; (2) a layer containing sea-buckthorn&#x27;s characteristic high content of saturated and polyunsaturated fats; and (3) sediment and juice on the bottom. The upper two layers can be processed for skin creams, and the bottom layer can be used for edible products like syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea-buckthorn fruit can be used to make pies, jams, fruit wines, and lotions. See, Wikipedia.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essence never fails! These product always stand up to their more expensive &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; counter parts. The odor,  function and price of this product is pleasing. It lives up to its promise. On eof those things that makes you feel good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essence products on and off for years. I have yet to run into one I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seaberry scent is nice and light. It smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t really linger after washing. The Cassia seeds supposedly helps protect hair from damage and breakage. I am not sure how I would measure that. For now I&#x27;ll just say I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. The conditioner did make my hair nice and smooth and didn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.&lt;br /&gt;I used this conditioner both with the accompanying shampoo and with a different Herbal Essence shampoo and can&#x27;t say I really noticed a difference (not that I expected one).&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a super amazing conditioner, but it is excellent for normal everyday use.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, but the weird thing is, it always makes me hungry when I use it because of the delicious berry fragrance. Sounds weird, I know, but I can&#x27;t help it. The fragrance is light and really, really yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough about the scent. :) The conditioner itself is very mild and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling lank and heavy. My hair is dry, fragile, and very thin, and this conditioner leaves it feeling soft with just a bit of a healthy shine. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always loved Herbal Essences shampoos and conditioners, but I think this is my favorite conditioner because it works well, smells great, and leaves my dry hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I received this product for testing purposes from Influenster. It smelled wonderfully fruity, even more so than the shampoo (at least to my nose) but again, as with the shampoo, it wasn&#x27;t overpowering. I thought that the texture of the conditioner was nice, but it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as other conditioners on the market. If you are looking for a lightweight, everyday shine-inducing conditioner, this is the one for you. If you&#x27;re looking for something more appropriate for dry or damaged hair, I doubt that this will cut it. That being said, this product did not weigh down my hair and I find the package design clean and attractive.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. When it comes to conditioner it is really important for me since I have long curly thick hair. For every bottle of shampoo I buy I must buy two conditioner. I received product complimentary to test and review. Although it this product does smell good and works okay it wouldn&#x27;t be my go to. Another brand tames my poof quicker. Hair has a mind of its own! I recommend this if you don’t have a poof ball on your head.</li>
    <li> Use tthis after the matching shampoo and your hair will look you just came out of the salon. I absolutely love this product and I&#x27;m looking forward to my next trip to CVS to buy some more. It works wonders and smells amazing! My fiance would not stop smelling my hair!</li>
    <li> Really nice product that made my hair feel really soft and look really shiny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick coarse hair. I&#x27;ve tried many brands of shampoos and conditioners to make my hair feel not only soft but look healthy as well. I&#x27;ve also tried many serums and sprays. I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would make my hair feel worse like other brands have. To my surprise by my 4th time using Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo, conditions and dry oil spray my hair felt great! My hair is soft, I could run my fingers through my hair and it smells amazing! The dry oil spray doesn&#x27;t make my hair look super oily either which I love. I will definitely be purchasing this in the near future. I was given this product free to test and review. But my review and opinions were completely my own, I will recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Conditioner for free to test and review from influenster. I washed my hair and used this conditioner on my hair. It has a citrus smell not too strong but perfect. My hair felt softer and lighter after just damp drying my hair with a towel.  After I dried it was definitely softer and looks great! This is a product for me and will buy it and recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I was selected to test and review this product. I love the smell and how moist yet lightweight the conditioner is. My hair came out very soft. The product also smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me for free from influenster to review! Like the shampoo, this product smells amazing! The smell wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as the conditioner but is still wonderful! I have a lot of hair so I only got two uses out of the sample I was sent. I used this conditioner with the Herbal Essences Illuminating Shampoo and noticed a difference in my hair in just those two days. My hair was shinier, softer, and smelled amazing! I used this product during 2 of my morning showers and was so sad when it was gone. The product had a great feel in my hair, I kept thinking it was still in my hair while showering but it was really just the product made my hair so smooth! I really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this for testing. It was a very light hair conditioner, which was nice. I have medium thick hair so I don&#x27;t need anything wearing it down much more than what it is. It had a clean, fresh scent, almost like something you would find labeled &amp;#34;clean linen&amp;#34;. My hair felt clean and soft afterwards, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it illuminated my hair in any way. If my hair was much lighter or much darker it may have had a more significant fact. Overall, its a good product if you&#x27;re just looking for a daily conditioner, but I don&#x27;t think it does what its intended to. (At least not for my hair).</li>
    <li> LOVE this conditioner! I am very picky about what products I use in my hair because of the &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; feel.  I received this product free to try.  I don&#x27;t think I would have tried it otherwise and VERY glad I did.  The smell is amazing and the overall feel of my hair is wonderful.  I go 2-3 days washing my hair and look for a product that doesn&#x27;t create an oily look.  From the shampoo, conditioner and dry oil spray-- I&#x27;ve been impressed!</li>
    <li> I received this conditioner as a sample from Influenster. As with the shampoo, I really like the smell of it. I left it in my hair for about two minutes and my hair was definitely shinier throughout the day. The only reason it&#x27;s not perfect is that it didn&#x27;t seem to detangle my hair as well as other conditioners do. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with short hair...what do I know?  I could have used it on my back, but I didn&#x27;t.  I used this product once or twice and my hair felt smoother, cleaner, and smelled better.  The berry smell is a little feminine - definitely a product meant for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curly-haired wife&#x27;s comments: &amp;#34;I enjoyed the scent.  It wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and smelled pretty.  The lather built easily and it seems like it would last a while with only a small amount each shower.  It got though my curls without making my hair feel heavy, pretty good detangler.  No residue leftover.  I like it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if detangler is a word, but she has a lot more hair on her head than I do.  Like I said, I&#x27;m a guy with short hair...what do I know?</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells, it&#x27;s become my new favorite scent. It&#x27;s technically seaberry but it reminds me of watermelon. It leaves my hair really soft and smooth without being heavy.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner!!!! The smell is amazing, which I know a lot of people said, but it&#x27;s really true. It makes me feel so clean and happy after using it. While my hair isn&#x27;t crazy shiny afterwards, the conditioner does leave my hair soft and smooth. I have trouble with my hair breaking, and this seems to help some. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> I got this along side the spray and shampoo in a #VoxBox from #influenster and this has a great smell but leaves hair feeling dry so :/ not really satisfied with it but thanks @influenster</li>
    <li> The very first thing that struck me when I tried this for the first tiime was it&#x27;s gentle citrus scent.  It&#x27;s a clean, refreshing scent that stayed in my hair even after rinsing the conditioner out.  There was no lasting residue as some conditioners can leave and my hair was left with a nice shine to it!  Would recommend this to anyone loving this kind of scent!</li>
    <li> I have wavy, shoulder-length hair, and I have a lot of it, making a good conditioner essential so that I can run a comb through it.  This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals conditioner does a pretty good job of making my hair shiny, silky, and easy to comb, although I&#x27;ve found that I lose some of my natural curl when I use it.  Because I can still feel the results the next day, even after I shampoo, I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;ll use this a 2-3 times a week, no more, to keep the bounce in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant, a little fruity, and not over-bearing.  I applied it after using Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat Shampoo and after Herbals Essences Naked 0% Shampoo, both with similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> The Herbal Essences brand of shampoo and conditioner is a brand that I like, and it will usually find its way into my shower when it&#x27;s on sale, so I was expecting to like this conditioner as well.  I do like the way the conditioner performs.  It&#x27;s thick and coats my hair well.  It also rinses cleanly and leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.  What I didn&#x27;t like about it so much was the fragrance.  It says it&#x27;s seaberry essence, and I just think it smells a bit off.  To me it almost smelly like stale gummy bears, a bit sweet but also sour.  My spouse says it smells like body odor, but he&#x27;s more sensitive to smell than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My hair is about 6 inches long, thick, and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... it&#x27;s a great performing conditioner, just don&#x27;t expect the usual floral fragrance burst you usually get from Herbal Essences.</li>
    <li> I have fine, but thick, blond hair.  This conditioner worked really well to make my hair tangle-free &amp; soft, but not so thick &amp; heavy that it was weighed down or greasy.  The next day after shampooing my hair still looked great.  The scent was nice and fresh- kind of grape-y- and was subtle after drying.  I also felt like my hair was a lot shiner &amp; less static.  I&#x27;ll continue to use!</li>
    <li> There are a few things that are important to me when choosing a hair conditioner. The first is that it leaves my shoulder length fine textured hair tangle-free after shampooing and conditioning. Check. This did a good job on that. Second is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down after drying it. My hair is rather fly-away and any conditioner with too much oil in it just makes my hair look flat and straight. This one doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, yet it has enough moisturizers in it to make my hair look shiny and lively. The last thing I look for in a conditioner is one that has a nice fragrance, but not overly strong. This has kind of a generic flowery fragrance with maybe a hint of fruit. It&#x27;s not one that stands out but it isn&#x27;t overdone either. (What ever happened to that wonderful Herbal Essence shampoo from way back when that smelled like a fresh herb garden? I wish they would bring that back!)  So this is a conditioner that I would purchase because it does all I things a conditioner should do and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences&#x27; signature, starting from when the line first entered the market, has always been its the FRAGRANCE.  So for their newest roll out - Wild Naturals - the scent is off the charts.  Intoxicating frankly.  Would wear this as a fragrance if I could.  Thai basil lemon, and it lingers too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner worked great for my thick but finely textured \\&quot;Irish\\&quot; hair.  Note, don&#x27;t use to much, because you don&#x27;t need much.  Just today used maybe a palm&#x27;s worth on my shoulder length mop, and my hair came out full and shiny.  Very nice results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the scentl of this makes you pick this up time and again.  LOVE  &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I think that Herbal Essences did a great job with the fragrance of this product. But the condition that this stuff left my hair in was terrible. I had to deep condition several time to fix the damage caused by using this line of products from Influenster. I cannot recommend and will not even finish the product sent to me. Will never purchase.</li>
    <li> This has an AAAMAAAAZING smell, GREEEAT HYDRATION, SHINNNEEE, AND SOFTNESS!!!! Thank you influenster!!!! I&lt;br /&gt;LOVE&lt;br /&gt;IT&lt;br /&gt;SO&lt;br /&gt;MUCH</li>
    <li> First off, I am very picky when it comes to conditioner. I require my conditioner to be on its A-Game and to prevent any kind of fizzing or tangles. However, I also have very fine hair, it also has to not leave my hair greasy or oily. This conditioner does a great job of leaving my hair soft and tangle free without making it look oily or greasy. Also, the smell of this conditioner is heavenly divine. The first day I wore this shampoo and conditioner, I had three people come up to me and compliment me. I received the product free to test and review and was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several Herbal Essences shampoos and conditioners in the past and have enjoyed their smell.  This conditioner isn&#x27;t any different.  It smells great!  I have fairly short and thin hair.  I don&#x27;t usually use much conditioner and even a little bit of conditioner usually leaves my hair feeling smooth.  This conditioner, like other conditioners I have used, left my hair feeling smooth.  This particular conditioner left my hair smelling great too!  I would say it&#x27;s comparable to the other Herbal Essences conditioners on the market. It&#x27;s an average conditioner and doesn&#x27;t necessarily produce different results than other conditioners (e.g. Tresemme, Pantene, etc).</li>
    <li> Love the smell.however, I&#x27;m not fond of how my hair feels afterward.  I don&#x27;t think it is really conditioning.  My hair feels dry.</li>
    <li> I received this conditioner to review from Influenster. It smelled good but I didn&#x27;t like the way it conditioned my hair. The consistency of the conditioner is very watery and it has a waxy feel vs a creamy feel. My hair felt dry and looked frizzy after using this. I would not recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a really good, fairly standard conditioner.  The scent is about what I&#x27;m going for - noticeable but not cloying and a little summery, which is nice with the weather as cold as it has been lately!  It left my hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I got this as sample along with the shampoo and dry oil spray from Influenster in a VoxBox on Tuesday to test and review. In just a few days I already see and feel a difference in my hair. I would definitely buy this product in the future!  Great hair products!!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this for testing. It was a very light hair conditioner, which was nice. I have medium thick hair so I don&#x27;t need anything wearing it down much more than what it is. It had a clean, fresh scent, almost like something you would find labeled &amp;#34;clean linen&amp;#34;. My hair felt clean and soft afterwards, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it illuminated my hair in any way. If my hair was much lighter or much darker it may have had a more significant fact. Overall, its a good product if you&#x27;re just looking for a daily conditioner, but I don&#x27;t think it does what its intended to. (At least not for my hair).</li>
    <li> I received this conditioner to test and review thanks to Influenster. I loved the fact it had essential oils in it and it was going to make my hair shine. However, I didn&#x27;t feel it really matched that compared to the same shampoo and dry spray. It was just like any other conditioner and honestly, it didn&#x27;t make it feel as good as others do. It was just okay.</li>
    <li> This conditioner left my hair soft and manageable. Despite wearing a fitted scrub cap for two straight days of work right after, my wavy virgin Asian hair still had some life in it after. I used this with the shampoo and dry oil spray of the same line. My biggest point of contention and the deal breaker for why I&#x27;d probably never buy this product in the future: The scent. It&#x27;s too fruity/floral/sweet, and the scent is so strong, especially in a hot shower. This may not bother other people as it does me since I tend to be fairly sensitive to fragrance and can get headaches from it, regardless of price point or type of fragrance. It&#x27;s just not my thing. I received a trial of this shampoo free through Influenster in order to review. I have not let this influence my opinion.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is like most other conditioners. Leaves my hair somewhat soft and shiny, but feels like there could be buildup after extended use. I didn&#x27;t love the smell or the consistency of this shampoo, but it got the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free to test and review.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample for testing purposes. I like the shampoo but my hair is really thick and course and it feels brittle after using this conditioner. I think it would work well for fine hair.</li>
</ol>
