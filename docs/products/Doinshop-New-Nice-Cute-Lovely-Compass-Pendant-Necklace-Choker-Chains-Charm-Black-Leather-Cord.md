      <li>but it is really cute and will be wearing it often.</li>
      <li>Absoutley love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Received mine yesterday and I love it❤</li>
      <li>Very cute wasn&#x27;t really a choker but very cute got many compliments on it</li>
      <li>but it fit perfectly and the compass wasn&#x27;t to big.</li>
      <li>Very long but very gorgeous i love it😍</li>
      <li>Looks so nice and exactly like the photo.</li>
      <li>Super cute.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s tied together, I could undo it and cut it to fit my neck size, then I tied it again.</li>
      <li>It was cheap and it shows</li>
      <li>Looks great and has a long adjustable cord to fit to the size you like.</li>
      <li>Luckily the look of it makes up for the difficulty it originally came with.</li>
      <li>I love my new piece</li>
      <li>Exactly like the pic</li>
      <li>but I would certainly order again.</li>
      <li>A little longer than I thought but still nice.</li>
      <li>the actual rope part didn&#x27;t fit like a choker.</li>
      <li>so it looks even bigger on my neck, but overall, it was an okay purchase considering the price, and I could just switch out the rope for something else.</li>
      <li>The charm is pretty and it arrived nearly 3 weeks early!</li>
      <li>Arrived 1 1/2 weeks early.</li>
      <li>I have to adjust it sometimes since it comes loose if you move around too much.</li>
      <li>was very pretty in my opinion, but for some reason--whether I just have a small neck</li>

    <li> Perfect glides nicely fits good no problems looks great</li>
    <li> Looks so nice and exactly like the photo. The only issue I had was it was too big for my neck. Since it&#x27;s tied together, I could undo it and cut it to fit my neck size, then I tied it again. I have to adjust it sometimes since it comes loose if you move around too much. Luckily the look of it makes up for the difficulty it originally came with. Arrived 1 1/2 weeks early.</li>
    <li> Very nice necklace. Exactly like the pic</li>

    <li> Absoutley love it. I was worried the string was going to be long but it fit perfectly and the compass wasn&#x27;t to big. The only thing was the shipping took quiet a few weeks but I would certainly order again.</li>
    <li> the only reason it&#x27;s not a five star is just the wait it took for it to get here. the estimated arrival was between 15 days but other than that I haven&#x27;t stopped wearing it and it is great quality!</li>
    <li> Great necklace ! Looks great and has a long adjustable cord to fit to the size you like. It does takes a while to arrive. (OVER A MONTH) so if you are going to get this give yourself enough time.</li>
    <li> Received mine yesterday and I love it❤️❤️❤️</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a great necklace</li>
    <li> Super cute. A little longer than I thought but still nice. I love it.</li>
    <li> The necklace or pendant it&#x27;s self was very pretty in my opinion, but for some reason--whether I just have a small neck or whatever-- the actual rope part didn&#x27;t fit like a choker. And it also slides apart sometimes so it looks even bigger on my neck, but overall, it was an okay purchase considering the price, and I could just switch out the rope for something else.</li>
    <li> I love my new piece I wear it everyday!</li>
    <li> I Lovee this necklace</li>
    <li> Very long but very gorgeous i love it😍</li>
