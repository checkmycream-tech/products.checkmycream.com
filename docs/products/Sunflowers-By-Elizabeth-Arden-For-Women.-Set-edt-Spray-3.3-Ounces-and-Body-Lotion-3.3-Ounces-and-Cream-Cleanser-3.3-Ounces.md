      <li>I love this light fragrance for summer time.</li>
      <li>so it was an easy choice.</li>
      <li>but i believe she was happy with the purchase as this was one of her favorite scents when she was younger</li>
      <li>No explanation given, no tracking available.</li>
      <li>Worked out great as a Christmas present for the mother.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t that this is original.</li>
      <li>The only problem that I ever had with wearing this stuff is that, in warm weather, you will and DO attract bees!</li>
      <li>They smell sweet</li>

      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I use it on my disabled daughter, it gives her a clean fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was ordered as a gift so the dents in the box made it hard to wrap nicely.</li>
      <li>No fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn in my nearly 50 years has ever been asked about so much as this one.  </li>
      <li>Appeared to have been handled quite roughly, but luckily the product itself wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my 19 year old niece.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth every bit I spent.</li>

    <li> This was a gift for my 19 year old niece.  It&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it for her.  She has been wearing this fragrance for over a year now.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Perfume bottle leaks after pump is used.  Problem with crimped metal lid seal to glass jar.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the set and I loved the price and speed with which it arrived.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love It....</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She loves the fragrance and found the amounts were just right for the money. It&#x27;s hard to find some fragrances in packaged sets.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom&#x27;s last birthday and it made the perfect gift!  She loved it and I loved the price.</li>
    <li> Always buy this for my.mom and she loves it. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Great package for the money</li>
    <li> Smells weird I don&#x27;t that this is original. Also I  could  tell we&#x27;re they peeled the clearance label off of it.</li>
    <li> Appeared to have been handled quite roughly, but luckily the product itself wasn&#x27;t damaged. This was ordered as a gift so the dents in the box made it hard to wrap nicely.</li>
    <li> A friend at church always wears this perfume and it smells wonderful (to me).  I would highly recommend it. Not too sweet not too flowery.</li>
    <li> This order was placed on May 7th and delivered a month later. No explanation given, no tracking available.</li>
    <li> I got it for my fiance and she said she loved it. Even said she had several people compliment her on the scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really beautiful scent that I&#x27;ve been getting for my mom for years. Everytime she runs out, I get a call asking &amp;#34;what&#x27;s the name of that perfume I like so much?&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s mom&#x27;s cute way of saying, son time for replenishment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always happy to get it for her.</li>
    <li> the corners of the box were a bent up but I just took everything out and put it in a basket other than that it was great</li>
    <li> Very bad experience, very bad product packaging is completely lost, not recommended, I made a purchase of several products, the seller lost everything I pack in one box. abusers! stole a perfume</li>
    <li> i purchased this as a gift but i believe she was happy with the purchase as this was one of her favorite scents when she was younger and she didnt think she could get this product anymore.</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume it smells so good and the price was right</li>
    <li> I love this light fragrance for summer time. It is inexpensive enough to apply after multiple showers or pool use. The 3-piece set is affordable and makes the scent last longer too.</li>
    <li> The great pricing amazon offers allowed me to buy several perfume &amp; lotion kits like this one for my girlfriend of the time. She loved them all and it was well worth it. Got to please the ladies boys!</li>
    <li> Sunflower spray is very nice and not over powering for anyone around the person wearing it.  I use it on my disabled daughter, it gives her a clean fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These box sets allow me to get the lotion and spray for a reasonable price.  I don&#x27;t use the bath gel a lot, but it is nice to have when I want to use it in her bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of Amazon, I don&#x27;t have to go out to look for the product.  It saves me time!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  I just got this for a b-day present for somebody else.  great price for something that smells so good!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume it smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s worth every bit I spent. Wish&lt;br /&gt;I could get the body wash alone in a bigger size.&lt;br /&gt;I love how I smell when I get out out of the shower!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and will buy more I have for many years!</li>
    <li> It smells like sunshine and honey.  The only problem that I ever had with wearing this stuff is that, in warm weather, you will and DO attract bees! LOL :)  It&#x27;s that pretty, they&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re a flower!</li>
    <li> No fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn in my nearly 50 years has ever been asked about so much as this one.  And I don&#x27;t even like sunflowers!</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift from the UK to the USA.  The reciprient told me that she is very , very pleased with the product and loves it all.&lt;br /&gt;  From my point of view, really excellent service and so easy.&lt;br /&gt;  Peter</li>
    <li> My wife loved the products.  They smell sweet and I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the perfume so it was an easy choice.</li>

    <li> Super fast shipping!  Such a great deal!</li>
    <li> Love Sunflowers.  This was a gift for my mom which is one if her favorites.  She loved it! She recommended it to several of her.friends as well.</li>

    <li> I have loved Sunflowers since I first came across it back in the 90&#x27;s! It is the only perfume that I do not get tired of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this purchase; I could not believe how quickly my shipment arrived. I had it in my hands 4 days after I placed my order.</li>
