    <li> this is the hair that I get from my local beauty supply store...It is decent, but is good for only 1 wear...which is NOT virgin indian remy quality!!! it feels nice, but after it is won after about 2 weeks it turns ugly!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on decent reviews and not having many options for 18&amp;#34; black hair here on Amazon. I have been wearing extensions for 7 years and can tell the length of hair by looking at it. The quality is okay considering what you are paying. I wanted to make sure I was not mislead so I went ahead and measured it. It was indeed 16&amp;#34; instead of 18&amp;#34;. I would of paid an extra 20 bucks if needed to actually get the 18&amp;#34; I intended to purchase.</li>
    <li> I received my hair extensions on time and as stated. The hair is silky smooth. I have cut it and put clips on. Have not washed it or curled it yet. But I love the hair. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, appropriate packaging. These extensions are beautiful, I recommend them to any girl that this dubious use. You will be surprised how well they are put, if you puts a professional person, no one will know that they are extensions.</li>
    <li> The hair is very nice, however,it only looks good when wet.  It does not flat iron good at all!  I give this hair rating a 3!  As I would buy it again...</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair that I ever purchased. The bundle is really little. The quality of the hair is really poor. Do not waste your money. If I could have given it zero stars I would.</li>
    <li> It was straight when I opened it but.... Mmm not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This hair is horrible. I actually ended up returning it. The ends were terrible. The length of the hair is not even what you get. And the bundles are very small. You would need to buy about 3 or 4 to do a full head. This is not Remy hair. The description and the pictures of this hair is false advertising. It does not even come looking like the picture. What is said in the descption has nothing to do with what you get. I wish o would have taken a picture of this hair. It was the worse by far.</li>
    <li> it got to me very fast and in good conditions I really liked the hair extensiones very smooth and pretty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad i ordered 2.... it came with very little...</li>
    <li> Too little bundle, look more a lot in the photo. Disappointed</li>
    <li> I normally spend around $150 to $180 on my hair extensions, and end up sewing the clips onto the hair myself.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know it was possible to buy hair for $40 and get damn near the exact same results! I was truly amazed!</li>
    <li> The first two times I bought this I was thrilled but this time Idk what was sent to me it wasn&#x27;t the same I couldn&#x27;t even bleach my hair to dye it ...</li>
    <li> This is was not only nice , clean and soft but it stayed that way for a long time . I&#x27;m very satisfied . Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this hair a second time and it is horrible . The hair is very thin and it is not 18 inches ..ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK I CAN NOT CO-SIGN THIS PRODUCT ..</li>
    <li> I usually hate buying hair online but this hair changed my view.  The hair was delivered a week after I purchased it.  I am currently in Germany. The hair was exactly what I wanted.  I wore it for a month before it started to shed but overall I will defiantly buy again and promote!</li>
    <li> Its a good quality of hair. It never tangled or matted up. I could curl it and flat iron it. The only problem I had is that I needed 3 bags instead of two. its not enough hair in the bags.</li>
    <li> Hair was really thin but they refund ur money quick</li>
    <li> Does the job i need it to do i didn&#x27;t think i was going to use the hair after i cut my hair but i have hair left and for the little styles i do it works not a lot og shedding and feels good on the hands and can use a flat iron on it use mines at about 400</li>
    <li> This is not 18 inche is 16, is not indian remy l not happy for product horrible is plastico no estoy feliz</li>
    <li> was not actually 18 inches. there was little to no hair in the bag the two bags made one bag. i took it to professionals i was then told i was ripped off!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife said the hair did what it was suppose to do for the price!!! 4 stars only because shipping was terrible and all packages were not together, so instead of paying for 1 express we paid for 3 and only one package was on time.</li>
    <li> The hair was good.. The only thing is that they&lt;br /&gt;folded it when they shipped it.., that made it harder to get the hair crease out..when the hair was put in my head But it got it here really fast and prompt... Great service*</li>
    <li> excellent item.. thnsk for selling. i hope make new shopping soon.. I recive yor note , i like your way to interactive with the clients. good luck.</li>
