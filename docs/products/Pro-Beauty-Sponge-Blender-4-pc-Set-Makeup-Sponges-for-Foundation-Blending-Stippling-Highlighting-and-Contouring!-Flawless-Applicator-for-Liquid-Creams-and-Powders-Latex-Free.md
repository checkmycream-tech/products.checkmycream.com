<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I keep making the mistake of thinking that there is a cheaper equivalent to the original Beauty Blender sponge, and I keep getting disappointed.  These were so stiff.  No matter how much I soaked them, they were like using a kong ball on my face.  For those with pets, you know what I&#x27;m talking about - long lasting chew toy.  Anyway, I still gave it the old college try, but my foundation preferred to stick to the sponge and not my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose this would be good for those who like the &amp;#34;barely-there&amp;#34; coverage, but this just didn&#x27;t allow the foundation to be released onto my face.  Waste of money &amp; foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the expensive Beauty Blender. UGH...</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. They make putting on my foundation so much easier. My favorite is the purple one. I feel it is the softest. Although I do use the pink one often as well.</li>
    <li> I received the items in a super fast time period. They are perfect and I really like them.</li>
    <li> Love them all! Great quality sponges and makes applying makeup easy and flawless</li>
    <li> Love these sponges!!! They&#x27;re super soft and blends out my foundation and concealer flawlessly!!</li>
    <li> These sponges are incredible! I had a really difficult time trying to find a beauty blender dupe as I had a hard time spending that much on a single sponge. I found these from a youtube beauty guru and it was such a good deal I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. These expand great, don&#x27;t absorb my makeup like some sponges do, clean easily and have a great texture. I love that the company sends emails and follows up with their customers, along with sending TONS of instructions on how to use these. There are great sponges and I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> received it in 2 days ....love love the product!!!! all 5 sponges play a role ... i didn&#x27;t know much about the all the other types of sponges but an email was sent shortly after detailing the role it plays. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE</li>
    <li> I bought the Beauty Blender sponges and loved them, but when it came time to replace, was looking for a cheaper alternative. I found this set on Amazon, and decided to buy based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The versatile shapes are great, and the quality is similar to the far-more-expensive Beauty Blender ones. As a bonus, the sellers are really nice, followed up with multiple tips via email and even offered a free gift as a thank-you-for-purchasing. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> From the moment I placed the order I was satisfied with the service provided. Email confirmation had also a guide of &amp;#34;How to use and care&amp;#34; for your sponges.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was prompt and the sponges are of great quality. I am very happy and YES, I absolutely will buy them again and most definitely I do recommend them :)</li>
    <li> These sponges are a makeup must have! I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to flawlessly blend concealer and liquid foundation. The damp sponge leaves a beautiful dewey finish.</li>
    <li> After using beauty blenders for the first time and for an affordable price I started falling in love with it! It is now one of my main make up tools I use everyday to blend my foundation out. It does give a airbrush finish and an even tone to my skin! That&#x27;s what I loved  about it! I gave it 4 stars because I started seeing holes that aren&#x27;t the big problem but it was hard for me to wash out the foundation. Overall it was a good first experience! :)</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how fast my blenders were delivered. They are very soft and worth it for the small price. I could see myself buying them again. Thank you Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! They arrived early, are excellent quality, and the sellers give full instructions on how to use and clean the sponges. I bought a second set for my sister, who loves them as well! My favorite was the purple sponge until my cat ran off with it, so I now use the pink and blue sponges. They all work so great and make even my cheap drugstore foundations look 1000x better. I would highly recommend buying!</li>
    <li> I liked them. Very soft and good for any make up. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got these yesterday and I put my liquid foundation on with the tear drop one, my makeup looked flawless.I absolutely love how it gives me the Dewey look! I&#x27;m definitely ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> The beautyblender is MUCH better.  These sponges are harder and don&#x27;t blend the make-up very well.  They are simply not the same material..the only difference is the space between beauty and blender in the name.  I really wanted these to be good and I was fooled by the reviews.  Just ordered another beautyblender.  Oh well...when it seems to good to be true...    Lesson learned!</li>
    <li> These are better then the beauty blender I have. Softer and blend better, good service, and live the price. Want to check out their brushes next.</li>
    <li> These are great! I bought another dupe from a drugstore and had to wash it about 8 times before it stopped smelling like plastic. These come out of the pouch smelling like... nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I totally &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; why all the different shapes are needed. The instructions on the back call for &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34; with one of them, which I don&#x27;t think is technically possible with a sponge. I think that term has come to mean &amp;#34;lightly press over and over again,&amp;#34; but now I&#x27;m being pedantic. These little guys get the job neatly and evenly, and wash really easily. Great tools!</li>
    <li> These are great.  I needed a new beauty blender, but didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for one sponge!  All the rave reviews here motivated me to try these.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I really like the purple and green ones.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have never used a beauty blender (I mean the one sold in Sephora) so I cannot compare them two. But I think beauty junkees has already done a great job. The sponges work well and easy to clean. Most importantly, they are cheap. I do not think I will choose a beauty blender over beauty junkees. They are really good and not pricey at all. You guys deserve to try it.</li>
    <li> These sponges work wonderfully &amp; at a fraction of the cost of the beauty blender. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> Though I was still using the good old sponges for applying makeup, I thought I would try these.  They are soft and spongy kind of like a stress ball!  They seem to blend well.</li>
    <li> These sponges are as high quality as the Beauty Blender, if not better. The price is definitely better. They are very soft, and give your face a flawless finish. They aren&#x27;t stiff whatsoever, nor do they have an odd odor. Each individual Sponge can have a specific purpose in your makeup routine, but they all work flawlessly on face makeup.  I love these sponges. I would definitely repurchase again. And the service is wonderful. They send you an email on the method of use for each Sponge. Its very helpful and appreciated. Highly recommend these sponges. I&#x27;m very content with the product and service.</li>
    <li> Thank You so much . It&#x27;s really amazing 👌😍 and so cuuuuuuute</li>
    <li> First off I must say up front that I LOVE the original Beauty Blender and will continue to buy it. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but it is so soft and pliable and gives an absolute flawless application. My makeup has never looked better. What attracted me to this sponge set was the variety of shapes and the affordable price. I find the pink egg to be way too large and dense for the face, so I have been using it to apply moisturizer to my neck and chest areas. The purple sponge is nice, but still more dense than I like for applying foundation, so I have been using it to apply highlighter and blush. The green sponge is my favorite, it is softer than the other sponges and great for applying concealer or for correcting mistakes around the eyes. I have not yet used the blue sponge, but plan to when the others wear out. If you can afford the original Beauty Blender, I still think it performs better for applying foundation since it is smaller, softer, and easier to press the makeup into the skin giving a more flawless finish, but I definitely recommend getting these sponges as well. The variety of shapes is a plus, the price is affordable, and Beauty Junkees seem to stand behind their products and give great customer service.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy these at first since I did&#x27;nt want people thinking I have sex toys in my bathroom.  My favorite one is the green one for fixing mistakes and eye shadow runoff.  My next favorite one is the pink egg shaped one, as it does really make my old wrinkled face look better by not letting my foundation settle in any of my wrinkles.  I haven&#x27;t tried the blue or purple one yet, so I hope they work just as good.  They were also a great price for all four sponges.</li>
    <li> These are ok sponges but not a good BeautyBlender dupe.  I saw these on a blog and read the great reviews but I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about.  My make-up looks so much better with the BeautyBlender.</li>
    <li> I bought these last week. So far I have used the pink teardrop for foundation/concealer and the blue flattop for BB cream and a tinted moisturizer. Both items have worked very well. When they arrive they have a faint odor. It takes several rinses to get them cleaned and prepared. Using them is simple, and you use less product to achieve a better finish with more coverage. Overall I like these and will probably order them again.</li>
    <li> I waited to write a review because I wanted to try all of them. These sponges are not as good as the ones you can buy at Sephora or even better, the ones at Marshall&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie when i first purchased these beauty blenders i was not expecting perfection i thought it was just some sponges that would do the same job as a foundation brush and it is NOT! These sponges are awesome, they tackle the hard to reach areas on your face and i find that i do not have to use nearly as much foundation as i have to use when i use my fingers or a foundation brush. These sponges are literally miracle sponges and im not the type to big up a product just because. An item for me,,has to show an prove and these sponges definitely have.</li>
    <li> The quality of these sponges is incredible! The material is nice and dense, not flimsy at all. They&#x27;re true BB dupes and I think they&#x27;re much better than the Real Techniques sponge. I have very dry skin and using these damp sponges with a stippling motion is the only way I can apply my liquid foundation without having it cake up. My personal favorite is the green one, which I use damp to apply the green Graftobian corrector to all of my red areas (porcelain skin tone with pink undertones) as well as getting the Graftobian highlight in the under eye area. The green sponge is an AWESOME way to apply concealers and to work on your problem areas in general since it&#x27;s super functional with the differently sized ends. I haven&#x27;t really found much use for the blue one personally, and as for the pink and purple sponges, I really can&#x27;t make up my mind between the two as far as stippling on foundation goes. Overall, I definitely recommend these to everyone who uses BB style sponges and will continue to order from this manufacturer/seller.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products before this and nothing comes close! The different shapes help for any and all of your makeup needs. I recommend this product to all ages and skin types! These Makeup Sponges will make your mornings faster and your makeup look flawless!</li>
    <li> Great beauty blender dupes at a more reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these sponges. They are clearly designed by a Pro. While they feel substantial, they are easy to use. I love the texture, it really does feel like suede! The seller actually sent an email with step-by-step directions on how to get the best results with this product - it is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;They clean easily and dry quickly, ready for the next makeup application. It is the best investment ever!</li>
    <li> I have tried many application blenders and have found these to be the best!!  They made my foundation look flawless.  They were durable and held up a lot longer than other applicators I have used in the past.  They are definately worth the money and will be the only applicators I use. :)</li>
    <li> Love the products. Love Beauty Junkees. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It can be overwhelming to look for a great quality sponge that&#x27;s as close to the &amp;#34;original pink teardrop&amp;#34; as possible, so I was thrilled to find it with Beauty Junkees sponges. I had several of the BB sponges but ditched them and have now ordered the variety pack twice. I love the options it allows you and quickly have learned that though the teardrop is wonderful, the other shapes serve fabulous purposes as well. They also stand by their products and will bend over backwards to answer question or correct any issues that may (rarely) arise with their products. I do believe I have become a Beauty Junkee for life.</li>
    <li> although it is not as soft as the original beauty blender, it is a very good dupe for its price.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 13 year old after she had asked for a similar, but more expensive blender.  I am so glad I did!  She loves them and I am so happy that they cost much less and work so well :)</li>
    <li> This really is a great product, bought as a gift for my mom, and she really likes the variety of shapes that came in the package. I&#x27;ve not used the original beauty blender so I can&#x27;t tell if there is a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; difference. We don&#x27;t plan on it either since we like these, there&#x27;s no need to buy another product. There service is great as well!!</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with my sponges, I&#x27;m not skilled in the makeup applying department but these sponges make it appear like I am.</li>
    <li> The sponges are freaking bomb! They&#x27;re relatively soft: with the green spade one being the softest and the pink teardrop blender being rather dense (wish it were a smidge softer). Overall, I loved them. They got HUGE once I got them damp, they don&#x27;t have any peculiar smell to them, they leave a lovely finish without getting my fingers really dirty, and they&#x27;re a pretty dang good deal even with the shipping fee w/o prime (~$21). Amazingly speedy delivery (took around 3 days to get to my house) and the service is very sweet and courteous.&lt;br /&gt;Only con I had was with some of the denseness of certain sponges, but they were still cooperative.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; they stained super fast o_o but I do not know if that is normal.&lt;br /&gt;Minor issues with the staining though :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would definitely purchase from Beauty Junkees again c:</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my wife, she loved them. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Sponges are a little denser than the original beauty blender, but they still work great. The sellers sent me instructions on each one, including products and sponge care/cleaning. The seller was more than helpful.</li>
    <li> These sponges are well made, seemed like they would hold up well, and they&#x27;re cute! I gave 4 stars because they seem to be a good product. However, I did return them because for me, they were just too bulky. Even having points and such. I am using the small white little sponges now and they just work better for me--getting into all the tight spaces like around the eyes and nose.  I wanted to add that the company has amazing customer support and service!</li>
    <li> I bought these sponges for Christmas and so far have only used the Pink Teardrop, but I love it! I use so much less foundation than before and it helps blend beautifully! Product arrived quickly and was exactly as promised!</li>
    <li> Very good product,  this was my first time using a sponge.  Normally I used my fingers or a brush,  but these provide a better,  smoother,  blended coverage.  I will continue to purchase these in the future.  I have not had any issues with them falling apart and I wash them after every use.</li>
    <li> Love these!!! I use the pink and green ones daily.  So much better then a wedge sponge or my hands.  I love that they came with instructions for each sponge for cosmetic novices like myself.  Beauty Junkees shipped the product quickly and have been great with communication! I&#x27;d definitely buy their products again.  Do yourself a favor and get these.  :)</li>
    <li> Very happy I made this purchase.  Now I can&#x27;t compare these sponges to the original Beauty Blender because to be honest I have never used one.  These was my first choice because well... get one beauty sponge for $15 or get four for $15.  I figured I would opt to try the four first and see where things went from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have to say I am extremely happy that I decided to buy the dupe.  The Green Spade makes that bag worth it alone.  It is by far my favorite out of the four.  So soft and spreads my foundation evenly and very light weight when comparing it to the amount of product I was using when using a foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I noticed right away that the Green Spade and Blue Contour are both significantly softer than the Pink Teardrop and Purple Pear.  Not to say that the Teardrop and Pear aren&#x27;t soft, they most definitely are.  But the Spade and Contour sponges have them beat hands down.  The Teardrop and Pear just seem to be much more dense.  I have considered that it could be due to the fact that the Spade and Contour sponges do have very unique shapes.  I just don&#x27;t think that is the only thing contributing to the density difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all and all I really have no complaint about this product.  It arrived two days before its estimated delivery date which was a pleasant and welcomed surprise.  So props on the fast shipping.  Since ordering this product I have received a few emails from Beauty Junkees offering tips on make up application with the sponges and just general inquiry to make sure I am happy with the product.  It is nice to see they are so interested in customer feedback!  I waited until I had gotten the opportunity to use all of the sponges before I left a review that way I could give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be making this purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! Blends beautifully!!!</li>
    <li> Love the sponges, and the instructions for use.  Thanks for the tips.</li>
    <li> i love these sponges. i can really tell the difference when I&#x27;m applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! must have!  Great quality and good price for the collection.  I like the costumer service and the follow up email and tips about the product.. Thank you,</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the beauty blender  at half the price. Nice quality as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased these sponges just recently, and after the first time of blending ( I also focus on contouring and highlighting) It worked great! I used them with Mac&#x27;s Fix Spray AND water.. still great.. These are my cheap alternative for $20 Beauty blender.</li>
    <li> Not only were all the other reviewers correct (including the 5 star reviews) but Beauty Junkees truly surpassed my expectations! My order shipped quickly and arrived within a few days, however the customer service did not stop there. I received notes in my package, e-mails etc., asking if I was satisfied and letting me know the company was there to help if I was not 100% happy with my purchase. Of late, you do not see that level of customer service and pride in customer satisfaction these days so it was quite refreshing. The sponges are also great quality for the price and work just as flawlessly as expected. This purchase from Beauty Junkees is more like a STEAL than just a deal. Thank you Beauty Junkees team for a fabulous product and ordering experience!!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I am not a major makeup person, I&#x27;m more of a eyeliner, mascara and lipstick girl. I recently decided to try a few new products like tinted moisturizer and cc cream and my friend who is super into makeup recommended a beauty blender. I&#x27;m also not the type to drop $20 on a sponge so I decided to try these first and I&#x27;m so glad I did! They are just like the beauty blender sponges and at 4 for $15, I&#x27;m sold! I followed the instructions to dampen the sponge first and I also tried it dry when in a rush, both methods worked great and applied the products evenly. Definitely worth trying!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to write a quick review to throw out there that I love these sponges...Customer service was outstanding, they emailed me with detailed tips and tricks for use and cleaning...They are exactly as listed, bright colors and easy to use. Will def be ordering more:)</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that works just as well as the beauty blender for a lot less and I found it! Not only does it work great and is extremely affordable, the seller also sends an email with how exactly use the different sponges (which is great for us sponge newbies). I would defiantly buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything other than brushes to put on makeup but now that I used these little sponges, I&#x27;ll never use another brush again. This sampler pack is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing several beauty sponge brands for awhile now - was interested in the BB, but just could not justify spending $20 on one sponge. After reading lots of Amazon reviews on these sponges, I decided to try them out, and I&#x27;m SO GLAD I did! My previous makeup sponge experience is limited to the very unimpressive little triangles you can purchase 12/$4, so I was excited/skeptical to see how much different these would be. Happy to report that the purple teardrop sponge gives me the most natural looking bb cream possible - I can&#x27;t imagine NOT using one of these any more. If you&#x27;re on the fence, why not give it a try - Beauty Junkees&#x27;s excellent customer service matches their excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great application sponge.  As good or better than original Beauty Blender and much less expensive. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love these. I will definitely order again. My favorite is the blue/aqua one. I use it dry for my powder. It is so much better than using a brush.</li>
    <li> Have always used brushes to apply my foundation.  Gave these sponges a shot just to see if I would like them.  Well.....the brushes are now gone.  These work so much better than brushes and clean up nicely. My foundation is flawless and stays all day!  Prices are acceptable for the quality and customer service you get.  So glad I took a chance on them!</li>
    <li> These sponges are an exact dupe to the high priced blender sponges. This was my second purchase, before these i purchased another set from amazon that were HORRIBLE....they did not expand when wet, they were useless and went in the trash, these expanded and clean easily with mild soap and warm water, no need to pay the high prices, buy these, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for a great product based on reviews and hoped it was an alternative to an expensive beauty blender but these things were hard did not blend and was rubbery. I don&#x27;t think I got the product other people wrote great reviews about. Was hoping I found something I could tell my cousins and friends about because we are all about that flawless look but as it turns out I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it am sorry it&#x27;s just horrible.</li>
    <li> These sponges are excellent for applying and blending makeup.  They can be used for foundation, concealer, highlighter, etc.  They also provided great information on the usage for each sponge!  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> These did not work as I was hoping for spreading on my covergirl bb cream. Even though I wet the sponge as suggested, they just pushed around the cream in clumps. Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges.  They seem to be very high quality.  Easy to use/clean.</li>
    <li> I liked it at first but it started getting black dots after couple of weeks. I don&#x27;t live in a humid region and I wash the sponge after couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to clean the mold looking black dots out of the sponge using a lot of different methods nothing worked. Sad sad.</li>
    <li> maybe it is just me, but too much wasted product, hard to clean, took too much time. my fingers are better artists than these little devices. just because they look good doesn&#x27;t mean they work good.</li>
    <li> I used to think a makeup sponge is just another makeup sponge - until these.  Super sturdy and dabs and blends beautifully!  I especially like the blue sculptor sponge.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great! The price was amazing because these sponges are normally expensive. You&#x27;d think because they are a good price, the quality wouldn&#x27;t be as great but they are. I love my purchase, thanks !</li>
    <li> I love these sponges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a few get ready with me/foundation experiment videos with ladies using beauty blender sponges and wanted to try them for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I likes that cost 1/2 the price of the one pink tear drop beauty blender sponge and you get more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me say that I&#x27;m am not one of those high maintenance type of women, with a 30+ minute beauty routine involving contouring and etc. Used to be, but I prefer to spend any extra time I get doing other things and I only truly wear make-up to hide my hyperpigmentation and blemishes. Thus so far I&#x27;ve only used the pink teardrop sponge for foundation application and the blue sponge that reminds me of a slanted door knob for my finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve seen with them so far is they stain easily, I&#x27;ve followed the recommended cleaning instructions using olive oil and mild soap to clean them but they stained right away. I&#x27;m not sure if the type of make-up one uses makes the difference with that but I wear MAC studio fix foundation and MAC Studio Careblend Pressed powder. Being that I wear expensive make-up, I was concerned that the sponges would soak up too much of my product using it up more quickly than I want to, now to say that it doesn&#x27;t soak up any would be a lie, it&#x27;s a porous material so it&#x27;s to be expected  but it doesn&#x27;t soak up nearly as much as I thought which is a huge relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stippling affect combined with the material of these sponges really makes a difference in the way my make up looks compared to using brushes or my fingers (which I still occasionally use when I&#x27;m in a rush) even for us lazy make-up gals who don&#x27;t have a rigorous make-up routine. I love these, I will definitely order them again when my current set gets old, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Great sponges and excellent price!!!!</li>
    <li> They do the job!! So much easier applying makeup now!</li>
    <li> awesome for the price</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted Beauty Blender sponges for Christmas and when I saw the price of the real things I about choked. Fortunately for me, I found this set on Amazon. It would be an understatement to say that my daughter was thrilled when she unwrapped this present. She loves them! Thank you Amazon for providing this option and thank you Beauty Junkees for the excellent service!</li>
    <li> I bought your beauty blenders for my daughter and she loves them. She really loves using the blue sculptor blender for her moisturizer and the pink tear drop for her concealer. She loves how soft they are and how well they blend out her make up. The spade has been a life savor for her when it come to her eyeliner. She just swipes it over the area a few times and POOF it&#x27;s gone.  She rates it much higher than her other beauty blenders she has purchased.</li>
    <li> I think these work great.  I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to aside from the cheapie white triangles, but I love how they work.  I can really smooth my under eye concealer well, and it doesn&#x27;t settle into the lines like it would without using it.</li>
    <li> I actually prefer these over the original  beauty blender.  They last heaps longer &amp; retain the water better then the beauty blender does.  The pricing of them obviously a plus.  I used both the beauty blender and these dupes at the same time and just saw and felt a noticeable difference.  My all time fave sponge from these set is the green sponge.</li>
    <li> great selection, arrived on time. great price for all of them,, my daughter was thrilled</li>
    <li> Wonderful! They work as well as the beauty blender and for such a great price you can replace them more often if you want!</li>
    <li> These perform well as makeup applicators. I have purchased the Beauty Blenders and don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the effectiveness of application when comparing both sponges. Additionally, the variety pack can be used for different types of applications or to take on trip I do see an absolute difference in price as the BBs are ridiculously priced for the job they perform and the breakdown/wash cycles per use. I have also ordered much cheaper versions of these makeup sponges from other 3rd party sellers on Amazon. These cheaper versions cannot carry out their applicator duties due to the toughness of the sponge structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent alternative to BB and outperforms cheaper sponge applicators.</li>
    <li> These sponges were very bad quality. they absorb all your makeup leaving practically nothing on your face. the real beauty blender is very soft and squeezable, where these are just very compact and tough.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE these sponges. My sister had purchased similar ones a few months back and she recommended I get some. It really helps make my makeup look better and more natural. Also, it helps with my acne since I&#x27;m no longer applying makeup with my fingers (which have  natural oils). I use the purple pear for my everyday makeup application (mostly just BB cream). And I use the blue one to apply moisturizer. They&#x27;re easy to clean and easy to use. Would definitely recommend these to anyone who wears makeup.</li>
    <li> I was one of those people who fell for the hype of the beauty blender sponge and paid $29 for it. Dumb! I wish these companies would put the exact material these are made out of so you could compare apples to apples.&lt;br /&gt;I compared the pink one here with the beauty blender. I used the pink Real Techniques on one side of my face and the beauty blender on the other side. Looked in a magnifying mirror and was amazed to see Real Techniques did a better job. Much more of a &amp;#34;air brushed&amp;#34; finish. Just because something feels different does not mean it is not as good or better. The pink one here is a little bigger than the beauty blender and slightly firmer. Larger means more coverage faster and the firmer sponge is effortless. Love it and really sorry I did not do more research prior to purchasing the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> I love these blender sponges! I have tried many other brushes and sponges and these work the best! They blend my liquid foundation so well and they really help save on the amount of foundation I am using! My daughter has also been using one for her eyeshadow and says it works great!</li>
    <li> Great service and good product for a reasonable price! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. They apply makeup like a dream. My favorite one is the green spade. It makes the finish of the makeup so flawless and beautiful. And for the price, you seriously can not go wrong. Also, the customer service is exceptional.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter.  She liked the pink one the best. It is good for under eyes, forehead and cheeks.  She hasn&#x27;t really used the others much. She said she thought the quality was good for the price.</li>
    <li> The authentic one works much better. Good quality for the price though.</li>
    <li> 4 amazing, latex-free, non-allergenic, reusable (a little bit tiny) beauty sponges for the perfect price! I have tried the Beauty Blender, but actually prefer these because of the different shapes! I love the size of them and the different shapes make conturing and applying foundation simple every time. I am very picky and hardly write reviews, but these are truly FANTASTIC! You seriously will not regret purchasing.</li>
    <li> This set is wonderful! It arrived on time and came in a cute little bag! The sponges fit perfectly and are so easy to use, I love it. I would buy these again!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I will definitely recommend them to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> it is wonderful. I used it for a wedding this weekend on myself, sister, and niece. gives a airbrushed clean finish</li>
    <li> I am not so great with make up, so anything that makes it easier is a bonus.  I had heard about the brand name Beauty Blender sponges, but was not excited about the price.  I just couldn&#x27;t see myself spending $20 for one sponge.  I was excited to see a set of 4 different shaped ones for less than $13.  I was drawn in further by Beauty Junkees&#x27;s promise of 30 day guarantee.  I have only tried the tear drop one so far, but I definitely like it.  Much less messy than using your fingers or a regular sponge that absorbs half the makeup.  I use it to apply my BB cream, and think it blends much better than using my fingers.  If you are looking for a less expensive alternative to the brand name but with similar results, definitely try these!</li>
    <li> These are ok. The tear drop shaped one holds way too much water and hard to squeeze. The rest are ok and does an ok job, but moves way too much product off your face.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, comes with very detailed instructions that were very helpful.  Will be my new go-to makeup sponge.</li>
    <li> Great dupe for the beauty blender at a fraction of the price! Work so well when damp and I love that they come in a pack of 4 so that you can replace them easily. The green sponge is great for blending under the eyes and around the nose, the pink and purple sponges are great for wider areas of the face. I have already repurchased and I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I love all the different shapes, they come in handy. Double in size when wet and they soak up very little of liquid product. I&#x27;ve always used the original beauty blender, these are my new replacement. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really liked these sponges.  The blue one&#x27;s neck is a little thin and flimsy but they all have lasted through many uses.  I really liked the seller&#x27;s follow up information on different ways to clean the sponges.  I used the olive oil method.  I put a 1/2 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil in a plastic baggie, then put my sponge inside the bag and worked the oil into the makeup area on the sponge with my hands outside the bag. Then squeezed the makeup/oil out of the sponge while still in the bag and then took it out and cleaned it with a mild soap and air dried it.  Voila! No mess on my hands! No makeup stains on my sponge!</li>
    <li> Better than the more expensive ones. Don&#x27;t shred. Come very clean with a mild wash. Like them very much!!!!</li>
    <li> First time I tried these and they work great for makeup and bronzers.  It is so easy to apply makeup and I will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a blending sponge and so far I love this one! I saw a marked difference in the way my foundation came on...smooth and flawless! And the customer service so far has been really impressive. The company has sent me helpful tips on how to use and clean the sponges...and even offered to send me a free one as a bonus! I have only used the teardrop sponge so far but I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to using the others!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, it works well and gets the job done. I can&#x27;t help feeling, however, that a ton of stuff is building up inside it, even after washing it after every use.</li>
    <li> First the good, the green sponge is very nice, very soft and works well to blend foundation, not so much concealer. The blue works well for powder. The pink one ended up in the garbage, it&#x27;s way too dense for anything. I have not tried the purple as of yet. I will continue to use the blue and green, but these are in no way a dupe for the BB.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by the quality of these sponges.  They work beautifully.  I feel like a kid using them because with a little warm water they grow so they can help with the application of your makeup.  I&#x27;ve never used anything like these and I am very happy.  They come with excellent directions and cleaning instructions too.  Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> There are so many blending sponges on the market but I am SUPER happy with my Beauty Junkees set. Each one has a unique shape and use and the customer service of this intimate company is amazing! I like the pink and purple sponges for foundation and conturing and the blue for a creme blush. I don&#x27;t know that I am using them for their exact purposes but I am super happy with the result!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges!  I bought them to use with Bare Escentuals mineral makeup and bisque concealer.  The application is flawless and my skin looks so much better because of the application process.  I also tried these with liquid foundation and they worked like a charm!  I use much less of the makeup by using these sponges. The seller is wonderful to work with.  They sent a follow-up email asking how my purchase was.  They went the extra mile and that goes a long way with me.  Buy these, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Best makeup sponges! Foundation, concealer, powder &amp; blush go on beautifully. This is the best my face has looked! Excellent customer service as well!</li>
    <li> I have used extremely expensive brushes and I thought I had found my favorite brush - I decided to try these one day and it is even better then my brush.  My make up goes on smooth and seems to stay better then with the brush.  Highly suggest these sponges.</li>
    <li> I don’t usually write reviews but I felt that I had to for this one! Not only is customer service great (Beauty Junkees sent an email to confirm delivery that included tips on how to use the sponges, followed by a feedback email asking if I’d like a free sponge sent to me!) - the actual quality of these sponges is great! I got the sample set and the sponges are all dense, bouncy and do not absorb product! I have a beauty blender and a real techniques bb dupe which absorbs more water than these, amongst other dupes that have yet to match these! The blue sponge is the least one I reach for when using make-up, I now use it to apply masks…etc, the green spade is my favorite because it’s ergonomically smoother. Clearly if you use your nails to grip the sponges they’re going to fall apart sooner! Quality sponges for a fraction of the price and a great company!</li>
    <li> they are simply amazing!! so useful, I love them!</li>
    <li> I love my beauty blenders! This is my first time purchasing sponges and I&#x27;ve been looking for good quality yet affordable ones for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I use all of them for different purposes and they work amazing when damp. Great prices! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I just got my new sponges. I&#x27;ve tried lot of sponges. the best one is those sponges. Love it. It will make your skin glow. Shapes are good for any application. i have very sensitive skin. I would highly recommend those sponges.</li>
    <li> I really liked those sponges. To me they are better than the brand name for some reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Price. Off course it&#x27;s the price. You also get many more than the other brand&lt;br /&gt;2. Quality. Each sponge is different but they all work really well. The other brand is also really good. So it depends what your needs are.&lt;br /&gt;3. Functionality. They blend the make up really well. The result looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash them before each use to minimize bacteria and to apply the make up or the bb cream well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like comparing brands (but I just did lol) so I have to say that each brand has it&#x27;s pros and cons and you have to try for yourself to judge but my personal opinion is that these sponges are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I like that they are all shaped differently because they fit any need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the email with instructions that the seller sends was helpful and friendly.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the beauty blender. Super hard and rough to use... Save your money and buy the real thing. Totally scammed.</li>
    <li> wasting of money. doesn&#x27;t work. i don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ripped off as soon as I wet them :/</li>
    <li> My wife started using these makeup sponges and loves them. Been practicing contouring and they blend the makeup well. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love my new makeup sponges! They are amazing !</li>
    <li> just as described it serves the purpose, I&#x27;ve only used the purple so far and it&#x27;s very easy, makeup is totally easy using this, Foundation is a breeze with this, it settles perfectly on my skin, I love it and can&#x27;t live without this anymore.</li>
    <li> I used each of this beauty blenders and they are not user friendly. I tried both damp and dry and found that I spent too much time patting in my make up and layering over blemishes or other imperfections. I did like the completed finish of the sponge because it looks more even however, I found that my make up didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it does when I use a foundation brush. Maybe it&#x27;s my technique or maybe it&#x27;s just not a product for me.</li>
    <li> What a good deal! I&#x27;m very happy with these sponges and will not be looking for more expensive varieties. I got the variety pack and decided I liked the pink teardrop shape the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an issue with quality in my first package, so I alerted beautyjunkies. What great customer service! I had new sponges just a couple of days later and they are awesome!</li>
    <li> A little firm compared to beauty blender but I would buy it again.  Glad to get the sampler pack and try the different shapes.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great. They work just like the official tear drop ones, plus its helpful that they bring you the rest. It makes foundation go on smoth with no smudges. Also if you contour with liquid based make up, this set is a must have, they are great. They also tell you in the back how to clean them  which is good. All sponges always have a little residue of make up but following the directions on the back cleans them nicely.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great and the shipping was fast .. i like blue sculptor it easy to use  when im applying bb cream or foundation. Usually i&#x27;ll use the regular wedge now i hear a lot of people talk about those sponges so i gave it a try it turn out i like it...</li>
    <li> Best sponges ever!!! They&#x27;re  easy to use. Make sure you wet  them first. My makeup  looks like a professional  did it!</li>
    <li> Got all the women in my family hooked on these. They apply foundation with an airbrush like finish. I use them wet and dry depending on the coverage I want.</li>
    <li> for granddaughters and they love them</li>
    <li> Great product and great service</li>
    <li> Love these! Great quality better than the beauty blender!!!!! ♡♡♡♡</li>
    <li> Great set of sponges.  I received a follow up email once my order shipped explaining the use of each sponge and what they worked best for and other useful tips.  The packaging of the sponges also explained how to use them and maintain them.  I though it was pretty good customer service with just enough helpful information.</li>
    <li> These makeup sponges are magical! I love them.  They feel great on my skin when I apply my makeup.  They do wonders blending as well.  They are so very easy to clean as well, and they last a long time.  I am using these from now on. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> cannot compare to authentic beauty blender at all; totally a waste of money</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. Beauty Junkees got the product to me quickly and as described.&lt;br /&gt;my daughter hasn&#x27;t given me a review as yet, but the sponges appeared to be very good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t wear makeup a lot before I got these sponges. I hated trying to blend my makeup and having no success. I would end up with globs of makeup on my hands and on my towels. These sponges fixed all of those problems! They are awesome and so worth the money! I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> The pink sponge felt harder than the others asif theres a lump when soaked this sponge felt hevier nland harder then when it was dry the other sponges are.good shape apply your foundation pretty good abit on the harder side compared to the real beuty blenders but for that price its good</li>
    <li> These sponges are lovely. Great texture and the varying shapes lend to a world of uses. These are certainly a worthy alternative to the excessively high priced predecessor.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t make any comparisons there, but these sponges work beautifully in blending and providing sheer, smooth application. I used brushes before I got these and these definitely give me more of a dewy look, which I love! I use the purple pear the most, as I use it to apply BB cream, and it gives me beautiful, sheer, even coverage that can easily be layered if I need to. I mostly use the pink teardrop to apply cream blushes and blend out concealer under the eyes (these sponges really help in preventing the &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; look). I haven&#x27;t used the green spade or blue sculptor yet, but I think the blue one would be great for foundation/fuller coverage because of the flat surface. Cleaning these is a breeze compared to cleaning brushes, so that&#x27;s another bonus. Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase, and I think these are great sponges for beginners like me. In addition, Beauty Junkees is great, they&#x27;re very sweet and send you a couple follow-up e-mails with instructions and tips and even an offer for a free sponge!</li>
    <li> I will never use any other brand of makeup sponge again. They last forever. The pink teardrop shape is the best out of the bunch.</li>
    <li> I decided to give these a chance since I thought spending $25 on a sponge was insane. Not disappointed. They work wonderfully and create such a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> after seeing a tutorial online, I thought I&#x27;ll try this which is so much cheaper than the name brand. I&#x27;m happy I did. You&#x27;re suppose to soak the sponge just enough so it doesn&#x27;t soak up the foundation, and  It took several tries before figuring out how much water to leave in the sponge and how much to squeeze out, but once I did the foundation goes on so smoothly, beautifully.  I mostly use the green sponge now which is easier to handle and the small side help blend the foundation around my nose/smaller surfaces.</li>
    <li> These makeup sponges are way better than ordinary makeup wedges-which are fragile and rip easily- these sponges do what they are called for-a flawless application and its exactly what they do. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with these sponges they are very useful- I&#x27;d say they are exceptional- nothing beats these.</li>
    <li> meh I am neither here nor there about this product, the material is on the cheaper side but it still works</li>
    <li> Gift for wife...she loved it</li>
    <li> I had seen a video on using these sponge blenders to apply foundation and thought I would give them a try.  I have to say that I am impressed with how well this blends and gives me a nice smooth look. I was a bit concerned about how much more foundation it would take and it didn&#x27;t seem to take more than usual. I ordered the pink egg shaped sponge and find it pretty easy to use. I clean mine with antibacterial soap and olive oil as recommended after every use and it really seems to clean up pretty good.</li>
    <li> The funny looking blue one is my favorite (: it&#x27;s just cute to me haha. They&#x27;re all perfect beauty sponges though</li>
    <li> works pretty much like other beauty blenders.</li>
    <li> I have only used the green one for tinted moisturizer and concealor, but I love it! I will never use my fingers again. They are easy to clean and quite large! Should have been doing this all along! The price is great and it works well for blending. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Each sponge seems to have a different texture. The slanted-top hourglass shaped one actually was my favorite - it was squishy but not too limp, so probably the closest to the original Beauty Blender. The lime green one is soft, but stays compressed longer than the other ones when you squeeze it out, so that leads me to believe it&#x27;s not as dense as it should be. The purple one is oddly hard. And the pink one I gave away, so no verdict there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try, though. Maybe one or two of the shapes will work well for you.</li>
    <li> These sponges are wonderful! I&#x27;ve never used a real Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t make a comparison there, but I have used drugstore sponges and these sponges from Beauty Junkees are miles ahead. They do a fantastic job applying and blending heavy coverage foundation. I&#x27;ve struggled for years with looking cakey but these sponges make my makeup look as close to flawless as I could reasonably hope for. I&#x27;ve yet to use the blue and green ones, but the pink and purple are both great. They expand a LOT when you run them under the water. Great choice for those who want top-quality sponges but can&#x27;t shell out $$$$ for a Beauty Blender.</li>
    <li> These are great little sponges. I would recommend them to anyone. They got her before actual delivery stated. They Erie even nice enough to add directions for use.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these sponges they work great, I am taking professional make up classes and these sponges have been very useful really recommend them.</li>
    <li> This was an incredible deal ! My daughter is very , very happy with this product and i will use this seller from now on for this same product in the future !!!! Thanks again John Mckenna</li>
    <li> Love love love these sponges. They beat my beauty blender and real techniques. The price is great, and the variety of shapes makes them a must have.</li>
    <li> Most impressive Amazon order yet (and I order multiple times per month)!&lt;br /&gt;1. Arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;2. Great quality (I&#x27;ve purchased the expensive sponges and if I had them side by side with these, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference!)&lt;br /&gt;3. The seller contacted to provide tips on how to use the sponges - which was very helpful!&lt;br /&gt;4. The seller even followed-up to ensure I received everything and offered some cleaning tips.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering these to put in gift bags for my girlfriends or sister - I was very impressed with the sponges and the seller. 5 stars all the way!</li>
    <li> No words, these are simply amazing, gives your face a flawless airbrushed finish!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase  Love the effect they have on my makeup</li>
    <li> Ah. I am so in love with this product! I was using original Beauty Blender before and took the risk to try this to save on money. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be working really good because I am getting 4 pieces, compared to only 1 from beauty blender for the same price but I was surprised that it worked just the same, if not better. It doesn&#x27;t absorb my makeup and blends very well. I use one each for my foundation, concealer and bronzer and saved the other one as a back up. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I liked this sponge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is happy to have got what she want is the sponge.</li>
    <li> I already own the BB ( I received it as a gift) which costs an outrageous amount for one! I wanted another but could force myself to spend that kind of money on a sponge. I did some searching and found this set. They work flawlessly and for a fraction of the price you get 4 pieces that come beautifully wrapped.I am very pleased with this purchase and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> These beauty blender dupes are soooo amazing. Better than the actual thing if you ask me, because of the variety, it is easier to create a flawless face, the different shapes and sizes are so useful. I use all of these sponges frequently and haven&#x27;t had any problems at all. They came in really fast, and the baggie that they came in came with little tips on how you should use each sponge, what they seem better at. Beauty Junkees also have a youtube channel providing some tips also, so all of these resources are extremely good for the first time user. Fantastic alternative for someone looking to have a very nice quality, for a good price.</li>
    <li> These are okay at best.  Out of the package they work nicely, but once you have to clean them, it&#x27;s over.  The first time I tried to clean one (the pink sponge), I followed the directions exactly, but when I went to squeeze the water it, it ripped in 3 places.  (The company was nice enough to replace it for me, but still.) I tried to clean another one and used minimal water and pressure to avoid ripping it again - and it literally took 2 full days to dry.  Not a great product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these sponges. They are great quality and were inexpensive. i especially like the tear drop sponge because it gives liquid foundation a flawless finish and blends beautifully. I strongly reccomemd.</li>
    <li> I LIKE ALL THE DIFFERENT STYLES, BUT THEY ARE NOTHING SPECIAL AS FAR AS APPLICATION GOES</li>
    <li> Great products was expecting more I guess</li>
    <li> They work! After getting past the first time cleaning them (which should be done thoroughly before you use it because they contain something already in it...it bubbles) they&#x27;ve worked like a charm. Some are more flexible than other however none of them are hard to work with.</li>
    <li> Got my sponges and they are awesome!!  Starting with the packaging, they are so professional and make a great gift idea for your friends/family who love makeup.  Makes application of foundation/powder flawless and I believe I may even be using less product.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> The 4 pcs pro make up sponges blender set was a purchase made fort esthetics class. It was the best purchase by far . Each sponges is used for as deceived in the email received for beautyjunkees. I also use these for personal use and love how wonderfully each ones works differently yet has the same affect.</li>
    <li> Beauty blenders are better</li>
    <li> Loved em they made a huge difference in my blending .. I didn&#x27;t think it would but my make up finished so nicely! Recommended to all my friends</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! I just bought both the sampler pack of these and a Beauty Blender and have compared. They don&#x27;t feel quite the same the Beauty Blenders do, but they work just as well. They expand under water to twice their size which rocks! I love the sampler pack, the different sponges work in different ways which is awesome. I&#x27;ve never been able to wear just foundation and be happy without a powder but with the coverage these sponges give I was able to (Which is hard because I have acne!) They smell nice too lol. Long story short, save your money and get these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only recommendation I would make is a smaller size (like the beauty blender had the micro, except a tad bigger) for the eye areas. I&#x27;d definitely buy those!</li>
    <li> I Receive them and they&#x27;re great thanks ❤️</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! There is a slight learning curve at first, when you&#x27;re not used to stippling, but this is so easy to use and my makeup looked amazing!!</li>
    <li> These are great sponges, this is my second batch of them.  Will keep ordering them!</li>
    <li> These are the first sponges I&#x27;ve encountered that actually expand and stay large once wet. This allows you to quickly apply your makeup without losing the added benefit of that flawless airbrush look. I would recommend these to anyone, even other makeup artists.</li>
    <li> First off, shipping was quick and the seller sends you an email to follow up on the product which I think is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using beauty blender for years now but decided to try this product since it is more affordable and had good reviews. I&#x27;ve only used the product for a couple of times now but I can already tell that It is better than beauty blender. The material is high quality and does not tear easily which is a common problem I had with the beauty blender. The sponge had the same effect as would the beauty blender product so all in all, I am definitely switching to this one.</li>
    <li> really nice in applying foundation to skin, couldn&#x27;t tell a difference!</li>
    <li> Since I bought the variety pack, I clearly like some sponges better than others. Of course, my favorite is the tear drop shape. There is just something about it that allows me to apply makeup expertly with it. The other sponges had such peculiar shapes that all they can really do is a &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; motion. I haven&#x27;t tried the green one yet so I&#x27;ll see if I like that one. I started off with the beauty junkees sponge so I have no idea how the beauty blender sponge is like. But as far as I&#x27;m concerned the beauty junkees sponge probably works just as well and is more affordable too!</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. I was surprised at how many uses a little old sponge could do but it is truly the perfect concept. I was always wanting a better spread of my foundation and it really does work and I love the packaging and design. Thanks!</li>
    <li> What a fantastic price for a fantastic product... even down to the packaging it came in! I love the even coverage that the sponges provide and my daughter is using a few of them for theatrical make-up applications. We both have sensitive skin and have had no issues with break outs or sensitivity from using the sponges. Very, very happy with my purchase! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of 4 sponges for $12.97.  I have tried many similar sponges out there, many over this price for 1.  This is very comparable to the Beauty Blender but I would have to say the BB is much spongier and has more give.  All in all I would say these are great little sponges and I found uses for every single one of them.  The one thing I like about these in comparison to other BB dupes is that all the others I have tried started to deteriorate after a few uses and I wound up with little colored specs of sponge all over.  These have held up great in comparison and I have even washed them once with my BeautyBlender solid sponge cleanser, but you could also use baby shampoo.  All in all I would recommend these sponges, especially if you are concerned with price.</li>
    <li> OMG, what&#x27;s a wonderful makeup sponges. I so happy with my purchase!!! Thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> This beauty blender set is great specially when applying High Definition cream foundation. I&#x27;ve been using other brand which come only on one shape and more than twice as much. Having this different shape makes applying foundation, blush and contouring easier. The delivery is prompt and their customer service is top.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used a beauty blender so I guess this review might not be as helpful BUT i have purchased a 2 dollar &amp;#34;makeup blender&amp;#34; from Target... compared to that one, these feel like silk. They are very dense and luxurious and seem to clean pretty easily. I also love that the makers sent me two follow up emails to make sure I recieved the product and to teach me how to use each sponge in different ways, which was super helpful because I had never seen a couple of the shapes before. In summary, I would absolutely purchase these again, and recommend to a friend, you cannot find a better value for the price, especially since these feel so incredible, thank you Beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> I think the green one is the best! Surprisingly the pink one didn&#x27;t work to well for me! The purple sponge is good as well but I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use the blue yet but I can tell it will be good! Overall I think this package is well worth the money! The products are nice and work well for a beginner. I just prefer the purple and green because they really help get into those hard to reach places.  I was disappointed in the pink sponge but the fact I can order my fav sponge in a four pack now is super exciting. I use the real techniques sponge and although my favs in this pack are different to the real techniques sponge, I would purchase either to help put liquid foundation!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used the original blender so can&#x27;t compare. I will say I&#x27;m happy with this product &amp; my foundation definitely blends better than with my brush.</li>
    <li> Love Love LOVE these sponges.. I&#x27;ve already used them! And my makeup came out GREAT! I got compliments all night long! I&#x27;ve only used a makeup brush to my foundation on, but from now on I will only be using these blender sponges! Best purchase ever!</li>
    <li> Awesome sponges and excellent customer service. I use these sponges every day and they&#x27;re great - highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love these! In comparison to the higher priced similar product, these seem to be a bit more firm, but I think they work better that way. I use loose mineral makeup and it goes on flawlessly! Just be sure to follow the instructions that come with the sponges. The seller is very helpful and has excellent customer service. I am overall pleased with the price, product, and service!</li>
    <li> These sponges were everything I thought they would be. They work perfect with any kind of foundation I use! I am most deff going to buy more</li>
    <li> Good quality, affordable, and arrived quickly. I like the coverage I get - makes my make-up look less heavy, as I wear a liquid foundation or correcting fluid every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for over a year and I just ordered another set! I made a mistake and ordered another brand of sponges on Amazon because they came with a cute case and I had to return them because they absorbed so much product! These sponges work just as good (if not better) than the original beauty blender! My favorites are the pink and purple sponges. Green sponge is great for applying concealer. These are the best bang for you BUCK. Give them a shot!</li>
    <li> Work great.  Easy to clean. Different sizes are an added benefit.</li>
    <li> They seem nice, good quality, and interesting shapes. I tried it with my liquid foundation and also for softening blush. And while they got the job done, I didn&#x27;t notice any earth shattering results that would cause me to constantly purchase more of these oddly shaped sponges.</li>
    <li> I think for the price you get a pretty good deal on some pretty decent makeup sponges. One of the biggest differences I found between the beauty blender dupe sponges and an actual beauty blender makeup sponge was the way they feel. You will find the dupe sponges to be a bit harder feeling; while the actual beauty blender sponge has a more softer feel to it. I have been using the pink and blue dupe sponges more and have to say they are not too bad.</li>
    <li> It really gives that dewey, natural finished look to my foundation, concealer, AND contour. You get all four sponges, and all for a price cheaper than the Beauty Blender! The pink sponge is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I do not like these sponges at all. They are so stiff and they absorb a lot of make-up. The seller was kind enough to reimburse me the whole amount AND she let me keep the sponges, which was very nice of her!</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the reviews.  I had been looking for some new sponges and things in the stores were awful.  So I took a chance.  I love these sponges.  The company sent me an email shortly after purchase to make sure I understood how to properly use the sponges, which I appreciated.  Follow the directions  Great product.  One added thing...the packaging was great .</li>
    <li> These are so hard. No matter how much water I try to get into them, they&#x27;re really hard. They work okay, but not the best.  UPDATE: Adding a star for excellent customer service. I also was able to get my money back because I was unhappy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have only tried the pink one, so that is why I did not give it a five.  I have watched the reviews of similar products on YouTube and beauty shows.  This product swells as required and makes makeup application easy. As a novice, I require practice, but not due to a problem with product.</li>
    <li> I was really pleasantly surprised by these blender sponges! I&#x27;ve never used a Beauty Blender or any other makeup sponge, and I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much from them. I only wear BB cream, and I&#x27;m usually pretty satisfied with the coverage I get from using my fingers. That said, the price on these was right and I&#x27;m a bit of a sucker for those beautiful, bright colors, so I decided to go for it. I&#x27;m really glad that I did, because they somehow make the already-nice application of my BB cream nicer! I occasionally get dry spots around my mouth or active breakouts, and my BB cream sometimes accentuates those less-than-pretty spots on my face when I apply it with my hands. If I use one of these blending sponges, the BB cream looks way less cakey on those parts! Overall, the finish just looks a lot softer and more natural, so if you&#x27;re not into the heavily-made-up look, you&#x27;ll love the natural-looking finish you can get with these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges themselves are really nice quality. They&#x27;re soft and not at all abrasive, and they do actually feel slightly different from each other. They&#x27;re all different shapes, which is nice for getting at certain parts of your face (the green one is especially nice for difficult spots like the eyes), but the density varies a bit, too. The pink one feels the firmest to me, followed by the green, then purple, and blue is the most pliable. None of them seems to absorb too much of my BB cream, which is great. Overall, I&#x27;m really satisfied!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. They work great.</li>
    <li> Not the best but it gets the job done.It could have been softer.</li>
    <li> The love all the sponges!</li>
    <li> These sponges are excellent quality and are SO much cheaper than other \\&quot;big name\\&quot; blenders.  I would highly recommend this 4-piece set...each of the shapes comes in handy for different makeup tasks.</li>
    <li> The sponges work great. I get a clean and well covered application of my favorite cosmetic products and I am able to touch up all of my mistakes along  the way too. So easy to use and hygienic. Great product.</li>
    <li> I think using the sponge has made a definate difference in the appearence of my make up...i will not go back to using brushes only. I gave 4 out of 5 stars because im not sure you need all different shapes and 1 has ripped and I do not feel i am rough in my use. Still...its a great deal for price.</li>
    <li> I bought the sponges because of the reviews.  There work great from all my make up needs.  They&#x27;re easy to use due the sponges being large enough to hold still.  I received them quickly and they are very sturdy.  I save makeup because of them and I look better.</li>
    <li> I have two beauty blenders that i bought in Sephora and believe those are exactly the same thing and it works even better! Nice product!!</li>
    <li> First off I want to say I have never used the original Beauty Blender so I am not comparing these to that. I have only had it a couple days and I LOVE IT SO FAR!!! Feels great on my face, isnt too hard, pretty soft and bouncy. I have only used it on myself so far but I am a professional makeup artist so I do plan using it on my clients I love the effect it gives. It looks are brushed and not caked on like a brush can do. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> Love &#x27;em!! Justo with i&#x27;d bought more!!</li>
    <li> Really loving this set-- I expected simply a more wallet-friendly version of the Beauty Blender, but would choose these OVER the Beauty Blender regardless of price point. Not only are the sponges exactly what I expected, the packaging is really lovely. The fact that a little introduction email was sent to me upon delivery also really impressed me! For me, the customer experience is already amazing, and I&#x27;ve only had these little sponges for days. Will order again, and am looking forward to more interactions with this company!</li>
    <li> These work so well! Smooth blending and relatively easy to clean. Would recommend and will buy again in the distant future when I need new ones :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for blending. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use all the sponges yet but the pink teardrop works well for smoothing foundation on my face.  Will update when I have tried the others.</li>
    <li> I have been using BeautyBlender sponges for years, but decided to look for a dupe as the BB sponges were tearing easily and getting expensive to replace. Pro Beauty Makeup Sponges from Beauty Junkies expand when wet like BB and provides a flawless finish like BB. $20 for 1 BB sponge vs $13 for 4 sponges from Beauty Junkies. Easy decision, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into blending sponges and I have to say that I&#x27;m seriously impressed. The stippling motion is pretty easy to get down and my foundation coverage is even and pretty. Most importantly, the sponges are great on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Not as soft as &amp;#34;the other one&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really like this blenders, I think I might like them more than beauty blenders, I like they have different forms and the price is amazing. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Love the variety pack of the make up sponges and very affordable. I haven&#x27;t tried a couple of them yet but its been great so far. I even love the instructions of each one and the company&#x27;s attention to the customer.</li>
    <li> I got a Beauty Blender and it wasn&#x27;t all it was cracked up to be. I found these and really like them so far! They&#x27;re holding up well and seem to do a great job.</li>
    <li> The best makeup applicators!!!! They only ones I use now!</li>
    <li> I love these makeup sponges.  I own a Beauty Blender and love it.  However, I wanted separate sponges for applying different products, which meant purchasing at least 3 more BB&#x27;s....and, due to daily use, replacing all 4 BB&#x27;s every 3 months or so.  That can get expensive given the price of the BB, so I decided to shop around for a less expensive dupe.  I tried a couple of store brand sponges -- a waste of time and money.  I then looked to the internet and found multiple disappointing reviews about various similar products.  The comments about this set were mid-range, so I decided to give it a shot, and  I was very pleased to find that the Pro Beauty Makeup Sponges Blender Set provided soft, absorbent, pliable sponges at an excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I received the color and shape assortment displayed in the description.  Second, they came properly packaged -- individually sealed in plastic, and then enclosed in a mesh bag.  There was no chemical or other foul odor upon opening, and the initial wash was quick with no residue.  Given a day to dry, they worked equally as well as the BB.  Not too dense; soft and spongy, spreading my mineral makeup very well.  I have used the green, spade-shaped sponge for under eye concealer, but I tend to reach most often for the teardrop-shaped version (the one most similar in shape to the BB) for various applications, and have had no problems with tearing or breaking, or with inflexibility.  I have not tried using them dry, but the damp version works perfectly.  They do stain easily, so I would recommend washing after each use if you want them to remain fairly stain-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also applaud the instructional e-mail that the Seller sent prior to arrival of my Sponge Set.  It includes very helpful tips on use of the different shapes of sponges, washing techniques, etc.  I truly appreciated that extra step to ensure that I was happy with my purchase.  I will be reordering this set, and recommending this product and this Seller.this Seller.</li>
    <li> I received all product that was advertised. I love the sponges they make it so easy to apply my make up. I was worked since I use powder &amp; mineral makeup but it applies my makeup flawlessly!! &amp; for a great price!</li>
    <li> Very happy with these blenders! Excellent price and great quality. Fast shipping. Would order again.</li>
    <li> They were so stiff!! Maybe I just have a small&amp;sensitive face but still this is not bouncy and soft. It&#x27;s just like a weird stiff latex feel. Or like rubber hitting your face. Yes even after washing several times and trying to apply my makeup while it was damp. But no still dense. Hate it. Don&#x27;t even know how to explain it. Just straight to the trash. Great.</li>
    <li> I have used the sponges for about a month and a half.I choose this rating because I have received several comments on how good my make-up looks since I started using them. The different shapes make it easy to apply make-up in all places on my faces including by my nose.</li>
    <li> I use all four sponges on a daily basis. The blue sponge is great to apply your moisturizer , purple for concealer, pink for my foundation and green to clean up any imperfections I may have. Each sponge allows me to apply my products in an even manner on my face ,with out getting my hands dirty. It makes me feel like a true professional!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a few days and love them. They help my mineral make-up go on flawlessly without the mess of the brush and it seems to last longer on my skin. Very easy to use, store and clean. Would highly recommend, especially for those of us that like to have the 5 minute morning make-up routine!</li>
    <li> I have owned two of the Beautyblenders and thought I would try your makeup sponges. I would give you no stars but I was required to give you at least one. The sponge is not a quality product. The Beautyblender is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These sponges are well worth the money and very good quality.  Why pay double or triple for one sponge when u can these 4 for under $15??? Get them....u won&#x27;t be disappointed. A great bargain!</li>
    <li> These sponges are so versatile and pretty!? Although some of the sponges are not as soft as others, they work really well for liquid and cream foundations. I love using the pink sponge for my Mac studio fix but the quality is not as up to par with the original beauty blender. I may have used the pink sponge about 10 times now and I can see some parts of the sponge wearing out. Although for the price and the results that these sponges bring, better than all the knockoffs hands down. They are truly great sponges for beginners.</li>
    <li> It is very amazing product that help me in applying my makeup foundation cream .</li>
    <li> These are great value as you get 4 for almost the price of 1.  I haven&#x27;t had them for too long so I cannot speak for their durability.  I received nice instructions for their care from the seller and I do clean them often so I hope they will last a while.  And even if they don&#x27;t, again it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that none of the shapes works for hard-to-reach areas, like the inner eye corner.  They look like they would but they expand when wet and get too big for those small crevices.  I think I will sacrifice one of the sponges and cut it in order to be able to use it for this purpose.</li>
    <li> I was looking into buying the Beauty Blender but I couldn&#x27;t see spending $20+ on a makeup sponge, especially knowing I&#x27;d need more then one. After searching different sellers I came across this 4 piece set. The reviews were great but you still never know until you try the product yourself. After doing so I was SO pleased (to put it mildly). They are very smooth/soft and literally bounce off your face. Not harsh AT ALL. Make sure you do read the directions though. Wetting the sponge is required. This is a MUST buy.</li>
    <li> I like the different shapes and colors. It applies liquid foundation well , but the sponge is a bit heavy to hold.</li>
    <li> These are the best make-up sponges I have ever used!  After years of using sponges that did not hold up for long, I wanted a larger, stronger sponge instead of the flimsy ones available in most stores.  So far, I have only used the teardrop pink sponge, but it is worth the cost of all four!  Plus, I was very impressed to receive an e-mail with easy cleaning instructions and tips for using each sponge.Whatever these are made of, this material seems indestructible. My make-up has never gone on easier or smoother. I would highly recommend these amazing make-up sponges!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and as a present for my giftee person that I was matched with through Reddit Gifts. I had been wanting to try these out for a while and when my giftee person said she had been wanting to try them out also, I figured now was the time to get them! I have been loving them! The product was shipped very fast (Amazon Prime is always amazing!) and got here when I needed it by. As a person who has never used these I was really nervous, but the back of the package lists what each sponge is best used for, which made it great to get started with.</li>
    <li> I purchased these sponges based on the positive feedback given in the other reviews. I am so pleased to report that I love the sponges just as much as the other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I am new to using sponges for my make up application and found the Beauty Blender&#x27;s price tag rather intimidating. Plus, I&#x27;d heard that the Blender was hard to keep clean. I am thrilled to say that these sponges are easy and fun to use, and simple to clean. Beauty Junkees does an excellent job of providing information about what each sponge is best used for, and how to clean them properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend these sponges, in fact my mother already purchased the same set because I love mine so much. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more Beauty Junkees products in the future.</li>
    <li> The greatest replacement to the beauty blender! Makeup looks flawless every time! If you are on the edge about paying $15 for ONE beauty blender sponge, you have to try these you get more for your money and they are just as good if not better!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved these little guys. Feels like I&#x27;ve been putting on less make up and it looks better! I am glad that I had the opportunity to get them at such a good deal but I would have definitely spent more on them.</li>
    <li> I have been using a beauty blender for about a year but its too expensive. 20 dollars for a sponge is ridiculous and its not stain proof so you would need to buy one every so often. I decided to try one from Walmart the SoHo brand. Let me say this soaked up my liquid foundation like crazy and on top of that it ripped after the first wash because of my nails. I got it for 6 bucks and it lasted less than a week that wasn&#x27;t good. I bought a 4 piece makeup sponge set from another seller here on amazon and they were good but of course they stained after the first use. I decided to get these sponged from Beauty Junkees because of the blue &amp;#34;sculptor&amp;#34; sponge it seemed perfect for creating that flawless face since it was flat and I was right. It evens the liquid foundation so perfect and it even leaves a more dewy look because the sponge is wet and sometimes I add a little too much powder and it evens it out and doesn&#x27;t leave it cakey. I use the green sponge &amp;#34;spade&amp;#34; for concealer under the eyes since its a little smaller and it give a better finish than using a brush. The other two &amp;#34;pear&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;teardrop&amp;#34; I use with bb cream and it is a even application. The difference between that sponge from Walmart and these are the material these don&#x27;t soak up the liquid makeup too much and the clean so nicely. I use mild soap dove with warm water and make sure I rinse completely then get a clean towel wrap the towel around the sponge and squeeze gently out all the water. I let it air dry on my nightstand and the next more re-wet and squeeze out the water in the towel again and i use it. I recommend this sponge for beginners in liquid makeup and also you can build coverage if you add another coat without making it too heavy. If you use a liquid as a contour or blush this will blend it so beautiful and you will never have harsh lines. Just an fyi I use these liquid foundation with these sponges and have never had any problems. Mac prolong wear, Mac fix fluid, Revlon color stay, Garnier BB cream oil free, Maybelline fit me&lt;br /&gt;These are the concealers Maybelline fit me concealer, hard candy heavy duty concealer, Mac prep and prime highlighter, and mac prolong wear concealer.Revlon color stay, Garnier BB cream oil free, Maybelline fit me&lt;br /&gt;These are the concealers Maybelline fit me concealer, hard candy heavy duty concealer, Mac prep and prime highlighter, and mac prolong wear concealer.</li>
    <li> The pink sponge is a little dense compared to the others but overall they apply variety of makeup mediums well. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> a nice variety of sizes for a great price.  makes makeup go on smoothly.  have recommended them to my friends.</li>
    <li> these sponges arrived very quickly and packaged nicely.  Not only was the presentation nice, but the product is also great.  the only tip i have is to be careful when cleaning, dont press and squeeze to roughly especially when wet because it gets softer and you do not want to ruin the sponge. But overall great blenders</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these sponges after seeing them featured on one of my favorite beauty blogs. I had no problem placing my order and shipping/delivery was very quick! So far I like the sponges, they are firmer than I expected but I am hoping that over time they will get a little more bounce as I break them in. They seem to be made of pretty good quality and I hope they&#x27;ll last for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints and would probably recommend these to a friend considering the price + shipping + quality are more than satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I bought the sponges based on the reviews and they work well blending my face makeup. My daughter has the beauty blender but paid a lot for it! These four sponges are a great price! They work just as good as the beauty blender but cost less plus you get four beautiful colors! Thanks for the great deal!</li>
    <li> These are amazing and I like them better than the popular name brand...they are holding up very nicely and the variety pack is definitely the way to go!!!</li>
    <li> Not the best quality and very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m just as happy with this set of sponges as I am with my black Beauty Blender, if not happier because of the excellent price. In addition to these Beauty Junkees sponges being a GREAT value, the customer service is phenomenal and (as I think other reviewers have mentioned) the follow-up emails were so courteous, helpful and made me feel that Beauty Junkees appreciates my business and cares about me as a customer. Bottom Line: Even if you only like ONE of the sponges, you&#x27;ve  still saved money over what you&#x27;d spend on one Beauty Blender. BUT I think you&#x27;ll love ALL of them as much as I do. The different shapes come in super handy when applying makeup to various areas of the face. I love the finer points for getting around the eyes and nose. There isn&#x27;t a lot you can&#x27;t do with these sponges. Note – I disagree with the reviewers saying these sponges are hard. I had previously bought a cheapo knockoff at CVS and THAT sponge was hard and completely crap. I think these sponges are as soft as you&#x27;d want a blending sponge to be. The packaging is super cute as well! Great job Beauty Junkees, I&#x27;ll never waste money on another Beauty Blender!</li>
    <li> Loved the sponges!!! First of all, this is a lot.of bang for your buck. Just one regular beauty blender sponge ranges between $20 and $25. So getting this value pack is sooo affordable and convenient. It only took 2 days to receive them and they work like a charm!! &amp;#60;3 super flawless finish and stroke free. Definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!! Love all of them, leave the skim looking flawless!! Great variety and easy to clean!! Recommend it to anyone on the search for a good sponge.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I rarely write reviews, but was so happy with this purchase. My make-up routine is changed forever. I&#x27;ve owned the original beauty blender, but for this price and this variety of shapes it&#x27;s a no-brainer. Look up you tube beauty videos if you&#x27;re not familiar with using this. Not too much direction: get the product wet, wring out/remove moisture with towel, place foundation on back of hand, apply using a stippling motion.</li>
    <li> its so hard for me to rate things in amazon but I have to say these sponges are worth reviewing, apart from being affordable they do an amazing job on blending concealers and foundation but I use them for different purposes because they end up doing a better job than my makeup brushes. I would recommend this sponges to all of my makeup addicts out there who have a budget and want to get some nice quality for less amount of money, I have mac, Sephora and beauty blenders and this sponges looked like I got them from one of this stores the only difference was that I paid less hehe :P I will definitely will be buying more in the future!!!</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast for me as I am a prime member. I appreciate the application and care tips that were provided with the package. I mainly use the pink and purple sponges for foundation. I&#x27;ve used them for liquid and spray foundation, and they work great!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges!!! Best thing you would ever purchase at an affordable price. The best dupe for the beauty blender l but I think I actually like these better. Now I don&#x27;t even use my makeup brushes anymore. They really are amazing. Even my little sister started using it and it changed her makeup routine now I got to buy another pale for her haha.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great and the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!  I like the fact that you can fit them in any curve on your face. My favorite is the blue with the flat top. It&#x27;s great for under my eyes to blend the concealer.  I have used the one that is shaped like a bell and washed it a few times and it is still like new.  Love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! They are FUN!! Easy to clean!! They are larger than I expected so that was a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> I love my new sponges. They do an amazing job especially the spade green one, it does wonders with concealer. I think I will be ordering more in the future to add to my makeup kit.</li>
    <li> Whatever you read on this page please take away one main point: THIS IS NOT A BEAUTY BLENDER DUPE AND EXPECTING ANY OF THESE SPONGES TO REPLACE YOUR BEAUTY BLENDER IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and work well. The Beauty Junkees Team is also very attentive and helpful and I received an email with instructions on what each sponge is for and how to use them. Overall very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought the variety pack 3-4 months ago and I&#x27;m very impressed! I find that the pink and purple sponges are too dense for blending properly, and the blue one isn&#x27;t a practical shape for me. But the green spade sponge is the star of the show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too dense, it doesn&#x27;t soak up all the product, and it&#x27;s so super soft. I&#x27;ve been using the same sponge for 3 months and I&#x27;m just now seeing that I need to replace it. I wash it carefully after each use and set it out overnight to dry. I recommend using a mild cleanser (such as face wash, body wash, or bar soap) that doesn&#x27;t sud very much to wash it. Once you see the tiny pores of the sponge starting to stretch or tear, it&#x27;s time to get a new sponge. This will NOT work well with a thick, wax based concealer, and it tends to soak up watery, serum-like foundations, so check ingredients and consistency before purchasing these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I use the sponge: I saturate the sponge completely in warm water, squeeze out the excess, and blot it with a towel. I first dot liquid foundation all over my face and spread it with my Real Tecniques buffing brush to allow it to oxidize on the skin. I then use the bigger side to &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; and blend it into my skin, around my hairline, and down my neck. I apply cream concealer under my eyes and problem areas and use the smaller side to blend concealer. The point really helps you get close to your eyes. I then dip the smaller side into translucent powder to set the undereye concealer, then dip in the larger side and pat the powder lightly over my T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used the Beauty Blender, so I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a dupe, but it does pretty much the same thing. There are many better ways to spend $20 of my hard earned cash! $15 for four sponges is a much better price. I DEFINITELY recommend the green spade to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges!</li>
    <li> I have never used sponges before to apply make-up so I thought I would try these.  I know it&#x27;s silly but I selected these over the others I&#x27;ve seen because they looked like cute little chess pieces.  Well, I got them home and didn&#x27;t quite know how to use them.  So I looked on Beauty Junkees Youtube channel and there were a few videos explaining how to put on your moisturizer and foundation with the sponges.  So I awkwardly tried applying my make-up and after a few tries I was an expert, well maybe not, but it sure makes applying your makeup a lot more fun.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I will admit, I was way impressed.  I love the original Beautyblender, but I don&#x27;t love the price tag.  I really like the Sephora Perfectionist, the price was better.  But I love Flawless Beaute even more and my wallet will love it and thank me.  And then I will buy more makeup with the money I will save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;You are getting 4 really high quality sponges in different shapes.  BIG BENEFIT - you can play with the different sponges and figure out which is your favorite.  There are subtle differences in each shape, so you will most likely like one or two more than the rest. There is no difference in the application and result between any of these brands.  You are still getting a really beautiful flawless finish regardless of brand name and price.  So if the result is virtually the same, why the heck would you spend more $$$?&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by the flat sponge, and quickly figured out it was a surprise favorite.  I really like it for the stipple effect of blending in my CC cream.  I think this sponge would work really well with a cream blush!  I normally hate cream blushes because I can never get them to blend correctly, but I&#x27;m considering getting one just to use with this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;I love any of the tipped ones for concealer, and I love blending foundation with the two tear drops.&lt;br /&gt;I used them all wet with liquid foundations, cream concealers, and cc creams.  Pretty face achieved!  Boom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> The sponges did not do what I expected.  Not comfortable to hold and not easy to clean.  They did not apply makeup smoothly.</li>
    <li> I have tried three &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; versions of the beauty blender sponge and the Beauty Junkees set  outperformed all three.  The sponges are great quality and the suede like texture gave me much better results than my current blender sponge. The different shapes are helpful; just like having an assortment of makeup brushes for each area of the face. It&#x27;s a good value; you get four blender sponges for the price of the original beauty blender sponge.</li>
    <li> This deserves 0 stars. I don&#x27;t know how this received all of those positive ratings but if you&#x27;re reading this DO NOT BUY! I&#x27;ve used Beauty Blenders (authentic) for months. I was fooled by a the title thinking these were Beauty Blender products. THEY ARE NOT! So upset that I wasted my money on these. They feel and sound  like I&#x27;m bouncing a rubber ball on my face. I have to go back to my $1 sponges until I can get a REAL Beauty Blender.</li>
    <li> These applicators are great!!!  I use 1/4 of the amount of foundation I used with my foundation brush. It blends smoothly.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Spreads make up evenly. Really Like it!</li>
    <li> The company sends you an informational email and insert in the package to explain each sponge. This was very helpful for me because originally I bought this pack to test out the pink teardrop, but I had never used any of these before so I bought the variety pack anyways. I now like the purple sponge the best. The quality is great on these sponges (especially for the price!), but make sure to wash these after every use so they don&#x27;t stain and then they&#x27;ll stay fresh! (I use the purple and green sponges the most often.)</li>
    <li> Very good sponges , they blend perfectly.</li>
    <li> These are just as great as my beauty blender sponge without the high price!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for my beauty blender makeup sponges. I am in love!! My makeup has never looked so flawless. I have been looking for some good quality beauty blender sponges and I have finally found them. I would definitely purchase more in the future. Again, Thank you! </li>
    <li> so wanted to buy beauty blender but do not feel like spending on it . So got a very good option for 1/4 of its price .. Yes 4 pcs for $14 bucks .&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;The quality is amazing , its firm , yet soft ,&lt;br /&gt;I use cream  and stick foundation , this works perfect .. gives flawless finish .&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful colors .&lt;br /&gt;great price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation :&lt;br /&gt;wash it after every use , I use baby shampoo to wash my makeup applicators .&lt;br /&gt;Never put damp sponge in airtight bag  ..to avoid fungus</li>
    <li> Received these the other day and just love them.  The pink one for me was the easiest to blend with.  Flawless coverage.</li>
    <li> These makeup sponges arrived promptly and were in pristine condition. I really love the diverse shapes of these sponges before I only used the pink tear drop one and I&#x27;m fine with only using just one of these sponges because I am not a makeup artist so I just use one of the sponges for everything basically, but if you are looking for a great product and are a makeup artist these are perfect for you. I will be using these sponges for a while.</li>
    <li> Makeup goes on smoothly and the shape allows for application in all the corners. These sponges do a better job than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Don&#x27;t waste your $ on the $14.95 brand du jour. These are the same and a lot better value</li>
    <li> I wanted to know what the big hype was about, so I purchased these sets of 4. Not only did I appreciate the email with tips on how to use the sponges, but I also loved the price... what a bargain!.... It doesn&#x27;t soak up the foundation and the blue one blends pretty neat for a contour look.... overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase :)</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of buying these sponges mostly because I read some reviews that they weren&#x27;t the same as the beauty blenders, but I never used the beauty blender before so I decided to give it a shot.  I am completely satisfied with them. They do the job that make-up brushes can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t leave streaks in my foundation like some brushes do. Not only do the sponges work great but the customer service is great. I received emails when I purchased the product to give me helpful tips on how to use the sponges as well as an email making sure I received them. Even though I&#x27;m not a make-up artist by any means I do recommend these!</li>
    <li> High quality material, very smooth and dense.&lt;br /&gt;Creates flawless look, feels great against skin, blends AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;Wet and wring sponge out with clean towel first.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> These Beauty makeup sponges are perfect. THey are just the right size and good quality. WIll definitely be repurchasing! Definitely reccomend!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the name brand!</li>
    <li> For the wife and she seems to really like them.</li>
    <li> Sponges are great, and the different shapes for applying different products is a bonus!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet but I love them so far! Gives an airbrushed look to your makeup and reduces your pores.</li>
    <li> The sponges are really great!</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing! Unlike other makeup sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past, these are very soft and get very large when they get wet. I wet them, squeeze out the extra water, dip in my foundation, and &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; them on my face. This gives me a perfect, airbrushed finish. The different shapes allow you to get foundation in difficult places like around the nostrils or under the eyes. They&#x27;re so easy to clean- I just use a gentle face wash and wring them out.</li>
    <li> I have only used the pink one so far and I just love it !</li>
    <li> I have started to use these more often and have found that they do make a difference.  They give your face a more natural well blended look with no difference in color between your face and neck.  I would recommend this product and also commend the seller for very good customer service, meaning that if you are not happy with the product, they will accept the return and reimburse.</li>
    <li> I received these sponges on time and I absolutely love them. The quality is exceptional and I love the vibrant colors. I would recommend these makeup sponges to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great sponges for the price.  I haven&#x27;t played around with all of them yet, but LOVE the pink tear drop sponge.  Application goes on smooth and blends well.  They shipped to me quickly and had nice follow up e-mails checking to see if I was pleased with everything.  I will DEFINITELY purchase these again and check what other items this seller has to offer.</li>
    <li> Awesome makeup sponges! Very happy.</li>
    <li> Just love them. I get so many complements on how flawless my makeup looks now. Great price too. 💙💜💚 BUY</li>
    <li> The beauty blender has a more loose and puffy texture comparing to this one. But this certainly does the job.</li>
    <li> So I went on a whim and decided to give these a try and fell in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHIPPING:&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was FAST for me due to being a PRIME member :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING:&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is soooo chic! I am a sucker for packaging as I view that if you spend time on presentation that means you would spend time on perfecting the product. IMHO. The lil pink organza bag was rather cute and I love that I could use it to keep those that I do not use daily and not risk it getting damaged or dirty etc. The price for all 4 vs the the Original Blender @ $20 for 1 was also another factor as to why I chose this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;I am an aspiring makeup artist. However I haven&#x27;t started building a client base yet or even did makeup school - self teaching. So I may not know the use for all 4 separately, but I tried all 4, so I can give a lil synopsis on each. Honestly I love them all as they all serve their own purpose - no complaints other than I fell in love with one and the others are tucked away in my closet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contour sponge with the flat top (blue) one is one I have never seen before - works amazing when I use it to highlight and contour my forehead. The purple pear one is similar to the green but the ending of one side is a bit more rounded - I use that end to highlight my cheekbones - and the other end to apply a full face. The pink egg shaped was nice, nothing to really mention here. But my absolute fave is the green spade one!! What a wonderful invention! The pointed endings make it super easy to get my foundation into the side of my nose and under my eyes! I use the longer end for full face and the shorter end for highlighting. I spray a few squirts of water to the sponge and it expands a tad and works like a charm. I usually pump a few drops of my foundation in a lil sample sized container and I have no issue getting all of the product out as the tip is super long and pointy! A huge benefit to these sponges, which may be due to the materials used to make it, compared to similar products I have tried is it doesn&#x27;t soak up all the product where I would have to use more foundation which was an issue for me. I currently only need 3 pumps of my foundation for a full face and I am good to go. Other sponges I have had to use 5 pumps - so some savings for me there.  I know that my foundation being water-based it is better to use a brush but sometimes it would look unnatural and cakey with a brush and I prefer a natural look. With this sponge it gives a more natural airbrushed finish which is how I love looking daily. It gives me a second skin look so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING:&lt;br /&gt;I usually clean them every 2-3 days by soaking them in ELF antibacterial cleanser and some vinegar - please note that when fully immersed in water they get a lil big but that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. Also, they do stain - not sure if I need to use another cleaning solution but I would loved if it could look brand new every time I washed it - but that never really happenswith any product - brush or sponge lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend giving these a try. You will not regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION TO BEAUTY JUNKEES:&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice it a lil cleanser came with the product for the same price. Also, maybe I am uninformed but if you could sell them individually or in packs of 2s that would be great? I love having back ups when I am lazy to wash it so having a few of my faves that are clean would be helpful.rials used to make it, compared to similar products I have tried is it doesn&#x27;t soak up all the product where I would have to use more foundation which was an issue for me.

    <li> The Sponges:&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try the beauty blender sponge but I didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg for it. I came across these and decided to give them a try. The sponges are great. They work very well and they are nice and compact enough for travel. I am still getting use to them since I am more of a brush girl but I can honestly say I really enjoy using these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Costumer Service:&lt;br /&gt;One of my sponges was defective so I called beauty junkees to see what they could do about this. The representative was extremely nice. She sent me a replacement sponge and I recieved it in only two days! Needless to say I will be ordering from them again! :)</li>
    <li> Best blenders i have ever purchased. Even better than my authentic blenders (because they were so much cheaper and work the same).</li>
    <li> Great sponges great price</li>
    <li> If you love Beauty Blender, then you will love these sponges.  Not only is it comparable to the Beauty Blender, it is cheaper and you get more sponges.  A definite must try.</li>
    <li> these sponges are the best!  I use them all the time and I know for a fact i&#x27;ll be buying them again!&lt;br /&gt;They last long and are very well made!</li>
    <li> These sponges are a great buy.  They&#x27;re harder than the $20 sponge but the outcome is very close.  I doubt you could tell the difference on the skin whether using these or the $20 sponge.  I don&#x27;t regret buying these at all as I love the size and different shapes.  If you don&#x27;t want to pay $20 for a sponge, then I think these are a good substitution and you can still achieve a flawless face with these sponges.  If there is a con to these sponges, I do think they drink up more foundation than the $20 sponge does.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. They are durable and do not absorb that much than other kinds. And these different shapes for different functions are really handy. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Being that the brand name beauty blenders cost $20 for just ONE sponge, this is definitely a PERFECT compromise.  It works just as well as the real thing and even though it&#x27;s cheaper, the quality doesn&#x27;t suffer.  It definitely gives me great coverage with an airbrushed look.  Prior to the sponge, I used to apply foundation using a brush and it had a tendency to make my makeup look cakey and if I was in a rush and didn&#x27;t blend well, you could see some streaks.  Unlike a brush, this product give you that &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; coverage look and it&#x27;s a pretty even application.  So happy to have found this affordable but comparable alternative!!!!!</li>
    <li> First off I looove the packaging it came in. They are very soft, pretty cute and seem like they&#x27;ll last a while. They truly do their job when it comes to blending your makeup out and getting that finished look.</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged, ready for giving as a gift.  Great customer care with good directions and tips for usage.  It comes a little small but expands when you first wash it. I don&#x27;t have that super expensive brand so can&#x27;t compare, but I did order the cheap one from china and that one is small, firm and doesn&#x27;t expand when wet.</li>
    <li> As an MUA, I was worried this was going to like those cheap sponges I&#x27;ve mistakenly bought before but these sponges are AMAZING.  When you wet them, they expand quickly &amp; are super soft.  I have a lot of fashion shows &amp; shoots I work on and these save me so much time &amp; money.  LOVE these!  Althought I do wish they sold a specific shape vs. all diff ones.  I tend to use one over the other but still does everything I need.</li>
    <li> I received these makeup sponges as a gift and they are great.  They do a wonderful job of blending foundation.  They even work great for mineral powder.  Will absolutely be purchasing some more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> I probably would have been happy with these if I hadn&#x27;t used the BeautyBlender first.  Way more dense and just doesn&#x27;t apply as nicely as the name brand sponge.  Waste of money because I went off and got another BeautyBlender anyway...</li>
    <li> I had only used the cheaper versions of these sponges so I had no idea how they should have been holding up. I had to replace them every week, but I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to try these! They don&#x27;t absorb the makeup and everything washes right off. They&#x27;re keeping their shape and I think they&#x27;re going to last much longer.</li>
    <li> I decided to give these sponges a try as I am new to using beauty sponges. I had bought the beauty blender before and for the price, I did not think it lived up to the hype.. I saw these four sponges on Amazon and thought wow that is an awesome price.. The quality is good and there is a sponge for each dimension of my face. I love that! There was even a very nice letter that came with the sponges saying exactly how to use them and was packaged very nice! I am so excited to have found these and THANK YOU so much! I will definitely buy these again! You have to try them, you will be so happy you did!&lt;br /&gt;Kayleen-Irvine, CA</li>
    <li> I have a beauty blender and I love it a lot, but wow, these are easily comparable to my BB, but for much less money! I can&#x27;t reccomend them enough, and I&#x27;ve been raving about them to all my friends. I wanted to wait a little while before posting this review because I wanted to see how well these would hold up over time. Well, they&#x27;ve been through 6 washes and multiple uses everyday and they&#x27;re all still holding up fantastically. I won&#x27;t be buying the BB anymore, not as long as these are around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Beauty Junkees has fantastic customer service. When I first ordered these they sent out a detailed email that went over the use of each of these sponges which was a fantastic resource, but I lost it somewhere in my inbox. When I contacted them, they resent me a new copy of the email and went above and beyond to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase. They&#x27;re the best!</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup sponges in their design and quality. Each shape serves a different purpose. Beauty Junkees offers them at a great price and also they give tips on use and care. I am a repeat customer. I just bought more for my daughter and my two sons girlfriends. They were surprised at how much cheaper they were from this seller. Always a satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I ordered the purple ones and they are amazing</li>
    <li> I am used to a much larger sponge. I had a big diamond shaped one but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. I&#x27;m not used to all the knobs and points, but I guess I will get more familiar with them as time goes by. I really liked the larger sponge.</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM! Really gives your makeup a whole new look, since I&#x27;ve received my sponges i have yet to use my brushes and i doubt i&#x27;ll be going back to them! I&#x27;ve been wanting these beauty sponges for the longest time and i was a little hesitant about spending $20.00 for one sponge which i didn&#x27;t know if it would work or it would be a one time deal... so i went a long and bought these for $13.00 for 4 sponges and i must say its best investment I&#x27;ve done! i will never go back to my regular MAC or Sigma brushes! i now have a airbrushed look for cheap!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several methods of makeup applications before, sponges, brushes, finger tips and never been satisfied. When the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; pink tear drop shaped sponge (Beauty Bl**nder) came out I wanted to give it a try but the $20+ price tag deterred me. When I can across this set on Amazon, I was thrilled &amp; I was even more so when I received and used them! They make all make-up application (primer,foundation, blush) smoother, less messy &amp; with better coverage. The best part is they DONT WASTE MAKEUP!! Other sponges I&#x27;ve used absorb a lot, these don&#x27;t! Saving me $$ on that pricey Laura Merc**r foundation I love!</li>
    <li> OMG!! As a &amp;#34;makeup junkie&amp;#34; I just love this sponges ! The value for 4 is unbeatable my fav is the blue &amp; pink one !! I loved them soo much I had to give one to my friend ! Their tips work amazing &amp; their attention to customers is outta this world ! I&#x27;ve had them close to a month &amp; they still work very well ! I just rinse them in warm water &amp; dab any excess water out &amp; begin my &amp;#34;beat my face&amp;#34; with them! If you&#x27;re a makeup junkie or a &amp;#34;makeupwhore&amp;#34; &amp; HATE HATE spending $20+ on a single sponge -_- ... get these babies- you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I ordered the blue one mainly just for applying BB cream.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I.purchased these as a gift for my daughter. she was super excited. Great product! Fun to use. Great costumer service.</li>
    <li> Applying makeup without touching your face and you looking flawless??? Definitely an awesome purchase!!! I absolutely love it! You will too!</li>
    <li> Like Fisher Price blocks - Fun, sturdy and practical sponges for building the perfect makeup application!&lt;br /&gt;The reasonable price and sturdiness makes these a great tool you would use and not put on the shelf for fear you would mess it up.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is fantastic, personable, and their friendly email with instructions really helpful and caring.&lt;br /&gt;They prove that even if you are selling sponges (and not a car) your customer will have contact with the product every day and by putting so much care into their business will bring a happy mood to the experience!&lt;br /&gt;I see the sponges and i think... oh those Happy Sponges from the nice folks at Beauty Junkees!&lt;br /&gt;Never thought i would talk to my sponges.... will not go as far as giving them names... but you never know!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend investing in this Sponge Experience and supporting the lovely Beauty Junkees team!</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected, first amazon send me another order because the first order I never received. I was really happy about that. Second, I really like the texture of the sponges, color, and shape. I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to try all four sponges but by looking at the shape, my favorite one is the pink teardrop. When I use the teardrop to put my foundation it gives me a flawless look also the pointy edge is great to use under the eyes or around the nose. Overall the sponges are a great product and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> The sponges are great. They expand when wet and leave a flawless application when I apply my foundation. I love the different options I can choose to do reach certain places, like for instance the spade is great for applying concealer under the eye area. I also like the fact that they are latex free. I definitely will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I have only used the pink teardrop sponge when I&#x27;m contouring &amp; I really like it. It blends my highlight &amp; contour perfectly. I am going to be using the other 3 sponges soon.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these sponges.  If you go into Sephora or Ulta, you&#x27;re going to end up paying SOOO much for just one sponge ($10 bare minimum).  I&#x27;ve seen blender sponges cost as much as $30.  Why pay more when can get 4 professional grade makeup sponges for the lowest price out there?  The choice is simple.  You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
    <li> I love that they emailed instructions/how to use each of the sponges. Work great!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.  These little sponges are perfect for applying liquid makeup.  They put less stress on your skin than using your fingers.  Plus they make applying foundation kinda fun!  I mainly use the pink teardrop one for every day use.  But if you want to get more particular with your coverage, the other sponges are great for that.  I will buy again when they wear out!</li>
    <li> My fiancé saw this set and, knowing that I was a prime member, asked that I get it for her.  She really likes it and has told me that the quality of sponges is fantastic.  She also stated that the cost of individual sponges would be quite expensive and that this was a good deal.  She showed me the product in real time and she used it to conceal my acne scars-lol….worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you are a chick, or really anyone who wears some product- we both recommend these sponge things.</li>
    <li> Just like a beauty blender at a much lesser price. Great customer service. Can&#x27;t beat the value with all that you get and not getting a cheap product either. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Amazing first time experience with buying beauty makeup sponges. I was very hesitate at first, for not knowing how to use the sponges. I was not disappointed with purchasing the sponges from Beauty Junkees. Product was delivered very quickly and was very impressed with the quality and the easy use of the sponges. Would defiantly recommend buying from here!</li>
    <li> I am always looks for cool new products and I recently wanted to try something other than the &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; makeup sponge that I bought. These are AWESOME! I can;t say it enough. I have even convinced my sister (who loves makeup) and my best friend who loves her foundation to try these and they both love them. I love the blue one its great to blend my bronzer into my skin and its so soft (even if that is not the purpose of that sponge).The purple one is great for my under eye concealer/highlighter. I am a minimalist when it comes to make-up and most people think I just wear blush, so these sponges make my face look flawless with the minimal look. I LOVE THESE!  I may buy some of these at x-mas gifts in the future.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase! Makes my makeup look flawless and the customer service was great. 4 quality sponges for 15 dollars? Pretty hard to beat that. I would definitely order these sponges again in the future. Believe me when I say you will not be disappointed. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a multitude of assorted applicators for concealer and foundation and these blender sponges have been the most thorough in seamless application. I have dry,red and sometimes flaky skin and these were able to conceal all of my imperfections. The seller was very quick to send out this product and was very courteous and professional. I will by from this seller and this product line again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 and felt it&#x27;s time to learn how to apply makeup properly. I&#x27;ve used the flat round sponges that come with makeup and I&#x27;ve tried a makeup brush. But these sponges are the best. They&#x27;re easy to clean. I wash mine with anti bacterial hand gel/soap and let air dry. After several weekly washes, sponges are still soft and not falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My makeup looks so much better and even. I wet sponges then squeeze out water until sponges are damp. I dot makeup all over my face. I use the turquoise applicator for stippling on makeup. I use the lime colored applicator for concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup doesn&#x27;t settle in my fine lines. &#x27;Course I use primer first and I don&#x27;t use finishing powder. I&#x27;m not sure if I can mention product I use instead of powder but here goes. I use Mally Poreless Face Defender.</li>
    <li> Really make a difference in how your makeup looks. Foundation goes on smooth with no caking.</li>
    <li> Recommend that merchandise to anyone that wear makeup</li>
    <li> I order the blue sponge mostly for applying foundation. They are great! Makeup goes on very smoothly and evenly.  The sponge is a cinch to clean, I use liquid soap with a drop or two of olive oil, rinse until water runs clean and air dry. I love it, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This set is a really great set for all skill levels. I personally have been using the Beauty Blender for a couple years now and the price to replace them really hurts the bank. I took a chance and ordered this set and am happy to say I probably wont spend $20 on one &#x27;sponge&#x27; from Beauty Blender again. This set also provides different shapes to help expand techniques and application in which any MUA, beginning, expert, or on self-only can benefit from. Thanks again for this variety set! Will be ordering from Beauty Junkees again!</li>
    <li> These are great! I&#x27;m still getting used to using a sponge rather than the typical brush. I have yet to try it wet.</li>
    <li> I just received this package and immediately tested it out. They come in a sheer pink drawstring bag which is great for storing them altogether rather than a box that you would likely throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked them all in water to inflate and dampen them, as you would with the original beauty blender. I automatically noticed the ones that are supposed to be dupes (the pink teardrop and the purple pear) were very firm and not that pliable. I could not squeeze them all the way down as you can with the original. Also, those who seemed to retain more water which I assumed would also absorb more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other two, the blue sculptor and the green sponge, are made out of a completely different material... similar to the texture and softness of the beauty blender but not as strong. I knew that automatically, the blue sculptor would be the best for application... if only if it had a pointed tip at the bottom - it actually might be better than the beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did test out the blue and pink sponges. As I had already guessed, the blue sponge provided a better application but tore! Might you this is only minutes of me receiving them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that there is a variety of sponges, so that&#x27;s good but I think most of the women here are expecting the pink sponge to be more like the original but it isn&#x27;t. The blue sponge is really good but needs to be a bit more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I can get a few more uses out of that specific sponge but the others... I think I could pass. I was really hoping to like this a lot but it just isn&#x27;t as good as it is hyped up to be.... it seems that this product is even rated higher than the beauty blenders which seems a bit odd.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! I received an e-mail with tips on how to use each one and it was very helpful! The make-up goes on even with-out caking or streaking and seems to last a lot longer.  Very pleased with the product and how helpful Beauty Junkees was with the tips and follow-up e-mails. Recommending for all my friends!</li>
    <li> Used them for the first time today. Wow! The best my foundation and concealer has ever gone. I am a make-up artist and these sponges applicators are better than my brushes or wedge sponges. I just bought a set for my sister and a set to keep in my work kit.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace my beauty blender when I came across these on Amazon.  For the price I decided to try them out.  Very happy with the decision. I use the purple one to stipple on foundation and it works really well.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> These make-up sponges are easy to use and applies foundation evenly.  Have no regrets purchasing this product.  Would do it again.</li>
    <li> These beauty blenders are awesome! I was shopping around for some for a while and saw the Sephora ones for way more, and this pack includes 4 different sponges and directions. The distributer also sends an email explaining the uses for each sponge! The order came right on time too, and overall, the sponges are amazing.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. THIS PRODUCT WORKS AMAZING. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT MAKE UP BLENDER WITHOUT THE PRICE JUST FOR ONE YOU NEED TO GET THIS. IT WORKS AMAZING. FLAWLESS MAKEUP. SUPER EASY TO USE. SOO HAPPY I BOUGHT IT</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these sponges. I usually use brushes for my CC cream, but they leave streaks. The pink sponge is my favorite and left my face looking flawless. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Recommend to everyone! And it came with cleaning instructions! Definitely getting more pink ones. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the makeup sponges .  I used the blue and the pink and they work great.  The delivery service was great as well.  I love love them.  I would recommend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> It was great, I received an email from them with directions on how to use the different sponges.  The tips they gave are extremely helpful.  I have used other sponges before and they seemed to be very dense.  I like the texture and softness of these.  I think the pink teardrop spreads my makeup very smoothly and evenly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with all of the sponges and will definitely recommend them to my friends.</li>
    <li> Best value for Beauty Blender makeup application sponges on amazon! I mostly use the lime green sponge but all can be used again and again to flawlessly apply liquid foundation, creme eyeshadow, creme concealer, cream blush, creme highlight or stick foundation...I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed. Just wet them and dry to damp with a paper towel and apply creme and liquid makeup like a pro! With beautiful results!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. The sponges work great and are a fantastic deal.</li>
    <li> This was my first set of sponges like this. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a week. They make my make-up look flawless and it stays on much better than applying by hand. I thought using a wet sponge was kind of weird when I read the package just to find out that is the key! I will definitely be purchasing this set again and again! Love them.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the follow up communications that explain how to use each of the individual sponges. I bought these for my daughter who likes to experiment with make up as a Christmas gift. I can&#x27;t wait for her to use them.</li>
    <li> For the price, these sponges are very good. These allow me to blend my makeup quickly and easily. I have dry skin, so if I apply foundation or bb cream with my fingers, is often clings to dry patches. However, with good sponges, like these, that doesn&#x27;t happen. The reason I give these 4 stars instead of 5, is that some are significantly better than others, and I hate that I have to pay for all 4 when I only like 2 of them. My favorite is the green sponge. It gives a beautiful finish, and has a small enough tip to blend it near the nose and eyes. The pink one is also really good, but I wasn&#x27;t quite as big of fan of the finish it gave. The purple one I find to be way too large and dense. Why would I want a makeup sponge that I can only use to apply to large areas of my face? The blue one is okay, but I found the flat surface made me more likely to get a makeup line. I also didn&#x27;t like that the company called me and asked if I had any questions after my package arrived. I found it kind of annoying. Overall, I wish all the sponges were more like the green sponge, but overall these are a great value for the money. For comparison, I found the pink and green sponges to give a slightly better finish than the Real Techniques blending sponge.</li>
    <li> My daughter and niece used the sponges while getting ready for the prom.  We had a lot of fun with all the various angles and surfaces.  What clever designs and quality material.  The girl looked radiant and felt pampered.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, and she has not used yet. They were packaged nicely. She cannot wait to use it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of them, but I use the pink pointy one for applying and blending out my concealer, as well as highlighting and to assist with contouring. Overall, you cant go wrong with it!</li>
    <li> I used to swear by my Prescriptive foundation.  Now, I use one of these funny looking things with an inexpensive foundation.  At the beginning, I use the applicator with my Prescriptive foundation, but found it taking too much product so  I decided to give cheaper drugstore brands a try.  I have tried L&#x27;Oreal, Covergirl, Mayblline, Rimmel, you name it -- all of them together cost less than one bottle of Prescriptive.  I cannot say the result is for sure better, but I can confidently say it is good enough.  I have received more compliments on my skin since the switch although I am not entirely sure that is a good indicator because Prescriptive is very natural, barely noticeable, but very expensive.</li>
    <li> the blue one I use for applying make-up. better quality than the original sponge.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges!  Favorites so far are the green and purple for blending foundation as well as cream/gel bronzers and blushes.</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing! They really make my makeup application so much easier and they create a beautiful look. I like that they don&#x27;t absorb too much product. I purchased a set for myself and my sister. Needless to say, I would definitely recommend this set and would purchase them again!</li>
    <li> I am editing a previous 5 star review. I have purchased the pack with 4 different types of sponges several times. This time I purchased the pack of 4 pink tear drop shaped sponges, and was terribly disappointed. Between this purchase and my previous purchase the material used is completely different. Prior to this package, the sponge was a lot more dense and more like the name brand product it is trying to duplicate. Now they feel like a cheap, very porous sponge. Rather than my foundation sitting on top of the surface, it is being sucked into the sponge, and I have had to use more foundation than I did with the previous packs.</li>
    <li> Great blenders.  Love them.</li>
    <li> loving these little things! Had a sephora sponge and these are MUCH better [ my sephora sponge fell apart after a week] the pink and green sponges are especially useful for flawless foundation finish &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The delivery time was prompt.  My daughter loved them! (they were a gift for her)  The price was very reasonable. I really appreceated the email with tips on how to use them and how to care for them.  aait was a great bonus.</li>
    <li> I dont need the beauty blender. I love these. They are very good, and they last long.</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions, they really do give you that airbrushed look. Another thing I really like is how stiff they are, which means they don&#x27;t soak up as much product as regular makeup sponges. If you&#x27;re concerned about conserving your makeup, like I am, I think it helps to apply the foundation and concealer directly to the the skin and then use the sponge to blend.</li>
    <li> I loved my pro sponges! !!!! Thanks for fast delivery</li>
    <li> Really fast delivery. Love the sponges! Each sponge has their own purpose. They are soft, effective and easy to clean. I highly recommend this package.</li>
    <li> Very soft and easy to wash.</li>
    <li> Received exactly what was advertized.  It arrived quickly and was top quality.  I was worried they would be like those cheap knock offs but they were exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is awesome with my MAC Matchmaster foundation , I have such flawless skin when i use these sponges. A great buy worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I always thought just using my fingers to apply foundation was sufficent but these are great and do a superior job.  They blend nicely and don&#x27;t seem to soak up the foundation.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT for blending-- the different shapes help to contour and apply different makeups to our face for the perfect look.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  My favorite is the pink one!  And be sure to get them wet!!  They expand and are really big!</li>
    <li> I been wanting to buy a sponge like these but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth it. After looking at the reviews I decided I would give them a try. I really like them, my foundation looks great, it takes a little getting use to since I&#x27;ve been using a brush this whole time but overall I can say it was worth it. It was a good deal because I&#x27;ve seen these sponges for about $24 each.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a way to apply foundation that would leave my face looking natural and I have to say that these sponges do the trick. I use them damp to apply concealer and foundation. I followed the instructions that came with the sponges and discovered how quick and easy it was to apply a light, even finish with them. The results are fantastic. I find the pink and purple sponges the most useful.</li>
    <li> Basically like the real beauty blender! The different shapes are so awesome! I mostly use the purple one, but I love them all. I will say that they are hard to clean, but they don&#x27;t absorb a lot of makeup so I don&#x27;t have to clean mine daily. 10/10 would reccomend</li>
    <li> I got these sponges based on the reviews I read and they did not disappoint! I&#x27;ve been using the purple sponge to blend bb cream and it works great, complete flawless coverage that lasts all day. My makeup looks more natural than before. It does take time to wash the sponge after every use but it&#x27;s worth it to keep it clean.  And thank you for the email usage tips  Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> The price was great for this product. I have never had the original beauty blender, but I was extremely happy with this product. I wish I would have started using these little beauties years ago</li>
    <li> Love love love! These are just like the beauty blender you purchase at sephora but at a fraction of the cost.  I was skeptical about buying one on amazon because of all the cheap knock offs that do not compare....but these are the best and would definitely recommend and will be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> First time purchasing these blenders. I normally buy the beauty blender, but the price and quantity drew me to purchase these. So far, excellent quality and easy to apply my make up. Will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges.  I am not a make up artist, far from it, and have never spent much time concerning myself with make up.  I just used a brush and some mineral foundation powder, flicked it on and went on my way.  As I have gotten older I seem to need a little more attention to my make up and discovered these sponges, recommended by many.  I have tried them all and they all work just the way they are supposed to.  I am very pleased with this order, and will definitely order these again if and when the ones I just received wear out.  For once, I found the reviews on this product to be very accurate to my own findings.</li>
    <li> Great value! Works as good as the clinique product!</li>
    <li> So far I LOVE these! I haven&#x27;t branched out to try them all but the pink and purple sponges are absolutely divine. I have never used a beauty sponge before and decided this pack was the best way to get a little sampling of everything. These make getting ready in the morning so much fun and it really changes how my makeup looks! Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Bought these sponges for my teen daughter after she showed a desire to  purchase an expensive one in a beauty store. Did not make sense to me as she was just beginning her makeup experience. When I saw this colorful set, that had such fantastic feedback, and was a great price I knew that I had found the perfect set. They arrived quickly and my daughter is so in love with them. The quality of these sponges is equal to the \\&quot;one\\&quot; sponge that she wanted and she got an entire set for the same amount of money. I&#x27;m already deciding who will be receiving their own set in their stocking for Christmas this year. I highly recommend this to everyone who wants a great set of sponges and a great deal!!!</li>
    <li> I had never used a make-up sponge before, these had awesome reviews so I decided to try them.&lt;br /&gt;One weird thing that was even more awesome was that the package had directions/suggestions for use. Which was very helpful because of the fact I was new to them.</li>
    <li> Good quality and applies make up flawlessly</li>
    <li> I love these blending sponges! I don&#x27;t use foundation brushes anymore, and my makeup looks like naturally perfect skin every time! I have a BeautyBlender that cost me something like $20. These sponges are much less expensive and give me the same, if not better results.</li>
    <li> These came so quick! Love the tutorial email what a cool idea and so helpful to making sure this product is being used correctly! The sponges work great you definitely see a difference and holy bang for your buck!!</li>
    <li> I have only used the pink one but so far so good. I have noticed that all the color from my makeup does not come completely off but for me that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> works pretty well and good for beginners to using makeup stuff</li>
    <li> I came across these accidentally while searching for BB sponges. What a great buy! Great quality &amp; awesome customer service.</li>
    <li> Great dupe for the beauty blender, high quality sponges. Saw a recommendation for these on a beauty blog and they did not disappoint. Great customer service too.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges- first time user of a.sponge.to.apply foundation and I love them.  Still playing around with all.of them.and figuring out what I like.best.</li>
    <li> not really a big makeup person but these sponges are easier than not to use, good quality for the price also.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these Beauty Blenders! In fact, I love them more than the brand labeled &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; from Sephora because the product quality and texture work better to ensure that my makeup is smooth and even across my skin. I highly recommend this product and this company. They sell fantastic product and have exceptional customer service, the two (2) main things every great company needs!</li>
    <li> Just as described excellent for concealer blending, blush and oil control. I like the different shapes to reach different areas of the face &amp; under eye</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product....as someone who has just recently gotten into liquid foundations, concelaer and contouring and highlighting. I&#x27;ve been on the search for the perfect brushes and sponges for application and blending. I&#x27;ve only used the pink and teal ones thus far for applying and blending my concealer and they work great. Make sure you run them under water first so that they expand. They feel great to hold in your hand and the application is great. They blended my concealer so well! So glad I didn&#x27;t get the beauty blender, these do the job! And can&#x27;t beat the price. They also clean up great. Can&#x27;t wait to try my entire contour/highlight routine with these this weekend!</li>
    <li> Great product, does exactly what was described and easy to clean.  Would buy again and again; and info on how to use and clean was offered freely.</li>
    <li> These sponges makes perfect foundation. They do a better job than my Bobbi Brown foundation brush and are more gentle to my face, because I dot the sponge on my face instead of brushing my face. The finish is very natural, very naked. I even use them to apply cream blush, it&#x27;s much faster using the sponge than use a blush brush or hands. The blue one with a flat bottom is my favourite. It has a thin edge so that I can use it to reach the side of my nose and my under eye area easily and precisely. The only downside is that I need to wash those sponges everyday, I only wash my brushes once a week.</li>
    <li> I have not had a chance to use each of the sponges but I appreciate the seller. I got an email when the item was sent with tips on how to best use each sponge. I got another email to confirm receipt of item and tips to clean the sponges. I have used the sponge both dry and wet and I am impressed with how it blends concealer and gets into corners of eyes and nostrils. I am happy thus far.</li>
    <li> I have the Real Techniques expert face brush, and just decided to try out these beauty blender sponges since everyone has been talking about them so much. Even though these sponges are not the official Beauty Blender Brand, they had such good reviews that I had to try them out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last sponges I used for foundation were those awful triangle shaped ones that would soak up too much product and disintegrate after a few uses, the last time I used one of those was probably a decade ago...or probably more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty sponges of today are NOT your mothers&#x27; sponges! These are fun to use, don&#x27;t require you to use any extra foundation (at least not in my case), and apply makeup better than anything I have tried - even the Real Techniques brush! Absolutely no streaking and creates an airbrushed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging has detailed information about each sponge. I use the teardrop one for liquid foundation, the purple one for cream blush, and the green spade for concealer because it&#x27;s pointy to get into the smaller areas near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking that enthuse brushes are so effective, you could buy drugstore products and get an exceptional finish with these sponges, that&#x27;s the type of result you could get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already been talking this up with my MUA friends!</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;m usally pretty skeptical when it comes to stuff like these products, so of course I did a little test myself. I used the sponge on part of my face, and I used my fingers for the other part. I was pleasantly surprised at the results, which prove the sponges to be very good at blending. I even used it with my blush, and felt it worked well. I&#x27;m trying to make my make up collection more sophisticated, and these sponges are a great addition. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the clean up of the sponges. It isn&#x27;t hard, but a tiny bit time consuming and I&#x27;m not always sure I have removed all the make up. However that would not prevent me from buying these sponged again nor would it prevent me from recommending them to someone. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great set! Blend make up perfect, bought two more sets as gifts. Will recommend for everyone to buy!</li>
    <li> Good dupe of the beauty blender.at a low price  This is better because you get 4 sponges all in different shapes.  I love the green sponge the most as it has 2 pointy tips that allow more precise application.  The other color sponges give the same airbrush finish, but I just prefer the least dense one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip I&#x27;d like to share: To save on the amount of product you use, make sure you wet the sponge first before applying your makeup.  It also helps when I use the same spot of the sponge to apply primer first, and then the foundation.  It won&#x27;t drink up as much foundation and easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Communication with the seller was great.  I also like the tips they sent about how to care and use the makeup sponges.  Thank you, Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> Order number # 107-5006786-1956245&lt;br /&gt;You guys did an AMAZING job in making sure I was more then satisfied with my purchase. I will continue on purchasing from you guys if for any reason I must and most defiantly will I recommend you guys to some friends. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I really love the beauty blender sponges.  Makeup goes on smooth.  I think i&#x27;m using less makeup than before.  It&#x27;s fast and easy.</li>
    <li> These are the first sponges I tried and let me tell you.... They&#x27;re amazing! Blend beautifully ! Also, they are extremely affordable... I will be purchasing some more in the future.</li>
    <li> These sponges are wonderful and so is the company!  The packaging was so pretty and stylish, and the service impeccable!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from Beauty Junkees again and again whenever I need makeup sponges.  Thank you Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> The tear drop shape is my favorite. I have heard of these beauty blenders before and wanted to try it. The product is great it gives me the best finish application then some of the brushes. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Girls in my family are always trying new products.  The beauty sponges costing $75 are not any better then these... these are just as good and best we have tried ...hope you enjoy as well</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found these before buying the &amp;#34;more expensive equivalent.&amp;#34; They&#x27;re really affordable and perform great! I use liquid foundation and definitely get the most use out of the classic shaped pink sponge. It lets you apply foundation to a large area quickly and very easily get around the corners of your eyes and nose. It&#x27;s perfect and I will definitely repurchase! I use the blue and green sponges a bit too for contouring and details but don&#x27;t care for the purple one. It&#x27;s kind of an awkward in between shape that I guess was designed to be easier to hold (they&#x27;re all easy to hold!) but really it just does the same jobs the other three do, just doesn&#x27;t quite do any of them as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pink teardrop sponge for a few weeks now and it has been great! It&#x27;s holding up very well and I&#x27;m not having any issues keeping it clean, which are two things I was most concerned about when I ordered this product. I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other sponges and see how they stack up!</li>
    <li> The sponges are high quality and the different shapes allow you to use them for different products, liquid makeup, powder, bronzed, etc. the different shapes allow you to use for different areas of your face, under the eyes, around the nose specifically. The sponges work best when used wet. They have maintained their shape and clean easily. They come in a handy bag that keeps them from getting dirty in the makeup bag!!</li>
    <li> One of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made.  I have only ever reviewed three products on Amazon, but have been buying from here for years, so that should tell you something.  While I do not use all of the sponges, the ones that I do use are nothing short of amazing.  They have totally changed the way my makeup looks.  I would advise against applying liquid soap directly to the sponge (and yes, I realize that the directions say not to do this, but when I tried cleaning it with oil, soap and water mixed together as advised, I felt like the sponge wasn&#x27;t getting clean enough), as it causes the sponge to become almost clay like in that when squeezed and/or pressed, it remains indented in that area, if that makes sense.  I think it&#x27;s because the liquid soap is harder to squeeze out completely when applied directly to the sponge.  I simply use a bar of soap and rub it on to the sponge, rinse, and repeat.  Much easier and you&#x27;re assured that there isn&#x27;t any soap trapped deep within the sponge.</li>
    <li> I love the sponges! They are easy to clean and use. The seller sends you detailed instructions on how to use each sponge before the product arrives. They are way more affordable than traditional disposable make-up sponges because they are reusable and you get four sponges for the price of one Beauty Blender. I clean my sponges with Dawn dish washing liquid after use and then let them air dry. I highly recommend these for beginners and professionals.</li>
    <li> Excellent sponges!  These replaced my original blender and works just as well or even better.  It seems better in sense when washing off the makeup after use.  Don&#x27;t hesitate - it is a great deal!</li>
    <li> the sponges are amazing, makeup comes up flawless and smooth, it makes the process of applying foundation much easier and the finish is that of a professional makeup artist</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d always used the foundation powder, blush and liquid foundation-supplied sponges and was never impressed. These sponges do a simply fantastic job of blending powder and liquid foundation, highlighting with powder blush and sculpting with darker toned compacts. And they don&#x27;t absorb too much of my products while doing so. They do give an airbrushed look as so many others have said. They wash up easily. The green sponge is my favorite.  I use it with under eye concealer and it takes years off my face. It makes concealer products work as they should. Different shapes for different jobs, different colors to help me remember which sponge does what job. Beauty Junkees sent me a very useful email about how to use and clean this product. This company really cares about the consumer experience. That&#x27;s priceless. My Beauty Blender Dupe Makeup Sponge Set purchase is by far my best purchase of the year.</li>
    <li> They are amazing sponges! Plus the company sends you information on how to use the sponges and which color sponge work best for certain areas! Best bargain in town!</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I notice barely any difference between these and my name-brand beauty blenders. They work great! I&#x27;ve been using the purple one for my foundation application, and I really love it. I&#x27;ve also been using the flat-topped blue one for primer, but I have to say that I don&#x27;t like it quite as much as the purple/pink ones. I&#x27;ve noticed that it soaks up a lot of the primer, and I might have to switch back to using a brush again. But other than that, no complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to people who are looking for great-quality affordable sponges with the same benefits and durability of a name-brand product.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. Makeup looks flawless.  I will never use regular brushes again. Not to mention extremely fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great price and great variety.  These sponges individually can run as much as $5 in your local stores; assuming they carry them.  I am not a MUA but wanted what the professionals are using.  My favourite is the green sponge because it&#x27;s great for highlighting.  The only negative thing I have to say is when I washed the green sponge it came apart easily.  I thought I followed the washing directions carefully.  I would definitely recommend this company and buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE these sponges! There are so many options to apply my makeup and they always leave a flawless professional look.</li>
    <li> These sponges are wonderful, they give your makeup a dewey fresh look.  They are everything the review says they are.</li>
    <li> These sponges are AMAZING!  Love the pink teardrop!</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE my blending sponges! They came in less than a week since I have amazon prime, and they have been everything promised! I&#x27;m a Mary Kay Beauty Consultant, and I have my clients use these sponges when I do appointments, even though they aren&#x27;t a Mary Kay product. I have even sent the link to a few people who couldn&#x27;t live without them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges make blending liquid foundation so easy, even for beginners who are unsure about full coverage foundation. They also make highlighting and contouring like a pro easy even for makeup amateurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sponges wash out so easily. Just follow the instructions they give. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with staining.</li>
    <li> These 4 sponges are fantastic! the different shapes work well with liquid or cream foundations. You can also use the purple one to set foundation with a setting powder. They&#x27;re very high quality and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> The items were as described.  Excellent quality. Concerned follow-up customer service.  Beauty Junkees has my business in the future as well…..</li>
    <li> No complaints here.  I haven&#x27;t used beauty blender, so this was the first ones related to it.  Works great with my foundation &amp; concealer.</li>
    <li> I have used the pink beauty sponges for years now and love them.  I am older and with this sponge my make-up goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t show the fine lines and the make-up doesn&#x27;t cake.  I chose these packages as I like the different contours to actually match up with my face.  I highly recommend these sponges.</li>
    <li> These are great makeup tools and a great value considering one a sephora costs $20+. And a must have if your a makeup artist. I love these and use them all the time. U use these while they are damp (squeeze out excess water)...the pink is your basic sponge u will use that one the most.... Purple is for the wider areas of your face ( cheeks forhead) and neck...blue is your blending sponge....green is the precison sponge so you use that one for harder to reach places (inner corner of eye) or target areas...A++++ product enjoy</li>
    <li> Better than beauty blender! Worth the price too. You get alot compared to one beauty blender! Good thing i saw this!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these. Stippling is the way to go.... my face is no longer shiny when I used these sponges.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the other three sponges, but I have used the pink one, the dupe for the beauty blender; it is amazing. I&#x27;ve never had my foundation go on so smoothly before! I was hesitant at first because I&#x27;ve always used brushes. Previously I used a stippling brush and that worked fine for me. With the pink sponge, I find myself using less foundation and it just covers my skin a bit more flawlessly. And flipping it to the smaller pointy end, I use that side for my concealer which reaches every little inch perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, please, PLEASE, clean these after every use. I really advise that. Because for one, you&#x27;re hands are around the sponge, two, it&#x27;s having foundation all over it, and three, it&#x27;s gonna build up really fast if you use it everyday! When you clean it every time, there&#x27;s less of a chance for darker stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that baby shampoo works best to clean it, and if you really need a lift then olive oil then anti bacterial soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit hesitant because I feel the sponge is sucking up some of the product, but maybe I&#x27;m just being weird..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation I use: Make Up Forever Mat Velvet + &amp; Lancome Teint Idole Ultra 24 HRS&lt;br /&gt;Concealer: NARS Radiant Creamy</li>
    <li> Very good sponge... No breakage yet and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday... Worth the price for several sponges. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Like all the reviews, I like the blue hourglass and lime green pointed one much better than the rest two, which I had high hoped for. The pink and purple ones are way too dense and hard to squeeze, hard to dry. It&#x27;s why I gave four stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;But the blue one performs excellent! Love it!</li>
    <li> These sponges not only are an AMAZING value but they work really well!!! I love having the different shapes instead of just the pink teardrop shape that seems to be the standard for these sponges. My favorite sponge is the blue one because I always use it to blend out my foundation/concealer and it works so well for using powders! I tend to use mine dry but think it&#x27;s super cool that they can be used wet too! I do recommend buying the SOLID beauty blender cleanser if possible to use for cleaning them. The company has amazing customer service as well since they offer lots of tips/tricks for how to use the sponges. Thanks Beauty Junkees for making such an awesome and affordable product! I would definitely recommend these to friends and plan to buy another set once mine get really worn out (not sure how long that will take...). Buy these - you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> I held off on writing a review for these until I had really given them a fair shot. I&#x27;ve been using them for just over a month now and I can honestly say that these sponges are wonderful. They really help you put your make up on very smoothly and evenly- not at all cakey. DO pay attention to the instructions on the package- be sure to run under water and then squeeze a few times and let it expand fully, then dry it off a little bit- so it is still damp but not sopping wet, then put some make up on it and apply to your face in a dabbing, kind of bouncing motion. Do not drag these on your face- be sure to dab or bounce them- if you drag them I&#x27;m sure that they would tear and rip in time. I&#x27;ve used other sponges that claim to be like the beauty blender but they are hard as rocks and do not expand like these do. These are soft and squishy and really allow you to get into every crevice on your face. I think my absolute favorite is the blue one with the green coming in a close second, then the pink. I&#x27;m not huge fan of the purple one but not for any other reason than with the way that I do my make up, I don&#x27;t really have much use for it. I will absolutely be buying these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the fact that they are great quality sponges, the company is really fantastic and has great customer service. They send an email pretty much answering any question you could possibly have about how to use the sponges and then follow up with you after that too (not in an invasive way but in a really great customer service kind of way). Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Not really fun of sponges as they consume more time applying it.&lt;br /&gt;But, given the result when I used the product, It change my mind about sponges at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this seller and the sponges to all beauty junkies around there.</li>
    <li> These sponges work great! They&#x27;re WAY more durable than the beauty blender brand and work just as well if not even better! This set is such a steal! It&#x27;d be stupid not to buy these sponges! A must need for anyone who wears or does makeup.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. I have 2 and gave the other 2 to each of my girls and they love them. Make sure to wash after each use.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I have ordered a few other brushes (angled kabuki and flat kabuki brush) and have been very pleased with the quality and performance of their products.  I decided to finally order these sponges after eyeing them for a while .... it&#x27;s so expensive to buy the &#x27;beauty blender&#x27; and have it throw it away after a few months.  I like that there are different sponges for different things .... my most favorite thing about this company is after you make a purchase they send you a thank you email, along with tips and tricks on how to use their products! They seem to really take an interest in their customers and make sure you enjoy their products and know how to use them.  I give it 5 stars! I only wish they would make more products since I really like all the ones I&#x27;ve already purchased.  I would recommend their products to friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Christina</li>
    <li> I like these sponges so far! Their size increases after you get them wet. They have a very nice scent and do not smell any chemicals as the cheap ones. Do not buy $1-5 sponges with a lot of reviews. I ordered them before and they turned to be horrible. I could smell them on my face. Do not do that mistake. These sponges come in a nice package and blend your foundation well.</li>
    <li> Someone suggested I buy the beauty blender or a similar item to apply my foundation recently, as I tend to do heavy makeup quite often. I wasn&#x27;t keen on paying $20 for the actual beauty blender though, so I decided to go with this product based on the reviews I read on Amazon. I&#x27;ve used the pink teardrop twice since purchasing, and it work amazingly! I am really pleased with the results- it really does look like the makeup has been airbrushed on and was particularly helpful with contouring. The sponge expanded to twice its size when under water, but did not retain too much water after I wrung it out (I was scared that the water would transfer to my face but this was not the case). The second time I used it I forgot to run it under water first so it did absorb some foundation, but when I corrected the situation it worked fine. The pink sponge that I used was super dense and soft on my skin, and although I have not used the others yet I&#x27;m sure they will be the same.</li>
    <li> Beauty Junkees was so helpful and quick with their order!  They send you instructions on how to use the sponges and how to clean them, and even offered to send me a free sponge to thank me for my business.  They are a small, family owned company and doing are some great work!  The sponges are great quality - and a great value.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my order.</li>
    <li> Just love it, use it every day.</li>
    <li> The sponges were a good value. The blue and green are my favorite. The only thing I would change is making them a bit softer, especially the pink and purple. I&#x27;ve never tried a Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t compare to that but I have used sponges from Soho and Avon. These are comparable and work well.</li>
    <li> Amazing make up sponges ! Very compare able to the beauty blender!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price works just as well as the original.</li>
    <li> These beauty sponges are gorgeous and they work wonders. They&#x27;re good if not better than the beauty blender. Great price and you get not 1 but 4 you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Best beauty sponges I&#x27;ve ever used!! I really recommend these sponges!</li>
    <li> Each sponge has its own purpose.  The spongs are made to cover all parts of the face(around eye socket, nose, etc).  Sponges blends beautifully, but the sponge should be mist before each use.  It cleans easily and keeps its shape.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have the beauty blender too... the beauty blender is softer and more spongy and these are firmer and more plasticy but they both apply foundation about the same... and so do my hands...  Not sure I buy into the whole blender tool concept because I always end up using my hands instead!  I think I like using it for a day or 2 but I get lazy and don&#x27;t feel like cleaning it and then don&#x27;t want to use it on my face.... an when I don&#x27;t use anything I can never see a difference when I look in the mirror at work...  I mean, no one would think, &amp;#34;oh my goodness!  looks like she was too lazy to use the beauty blender today!!&amp;#34;  I just don&#x27;t see a difference...</li>
    <li> These sponges do a good job. I prefer to use them dry, instead of wet. Either way, they work as expected.</li>
    <li> it is definitely much cheaper than the beauty blenders you find at sephora and nordstrom. if you read carefully what the directions are, this product will help you a lot with your make up. i would say most important thing to know about this would be use wet sponge for sheer and dry for full coverage. i would give 4/5 stars only because this isnt the original beauty blender technology.</li>
    <li> Great shapes for every angle &amp; feels soft to the touch</li>
    <li> Theyre good a little stiff even when its wet!! But it does the work! My pink sponge has a lil tear in it already but all in all its great for the price would buy them again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen these makeup applicators priced for a lot more. These are just as good. I love the varying shapes. I use the red one for foundation and the blue one for contouring.</li>
    <li> These sponges are effortless to use.  They&#x27;re practical, their designs make sense for the hills, dales, and valleys of the human face, and they hold up well.  I hesitate to take the company&#x27;s tip about using olive oil to clean them, though.  I rub a droplet of facial soap into them, squeeze them with warm water to work up a bit of lather, rinse them out with warm water, and then hold them under hot running water for 20 seconds, to kill off bacteria (this, according to my son the future doctah, works on just about anything to quasi-sterilize it).  I just wish they made one expressly for use with face powder.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with these makeup sponges.  I was originally just looking for a wedge sponge and as I was looking, I happened across these ones and thought I would give them a try and I am so happy I did!  The quality of these sponges are amazingly great and my makeup goes on very smoothly.  They also shipped fast, I received them faster than what was projected!  I&#x27;m very satisfied and will order more.</li>
    <li> I just received these sponges last week and I already use them every day. I use them to put on my foam foundation, as well as my creme stick foundations that I use to contour and highlight. The varying shapes and corners of these sponges make it easy to apply makeup pretty much anywhere on your face. I&#x27;m also a fan of how customer-oriented Beauty Blender is, taking the time to send me follow up emails on tips on how to use/clean the products. I wouldn&#x27;t have expected to receive such friendly customer care from an online order, but it was a pleasant surprise. I&#x27;ll definitely be a customer again!</li>
    <li> Love these!!! Can&#x27;t beat the price and the company is awesome. I really appreciated the email explaining how to use each different sponge for the best application.  Will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the pink teardrop so far but I really enjoy it and use it every day. With makeup brushes my face was streaky looking, but with this sponge I can even out my complexion. It cleans easily enough with the products I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just fyi I use a tinted moisturizer for coverage as much as possible. But I also have a regular concealer I use for trouble spots. This works well for both.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry skin and these sponges work great on my skin! Don&#x27;t forget to soaked them in water before using. Great customer service too :)</li>
    <li> Great Product!!  Works like a dream.</li>
    <li> I started with the purple one maybe cos purple is my favorite color. It blends really well. You get for beauty blenders for the price of one. Used it twice now and it worked really well for me. I still prefer my kabuki brush though. But I&#x27;ll definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These things are just nifty! Makes it so easy and fast to apply foundation (ANY  kind! Even powder !) to a beautiful, even, smooth finish.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! I wasn&#x27;t too keen on spending $20 on one Beauty Blender so when I found these, I knew I had to have them! They are the perfect dupe for the real BB and I recommend these to all my makeup loving friends!</li>
    <li> Love the different shapes....people have told me my face looks so nice....they must work :)</li>
    <li> I love makeup but I&#x27;m also a creature of habit. I thought these sponges were just a fad item that wouldn&#x27;t do much difference in my foundation application. Boy was I wrong!! These sponges have changed my life! My foundation is smoother, more evenly blended, and appears more natural on my face because it fills in fine lines instead of traditional sponges which just cakes on the foundation. I&#x27;m never going back to using anything else. Beauty Junkees even sent me a detailed email on how to use each sponge! Great product and great seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not huge on makeup application and tricks but what I am big on is natural looking coverage, which these are awesome for!  They make my foundation look flawless and anything else I apply w them as well!  They are easy to use, easy to clean, and really good quality. I also checked out the Beauty Junkees YouTube videos for some much needed tips!</li>
    <li> I have been using these applicators for about a month and really see a difference in the look of my foundation (that&#x27;s all I have used them for so far).  They provide smooth and even coverage and they are comfortable to hold and use. My favorite is the purple shape as it is perfectly shaped for each part of my face.  My second favorite is the pink shape for the same reasons.  The green shape I find to be a little too squishy and I actually haven&#x27;t tried the blue shape.  I would order additional purple shapes in the future - love it!</li>
    <li> I love love love these sponges! I honestly have a new love for applying my make up! It has seriously never looked and felt so good. It is easy and I save money from it not soaking into the sponges. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the pink one so far, but it works great.</li>
    <li> Firstly- I bought these beauty sponges after scouring Amazon for the best &amp; these might just be them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these on January 8th, 2014for $14.97 and received them on January 10th.&lt;br /&gt;They came in a ziplock pouch inside a pink mesh drawstring bag. I do like the mesh bag, it keeps them together and from falling everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price is fantastic considering most of the name brand BeautyBlenders are going for ~$20 each.&lt;br /&gt;I have now owned these sponges for 9 days and put them to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good material &amp; quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; like other knock off BeautyBlenders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purple- Good for general use ( I ended up giving this one to my mom since I already owned the blue Sona Kushic sponge from Target, but they&#x27;re basically the same thing). I don&#x27;t really care much for the shape of this one, I feel it&#x27;s a little big/wide and haven&#x27;t really found a good area for its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green- Interesting shape, but I really love it! I like using the larger side for concealer and the smaller for highlighting. It fits well under the eyes which is a BIG pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue- Has a lot of &#x27;spring&#x27; to it, but it works well to layer liquid/cream make up. If i use it, it&#x27;s after I use my make up brush to get a basic coat of make up on and then go back and use this to stipple the extra in my problem areas / areas that need more coverage. When I used it to put my make up on all over / without first using my brush it left some areas un-blended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink- General BeautyBlender shape. Good for concealer, highlighter, or &#x27;buffing&#x27; out your overall make up.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these are a great buy &amp; I would highly recommend. I use the Solid BeautyBlender Cleaner that I bought from Sephora for $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also- I realllly enjoyed their customer service. I received two emails, one explaining the uses of each sponge and a second making sure I received my order on time andasking for a review. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Blended perfectly, and sent instructions via email to how to use each sponge! I will definitely  be ordering more very soon!</li>
    <li> Great value! Each sponge is useful! My new favorites!!!</li>
    <li> This product works great. Beauty junkies even sent an email on how to use it and how to clean it!</li>
    <li> Good product and seller provided very helpful tips on how to use the sponges correctly. Each sponge is about 1.5 to 2 inches tall.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these sponges. Usually when I wear foundation it looks bery cakey and un natural, but when I applied my foundation with these sponges it made my skin look flawless and best of all not cakey. At first when i used them i thought they were a little dense but all you have to do is use it a couple times. I gave my mom some of the spones to so she could apply her maleup better</li>
    <li> This is a great purchase! Arrived super fast (thanks, Prime!) and the seller emailed instructions to me as well as a follow up email. Then as a thank you gesture, mailed me another blender. This company went above and beyond just by these gestures. I find that the products make it so easy to apply makeup evenly. They make makeup fun! Such a good buy and definitely worth the money. Buy it and enjoy! :)</li>
    <li> The quality of the sponges is fantastic. They are not the cheap crumbly kind but are smooth and firm and have great structural integrity. They do not soak up the product so less really is more with regards to your makeup application. I followed the directions on the package and in the email and enjoyed the smoothest make-up application ever. I actually prefer these to brushes. My first use was today and since I was going to work, I didn&#x27;t do any highlighting and contouring just MAC primer, foundation, concealer, powder, and setting spray and the pink sponge worked like a charm to give me the dewy look I need for the winter. No streaks, no smudges, no uneven application. The customer service from Beauty Junkies is phenomenal. Right after I made my purchase, they sent an email, addressed me by name and explained how to use and care for their sponges. Then after I received the product, they emailed me again asking how the sponges were working out.  I look forward to playing around with the other sponges and ordering from this seller again. The service is wonderful and the product is great.</li>
    <li> I give these four stars because I have never used the original Beauty Blender but my daughter does and it is a bit softer.  Since I don&#x27;t know the difference myself I can say I really like these.  The only thing I notice is that they don&#x27;t all seem to be made of the same stuff, if that makes sense.  They are differing levels of softness and absorbabilty.  But they work great and clean up like a charm.  I do use the Beauty Blender solid cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love this set of beauty sponges...makes the makeup glide on effortlessly!  Love the different shapes and colors!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much they increase in size and they are great to use.</li>
    <li> I love the sponges! They work very well and I received them on time as well!</li>
    <li> The makeup sponges are great! I am new to using them but so far I find them to be of good quality and easy to use. They are also a reasonable price unlike some others I have seen. For any makeup beginners out there or anyone who is curious about makeup sponges I would definitely recommend these!!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended these sponges to me and I absolutely love them! They are easy to use, easy to clean and are holding up great. What I love most is the finish - my makeup looks totally natural and I can apply as much or as little as I want. They are perfect too for blending the face and neck area.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great. They work well and they hold a good amount of makeup without soaking it all up.</li>
    <li> All in all these blender sponges are a good backup for any makeup artist or makeup enthusiast. I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re a dead on dupe for Beauty Blender but they&#x27;re very nice sponges.</li>
    <li> I am only giving four stars because I have only used two of the sponges (the pink and green one), I&#x27;d say that I use the pink sponge on a daily basis and it works great! It blends my concealer effortlessly and I don&#x27;t think I will use anything else to blend my make up. I will say that after using the pink sponge it shriveled up a bit? (I usually like to dampen the top of the sponge the most because I use that part the most to blend my concealer. So perhaps it&#x27;s because one part of the sponge is getting used more than the other side?) It is hard to explain, but it doesn&#x27;t affect how it applies make up in any way. I&#x27;d advice you to make sure your sponges have been run under water and squeezed out before using it because it does grow 2x&#x27;s it&#x27;s original size that it initially comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you were wondering, I&#x27;ve never tried the Beauty Blender, so I have no comparison to that product.</li>
    <li> Excelent and very useful product</li>
    <li> Products very best,I very like it!!!</li>
    <li> Got these 3 days ago, they are amazing, nice and soft glide on your skin like butter.. I would definitely recommend these.. :)</li>
    <li> Loved the packaging , not tearing apart . strong and works perfectly</li>
    <li> CRAP! DONT buy this product. They are hard and do not soak up water no matter how long I run em. DONT blend makeup well at all. PICKS UP foundation. NOT GOOD WASTE.</li>
    <li> I just received these about 20 minutes ago and am currently doing my makeup with them. But I&#x27;ll get to that a little later.&lt;br /&gt;I got these in a cute little good quality cardboard box sealed with their logo. Opening the box, is the pink organza draw string bag. Very cute and feminine. However I was a little disappointed to see I did not receive the instructions on which sponge is more suited for each area/technique. Onto the sponges themselves. They are relatively true to the colors in the pictures. The purple is more lavender than the picture but other than that its very true to the picture. The texture is very velvety and soft, so there are no worries of rough sponges rubbing against your face, or big pores or holes in the sponges that are going to soak up your makeup. As far as softness/firmness goes, they are all different. The pink teardrop is by far the firmest and as a little memory foam type feel. The purple pear is the second most firm with a very memory foam type feel to it. The blue contouring sponge is the second most soft with no memory foam type feel. And finally, the green spade is the softest with the most memory foam type feel. I decided to take these into the bathroom and do a damp test to see just how large they got. I ran them under the faucet and there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference. Then I tried pushing them into the faucet so water went straight into the core....all I have to say is HOLY COW. They got at least 2x their dry size. And they stay damp for quite a long time. They seem to put makeup on quite smoothly and evenly, but I will do an update after a few days-a few weeks of use. First impressions of these little sponges are quite good. I have a $10 sephora sponge that I&#x27;ve used for over a year because I didn&#x27;t think there was anything better. All I can say, is that one is now going in the trash. I can already tell these are much better quality and will hold up much longer.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I had been looking for these sponges all over but the stores only sold them individually. I found them as a set on amazon for a great price and ordered 2 sets. So far my daughter and I really like the sponges and the emails with the helpful tips. The only thing I am having trouble with is washing them. They don&#x27;t seem to come clean very easily. Otherwise they are good.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!!! I don&#x27;t have a beauty blender but I have the 1$ amazon dupes (which did the job fine) These are incredibly soft but also firm enough that they feel durable. When I washed them they expanded to an impressive size! Can&#x27;t imagine why I&#x27;d drop 20$ for a beauty blender when these are already so wonderful</li>
    <li> Great set!&lt;br /&gt;All of these sponges are working really well.  They distribute and blend beautifully, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I really love the blue one for putting on my Balm cheek stain.  Fabulous!!</li>
    <li> Love these makeup sponges.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a beauty blender and so far so good!! I have mostly been using the pink teardrop sponge. I love that I can blend my foundation without getting a cakey, uneven look. And I can adjust the coverage by using more or less water in the sponge. And what a great price! I also really appreciate the customer service from Beauty Junkees. They sent a very detailed follow-up email with specific instructions for each sponge. Great product! Great company!</li>
    <li> Love my sponges!  Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> Great value and great sponges for any person wanting to have a specific look when they apply their makeup.  They provide great tips on how to use the sponges too for any newbie!</li>
    <li> Love all the sponges&lt;br /&gt;easy clean up&lt;br /&gt;and they even send you an email on how to use them</li>
    <li> First time trying a beauty blender sponge. It&#x27;s the easiest way of applying foundation. I recently started applying foundation to my skin with my fingures and didn&#x27;t like the cakey feeling. But with Beauty blender sponge, it feels so light and natural.  I will recommend it to everyone !!</li>
    <li> Good substitute for Beauty Blenders</li>
    <li> sturdy but not nearly as soft as the real ones sold in sephora, grows too big when damped, not using them anymore after using them 2 times.</li>
    <li> wonderful texture, does the job very well. Sturdy sponges, it seems they will last quite some time! very happy with purchase and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really cool but I don&#x27;t see what the big deal about these are. They work as good as any other sponge. They&#x27;re hard to clean</li>
    <li> I love these makeup applicators. I have been using high grade triangular sponges for over 25 years, and I can&#x27;t believe the difference these applicators make. My face looks flawless, and they are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges they&#x27;re amazing. I will definitely be ordering from beauty junkees again. They gave me great customer service.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. I&#x27;ve already used it and washed it once. I use dawn soap and a bit of olive oil to wash my make-up brushes and sponges. It&#x27;s a great deal for the price. I will be ordering more in the future. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges!!  Great &amp; flawless application with ease of effort!  Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you beauty junkees!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even use the weird blue one and this four pack is still worth the month. Great little sponges.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I fell in love with these blenders. I hesitated at first because I was stuck between buying this set or the more pricier original. Thank god I cheaped out and just went with these because they work wonders. I wanted to try out the beauty blender because for my current foundation goes on too cakey when I use my brushes but these saved me! They blend really well and pat onto my skin with no problems. And they&#x27;re cute, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my new sponges from Beauty Junkees!  I haven&#x27;t had them too long, and I&#x27;m still learning, but so far I really like them.</li>
    <li> These sponges are wonderful.  I rarely use my brushes now, because my makeup looks so much more natural using the sponges.  The seller was amazing too; they actually emailed me after my purchase to provide instructions on how to use these.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great! I wish that the pink &amp; purple ones were a little less dense but they are great for applying powder and giving you that air brushed finish. The green spade &amp; blue sculptor really do exactly what the creators made them for. I highly reccomend this set if you are searching for a quality, less pricey way to apply your makeup.</li>
    <li> I thought these sponges worked great for me.. I would order them again..&lt;br /&gt;Andrea&lt;br /&gt;Harrisburg Pa</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service, they sent a follow up e-mail with tips on how to better use the product.  The product is as described and works beautifully.  When wet, the sponge almost double in size and is a great product.  The price is great as compared to the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; blender.  I will buy this product again when I need sponges.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of these sponges. They have a nice smooth texture that feels nice on my face. I use them for applying and blending makeup, as well as applying sunscreen and moisturizers. Very  happy with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
    <li> The sponges are a great tool to give you an airbrushed look. I definitely noticed a difference from my previous disposable sponges.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy.  Stand up it daily use</li>
    <li> I loved the product, it isn&#x27;t as soft as my original beauty blender but it get the job done just as good. I also love the different shapes. Product cam fast and was packaged well. Thank you once again. Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SPONGES. VERY SOFT AND THE SHIPPING WAS FAST. GOT IT A DAY BEFORE DELIVERY WAS EXPECTED!! I LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> After having using drug store sponges for too long, I heard these types recommended and decided to give them a try. These are a total game changer for my makeup routine, work with all liquid products I&#x27;ve tried with them, and most importantly: they don&#x27;t eat all of your makeup. Each sponge is said to last 2-3 months with proper cleaning (olive oil?) but I&#x27;ve been just using water to clean and it still seems like each will last at least a month. The texture is awesome and the finish they get you is great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The texture is very different from the original &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; and it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Their efficiency in giving flawless results is good, but you have to get used to them (their shape and absorption capacities).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret at all the purchase as they are pretty good sponges for a great price.</li>
    <li> Very nice sponges. Well made and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist who had seen many people use the original beauty blenders, which in my opinion are a bit too pricey to get only one sponge. I purchased a set of these Beauty Blender Duplicates hoping to get more bang for my buck. These sponges blend flawless without having to use multiple brushes like I usually do. These sponges cut down the blending application process by more than half. My two favorites are the Green spade and Blue sculptor. I use the Pink tear drop and Purple Pear to apply my foundation as they are a bit more dense than the blue and green sponges. I think the best part about buying these sponges was the excellent customer service I received from the company. It&#x27;s some of the best, if not THE best customer service I&#x27;ve ever received. Mine have already gotten so much use. Very happy with my purchase and will continue to buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Dry skin is my enemy, and these sponges help me apply foundation flawlessly. Less rubbing &#x3D; smoother skin. They apply nicely wet or dry, and the instructions the seller provided have helped me improve my make-up game! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. The pink one is a great stand-in for the expensive Beauty Blender. I&#x27;m not very makeup savvy, so I really appreciated the detailed info on how to use each sponge.</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy these for friends and family! Not only are they cost effective, they work just as good as the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; IMO. I use the pink and purple the most for full coverage application - foundation &amp; concealer and the green for concealer only days, I have not tried the blue yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are also very fun, I like to have my most used beauty items exposed and these add a fun pop of color to my vanity.</li>
    <li> These makeup sponges are great! I love these sponges. My make up is applied quickly and flawlessly. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using sponges for 2 weeks ..&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love them.... I&#x27;m 62 years old and have had so many compliments on how smooth my complexion looks... My two favorite are the pink tear drop and lime green.....I will be ordering some for my 30 year old daughter.....I know she will love them too...also it&#x27;s so much fun to put on my makeup...,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for the helpful tips...&lt;br /&gt;Macie from Montana</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used the original brand so I can&#x27;t compare, but these are fantastic. My makeup looks so smooth, it&#x27;s unbelievable!! Much better than a brush. Rinsing it  out well is a bit if a pain, but well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was packaged well, no odd smell, and their customer service is awesome!</li>
    <li> I really liked how it absorbs and blends my make up really well and it came with different shapes.I am really happy I got this product</li>
    <li> I use the pink teardrop sponge for my foundation religiously as well as the green spade one for highlighting and I am so happy I found this set! I don&#x27;t like using my fingers very much and sometimes my brushes can leave streaks so I use these to give that airbrush effect. let me tell you, it will not disappoint! they even sent me an email explaining how to use and care for the sponges. I&#x27;ve been using these for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m one happy camper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and I LOVE these!  They&#x27;re perfect for at home use (I would use for work if you&#x27;re a makeup artist). But for day to day makeup wear they&#x27;re amazing.  I read the reviews before buying and saw a lot of people liked to use them wet, I am now one of them. Run under water while squeezing a few times, squeeze as much water out as you can and pat dry with towel. Fantastic smooth coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super happy about these sponges. They are much denser than I thought they would be in this unbeatable price range. I tried the olive oil cleaning method suggested by the packaging, but that didn&#x27;t work very well. So I tried cleaning it with my hand soap. Guess what? All my makeup residue is gone within seconds. I&#x27;m also in love with the cute shapes and vibrant colors. I like that they don&#x27;t have a weird smell, which is super important if you&#x27;re going to be rubbing them on your face. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase. These 4 sponges will last for a long time since I only use one at a time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got such a great product at this price! I wanted to get the beauty blender but just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend that much on one sponge. These are so soft and expand with a lil warm water. My makeup goes on smoother, faster and I use less product! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> When I mash these sponges on my face I feel like a professional sponge masher</li>
    <li> Love them! I got 4 different sponges and tried all of them in application of liquid foundation. What can I say? They blend the foundation very well, without absorption of the make up into the sponge. It is easy to clean sponges. All of them almost double in the size when you make them wet. After squeezing the excess water they are ready to be used. Blue and Green are more soft, Purple is more dense in touch, and the teardrop Pink one is the most dense one ( I prefer to use it dry for the powder foundation). I highly recommend them, especially if you like natural look without having heavy make-up coverage, as application with different brushes always gives me more think coverage, which is not my favourite. I used these sponges with Revlon Colorstay and Fit me (mat and poreless), coverage is great, natural and at the same time hides anything you need to hide.</li>
    <li> These are a nice addition to my make-up applicator/tool collection. I usually use brushes only, as I find that sponges absorb too much of my makeup and are wasteful. However, these, because you wet them first, do not seem to eat up my makeup. I still apply my makeup with brushes or my fingers, then I use these to smooth out and blend for a more even, natural look.  I have not used a true beauty blender and so I cannot compare them.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Easy to use :)</li>
    <li> I like them so far, they do grow quite a bit when wet and are nice sponges helping with make-up application.  They&#x27;re definitely not those cheap sponges that drag on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ordering this first set of 4, I wish there was a way to choose the specific shapes I want as part of my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I&#x27;ll be ordering more, the product helps a lot in making sure you don&#x27;t pull your skin when you apply make-up.</li>
    <li> I received my order about a week ago and let me tell you I I absolutely adore my new sponges ! All of them are unique shaped and they have their own purpose so u can use each for something different but my favorite sponge is the pink sponge of course ! All of them are great quality sponges ! They&#x27;re extremely soft and durable I&#x27;ve already used them 5 times and so far they are still like new ! These are better than a stippling or any other foundation applying brush that&#x27;s a fact. I used to use a stippling brush to apply my foundation and It wouldn&#x27;t really give me that great of a coverage because of some acne scars that were left behind when my skin was acne active but after I outgrew the active acne skin I was sadly left with some scarring so I did half of my face with the stippling brush and the other half with the oval egg shaped pink sponge and wow !!! What a difference the sponge made the foundation literally look like real skin not cakey at all and the stippling brush on the other hand left my face looking cake and my dry spots showing I also touched my face and the makeup transferred where I used the stippling brush but the side where I used the sponge the makeup barely transferred at all. I am still amazed at how freaking awesome these sponges turned out to be I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be such good quality but they left me in shock I love them and when it&#x27;s rip to for all of my sponges I know what brand to buy from ! Beauty Junkers I love your sponges ! Even compared to the beauty blender these sponges are identical , you get 4 sponges for almost the same price as the beauty blender shoot you can say no to that , especially when the quality is amazing ! You won&#x27;t find anything better for the price and quality than from beauty Junkers ! So don&#x27;t think about it twice go ahead and click that add to cart buy now button!</li>
    <li> Great value!  It&#x27;s nice to try different shaped sponges to see what works best.  They are a little harder/denser than I expected, but they work well.</li>
    <li> These sponges work very well- I&#x27;m very impressed. However, I was disappointed when I received them to find out they are not actually &#x27;beauty blenders&#x27;- also, after only one wash the pink sponge showed that it had 4 small holes in the bottom which means I cannot use it professionally because it can no longer be sanitary. Also, the sponges stain easily and without the $30 beauty blender cleanser I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll ever look clean again. Like I said though, they work very well! They give a perfect airbrush looking finish to even full coverage foundation.</li>
    <li> These makeup sponges work wonders! They are absolutely wonderful especially for the price. When I use my tear drop blender it makes my makeup looks flawless. These are a must have in any makeup bag. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy them, seriously!</li>
    <li> My wife says:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Great quatro team! The foundation leaves the skin as if it is almost only skin with these sponges. It doesn&#x27;t look the same when I apply with brush. There&#x27;s a huge difference. The only thing it does stain a bit on the sponge even I tried to wash it with alcohol :S But don&#x27;t care.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The sponges were a little small when they first arrived and didn&#x27;t feel as soft as I expected them to be. But as soon as I put them in water they did get bigger and when I applied them with my makeup I was really surprised. They go on great and feel amazing on your face. I use them everyday! The spade sponge is my favorite for concealer it goes on smoothly giving you a nice flawless look..I really recommend you try them all,</li>
    <li> This company (Beauty Junkees) was very customer oriented and they sent me an email with detailed tips on how to use each of the sponges.  That was beyond my expectations.  Very satisfied with everything.  Other reviewers have given great tips on how they use the sponges, so I won&#x27;t be repetitive. I just wanted to give a thumbs up for Beauty Junkees and their sponges.</li>
    <li> I have only used two so far but they both worked great. great price too.</li>
    <li> First off, I have to say I don&#x27;t write reviews very often. I normally just use my fingers to blend my foundation. However, using the&lt;br /&gt;beauty blender, the makeup just sort of melts into your skin. Looks beautiful, flawless. I really like these sponges, also easy to&lt;br /&gt;clean and really great customer service. I received an email explaining how to use the sponges. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent colaty perfect delivery time</li>
    <li> Awesome product, and super fast shipping! I bought this because I needed to replace my beauty blender. These sponges are an exact dupe for an amazing price!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves them!!!</li>
    <li> I love them especially getting four of them for a cheap price rather paying $20 just for one :) will definitely buying more when I&#x27;m all done using my four sponges!</li>
    <li> This 4-pack of sponges is an AMAZING product. I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $20 for just one Beauty Blender, so I tried these instead and I&#x27;m so glad I did! They work with any foundation or BB cream, and the variety of shapes means that you can get to every part of your face. They leave a beautiful finish and it&#x27;s so much faster than blending with your fingers or with a brush. Also, since there&#x27;s four of them, you can rotate these and use them for a long time (six months to a year) if you take care of them! Wonderful, wonderful product. I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> These were one of those &amp;#34;YouTube made me buy it&amp;#34; purchases. I saw one of my favorite YouTubers using these and she raved about how good they are and how they are all four cheaper than the one little beauty blender sponge everyone loves. I was skeptical but I purchased with her discount code and got a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I think of them-&lt;br /&gt;The pink one is the closest one to the actual Beauty Blender Sponge. It is not as easy to squeeze as the BB and it doesn&#x27;t squeeze out the water as easily either. I found that this one does hold some of the water deep within the sponge so once you think you&#x27;re finished squeezed, a bit more comes out. It does get a little bigger when it&#x27;s wet but not by much. It takes forever to dry but that&#x27;s probably because of the water it keeps inside. I found that this worked well wet and dry to apply makeup although you get much more of a flawless finish with it when it is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple one is good as well but like the pink, it absorbs excess water. I have found this one is best for bouncing or stippling the foundation on your face so you can get a smoother application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green one is great for cream contour if you&#x27;re into that. The smaller side does a great job at blending out the product and making it look flawless without making you look cake-face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue one is odd but I use the flat side to just add foundation and spread it out smoothly. I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to use the rounded side yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these work best when wet and I find they are best stored on a rack or something with holes so they can dry quicker. I&#x27;ve had no problem with the color bleeding when I get them wet like I have with the original BB.&lt;br /&gt;I can see myself using these over and over and once they&#x27;re done, I see myself buying more.&lt;br /&gt;They are no where close to the texture of the BB (these are much more dense) but they do apply the make up very similarly and give a radiant finish.</li>
    <li> When I initially ordered these, I thought they were the original &amp;#34;BeautyBlender&amp;#34; at an insanely low price.  Before they arrived I did find out they were a different company-Beauty Junkees.  I almost got upset and then saw how many 4 star reviews they had.  I figured-they cannot be that bad?  And I WAS RIGHT AS THEY ARE AMAZING!  Better than the BeautyBlender I paid $20 for @ Sephora 3 weeks before I ordered these.  You can feel and see the difference.  My original feels as if it will rip apart any day now while the ones from Beauty Junkees are stronger spongy-that sounds weird, but feels right-and are completely off the chain when it comes to their performance as make up applicators, any type of cream or powder, makeup mistake fixers, tone down your eye shadow by patting one over your lids....I could go on and on. Fantastic product-I WANT MORE from BEAUTY JUNKEES.  They make a few other products which I must order simply because I know they will exceed expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Way to make a winner!!!</li>
    <li> These sponges are AWESOME! Just bought another set for my little sister because she kept trying to steal mine! Lol They work just as well as the name brand (and heck of a lot more expensive) beauty blenders, in my opinion. And the shop has very good customer service!</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Not nearly as good as the beautyblender.  The sponges are way too firm and do not absorb water no matter how long I run them under the faucet.  I also feel like I am bruising my face every time I use one of these sponges due to how hard and ineffective they are at blending in make up.  The real beautybIender has greater absorbency and gently bounces off your face while creating the perfect make up canvas.  I purchased these because I was looking for a deal; who likes spending $22 on a sponge?  But after using these sponges I&#x27;d much rather pay $22 for a product that works instead of flushing $15 down the toilet. BTW - &amp;#34;Editor&#x27;s Choice&amp;#34;?  Can&#x27;t find anything to back up that statement anywhere.</li>
    <li> I use these with or without water - works just the same for me, but others may have their preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore the fact that you can wash them so easily; my biggest issue with so many sponges was that they would not clean properly after a few uses. These clean quickly and easily, and I feel no need to clean them as often as I did my other sponges because these do not suck in all my excess makeup. I use far less makeup now and the application was absolutely flawless. I don&#x27;t understand it, but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the blue colored sponge for touching up my makeup after a long day (my makeup is to blame for the short usage - not the sponges). I also use the blue one to apply my moisturizer and even that seems to be doing wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly love this product and would recommend it to everyone who uses liquid concealer or foundation.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Not even close to Beauty blender.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these sponges, they are soft and apply well. I used all of them for practice and wash them with baby shampoo and they came back perfect. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These sponges are by far one of the best products I have purchased on Amazon. Amazing quality. I will be purchasing more sponges in the future.</li>
    <li> works great. not sure I need all the other shapes but its still saves me a few compared to the beauty blender at Sephora. I&#x27;ll give the other sponges a try as well especially the purple one.</li>
    <li> This is my first beauty some and after using it only twice I&#x27;m IN LOVE!!!! Makeup goes on nice and smooth cream concealer,  powder,  liquid all of it!!!! I would definitely buy these again and again.  Plus the colors are super cute too!!! Great product and customer service!!! I loved the email they sent explain how to use and clean the product too!!!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! Don&#x27;t know I survived before these. They are awesome. Good bye foundation brushes! No more streaks here!</li>
    <li> I love how evenly this product is to use, it came with great instructions on how to use and clean them. The seller was very helpful with sending instructions too. Love it and have already recommended it to friends!</li>
    <li> Great quality, and blend my makeup so nicely. Still getting used to the array of shapes, but I look forward to using all of them</li>
    <li> These dupes are Ah-May-Zing!!! I purchased a Beaty blender and from the second I handed the store associate my cash to pay for it, I started to think &amp;#34;Is this really worth it?&amp;#34;. Well after coming across these and noticing the price, I decided to give it a try. Well, I am so happy I made that decision because these are wonderful! The quality is great. The shipment arrived very quick, packaging was well secured and the directions/helpful tips that came with them made this purchase even better. I&#x27;m going to purchase a set for my mother (teaching her to use them will be easier with them direction) AND I&#x27;m getting a second set for myself!if you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing these, seriously you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Beauty Blender sponges are a very expensive and specific product.  As the sponges wear out,it is logical that you might want to replace your Beauty Blender with another sponge that might cost less and save money over time.  Because this purchase is a big decision for many who are considering using it, let&#x27;s take an in-depth look at how and why these sponges are different, and if they are a choice that you might want to make for your makeup arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is advertised as a Beauty Blender Dupe, I wanted to do this review based upon my uses of both sponges with the same product, applied to the same skin on a few people.  I am a makeup artist.  I am used to using throw away cosmetic sponges, and I also use the Beauty Blender.  When I want an airbrushed finish that uses as little makeup as possible (HD makeup gets expensive) I prefer the Beauty Blender.  Let&#x27;s take a look at why I feel that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TEXTURE AND BEHAVIOR?&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the texture of these sponges are different than the beauty blender.  The surface texture of these sponges is like flocked fleece.  The texture of the Beauty Blender is that of a micro sponge.  The surface is uneven and similar to a natural sponge, but much tinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly the weight of these sponges is more dense and heavier than the Beauty Blender.  This reflects also in their ability to absorb water and grow in size.  These only get slightly bigger, compared to the Beauty Blender which almost doubles in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the way that these sponges act when using is different.  These sponges are more of a stable solid surface which is more of an applicator in nature.  The Beauty Blender is much more bouncy and this is important for what I need it for, which I will address next in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT KIND OF MAKEUP DO I USE A SPONGE FOR?&lt;br /&gt;I like to use makeup that is HD ready so that I know it will photograph well, appear true to color in various light, and also be complimentary on skin of all ages.  My goal is to use as little as possible of the foundation, but make the application look like it is actual skin on men or women that I apply it on.  Graftobian HD creme is one of my favorites, but I also use MAC Studio Tech on occasions.  I like to use the sponge for a flawless application of these foundations in particular, which is why I like using a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like to apply corrector and concealer under the eye area using the point, in a way that is not detectable through the day by settling in the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DOES THIS SPONGE SET PERFORM AS COMPARED TO BEAUTY BLENDER?&lt;br /&gt;The primary reason that I do not like this sponge set for doing foundation is that it is more of a solid stable surface.  That means that water is locked into the sponge and when you press it onto the skin surface, it bounces a little, but it does not release much moisture and it also does not redistribute the foundation in a manner which causes it to blend with the skin surface as well as the Beauty Blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I noticed is that these sponges take up a lot more makeup than the Beauty Blender.  I can do an entire face barely touching the Beauty Blender to my pan of foundation only a few times.  I have used it to cover up very dark bruising, discoloration, and marks on the face so well that no one had any idea that foundation had been used.  I also have used the Beauty Blender for corrector and concealer (again cream).  The Beauty Blender scored once again with using a lot less product than these sponges use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these sponges, I found that it was harder to get the foundation, corrector, or concealer to go onto the sponge at first and then too much would get onto the sponge afterward.  I only got about a fourth of the mileage out of the application, and most of the foundation still remained on the sponge, but would not distribute to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I had with these sponges was in their retention of moisture without dispersing it with the foundation when applying to the skin.  That left the foundation patchy in places and a little bit of streaking despite me using the same bouncing technique that I use with the Beauty Blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the Beauty Blender, the surface of the sponge is soft to the touch, but uneven like a natural sponge is.  That allows the sponge to pick up a little foundation with very little effort, and it redistributes the foundation around the skin in such a way that it actually does look like skin when you are done because it incorporates tiny bits of the moisture in the sponge into the application process.  It is that moisture mix which leaves the foundation I use looking like a second skin.  Without it, it is not nearly as flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry time is vastly different as well.  These sponges take several days to dry completely (you don&#x27;t want to store them out of airflow until they are dry lest they mold), and my Beauty Blender takes about a day to dry well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARE THESE SPONGES GOOD FOR ANYTHING ELSE?&lt;br /&gt;When using these sponges for cream blush or a couple of cream eye shadow colors, I did find the surface and texture to be better utilized.  Since only a small area is being done and the color can be more intense, it did work better for those small things.  However, I still prefer the Beauty Blender in the long run, but these would serve as a decent pinch hit in my kit if I needed them for those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think that these sponges would be good to fix up spots quickly that need to be blended or thinned out and not necessarily sponged on with the stippling appearance of the Beauty Blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the cleaning instructions on these sponges are worth the price of the package.  Using the olive oil/soap combo on the sponges also works on the Beauty Blenders.  I am amazed at how beautifully the combination cleans the sponges.  Kudos to the company for providing such valuable information!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;I have rated this two stars because I don&#x27;t HATE these sponges, but I wanted them specifically for foundation applications to replace the Beauty Blender, and in that case, these just didn&#x27;t do it for me with the type of foundation that I like to use.  For blush or eye shadow, they were acceptable and will serve me well as a back up in my kit.  The texture and performance is quite different than using a Beauty Blender, so if you really want a Beauty Blender, you might not be satisfied with this.  It does use a lot more product which is another drawback for me as I want to extend my makeup as much as I can.  The price is good and these sponges can be used to clean up spots or for some things well enough, but if you want cream foundation to be applied flawlessly using as little product as possible, I don&#x27;t think this is the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are comfortable using the white throw away sponges that makeup artists use regularly, then this set would be a good choice to consider.  They clean up very well if used as instructed, so should provide a decent period of use for you.th these sponges was in their retention of moisture without dispersing it with the foundation when applying to the skin.

    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t compare these to it, but these streets sponges are great. There is a shape for all make up needs.</li>
    <li> I really like the purple sponge. Its great for blending</li>
    <li> Best Sponge I ever tried highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great sponges.  I use the pink and purple most often and the price was great!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect as I purchased these beauty blenders for myself and my teen daughters.  I am beyond pleased with the result.  My 18 yo daughter showed me how to use the sponge. My makeup used to look horrible by 3 pm but now it looks so natural and lasts throughout my work day.  Same brand of makeup, but using the beauty blender has made a huge difference.  I&#x27;ve been complimented on how nice I look, even at 3pm.  :-).  Highly recommend your product .</li>
    <li> Great Product and it works perfectly!!! Plus great value!!!</li>
    <li> I wish they blended a little better and didn&#x27;t absorb so much makeup</li>
    <li> I love to put my make up on with these sponges the pointy ends are very helpful when it comes  to work around eyes. Make up distributes evenly.</li>
    <li> I have to say that these are just as good at the brand name sponges. My cat destroyed my brand name sponge, and I really didn&#x27;t want to spring for another one. I have had issues with my foundation looking cakey lately and that was not the look I wanted. I had been using brushes and my fingers, and knew I needed to find a different method. I read the reviews, and gave this a try. I have been more than pleased with the outcome. This is a good value and will be repurchasing when the time comes. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I held out on the beauty blender hype for so long. These sponges are amazing and I look for a reason to use every single one each morning. The pink, used slightly damp, has replaced my flattop kabuki for foundation application - a brush I&#x27;ve used daily for almost 3 years. Amazing product and customer service!</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered these!</li>
    <li> I used the green sponge and I&#x27;m beyond pleased. It&#x27;s affordable and is like the large and micro beauty blender in one. It expands with water and isn&#x27;t like others that have that hard feel is nice and soft with a flawless airbrushed look.</li>
    <li> I am 37 years old and all I can say is OMG!!! My BIGGEST pet peeve with make-up has been dealing with makeup appliers (compact pads, mineral brushes, and most importantly the cheaply made eye shadow two ended sponge on a stick). Right? In my love for make-up, nothing hurts more than getting ready to go out and having the stupid eye shadow sponge come off the stick as applying...am I right ladies? All I have to say is buy Beauty Junkees Sponges! Never in my life, have I ever loved applying make-up so much more and without ease. What I love most is that you can rinse them well after application and they air dry. Next, they are SO easy to use. I am a perfectionist...I am DONE in NO time as before! First, I use the Green Spade sponge for my foundation and the dark circles under my eyes and finish it with any unintended smudges. It&#x27;s my fav... handling any detailed imperfection. (I LOVE how it holds in the hand.) Next, I start with the Purple Pear sponge. This is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for compact powder OR mineral powder (believe it or not, in my own opinion, when people force you to buy mineral brushes when buying mineral powder, watch out)! Purple Pear even works BETTER! The Pink Teardrop is so awesome! Never has my eye shadow been flawless as evident by compliments, etc. So FAST and EASY to apply. Girls, all I can say is that these sponges have saved me MUCH time, MUCH money and MOST importantly much self confidence in how my make-up is applied. NEVER in my life has it looked SO beautiful!!! (not too much or under JUST RIGHT!) SO pretty...</li>
    <li> These beauty blenders are amazing! I&#x27;ve had them for over a year now, and they&#x27;ve always done it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;m on my last one, so I gatta purchase another soon! (:</li>
    <li> Great product!  Easy to handle and to  clean, and really improved the way makeup looks after application.  Highly recommend it!  And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the sellers really go the extra mile and give great support and additional info, helping us use the product for the best results.  Thanks for caring, Beauty Junkees, amazing product and service!</li>
    <li> I recieved this set as a gift from my daughter. She had been raving about them ever since she had bought them a few months earlier. I love them! four excellent sponges for this price is such a great value. I&#x27;ve only used them for a couple weeks so I don&#x27;t know how well they&#x27;ll hold up but they feel as if they&#x27;ll have a long life. The variety of shapes mean you have every possible sponge need covered. I recommend them wholeheartily!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Beauty Blender for over a year now. I love the way my foundation looks airbrushed.</li>
    <li> I like it , it is pretty good to use, easy to blend , I recommend it , you got to try it ,</li>
    <li> I love these! They work great at providing a natural coverage look, and I especially like the Blue one - the flat edge makes it pretty unique among make-up sponges of this kind. The best part is these help conserve product, compared to using brushes or fingers in my experience.</li>
    <li> Love the teardrop sponge. High quality and gives a very flawless, airbrushed look.</li>
    <li> High quality sponges and GREAT customer service!  Excellent product!  No issues, yet they reached out to ME to ensure my satisfaction with the product!  That rarely happens, if ever!!!  Will definitely purchase from this seller again!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my beauty sponges! They work so well, wet or dry!! Also, the different shapes make it easy for different makeup applications.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used makeup sponges before, so I can&#x27;t compare them to any expensive brands. However, I am very pleased with these sponges. I was looking for something to provide smoother and more consistent coverage, and these do just the trick. Shipping was fast, and the seller sent me follow up emails with more tips and tricks. Definitely great for those on a budget!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Have been using the Pink and Purple sponges for the past month or so. They work wonders really. A nearly airbrushed finish. Definitely recommend for any makeup lovers like myself. Xx</li>
    <li> All I have to say is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> They work super well for my cosplay makeup needs. I&#x27;ve never used makeup or applicator sponges before, but these were intuitive enough for a novice like myself, had adequate instruction for loading up and laying on the product, and looked even and balanced after I was finished. Top notch, these.</li>
    <li> Great sponges for liquid make-up application and blending. They really grow in size once you run them under warm water. They are gentle enough for use around sensitive eye areas without irritation. Also, great customer service.</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of brush and make up sponge. This is by far the best make up applicator and at reasonable prices. Also extremely easy to wash/take care of. I use this to apply primer, liquid foundation, and cream based contour and highlighter. Shipment came sooner than the estimated ship date. Package was nice (tear off and resealable zip pouch). I will definitely be purchasing this set again in the next 2-3 months when I replace the sponges for hygienic purposes.</li>
    <li> So far I use the oval shape blender which is the most popular shape and I do like the way it feels against my skin  however I wish it was bigger</li>
    <li> These Sponges are very nice. This is a good price for all 4.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great! They are very light and easy to work with. What I like the most is that you get different shapes so you can easily apply corrector or foundation underneath your eyes or around the nose. They also blend great! Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product for smooth makeup application. I&#x27;m a fan of the sheer coverage I get with these sponges and tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really like these sponges! So much better than a regular makeup sponge, with many more uses.  I love using the purple pear for my foundation application.  It covers much more area and blends very nicely.  I use the blue sculptor for my powder, and the green spade is great for errors when I apply my shadow and liner on my eyes.  Haven&#x27;t used the pink teardrop yet.  The sponges clean up very well, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get several months use from them.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. The packaging was awesome and beautiful.</li>
    <li> on time and eficient, love it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these sponges! Flawless look! A must buy and the price is amazing! Will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> The best makeup sponges I ever had.  The do an excellent job in making my makeup look flawless.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE!!!!!!!!!!  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without these.  They make my makeup very flawless and better coverage.  No more getting foundation all over my hands and end up getting it everywhere else.  Very good price and they last forever! 100% recommend!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. They are a little firmer then the original beauty blender but they do the same job very well! Great buy</li>
    <li> I love these beauty blenders. I have tried using different and expensive brushes and sponges, I&#x27;ve also tried using my fingers for application. Nothing compares to how flawlessly these beauty blenders apply my foundation. I will never use anything else and will continue to order only from this company. I was told I would receive my order within 7 days but to my surprise I received it in only 2 days. Great product and even better company to order from. Great customer service. Beauty Junkees you guys are awesome down to the last detail of adding a cute little sticker that read &amp;#34;you are beautiful&amp;#34;.  I won&#x27;t ever order from anyone again my search is over. For under $20 this would be a great gift for my sister and mom. I know they will love it too. I am truly speechless. I am amazed at what this little sponge can do.</li>
    <li> Really great so far!!! I just opened them about a week ago and so far I absolutely LOVE THEM!!! I have never had the brand named Beauty Blender, but I was told at Sephora that when you get a knockoff, submerge it in water and if it doesn&#x27;t expand, it&#x27;s junk. Well let me tell you these DEFINITELY expanded when I put them under water. I haven&#x27;t experienced any plastic like smell at all. Though when I did submerge them the water that came out was rather cloudy, but I just squeezed it until it came clear and haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I received an email from the company asking me if I received it which was nice. I find the green one is great for highlighting under my eyes, and the flat part of the blue one is amazing for applying cream blush. I would absolutely order this set again. Especially seeing as you get 4 for less than the price of one brand name Beauty Blender. I&#x27;ll post an update in a few months, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> The perfect applicators for concealers, makeup.  Works great on those mistakes - mascara on  eyelids.  Great customer service, fast delivery.  I was surprised that the company even sent a followup email about using the product.  Very happy with the company, &amp; the products.</li>
    <li> I have used the sponges everyday since I received them! They are great!!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality sponges, love the fact that I can use different makeup applications. At fraction of price as compared to beauty blender.</li>
    <li> These bad boys are a must!!!  They work magic on your face while applying your foundation, BB cream or concealer! And they are very affordable as well. I recommend them no doubt! Thanx Beauty Junkees it was one of my best purchases here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> What a great product! I wouldn&#x27;t use liquid foundation, because I couldn&#x27;t get it to blend properly. These sponges have definitely changed the way I wear makeup. My foundation goes on flawlessly. I&#x27;m glad I bought these, instead of the $20 plus, original.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent value.  Much better quality than Ulta.</li>
    <li> I loved the color of the brushes. They were soft and worked great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE THINGS!!!!! Best sponges ever! I will always buy these. So much cheaper and works GREAT!</li>
    <li> Thank you for keeping up with me as a client. This shows how you really care about us. About the sponges, I have been looking for it long time ago and I finally found it. Thanks to you. I love using it instead of using the brush or my fingers. It is so amazingly perfect in blinding the concealer. Thank you again for your care and certainly I will order the pink sponge again.</li>
    <li> Works fine. I really never used sponges before but it seems to blends fine.  They are durable feeling but soft at the same time.</li>
    <li> Super quick delivery and I&#x27;m very happy with these sponges! Thank you!</li>
    <li> These makeup sponges are superior to most others I&#x27;ve tried; and the ones that were comparable were more expensive. So THIS is a win/win! There are a variety of shapes available to make flawless application (to even the most awkward areas) very simple. They are also very easy and durable to clean with warm water and soap. And the cherry on top is the excellent customer service and fast shipping! Beauty Junkees have staying power and I plan on being a &amp;#34;junkee&amp;#34; customer for the long term... Totally addicted!</li>
    <li> I got these makeup sponges for my girlfriend and she loves them. She just started doing makeup for a living and these were perfect for her. I like how Beauty Junkees emailed us instructions on how to use each sponge and how to properly clean the sponges. I will be purchasing more from Beauty Junkees in the future.</li>
    <li> Works really well, stains easily though, and takes a long time to dry</li>
    <li> Very soft, and work very well... I loved every one of them.</li>
    <li> The verdict is still out on these sponges. It would be more useful for me if there were one a little smaller,flatter overall, and or thinner. They seem to be great quality, I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in the individual sponges themselves.</li>
    <li> Great make-up sponges.  They blend beautifully.</li>
    <li> I love the sponges very happy! The blue flag ended one is my favorite, I use it with BB cream mainly but blush, conceller snd highlighter also. Having all 4 sponge options with a huge bonus and you can not beat the price.  Blend very well you can really feel the quality. The company was very helpful and I appreciated their follow up. Good customer service really goes a long way! Very happy and will be buying these again!</li>
    <li> I have bought many a beauty sponge in my day and let me tell you these are by far my favorite!! I don&#x27;t wet the green sponge and I use it as my eraser sponge. They all do what they say their supposed to do and more!! Trust me, money well spent!!!</li>
    <li> I really love these, my makeup looks so much smoother! I also just started learning to contour and these are perfect for that. they hold water and are almost twice the size but aren&#x27;t drippy. They wash easy with mild fade wash and dry by the next time I need them. I can&#x27;t believe I was using brushes for so long!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my daughter, SHE ABSOLUTELY loves them. She&#x27;s into the makeup tutorial thing, I&#x27;m glad together we were able to make her happy this Christmas.  Thank you</li>
    <li> The sponges work well!</li>
    <li> I had not previously used a beauty sponge prior to this experience. Just yesterday I tried the real tech blender for comparison. This dupe sponge does expand considerably when you wet it and it has a much firmer texture than the real tech. The finished results were nearly equivalent. Bottom line: it works, but you may need to adopt a gentler touch.</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing and just as good as a beauty blender! Thanks Beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> Great sponges for the price. Worth it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these sponges! Had been spending a lot more on the name brand and was glad to find a better, cheaper replacement. They&#x27;re soft and don&#x27;t smear my makeup around like some others I&#x27;d tried.</li>
    <li> My favorite 2 sponges are the blue sculptor and the green spade.  The blue sculptor sponge is nice and soft when wet and creates a nice, smooth canvas. The green spade has a nice texture as well and is perfect for concealer under the eyes and on the sides of the nose.  The pink teardrop was not what I expected.  It was very dense and although it did apply the foundation smoothly, it was uncomfortable using it on my face. I&#x27;ve washed all of them and they&#x27;ve all held up pretty well. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would re-buy the blue and green sponge whenever I need to replace them.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased these for me for Christmas. Before this i had been using a foundation brush, as i use liquid foundation. I used sponges when i was younger but they always seemed to absorb to much of my make up. These do no do that. I barely absorbs anything. everything is left on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;using the sponge damp helps leave a even king of &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to your skin. it is definitely a full coverage applicator.&lt;br /&gt;i tried the pink one first and it works great. really good for smoothing out your finished product.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite one is the purple sponge. It sits well in your hand. I use liquid base so i put some on my opposite hand, dab my hand and then apply to my face, it works out great. I always have baby wipes nearby ( having a 2 year old and all) so after i clean the access make up off my hand i wipe whats left on the sponge off with the baby wipe as well, it makes it a lot easier to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;My Favorite thing about this sponge is i use it to apply my concealer and my eye make up. it is flawless for eye make up! No more lines or smudges, just great eyeshadow!  i use a all over kind of eye shimmer by Stilla to finish and this more than does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I am not real good with the blue one, the pink is good and the green is precise!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you try sponges again!</li>
    <li> I purchased these sponges as a little gift to myself and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The seller also provides great feedback on how to use and care for the sponges which is awesome!</li>
    <li> These sponges just might replace most of my brushes. They are very easy to use and are very gentle on the face. Also, they are recommended by a ton of makeup artist I follow. Thanks for the great deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beauty Blender sponges for the past two years, and although these are a little harder like others have said, I see no difference in the end result of my makeup. For 10% of the cost of Beauty Blenders, I&#x27;ll totally take it!</li>
    <li> After watching some YouTube tutorials, I discovered that using brushes to apply foundation was causing my dry skin to flake even more. Several of the gurus recommended using a damp blender sponge to apply the foundation instead of a brush so that is what prompted my purchase. I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $20 on just one sponge so after researching the reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase this brand since the reviews were good and you get 4 sponges for $15. These are fantastic! I have tried many different foundations but never liked any of them because I was either applying them with my fingers or a brush. They were always cakey looking or caused my dry skin to look even worse. With this product, I get an even, flawless finish with all of my liquid and cream foundations that I otherwise would have ended up tossing. I just wet the sponge, squeeze it out so that it is damp, dab it into a little foundation, and dab it sparingly all over my face. A little foundation goes a long way. If I get a little heavy handed with the foundation, I&#x27;ll just dab back over that area with a part of the sponge that doesn&#x27;t have foundation on it and the damp sponge helps to lift it off. These quality sponges are cute, effective, and a great value! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> These sponges are lovely. They apply great amount of product and are great quality. The customer service was fantastic as well! Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are really great! I love that I now have so many different shapes. I&#x27;ve been using the blue one for primer and the pink and purple both work really well for foundation. I don&#x27;t use the green all that often unless I just haven&#x27;t washed the blue one or something. Anyway, I always use them wet and think they work quite well. They do hold on to a little bit of the product but wayyy less than the cheaper sponges do. Makeup goes on very smoothly if you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Sponges are just as described...soft, easy to use. Would highly recommend if you&#x27;re interested in getting the right fit for all your makeup needs!</li>
    <li> These sponges are such great quality! Seriously, so awesome. And the emails that I received making sure everything was good were much appreciated !</li>
    <li> Good quality, excellent service and the best price!</li>
    <li> Love the quality. Just as good as the expensive ones for half the price.</li>
    <li> Love them, better then the beauty blender of $20</li>
    <li> I love the variety in this pack! Lots of shapes to choose from! These are super easy to use, I&#x27;d never used them before I got these. It says to wet them, but they work fine for me without wetting them, honestly. They give you the smoothest, most flawless finish, too! I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy they made applying my makeup, and how quick! I use them for foundation, and concealer, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave one to my sister, and she loves it!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a beauty sponge so I didn&#x27;t realize I needed to wet the sponge prior to applying my makeup. Once I got that down, the sponge worked great. I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet, but I have no double they are all wonderful.</li>
    <li> These sponges are a game changer. I&#x27;ve been using the beauty blender for some time and I&#x27;ve purchased other sponges from Places like Ulta and Sephora. The Beauty Junkee sponges top them all. At the price and quality of the sponges, you seriously can&#x27;t beat them. Love love love!! I&#x27;m definitely a lifer when it comes to these bad boys! To add, the customer service and follow ups were pretty awesome. A little e-mail can go a long way! Loved the total experience with this product!!</li>
    <li> Beauty Junkees were amazing, they followed my order and even when my order was lost on the way (which received later on) they offered me to give me a new set. amazing customer service.</li>
    <li> LOVE these blenders! No matter what I am putting on my face (concealer, foundation, or just cleaning up eye shadow) these blenders make my face look flawless. Highly highly reccomend!!</li>
    <li> these are great! affordable and the application is flawless!</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing customer service, two of mine ended up ripping a little and they sent me replacements with no charge. these sponges are super high quality, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are great for the price. They are a bit harder than the original beauty blender, but they work pretty well. Also they are really cute.</li>
    <li> Take care of them and you will love these. Don&#x27;t ever use a wedge sponge from a local everything store again.&lt;br /&gt;I like the rounded on with the tip the best. I can get right in the corner by my eyes. Used correctly my foundation coverage is perfect and it moves smoothly. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! They are great and so versatile. They are very easy to use and clean. They give you face a flawless look that is super easy to achieve!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the green spade sponge so far and I love it. The sponge blends my concealer flawlessly. The only issue I have with the sponge is that there is already a small rip in it. I&#x27;m guessing from me washing it. I don&#x27;t think these sponges will last really long, however thats understandable for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought more expensive sponges (you all know which ones!). Beauty Junkees are awesome !!! The shapes are all thoughtfully created. I LOVE the aqua sponge with the flat end. Applies my foundation flawlessly, &amp; they all clean up like a dream. Soft as &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast. Great customer service.  Thank you Beauty Junkees :)</li>
    <li> I am really, really impressed with these sponges.  I haven&#x27;t tried the super expensive beauty blender and definitely don&#x27;t intend to because these little guys work great!!  Very smooth application for foundation, bb creams and concealer.  And I am also impressed with the company.  They sent out an email shortly after I orderes these with helpful instructions and tips on usage of each sponge. Love it!</li>
    <li> These sponges came right on time. I&#x27;m not sure how well they work but they are the only ones that my daughter uses.</li>
    <li> WoW!!!  This has to be the best thing that has happened to women since makeup was invented!  These sponges make application of so simple and allows you to minimize the amount so you look and natural as possible.  I love that I have 4 different shapes that will work on the smallest corner of my eyes to a larger area such as cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a cheaper brand that I found at Ulta but it didn&#x27;t even compare to this sponge!  Well Done!  I will definitely be buying these again and again.</li>
    <li> An amazing product, these sponges work very well for blending all types of makeup and paint! With good care, I am sure these sponges can last a long time. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! It&#x27;s a 4 piece set and completely inexpensive!!! At other places, you would most likely get the pink teardrop sponge at around $20-$25. Beauty Junkees gives you 4 and for half the cost!!! It&#x27;s a great buy and once I&#x27;m at the point where I need to purchase more, I would definitely buy this set again!</li>
    <li> Oh my god I love these sponges so much! I&#x27;ve used blender sponges before that smelled so strongly of rubber. The blender sponges by Beauty Junkees are nearly odorless. And they&#x27;re amazing. You get 4 sponges for the price some are charging for 1. Great deal. Great product. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I just like the blue sponge... it has a flat part that makes it easy to use. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever use the other ones.</li>
    <li> I have seen a bunch of youtubers using these sponges and I wanted to try them. My favorite is the pink teardrop one, I&#x27;m still getting used to the others. Only negative thing is the sponges get dyed by your foundation but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  They still work great!!</li>
    <li> Awesome blenders. I&#x27;ve only used the green and pink really, but use them everyday for foundation application. They&#x27;re awesome! Flawless look and you can barely tell you&#x27;re wearing make up. Super buildable and the blenders don&#x27;t absorb much product at all. Clean with warm water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughters, they love them.</li>
    <li> I really liked these set.  I got to know about it thru youtube makeup tutorials. I just gave my niece a set for Christmas and she really liked it, too!</li>
    <li> The sponges arrived on time and work really well. I&#x27;m glad I got these four sponges for the price of one! The directions on the back of the package is also very helpful. Nice work.😀</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. I use every single sponge except the purple one. My favorites are the teardrop and the sculptor. The sponges are a firm, but not too firm. They don&#x27;t absorb the liquid and apply evenly. As much as I love this product I think above all I love the service I received from Beauty Junkees. After ordering they sent me an email on how to use each sponge and what they are meant for that I found very helpful!  I would say they are an excellent dupe to the beauty blender. The only difference is the beauty blender has a different texture and is a little less firm. However, these Beauty Blender Dupe Makeup Sponges work really well.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great sponges, great price. Holding up well after cleaning many times.</li>
    <li> These are great. I love how easy they are to use and clean. They blend my makeup flawlessly. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I started using these. They are such a great cost too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great with a resealable pouch. The seller is awesome in communication, providing tips and general know how. They are super friendly and value their customers.</li>
    <li> I use these sponges to apply concealer around my eyes, apply my foundation so effortlessly smooth and apply powders. For mouth and eyes the sponges with tips do get to the crevices of eye and mouth areas. Just smooths it all out. I have tried various brushes that do give you more control and a more even coverage but this tiny brushes really do make a difference! Very smooth, flawless look when applied correctly. They also clean really well. The tips sent by Beauty Junkees really helped me to apply and cleanse my sponges. Using olive oil with the baby shampoo made a real big difference in the amount of effort needed to clean the sponges. I do love them, really! I think my makeup looks better (less obvious) and smoother.</li>
    <li> AWESOME BB dupe! I really like these sponges! Works just like more expensive BB sponges and is a MUCH better value. Give them a try, you will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this set as an add-on item because I do like BeautyBlenders but didn&#x27;t want to shell out $20 for one. I read the reviews on this item, saw the price and figured \\&quot;eh, why not?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are most assuredly not BeautyBlender dupes. BBs are bouncy, and extremely squishy and pliable. They bounce off your skin when you apply makeup. These sponges are very dense-- they remind me of memory foam, especially since they take time to return to their normal shape when you squeeze a damp one (though the pointy one less so). With these sponges, I feel like I&#x27;m just bopping my face and it kind of just goes \\&quot;womp\\&quot; every time. The sponge isn&#x27;t round and pliable enough to blend (they are all flat on the bottom, except for the pointy one. True BBs are more teardrop shaped) I was pretty disappointed after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my next point: I think it&#x27;s highly suspicious that so many of the reviews are 5 stars, and when you click on the users, you find out that they only have that one review up. HMMMMM...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For quality alone, I would have given the product 3 stars, since they were cheap-ish, it worked *okay* and the seller sent them in a cute sachet. But I am definitely taking off a star because I highly question the integrity of the seller. I would not buy again though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The seller immediately contacted me after reading this and issued a full refund without my asking. She also assured me that the reviews are real. She seemed sincere, so I felt bad. So I&#x27;ll just say this: the sponges are fine, they are just NOT Beauty Blender dupes. Same idea, different feel.</li>
    <li> First off, I want to be quite honest with you guys by saying I HATED using my fingers to blend my makeup! After using this product there is no turning back. I was searching online for some beauty blenders that all the YouTube gurus were raving about, so I figured why spend $30 dollars on just ONE SPONGE for that I&#x27;ll just use my fingers! When I came across this product I was SOLD! The reviews weren&#x27;t as sketchy as others that I came across so I gave it ago.. and guess what I LOVE my new makeup sponges. I definitely will not be a stranger to Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> I recently received the original beauty blender sponge (from sephora) as a gift and loved it upon first usage.  I loved it so much that I immediately started to look for dupes as I cannot justify spending $20+ for a sponge that needs to be replaced every 3-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I wanted to like these sponges after reading so many positive reviews, I didn&#x27;t find them to be of the same quality as the beauty blender and I cannot say that these four sponges are reliable dupes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no makeup guru, but here&#x27;s my comparison against the original beauty blender.  Please note that I have yet to use all of the sponges.  To date I have only used the purple sponge (and I received the sponges this past Tuesday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- cheaper&lt;br /&gt;- comes in a variety of shapes for different applications (although I&#x27;m still not sure how to use all of them)&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t absorb as much make up (I use it primarily to apply liquid foundation and a powder concealer)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use; I like the center ridge/indentation as I find it easier to hold when applying make up&lt;br /&gt;- received the product quickly and well packaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- after 2 uses and 1 washing, the purple sponge (aka purple pear) already has a sizable tear on the rounded part of the sponge; I washed it the same way I would wash the beauty blender and I don&#x27;t have nails so I don&#x27;t understand how the tear happened...&lt;br /&gt;- harder to clean; I also feel as if I have to wash the sponge more frequently as the makeup builds (and cakes) on the sponge faster&lt;br /&gt;- too dense&lt;br /&gt;- takes MUCH longer to dry&lt;br /&gt;- would like a pedestal for the sponges so they can sit somewhere while drying/in between usage&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t apply make up as smoothly... more streaks/uneven application.  I feel as if it wipes away makeup as opposed to leaving a dewy finish on the face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will keep them and use them for however long they last, but I&#x27;ll continue to search for dupes... or most likely suck it up and buy the original beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since initially writing my review, I have started to use the other sponges and did find that I like Blue Sculptor for application of liquid foundation.  I also found that the sponges are getting softer the more I&#x27;m using them, which helps.  However, with nearly every wash, little tears appear and I barely use any pressure because I know how fragile the sponges can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the customer service of this company is very admirable as they reached out to refund me since I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied with the product, which is why I&#x27;m adding a star to my original 2-star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will say this...One thing I find odd about all of the reviews is that almost every positive review has a 1:1 ratio of people finding the review helpful.  However, any review less than 3 stars has 0 out of 5 (one review has 3 out of 8) people who find the review helpful.  I almost want to agree with another reviewer about the reviews being fishy... I just find it odd...</li>
    <li> I love how even my make up goes on and how easy it is to clean and reuse the sponges</li>
    <li> i really love this product gives me air brush looking finish! i recommend these make up sponges for females that dont like there freckles and to cover up those dark eye bags. i mostly like the blue flat top sponge !</li>
    <li> I have very dry oily combo skin I should say. I can&#x27;t really wear much liquid foundation because my face gets flaky at certain random places when I put my foundation on. However with this sponge I can already see that it gives me less flakes than other appliances. I like it!</li>
    <li> it blends nicely using the beauty sponge with my foundation.  i have not used the original one.  but these work well to me.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great. Compared to the ones that I bought previously (at a similar price), these are far better quality in the way that they don&#x27;t absorb nearly as much makeup. Although some of the shapes are less practical than others in my opinion, these are the best beauty blender knockoffs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges!!! Great quality and unbelievable price. I have purchased more expensive ones at cosmetic stores and they have been too hard to work with to blend. These on the other are soft and work great for blending. I have already recommended these to my friends. I will be buying more from beauty junkees. No more expensive single sponges from cosmetic stores for me.</li>
    <li> Good but not fantastic. They are not a thick as the other ones I bought. They are better than your fingers or brushes though!!!</li>
    <li> My makeup truly looks like skin when I use these sponges. I love,love,love the pink one but use all of them for different reasons (contouring and blending) the tips they send with your purchase and their cleaning tip is the best I&#x27;ve heard. Saves money on silly useless cleaners!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to order from a company that cares so much about customer satisfaction</li>
    <li> First time contouring and these sponges made the application process a lot smoother and the results were great.</li>
    <li> grateful and pleased by the quality of sponges, recommend 100% serious and responsible seller, a pleasure for me to have made ​​the purchase !!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, as described. I love that the seller sent me an email about how best to use each of the sponges, very helpful!</li>
    <li> product is amazing and you get a lot more for cheaper! I couldn&#x27;t believe it lol this is a great deal! Don&#x27;t miss out! I love how it leaves my face flawless!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these sponges!!</li>
    <li> You may have heard of the Beauty Blender. I wanted to try it out but I didn’t want to pay over $20 for one sponge. I found the Pro Beauty Sponges instead and they had great reviews. The set comes with four different sizes for different areas of the face. I mainly use the pink and green one. It takes some getting used to although my makeup blends so much faster and easier. Plus it gives my foundation that ‘dewy’ look.</li>
    <li> Amazing sponges... I&#x27;m able to cover up blemishes now.. I&#x27;m starting to get a little more confident in my appearance thanks to these sponges.</li>
    <li> These are very good sponges. My personal favorite is the purple pear, but I also like the pink tear drop. I had never used a sponge like this before, but I saw a tutorial and wanted to try it out. I&#x27;ve used each of them a few times now and washed them. They are easy to use and clean. I don&#x27;t use the blue contouring one very often, but the quality is consistent. The green one is best for details, but I like to use it to fix my eyeliner or clean up any mascara smudges. Beauty Junkees, the company, is very friendly and offer advice on how to use their products. They seem to want customers to be fully satisfied. I haven&#x27;t had any problems, and the products exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Really like the beauty sponges. See a big difference in the way my foundation goes on. The price is great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these sponges!  They have made my makeup application so much better.  They are high quality sponges that every beauty fanatic should own.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this since it&#x27;s so inexpensive compared to the beauty blender and it had great reviews. However when I dampened the pink sponge and squeezed, I noticed a sudsy substance coming out. My first thought was it is a used product, but there were no stains. Not sure what the soapy substance is but I don&#x27;t want to put it on my face. I&#x27;ll just invest in another beauty blender</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I just can&#x27;t bring myself to spend $20 on one sponge. But why bother when these make my face look flawless. The green one is my favorite. Great bargain.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and lots of variety in shapes! They work extremely well and look and feel like they&#x27;ll last a long time! Cleaning them is very esay as well.</li>
    <li> I was interested in a beauty blender sponge, but for cheap and came across these. I could not have gotten a better deal. These sponges are perfect for applying my foundation. I have always used the little cosmetic wedges and dampened them to apply makeup. These sponges take it to the next level. They are great for my Colorstay foundation application, and even make applying makeup faster. Remember to wet the sponges properly, for a good application. I use the one with the flat tip to help with powder, but I am going to try it for spreading makeup to see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with seller&#x27;s customer service. I received an email with instructions on how to use the sponges. So far, I have used only the pink sponge to apply foundation (I used Neutrogrena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Foundation) and the coverage was flawless. Just dab and slightly roll the sponge on primed/moisturized skin for an airbrushed finish! It is fun to see the sponge expanding when you wet it and contract back slightly when it dries. The pink sponge seems durable and of quality material. It does get stained quickly, however. So be mindful of that. I plan to was it with mild soap and warm water immediately after every use to reduce the chances of saturating the sponge with bacteria and dead skin-cell buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly thought the whole beauty blender concept was a fad and gimmick but it works! Very happy that I could get all the sponges for such a reasonable price. Shipping was also pretty quick! The items arrived in a cute pink bag and each item was individually plastic-wrapped. There was no chemical odor from the sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review if I find that my opinion changes for some reason or if I have any additional things to share after using the other three sponges.</li>
    <li> These are great quality sponges!  They are denser than my Beauty Blender, but do the job just as well. I am totally in love with these sponges and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat this deal!</li>
    <li> like it but not familiar with this sponge , been using my hand as a sponge till now 😂</li>
    <li> to be honest I bought this product because of all good reviews! But Don&#x27;t like it at all!! I love my brushes alot better ! This one dies not have a good finish!!! Sorry didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> Love the different shapes - perfect for every job.</li>
    <li> First off, I would like to mention how lovely the seller is. They did a follow up email with instruction on how to use and I also appreciated the stylish packaging it came in; made me feel like I received a gift. As for the product, I can easily quote all of the other 5 star reviews I had read before purchasing the product. I haven&#x27;t tried all of the sponges yet but specifically the pink one made the application process for foundation and concealer smooth. Usually I struggle applying product under my eyes since my circles are pretty dark, but with the sponge it seems as though it works with the product more over using fingers or brushes. The way it blends without having to apply too much concealer is a blessing. Overall I would definitely order from this seller again. Thank you Beauty Junkees ;) I would like to see more products from ya! Oh!.. and the price? Unbeatable for a package of 4. I even more so appreciate quality products that are affordable, especially while on a budget.</li>
    <li> This has to be the fastest shipping of a product ever. I have only used the pink blender twice so far, but I like it. It blends my foundation nicely. Thank you beauty junkees for the tips on how to best use each sponge. It has only been a few days, so I will come back with a follow up review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a little skeptical about this product. I&#x27;m 62 years old; so I don&#x27;t usually apply the adjectives \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; or \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot; to any part of my skin. Certainly not my face. But my daughter came over raving about this sample pack of sponges she got and twisted my arm to try one out. I have to admit, I was impressed! It certainly didn&#x27;t make my face flawless (nearly impossible at my age lol) but it definitely sheered out my foundation, so I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing gobs of it (perfect for summer) and had a smooth even coverage I don&#x27;t easily get with my fingers or brushes. The sponges are soft, easy to clean, and feel durable enough that they&#x27;ll last me a while. Defintiely recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the airbrushed look that the beauty blender sponges are capable of. They are easy to work with and very durable.  The fine-tip shapes really customize the look and are thorough on many skin types.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to perfect my make-up technique. I have tried many things that I&#x27;m not fond of but these sponges do not fit that description. They are light and soft and distribute evenly even when too much foundation comes out of the container. I&#x27;m still getting acquainted with the best ways to use them but I&#x27;m having fun learning and I&#x27;m enjoying their effects.</li>
    <li> Trying a new makeup applicator sponge. Not sure about the product yet, but follow up and customer service from beauty junkees had been superb. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to shop there again.</li>
    <li> I was a faithful Beauty Blender user for the past year, but like most people, I can&#x27;t stand the high cost. When I saw all of the amazing reviews and the great price for this set, I jumped on it. They arrived quickly and in perfect condition. However, whenever I used them it is a huge difference from the texture of a Beauty Blender. Although the Beauty Blender soaks up more foundation than these do, it is soft and pleasant when you put your makeup on. These sponges felt like I was putting my makeup on with a hard bouncy ball and it just was not pleasant at all. It also took a lot longer to distribute my liquid foundation onto my face because they aren&#x27;t very flexible. Maybe I did something wrong? Actually I want to think that I DID do something wrong because I was SO excited to try these and want them to work out for me. I also tried to use them dry instead of wetting them and it was a bit better, but still not soft. I understand that they need to be firm but they just felt unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this type of beauty blender sponge, so when I found this set on Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t resist. I&#x27;ve used other types of makeup sponges as well as various foundation brushes and my fingers to apply foundation but these sponges give the best results by far. The sizes are perfect and they&#x27;re very easy to work with. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen a better price for the number of sponges you get. I will definitely order more when these wear out.</li>
    <li> These are the only makeup sponges I have come across that actually does what thy say they are going to do. Nice work</li>
    <li> I just received my beauty blender sponges and I am so excited to have them! Its been all a rave and I can&#x27;t wait to get started.... the packaging was great and I love that the seller provided the usages of each of my sponges. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife.  She said they are really nice.  She has never used Beauty Blender, but said these work well</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure just quite what to expect for the price compared to Beautyblender.  What I found were products that work very well, although they do differ slightly from the aforementioned brand.  I do a lot of acting and have used these sponges for stage work (albeit, the show I&#x27;m in right now does not require heavy stage makeup, just heightened regular wear).  I have tried the sponges with both liquid and cream foundation and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the pink sponge first to see how it compared to my Beautyblender.  I noticed immediately that the pink sponge is just a little &amp;#34;stiffer&amp;#34; than the original.  It still works very well, but part of what I have liked about my other sponge is that I don&#x27;t have to use quite as much foundation or concealer (I have very dark circles under my eyes).  Although the difference wasn&#x27;t that big, there was a slight difference.  I then tried the green &amp;#34;genie&amp;#34; as I have called it.  The material did not seem quite as dense as the pink one so I thought it might be closer to my original.  I was correct for the most part.  Although I really liked the larger end with a pointier tip, the other end really didn&#x27;t do much for me.  But this sponge did not require as much make up as the pink one had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I expected to like the blue sponge and thought the flat end would do a better job of blending.  Because of the info about the sponges, I did try this one with my powder.  I LOVED the finish that it gave over the top of my liquid foundation.  And using the sponge let everything &amp;#34;ride on my skin&amp;#34; rather than finding its way into my wrinkles.  In other words, great with powder, not so much on the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple sponge has become my FAVORITE.  I really like the material.  The shape is so much easier to grip and use than the pink &amp;#34;egg.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s got just enough point to get into those tighter areas and does a great job with my under eye concealer.  If I had to choose one out of these four sponges it would definitely be this one.  For whatever reason, the texture on this sponge does seem to have a little more give to it and does a better job with leaving that airbrushed finish.  I haven&#x27;t yet used this one for my liquid and the blue one for powder, but I can only imagine that I am truly going to love the finished result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one difficulty I do have with sponges generally, but especially the pink and blue sponges are their material seems to be just a little denser.  Because of this, they don&#x27;t dry quite as fast as my beautyblender.  They are also just a little bigger, which may be the reason :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the cost difference I will definitely buy these again when I need them.  For the price - THEY CAN&#x27;T BE BEAT!  I just wish that they&#x27;d come up with a mini so that it would really be easy to get my under eye dark circles more easily.</li>
    <li> Extremely pleasantly surprised! I&#x27;ve only had them for a week but they work beautifully. I really was not expecting much considering a bought one other from a different company a few months back, and absolutely hated it. I was truly afraid at first because of how firm they seemed when the Beauty Blender and the Real Technique Sponge are extremely squishy even without water. But after soaked and drained from the excess water, they are super soft and blend both foundation and concealer beautifully. If you have ever used the Real Technique Sponge, you know it applies well but the sponge texture is fairly rough compared to the Beauty Blender. But these are very smooth which makes for a smooth application. I normally wash with Baby shampoo right after, if not a couple hours later to prevent staining. So I can&#x27;t say much about that. If you are beginning a makeup collection or just need some to throw in a bag, leave for travel, this is a great option!</li>
    <li> Great package for a great price! Customer service was so helpful with the use of each sponge. I highly recommend these sponges from Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> These are not good. They r so hard even after soaking with water. And they absorb the foundation.</li>
    <li> After using the Beauty Blender Sponge and needing a new one, I did not want to pay the outrageous price for another one.  So, I decided to try the&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Blender Dupe Makeup Sponges 4pc Set I found on Amazon.  The price was great and the colors and shapes appealed to me.  I haven&#x27;t tried all of the sponges yet, but I think that the purple one will be my favorite and the pink one a close second.  These sponges, in my opinion, are even better that the original B.B. sponge.  I am very happy with my purchase and glad to save money in the process.  Thanks Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I always struggled with feeling like any makeup i used was caked on rather than a smooth finish.  These sponges are a great investment as I don&#x27;t have to keep trying different brands of makeup.  I can use almost any foundation and these sponges help it look blended in and not dry.</li>
    <li> These sponges are the best thing I have ever purchased for my make up tools. I have really freckly and multi-toned skin so getting even looking make up that doesn&#x27;t looked caked up is really hard. But these sponges are just amazing, I&#x27;m not the best at doing make up, but with these sponges my skin looks so flawless!!&lt;br /&gt;And Beauty Junkees are on top of their client service game, as I received the package they sent an email with detailed instructions and tips on how to use each sponge, making sure you are happy with your purchase. Which for me is always nice, I will be ordering more products from them.</li>
    <li> I think these are an excellent replica product with great value. I&#x27;m personally not over-the-moon about the supposedly &amp;#34;air-brushed effects&amp;#34; the original BB creates. However, it&#x27;s a trendy tool that I want to continue experimenting with. Having tried the original and then these dupe sponges, I can honestly say there is NO difference!!! This product works exactly as the original. They absorb water, expand and blend your foundation smoothly. My personal favorites are the pink teardrop and the purple pear. They work the same it&#x27;s just that I like the ergonomic design of the purple one.  I&#x27;m so happy I bought these and Beauty Junkees shipped the product super fast plus the packaging was just perfect. I also loved that the product included how-to and care tips. I&#x27;ll continue scouting Beauty Junkees for my beauty fetishes. Overall a great buy, go for it!!</li>
    <li> Items come exactly as shown in the picture. Quick shipment. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> These sponges are awesome. Great price, great product and customer service.</li>
    <li> It was great for the price!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter, who is a make-up maniac. She did not like the quality at all. Gave them to her sister, who isn&#x27;t picky about make-up application.</li>
    <li> These sponges are awesome.They are so soft and plush.  I use them to blend out my concealer and it does the job perfectly.  I always use the sponges damp because that seems to give me the best results.  I&#x27;ve used every sponge except the blue one so I can&#x27;t speak on that one but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just as good as the others.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges.  The quality on each individual sponge has surpassed my expectations.  I would recommend these to anyone who is in the makeup and beauty industry! The customer service is just the icing on the cake.  I received a detailed email explaining how each sponge works and also received follow up emails from Beauty Junkees to ensure that I was satisfied with my order.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I really like these sponges. The pink teardrop is my favorite. They help me get under my eyes and I just really like how they feel in my hand. They are really soft on the skin as well.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Not very easy to clean...but they work great.</li>
    <li> Love these already! A little stiffer than beauty blender, but still work really great! Especially like the flat one for contouring.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I&#x27;m just not up to a 16 dollar sponge when I can get 4 for two bucks less that work just as well, if not better. My favorites are the green and teal one, they work the best for me. I stipple with the flat side of the teal one, and I blend with the green. The fact that Beauty Junkees checks in with you before and after you&#x27;ve received your sponges is awesome. Will be buying these for friends.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite way to apply makeup and makes contouring super easy. Much better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Love these little soft things!!! super cute. Easy to wash. Great value!!! A must have for everyone!</li>
    <li> These are PHENOMENAL! Such a great dupe for the beauty blender</li>
    <li> I love the variety and instructions that come with this product, I will be purchasing more from this company I would recommend to any of my friends</li>
    <li> These are the best sponges I&#x27;ve ever purchased. They blend my foundation to perfection. My favorite is the purple one because I like the way it fits my hand.</li>
    <li> I was very please with my order . Liked the variety and helpful tips and uses on the back of the package. The company was also very helpful to my needs. I would gladly order beauty supplies from this company again.</li>
    <li> If purchased another brand on amazon before and it was just 100% just. Waist of time and money but these are great!! Just what I hoped they&#x27;d be. They expanded very nicely. You won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> i got 1 of those sponges at Sephora for $20, it got ruined after few times of use. These are great sponges and great value, nice variety tips</li>
    <li> I like it.  Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I didn&#x27;t feel like paying a whole lot of money for just the single beauty blender or another equally expensive brand and I&#x27;m so glad I gave these a shot! They&#x27;re all great quality and work incredibly well both wet and dry and the seller is not only prompt but very communicative. I use the pink and blue sponges the most, with the pink being for liquid foundation and concealers and the blue for contouring before I blend!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges, more affordable than the beauty blender and more ways to be used.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Super good quality and easy to clean and use.  I like the selection that comes with this pack.  I don&#x27;t wear liquid makeup often but this helps blend the concealer under my eyes very well.  Nice and even every time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a makeup junkie for 20+ years and I&#x27;ve used just about every tool to apply foundation/concealer and was never really satisfied. I finally broke down and bought a Beauty Blender sponge after reading the reviews and, although it works great, it&#x27;s quite fragile and can quickly become expensive as you have to replace it so often. I wash my BB after each use and after a week or so I started noticing little tears. I refuse to pay $20 every few weeks for a sponge, so I set out to find a comparable dupe. During my research I found Beauty Junkees. After reading all the fantastic things customers were saying, I placed my order and waited with anticipation. I received the sponges before the stated delivery estimate which was great! I always love when that happens :) These sponges were almost too pretty to use but I just had to try them out. There was a bit of a learning curve for me while switching from the BB to these sponges. They are definitely more dense than the BB which makes them more firm. However, the Beauty Junkees sponges are incredibly well-made. The quality of these sponges really is superior to anything else out there. The customer service is outstanding and I&#x27;m so happy I found these sponges and will definitely do business with Beauty Junkees again!</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than the beauty blender and they work just as well. If this is your preferred method of applying makeup I think these will be fine for you. I don&#x27;t personally find a specific need for all the different shapes but whatever works, right?</li>
    <li> The teardrop is my absolute favorite, It feels like my face was airbrushed after using with my foundation,as a makeup artist would definiently recommend this to my client</li>
    <li> Items as described, shipped fast, thank you!</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase and with the product! I hope I discovered this beauty wonder before!</li>
    <li> I just want to say that I LOVE THESE THINGS..my makeup and contouring has never looked so good ..I always get compliments when I decide to &amp;#34;beat my cheeks&amp;#34;  :-) ..I recommend this product to everyone. A MUST HAVE  in you makeup bag .. 5 stars all the way and must add the helpful cleaning tips and instructions was the icing in the cake plus the cherry .. Very satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Love these. I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands but I don&#x27;t see how they can be better. And their customer service is beyond compare!</li>
    <li> A little stiffer than I thought, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Easy to use and easy to clean and maintain.  The various shapes help blending easier.</li>
    <li> I order the four pack of pro makeup sponge blender set to replace my old makeup sponge. I have only used the pink one so far, it work fine. They arrived to my surprise the next day after ordering them. The sponge I was using came in a two pack but I forgot the brand so I ordered this one to try it out. Both brands worked well and these are more inexpensive if you use all four of them. The company is very customer oriented they phoned to make sure the sponges came in time and if I was happy with them. A+ for customer service!</li>
    <li> I have a combination of oily / dry skin... and lots of little things to &amp;#34;cover up&amp;#34; - for years (yes, YEARS!) I have struggled to find a product that would give me the coverage I wanted, without making my foundation looking cakey. ...In comes these little miracle workers! They are easy (and even FUN) to use (I say fun because applying foundation is no longer frustrating anymore!). And, they leave my skin looking soft, smooth and even airbrushed! I have seen these types of sponges used in makeup tutorials, but figured they were the same as any other foundation sponge (or brush) and never really thought twice about them - but, after FINALLY purchasing them, I understand why they are EVERYWHERE. They have quickly made their way into my daily makeup routine - and have forever found a home there. I love them, I love them, I love them. And cant say enough about them! They are simply wonderful products! :)</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and the sponges are so vibrant and great quality. Thank you for the tips on how to use them :) I&#x27;m so excited to try them! Update***I love these sponges! Yes I&#x27;ve used the beauty blender and it was great but somewhat pricey so I used other dopes and they were good as well but by far these sponges are great. My favorite is the blue sculptor. I love how it applies my foundation and concealer. My makeup looks flawless just as the beauty blender without hurting my wallet....The quality of the sponge is great not too soft or hard just right and the colors are great! Will I repurchase? Of course!!! For the awesome low price and it brings 4 sponges? Count me in. Fabulous sponges vs. 1 overpriced beauty blender? Pretty obvious choice :) plus great customer service :) win win!</li>
    <li> Love&lt;br /&gt;Love love!!!!! Amazing sponges for a quarter of the price of the name brand ones!!! This is a must buy!!!!!! Helps make skin flawless!!!!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to try this! I&#x27;ve been using the Beauty Blender for about a year and sadly, these sponges don&#x27;t compare. I should have spent a couple extra bucks to get the beauty blender, but these were rated so high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges really soak up A LOT of makeup. I feel like the money I &amp;#34;saved&amp;#34; buying these sponges is money wasted in foundation usage! Just don&#x27;t do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage isn&#x27;t as great. Again, I feel like it soaks up the makeup. I need to stipple and apply over and over again to just get the right coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For thise who did have the Beauty Blender before, keep the container! It&#x27;s a good way to dry these sponges ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is CHEAP. It already starting to deteriorate and rip apart after a couple uses. So disappointing! My beauty blender lasted MONTHS whereas this lasted a few days. I cleaned following their recommended steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to return these so bad, but to pay for the return shipping is not worth the fuss. Lesson learned :( Maybe I just got a bad batch with bad QA? I wish I liked them as much as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only PLUS is the purple sponge. I love the shape and it&#x27;s easier to hold.</li>
    <li> Packages arrived really quick and in great condition. Really like the sponges, they work great. Love the assorted colors and shapes!</li>
    <li> Nifty little sponges.  Seller followed up after purchase, was super friendly, and even sent me additional sponges of my choice with a really cute sticker.. all this before I even wrote the review! You also get detailed instructions on how to use each one.  Careful when cleaning not to squeeze your nails into the sponges. Also, I don&#x27;t recommend any soap to wash them with since it&#x27;s hard to rinse off.  Hot water works just fine for easy clean-up. I like to dampen them before applying CC cream so it spreads evenly for a natural finish.  All in all, a great purchase! Much higher quality than the generic looking ones you&#x27;d find in stores plus terrific customer service.</li>
    <li> I really like the green sponge which is perfect for under eye blending. The purple is good for cream blushes, the blue is great for getting a flawless look, and the pink is great for everything. I love how this company tells you to clean them with olive oil instead of trying to pressure you into buying a type of blender cleanser. Olive oil works wonderfully, and a little bit of anti bacterial soap won&#x27;t hurt. Overall these blender brushes are just as good (maybe even better)  than the beauty blender. I&#x27;m a Sephora makeup addict, and these inexpensive amazon blenders are the best I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> The price on these sponges is fantastic!  One beauty blender sponge usually costs the same amount that I paid for four of these.  Arrived quickly and worked perfectly.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the sponges. I have purchased the original beauty blender many times but I won&#x27;t need to ever again! The shipping was so fast and the packaging was fantastic. An all around fantastic product! So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot more dense than the Beauty Blender, so it&#x27;s harder to clean and squeeze out the water. But it still works pretty nicely in terms of blending foundation and not soaking up too much product. It&#x27;s a good price for the purpose, since these makeup sponges need to be replaced every few months.</li>
    <li> I really love these sponges! they are not exactly like the beauty blender(which i love) but they are very comparable and way cheaper!! They are more dense and need a bit more squeezing to get started but after that they are amazing! and because they are denser i feel they will last longer!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing these agaiN!</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price and exactly what was advertised!  I would definitely order again and refer to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the blender sponge every day and it works great I love the way it blends in my concealer!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these! I can&#x27;t believe I waited to so long to jump on the makeup sponge train! I get a very airbrushed look with my foundation and even with my creme blush which is super hard to blend usually. I love the variety and find a different use for each of them, but primarily use the purple and pink for foundation. So far, they seem to hold up very well and much more reasonable than others I looked at. Beauty Junkees has awesome customer service and support, so I felt confident buying their product.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! The packaging is great and they came quickly, they didn&#x27;t have a bad smell at all and awesome directions on how to use each of them. I really like these and plan on buying more!</li>
    <li> Great value, great product!  Would recommend these sponges to everyone!</li>
    <li> For one thing, the company is great. The sponges shipped really quickly, and they are great quality. The sponges are a great alternative to more expensive ones. When mine need to be replaced, I&#x27;ll be coming back!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative for beautyblender sponges because I wasn&#x27;t prepared to spend $20 for 1 sponge, when I stumble over these sponges on amazon. I noticed the great reviews they get and decided why not. I must say that I&#x27;m blown away at how good these are for the price. I&#x27;m for sure will re order these. Thanks beautyjunkees</li>
    <li> These are amazing quality. I use them every morning and I have no complaints. My makeup looks perfect and well blended. I will definitely be ordering more from this company! Such an amazing price for the quality.</li>
    <li> I just received these last week and I LOVE them! As of now I have only used the purple and pink one but I am really happy with them. They are just as pictured above and such cute colors.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for not only extremely fast shipping, but a product I didn&#x27;t know I needed and will never go without again!!! These sponges make applying makeup so much easier and they make it took like I have no makeup on! I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone 30years without these!!! Thanks so much!!! Love love love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product the quality is really good, great price too.</li>
    <li> Okay so I decided to buy these because I&#x27;m going back to school and wanted new makeup tools to blend out my foundation. I had the original beauty blender a while ago and I loved it. I wanted a beauty blender again but really didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 something for the sponge(though it is indeed worth it) I came across these and with so many positive reviews I decided to try them. First thing first the shipping was AMAZING! Seriously I got them in like 3 days. Second the price. I got 4 sponges for less than $20! Can&#x27;t get a better deal than that. Now the only reason why I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is though they did blend out my make up better than my brush I did have to use a little bit more makeup. The sponge soaked some of the product. The second thing that was a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; was that they weren&#x27;t super soft. Firm would be the word for them. Unlike the original beauty blender these aren&#x27;t as squishy and are pretty sturdy. And I mean sturdy. Nevertheless I did enjoy the sponges and loved the look I got with them. So if you&#x27;re looking for a sponge like the beauty blender I&#x27;d say these are a good alternative. BLENDS BEAUTIFULLY &amp; it&#x27;s a great price. Only thing is the firmness but it&#x27;s not that big a deal for me at least.</li>
    <li> Great sponges, a little more firm and larger than the beauty blender but i personally prefer it and it blends just as flawlessly for more product and half the price of the beaut blender!</li>
    <li> Great product; excellent customer service. Will definetly use this seller again; would recommend without hesitation!</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing! I&#x27;ve had them for a little over a month now and I have yet to reach for my brushes for application. These sponges make my makeup look flawless and natural. Great customer service too! They even sent me an email afterwards with a tutorial. I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> The makeup sponges were everything I expected. I absolutely love the finished look. The tutorial that came with the packaging is wonderful. I looked and felt like a pro after my 2nd time using the product.</li>
    <li> Received sponges quickly. Good quality. I am still learning how to use them properly.  Beauty Junkies sent an email with tops and pointers. Hoping I love the sponges because the seller is great.</li>
    <li> Perfect for blending. I mainly use the Pink one, and love it! I&#x27;m excited to try out the blue on for cream contouring! Great value!!</li>
    <li> The sponges work great in applying flawless makeup coverage. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great quality, Fast shipping...</li>
    <li> Decent sponges for a great price.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges and im really greatful for the different shapes!  The icing on the cake was the beauty industry tip on how to clean them (with the olive oil). Ive already paid that tip forward and referred your product to my&lt;br /&gt;daughter-in-love when she saw mine in person.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges, especially the blue one, as it provides a more full coverage look, which is what I prefer. And the instructional email was extremely helpful!</li>
    <li> I will never go back to using brushes for foundation again; these provide a much better look(if you get them wet first). I also use them for concealer and it blends so much h better and looks way more natural while still concealing effectively; highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Although I am in my 40s I am new to makeup. So when I heard about these sponges I was intrigued because of all the great reviews. ..boy am I happy I sent for them! I am wearing foundation and concealer now, something I never did before and the application process is so easy and flawless with these. Your skin feels natural , not cake-y and you can choose what side of each sponge to use. There is no smell as was said in prior reviews and they can be cleaned and dried.  They also look so colorful and cute! I love them.</li>
    <li> Awesome sponges! Blends makeup and durable</li>
    <li> Did not care for these at all. Very dense and just smears makeup around. Spend a little extra and but the real thing...</li>
    <li> I got the 3 pack of pink sponges.  Very high quality and useful for foundation, concealer, and cream blush.  I expected the sponges to be a little softer, but they still work great.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> I really love my pink teardrop makeup sponge!</li>
    <li> I got the sampler sponges to try and find a dupe for my beauty blender. When I got them in I noticed right away that the pink tear drop one was not like it at all. It wasn&#x27;t as soft and bouncy which is one thing I love about my beauty blender,but after some use and trying them all out they are very good sponges.  Are they a 100% dupe for the beauty blender,  no they are not, but with that being said they are pretty good quality for the price you are paying. If you are looking for something close to texture of beauty blender I would say the green one was the closest. I use the pink tear drop for my liquid foundation, the green one for concealer, the purple one for cream highlight and contour,  and the blue for powder. I really like them great buy.</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal! I had never used a sponge to apply foundation before and now I&#x27;ll never go back. The application instructions and cleaning instructions are well written and easy to follow. The sponges come in a medium sized resealable plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;I put my makeup on the back of my hand and dab the beauty sponge in the makeup, then I apply it to my face. The coverage is far better than if you only use your fingers. I use the pear shaped sponge and I gave the teardrop shape to my mom and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great for the amount of sponges you receive. I will be coming back for return orders.&lt;br /&gt;Great job Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I had never used a beauty blender sponge before and I absolutely love the application—perfect coverage.  I will definitely be ordering again.  Because you get the variety of shapes, you can find specific uses for all.  My favorite is the green—perfect for blending everywhere on the face.  Really appreciate the value (getting 4 for basically the price of 1) and the quality is great!</li>
    <li> So soft and squishy. I love them.</li>
    <li> I am loving my new sponges! I gave one as a gift and kept one set for myself.  Very easy to use and also to keep clean.  I look forward to using them every day.</li>
    <li> Does use up more product but I applied the same bb I had been using for a year and noticed quite the difference over finger application.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good quality and great for liquid foundation. It makes makeup application quicker and easier than when using a brush. I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a marvelous beauty tool, then look no further. Great shapes, great sizes...all at a fantastic price. Also, very fast shipping and all in all, a great buy.</li>
    <li> I buy these all the time from different manufacturers and these are the best for the $. May not need every size included unless you are a MUA but still worth it and I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these applicators.  Very easy to use and reduces gives such a smooth, polished, airbrushed look.  I find that my makeup looks more natural and that it uses way less makeup than a traditional sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative for me is I find them difficult to clean but I have enough to use throughout the week so that I only need to clean them once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a must buy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to get a Beauty Blender after trying one in a store.  However, I just could not bring myself to spend $20+ on one makeup sponge that I was going to have to replace in a couple months.  So I decided to check Amazon, where I found Beauty Junkees&#x27; four sponges for $15.  Now that sounded like it was worth trying.  I&#x27;ve only used the purple pear and the pink teardrop so far, but I love them.  They feel just like the Beauty Blender, but for a way better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciated the email from them explaining how to properly use each sponge.  Then a follow up email from them offered a free sponge!  Heck yes!  They blend your foundation so well, and the various pointed tips make it easy to get around your nose, under your eyes, etc.  And since you make the sponge damp before applying your foundation, they really don&#x27;t soak up very much of your makeup at all - which was a big worry for me - I didn&#x27;t want to waste half of my nice foundation by having the sponge soak it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these sponges over and over, as long as they are available!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with these brushes as soon as they came in the mail. Easy to use and provided great coverage. Worked great with bb cream foundations.</li>
    <li> I usually buy makeup sponges like this at Marshall&#x27;s or TJ Maxx, but lately I haven&#x27;t been able to find them. So I decided to purchase these, and I am so glad I did. The sponges I&#x27;ve bought in stores are $5 per sponge; buying these on Amazon was more cost-effective because it was like getting one sponge free. Did I mention the superb customer service? I didn&#x27;t? Well, let me tell you. When was the last time an Amazon seller sent you several emails to ensure that you received their product and were satisfied with your purchase? For me the answer is NEVER. That is true professionalism. I will continue to buy these from Beauty Junkees from now on!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your superior customer service Beauty Junkees! I&#x27;M OBSESSED WITH MY SPONGES!!!!! Love my blue sponge for all my creams and daily moisturizing, and the pink teardrop one is perfect for my concealer. I love the way it feels when putting stuff on my face now, it just feels lighter and healthier - instead of my grimy gross hands piling layers of stuff on. Thank you for the email with a description on each sponge and its uses, I really appreciated that and found it quite useful.</li>
    <li> After seeing the one at Sephora for $20 I&#x27;m so glad I got these. They work very well! I typically only use the big one right now but if I ever do any contouring I will try the smaller ones.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a airbrushed look when applying my makeup and came across this product and decided to give it a try. I love these blenders easy application and cleaning...will order more when the time comes. And what I also loved that the reps from Beauty Junkees emailed me to make sure that I received my items in a timely manner. Great product....great sellers.</li>
    <li> Wow! These lil sponges are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used all of the sponges yet.  Have used the pink and I love the look.  Used it with mineral powder makeup and had a really beautiful look.  Smooth and blended look.  Very pleased.  Glad I tried them.</li>
    <li> Works flawlessly. These face foams are so unbelievably soft. Great for applying foundation from the bigger areas on your cheeks, forehead, to the smallest details around the eyes. What you do is soak it with water and then squeeze it gently to have most of the water come out of it. It will puff up a bit and they are ready to use. Great for applying BB cream. Create even spread that is hard to replicate with your fingers or other applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also great in removing shiny spots on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four shapes suitable for different areas on your face. Warning: Shapes and colors make it look so delectable - and can be mistakes as Peeps! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying trying out these sponges. I&#x27;ve used them for about a week and here is what I have found. When wet, you get a very sheer coverage with a beautiful, smooth finish. I really like the finish I&#x27;m getting with these sponges. To get the coverage I typically get when applying with a foundation brush, I need to use the sponge dry and I have to use slightly more product. I&#x27;m ok with that as I don&#x27;t care for the streaking so that you sometimes get with a brush. So far I like the pink and purple sponges best.  The purple is easiest to hold and manipulate for me. The flat, turquoise one ended up leaving lines if I wasn&#x27;t super careful. I think that is impossible to do with the other two. I have not tried the green one yet. I recommended these to my daughter who prefers a sheerest coverage. I have used MAC brushes to apply foundation for many years but I may just be converted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how these work for applying concealer and blending it to perfection. It&#x27;s easiest to use pot concealer but if you don&#x27;t have spot, just apply with your finger and then blend with the sponge.  I do that with the foundation also.</li>
    <li> This is an update to my review placed shortly after receiving the sponges on 02/26/15  I have now had the opportunity to use all four sponges a couple of times, and I thoroughly enjoy them.  They are soft and give a lovely finish to liquid or cream foundations/BB creams/CC creams and concealers.They come with instructions for cleaning them, which I found quite helpful.  As an added bonus, Beauty Junkees sent me an email offering me a free sponge.  They asked that I post a review, which I had done prior to receiving their email, so I pointed them to it.  And today I got my free sponge.  That was a lovely perk, and a great customer relations move!  Thank you, Beauty Junkees.  I received these on 02/26/15 and have used only one once.  I was very happy with the packaging and the promptness of arrival.  I used the lime green sponge -- dampened -- to apply my foundation and concealer, and I was very happy with the finish it gave.  The sponge was very soft.  My foundation and concealer were both very smooth and looked seamless and very natural.  Two thumbs up!  I have never used the famous original Beauty Blender sponge, so I can&#x27;t compare these to that.  But based on my limited experience with these and the excellent price, I&#x27;m quite happy with them.</li>
    <li> bought by my hubby for me thesw work really well. I have the original beauty blender and i really cant tell a difference in how they work. now I&#x27;ve gotta say, the li&#x27; green one i really don&#x27;t use. Te pink and the blue however, those i put to work. Very good back ups.</li>
    <li> So far, I have only used the pink sponge. It doesn&#x27;t absorb your foundation too much and product goes on like butter.</li>
    <li> Love my sponge! Works like a charm. My makeup looks flawless. Thanks to the company for sharing great cleaning tips, too!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! I have perfected contouring with these. GREAT investment for such a great price. I clean mine with Zote soap and after about 10 good squeezes, their like brand new.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! They are really dense, just feel horrible. When you use them dry or wet it just feels like you&#x27;re hitting your face with a piece of rubber. If you&#x27;re looking for a beauty blender dupe I would go for the real techniques sponge, it&#x27;s soft and applies makeup flawlessly, only $6. I found mine at khols, they sell them at ulta and online as well.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described,  love them, will never use another brand again!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the sponges! They are very easy to use and ergonomic. Also, Beauty Junkees has great customer service; they really want the customer to be educated and 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Blended my makeup amazingly. Works exactly like the original beauty blenders, but for a better price! Love them.</li>
    <li> Love these!! Wish I would&#x27;ve purchased them sooner! My new favorite go to!</li>
    <li> I bought these hoping to find a dupe for my beauty blender, at half the cost. I&#x27;m so glad that I did! The quality is great and the purple sponge is dead on as far as the texture and softness goes. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the blue or green sponges yet, but the pink sponge is great too. The pink sponge is a little harder, but still great. Definitely a great value for the set!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  They didn&#x27;t cost much at all and these sponges blend my concealer VERY well wit minimum effort. What&#x27;s more is that the service from this supplier is even better than the product. They follow up with their customers with detailed emails - they also give tips on the best ways to use and clean the products. This is key for a person like me who&#x27;s fairly new to using these types of sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be a returning customer.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, EVEN MORE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t start wearing makeup until a few years ago and I always thought that whatever came with the powder i was using, that was all I needed. Then I developed cystic acne and had to be really careful about what I put on my face. I&#x27;ve always bought cheap brushes from Target that leave me with a face full of the bristle hairs from the brush; then I started watching YouTube videos on how to apply foundation. I saw a video of this beauty sponge &amp; there was no way I was going to pay $20 for a sponge at Sephora when I could use my target brushes. Frustrated, one day I started shopping around - and being an Amazon rookie and not knowing to look here - I searched around &amp; found 4 sponges for $14.99. I ordered them without hesitation and I&#x27;m bummed I spent so long using brushes - they&#x27;re not my thing. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if you know how to apply makeup &amp; know how to use brushes, all the power to ya. But if you&#x27;re like me and not trying to put on a show for the world everyday, but rather cover up your insecurities, these little guys will do it and they&#x27;ll do it in a way that a brush can&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t do for me.</li>
    <li> THESE MAKEUP SPONGES ARE AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this make up sponge thing. I tried Real Techniques first and liked it but accidentally tore the sponge while cleaning it within the first week. There goes 6 bucks down the drain. I searched Amazon and found these. They received pretty good reviews and were way more affordable. I purchased the purple one. I love that it is more dense because it feels more durable. After one week, I&#x27;m sold. I get a nice natural look with my foundation. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great sponges! Tried a cheapo one and it soaked up the makeup, these don&#x27;t do that! It&#x27;s a great deal and getting instructions from the seller is really nice. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. Read about them in a magazine and now I understand why people like them so much! Easy to use and they work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with the quality of these sponges. My favorite has to be the purple! It has just the right density. The pink, is more dense, so I like to use it wet. After using the blue one, I noticed a small tear. I contact the sellers about my concern and they were quick to respond and they sent me another. Overall, I am very pleased and would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> At first day I was surprised, lovely sponges so soft. By the third day of use one of them start to fell appart. I comunicated to the seller and inmediatelly sent me not one but two sponges in replacement! Great service, and still love the sponges☺️</li>
    <li> First time using sponges to apply makeup and these were great.  They really make a difference in application-ease and coverage results.  Love these.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and items are very good quality. They provide instructions on how to use the sponges, and how to clean them. Very good customer service.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever used a Beauty Blender, always been one to apply liquid foundation with a brush. I must admit its going to take some time to get use to (knowing which sponge to use &amp; how much liquid I have to put on the sponge) but I think it will workout good. I received the Beauty Blender today and already received an email from the seller on tips for using them as well as there contact information if I have any questions. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever received an email from a seller that doesn&#x27;t state please &amp;#34;rate us&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m pleasantly happy with my purchase and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve given it some time and at this moment I would not recommend. Although there super cute and the seller was amazing it doesn&#x27;t out way the fact that every time I use them it appears there is no blend. I&#x27;ve tried all sponges wet and dry and still receiving the same affect. I like to wear makeup that is natural looking and these sponges don&#x27;t help in that perspective.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every beauty sponge and brush out there and none compare to these.  They are extra soft, very easy to clean, and come in four different shapes (and colors which is pretty cool too)to apply make-up at any angle. With these I have been able to achieve a professional flawless look in my own home, and definitely at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged, arrived quickly, great quality! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and especially to clean. Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I love them, worth the money definitely!</li>
    <li> Wonderful sponges. I highly recommend these and will be buying all of them. Makes makeup application easy and flawless.</li>
    <li> Its the professional way to do all the tricks of the trade from your bedroom mirror.</li>
    <li> As a lover of the beautyblender, there is no comparison in quality! One sponge ripped after a few uses. You get what you pay for!!</li>
    <li> I love the the different shapes and how it&#x27;s non allergenic. Great......</li>
    <li> I have the more expensive version and these work just as well.  I love the different shapes.  Makes it easy to get into the crevices and fill in around eyes.  Buy these instead of the original.</li>
    <li> purchased these to try. They worked good but I do not like using these for application of my makeup., Will keep for my daughter to use.</li>
    <li> Have been using them for over two weeks and I&#x27;m AMAZED. Any type of makeup, liquid/pan/powder goes on seamlessly! I never used blenders before and I would always struggle with makeup settling in my pores and wrinkles. These buff over everything and create a smooth finish. I&#x27;ve started using the blue one dry to apply finishing powder and it works like a charm. They dry quick, easy to clean and haven&#x27;t torn or become damaged at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Beauty Blenders, the official ones, before as well as the drug store knock offs and found they perform equally as good. I bought this pack because it had shapes not readily available at the drug store and were cheaper than both the official product and the generic versions. I found that these stack up just as well! The green is my favorite, I love that it combines the practical use of a large blender with the mini blender side for concealing tighter areas like the nose and eyes. They are durable and easy to clean. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I LOVE them. Why pay $22 for one whend you can get 4 that work PERFECT for cheaper! I ordered for the blue sponge but fell in love with all of them. I use them for both liquid and powder foundation and my face is BEAT. Lol I would definitely recommend. Actually my mom wants me to order her a set because of how well they work.</li>
    <li> Very quick service and great customer service from Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and I could not believe the delivery time withing which I recieved my item. I began to use the items a day later super excited and to my surprise it performed extremely well. I am no makeup expert but it applied my foundation and banana powder flawlessly. I will definitely be ordering some more items from this supplier.</li>
    <li> The sponges work really well and are as described. The tips that were provided describing the purpose of the different colored sponges was very helpful.</li>
    <li> It came right on time, and it is all I have been using on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I always had issues using brushes, and it could be that I am using them incorrectly so, I decided to purchase these instead. These beauty blender sponges are easier to use and I love how it sets my make up. I think I&#x27;m sticking to these beauties!</li>
    <li> Great product!! I did a lot of research before purchasing this blender and boy am I a happy camper!! They work just as well as the more expensive version. I refuse to buy any more products for name sake.. I&#x27;m not paying more for something because of the name on the label!! This is by far the best blenders out there, and you get 4 for the price.</li>
    <li> Great sponges, great price.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous when I bought these not knowing how they would work. But omg! There amazing I use less make up now and it goes on so smooth and does not look cakey at all. Great product. Also great for putting cream blush on!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a beauty blender, and really wanted to take part in this beauty fade without spending $20-$25 on a sponge. After reading reviews I came across the Beauty Junkees version of a beauty blender and couldn&#x27;t pass up the offer. I liked how affordable these sponges are, and they definitely do a better job of blending my foundation in comparison to my foundation brush. The only issue I have is that my foundation remains in the sponge even after I&#x27;ve cleaned it, and there seems to be a lot of excess water making it difficult to dry. Overall though I&#x27;m still learning how to use my sponges, but will definitely be adding this to my daily makeup routine</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these makeup sponges! I use the blue one the most I love the flat top so you can pat your whole face after you applied your foundation for a flawless finish! They also work great to fix little makeup mistakes &amp; they are very easy to clean and keep up with. Every beauty guru needs these!!</li>
    <li> this is the best sponges ever. Way better than the beauty blender. I was skeptical first but after using it, I was amazed about the softness and durability.  I will not buy the beauty blender again. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used the pink teardrop sponge and I LOVE it! It does what it said and helps not cake on my concealer! I love that it&#x27;s super soft even when wet and so far has been easy to keep clean. I&#x27;m excited to try the others that came in the package as well bc I&#x27;m sure they are going to be just as great as the teardrop one. Also looking forward to trying them on the whole face instead of my brushes. Also the customer service is so GREAT and Helpful with the emails they send out! Don&#x27;t hesitate try them out for yourself!  Thank you beauty junkees!</li>
    <li> okay I only leave a review when I am  extremely satisfied or extremely disappointed,  first of all shipping was amazingly fast, it took  2 days to get to me. secondly the sponges actually are a great quality.They are not  the exact material or application of the BB but damn close and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I appreciate the instructional e-mail that the Seller sent. I appreciate the packaging. I appreciate the great quality. definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great foundation blending sponges. Same quality as the name brand BB without the outrageous price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big time make up lady but these sponges had great reviews. So far I&#x27;ve only used the pink one and I love it. I only use make up under my eyes. This sponge blends everything really well. Can&#x27;t wait to use the rest. It&#x27;s fall in Wisconsin, I&#x27;ll have to wait until winter to use the rest. Retired and love being outside:)</li>
    <li> These sponge are wonderful! I ordered them on a Sunday night and received them at 7:15am the following Tuesday. SO FAST! I was happy about that because I was dying to try them. I&#x27;d heard great things about the Beauty Blender, but like many others was hesitant about the purchase price and the fact that I don&#x27;t use liquid foundation so I didn&#x27;t know if it would be worth it. Plus, I use multiple products and didn&#x27;t want to add running back and forth from the bathroom to rinse one off in between products. These sponges had the best and most reviews of any on Amazon and I thought the price was more than reasonable for 4. As soon as I got them I did my makeup right away so I could try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They weren&#x27;t what I expected when I wet them, they were damp but not as wet as I thought they would feel. This was good because I planned on trying them with powder and mineral makeup based on some YouTube tutorials I watched. First I used the blue one with the flat side to put on my bb cream (Benefit Big Easy). I only put that in the places I get oily which is my T-Zone, the tops of my cheek/undereye and chin. It worked great for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the purple for my mineral makeup. Initially it didn&#x27;t seem to grab much of the makeup but I remembered that the purpose of these sponges is for more even application so to get more coverage I had to stipple a little more, which was fine because I got great coverage that looked absolutely natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the green for contouring and highlighting, the smaller end for blending bronzer in the hollows of my cheeks and the larger side for highlighter under my eyes. BLENDED BEAUTIFULLY! I don&#x27;t think I have ever put bronzer on and not wiped it off because it was too much, too high up/ down low, not even etc. This was foolproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the pink teardrop for dabbing blush on the apples of my cheeks up to my temples. It was light, but buildable and again blended into everything. When I finished all my makeup (without using any brushes), I put all my face brushes away. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need them again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these makeup blenders!!!</li>
    <li> I really like these sponges.  I have tried all the shapes.  The blue one is the most unique and has done great for blending out my contouring.  They are all wonderful to use.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the pink one had some small tears in it, it still works okay, but they have gotten bigger after a few uses, but not a really big deal with the other blenders to use.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! They are very easy to use. I use the sponges on an everyday basis. They apply the product evenly without absorbing too much. They leave a flawless finish, and are very soft on the face. They are money well spent.</li>
    <li> After trying other &amp;#34;imitation&amp;#34; blending sponges, I have to say that these are very good.  They apply makeup well.  They are reusable and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> ❤❤❤❤ Love the Beauty Blender sponges! ! The fact that you get 4 in different shapes makes getting every part of your face so easy. I use them for everything from a moisturizer to foundation.  Perfect for powder to blot away any shine.  Easy to clean and maintain with all the tips from Beauty Junkees!! They are the best!</li>
    <li> Great sponges and easy to clean!!! Almost close to the beauty blender : ).</li>
    <li> No good. Pretty sure most reviews here have to be fake. Wayyyyyyyy too dense to use, even when damp, which is how it&#x27;s meant to be used. Wipes the makeup right off your face instead of blending it in, and i&#x27;m not even using a wiping motion. Just go for the beauty blender or the real techniques miracle complexion sponge. These even bounce when you drop them.</li>
    <li> Awesome company! I loved the email they sent with instructions to help you use each one! The sponges are great. So many uses I love the green one it&#x27;s awesome for my under eye concealer. I like the blue for full coverage! Happy I got these.</li>
    <li> Got them in today and like love them.  Blends amazingly. I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Sponges work very well with liquid makeup. Good quality and great direction how to use them from the seller.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. I&#x27;ve used my finger to apply base for years and decided to try these sponges to see if they would be faster. Not only was it much quicker... I never thought my same base could look so flawless. Love love love these sponges</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> I received this set of sponges for a Christmas gift- I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with their performance. I&#x27;ve tried other off brand &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; type sponges... nothing has come quite as close as these ones. I would say just as good as the &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; or maybe better.</li>
    <li> these are great sponges.  We used them to apply costume make up for halloween (we had a lot of make up to apply) and they were great!  Easy to clean and re use.  Great Product</li>
    <li> Very, very nice set!  Bought to use as stocking stuffers and kept 1 for myself.  Pretty colors, larger size is easier to hold and they work just as advertised-smooth on foundation without wasting it.  Love them.&lt;br /&gt;Toni</li>
    <li> I have used these several times and love them!  They are super easy to use and give my skin a flawless look I&#x27;ve never even come close to before!  Very impressive--I had no idea a sponge could make so much difference!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter who loves them and their ability to blend make-up seamlessly.</li>
    <li> Yeah they are a lot more dense the beauty blender but it gives me the exact same affect on my skin as the beauty blender. All in all love it great quality for great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist, but I would consider myself a makeup enthusiast. First and foremost, I would like to state that I own several beauty blenders and I don&#x27;t necessarily think that these would be dupes for the BB. I actually ordered this particular set since it received such great reviews on amazon, but I was pretty disappointed when I tested out the sponges for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink teardrop sponge seems that it would be a dupe for the BB (especially the shape and similar pink color), but I found it incredibly dense and difficult to work with. I&#x27;m not really used to working with such a hard sponge, so it was uncomfortable to use. What&#x27;s even more upsetting is that it even started tearing when I cleaned it a second time.&lt;br /&gt;The purple pear sponge is not as dense as the pink teardrop sponge, but it is a dense sponge as well. I would say it was less uncomfortable than the pink teardrop so I guess that&#x27;s a plus?&lt;br /&gt;I liked the green spade sponge, it was way softer than the previous two, and it&#x27;s dual ended points made it easy to apply makeup along my nose and under eye area.&lt;br /&gt;The blue sculptor sponge would definitely be the softest of the four sponges. It&#x27;s flat edges was quite unique to work with. While I was really happy with this particular sponge, I was disappointed to find that it also started tearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say the sponge set lies in between hit or miss, some of them were hits, others were misses. While the price was great for a set of 4, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that the sponges are BB quality. I may consider getting the spade or the sculptor, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with my BB for now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the purple one so far, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use and produces a nice finish. Very soft to the touch, and doesn&#x27;t absorb a lot of the product. I definitely recommend these sponges if you plan on using it for liquid products, not so much powder base products (maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right, but didn&#x27;t work so well with me when I used it with mineral foundation). Cleaning is also pretty simple!</li>
    <li> Came in really fast and are my new favorite thing! Super easy to use and Beauty Junkees is so helpful by sending detailed email instructions on how to use and care for my sponges.</li>
    <li> Perfect for all application needs...good quality, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> these are just as good as the beauty blender brand and have a few different kind of shapes to really get into the &#x27;nooks and crannies&#x27;.  I do mainly use the standard shaped one though.</li>
    <li> I have never used the actual Beauty Blender, but I love these sponges. They do an excellent job of blending my foundation, powder and blush into a flawless finish. They are also easy to clean and reuse daily as opposed to makeup brushes. In addition, Beauty Junkees has been so thoughtful and helpful in giving me tips of how to use each sponge and in answering any questions I might have. I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I have never used the original beauty blender so my review cannot be a comparison of the two, however, I was surprised with the quality of these sponges. They are a great absorbant material, super soft, and blend beautifully. I have been using the pink teardrop sponge and find it extremely easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using an Antibacterial soap/cleanser rather than just baby shampoo or a soap that is non-antibacterial when cleaning in order to remove any bacteria living inside your sponge and air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was very cute and even came with instructions for each sponge and what areas they&#x27;re best for. They also sent an email with instructions as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their service is great and sponges are great quality and the price...for 4 sponges! Amazing. I will always buy and suggest these over any beauty blender.</li>
    <li> Excellent sponges! Provide seamless, all-around coverage. Very easy to use too.</li>
    <li> Great pproduct. Blends very well.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a great fan of makeup sponges since I got one from CVS and it was falling apart but I decided to give them a chance since they had great reviews on Amazon and it was a huge surprise. They work great with primers, foundation or contouring. I use the blue one to apply primers or foundation since it covers a larger area. The pink one is great for blending after contouring. I haven&#x27;t used the purple or the green one yet but I will update my review after I have used them.</li>
    <li> I am now a believer in sponges. I have heard so many praises about the sponges and never tried them until I started using concealer. This is one of the best tools you can have in your make-up bag!</li>
    <li> Not good as beauty blender</li>
    <li> I have used more expensive and supposedly higher grade sponges and I love this so much more! Not only are they decently priced, but they work just as well as the other sponges I have used. Plus, you can get the variety pack like I did and get the best of all worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order came quickly and was well packaged and the company is very professional and nice to work with.</li>
    <li> I really like these sponges, they work wonderful. They help me get a smooth even tone with my makeup and I noticed my makeup tends to stay on longer with a smoother feel.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I have bought BB dupes before, but these are *AMAZING*  They truly do get bigger and softer when wet.  These applied and blended my foundation beautifully.  Nice packaging, which says what each shape was designed for.  HIGHLY recommend!!!!  Will repurchase for sure.</li>
    <li> They are beautiful and they really do swell up nice when you put water and squeeze it out... The blue one really smoothed out the makeup... I&#x27;m in love with these</li>
    <li> I have only used one sponge so far. It has really helped cut down on how much make-up I use and the amount of time I spend putting it on. I would recommend the company include the same instruction sheet that is online so you know what sponge is recommended for what as I was new to sponges, but I did print off the online one. I definately recommend!</li>
    <li> Love these! Exactly what I was looking for, and easier to clean than I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a beauty blender, but can&#x27;t afford the real beauty blender...I promise that this one won&#x27;t disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;If I may say I think it is even better than the real beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great high quality. Trust me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation all year round, only when I have quarterly trips to London for work. When I do wear foundation, I noticed when I use my fingers to dab, the foundation will cake up later-after approx 6 hours. Since watching YouTube channels and following certain makeup artists- I found that using these sponges work absolutely wonderful. I am doing a lot of stipling and dabbing nowadays. I prefer green and pink, but the pink is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; sponge as it tends to sneak into the crevaces of my face...the sponges are not cheap material - well made and quite solid. The various colors help you identify quickly which to use for which parts of the face. Easy to clean and overall a great tool to add to my make up closet!</li>
    <li> These sponges are awesome, recommend them to anyone who loves makeup...they work great with everything..</li>
    <li> The don&#x27;t really help the makeup absorb into the skin.  They don&#x27;t feel similar to a Beauty Blender, which I kind of expected.</li>
    <li> THIS is what my makeup routine has been missing! I&#x27;ve been having trouble lately finding an everyday face routine to work for me. I was convinced  it must be the products I was using, and I was going though so many brands. It wasn&#x27;t the products, but how I was applying them. I tried both fingers and brushes, and it wasn&#x27;t working. Turns out this was all I needed to get flawless looking coverage. Before you waste money on new foundation or concealer, TRY THESE!</li>
    <li> they are all too big and fat to do a good job blending in small areas.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price. Works just as well as those name brand expensive blenders.</li>
    <li> Received items FAST.  Didn&#x27;t realize how versatile all the different shapes would be.  They are a little bit firmer than beauty blender dry but soften up nicely and bounce perfectly off the skin for flawless foundation application.  So great to have a reliable alternative that is NOT a rip off like beauty blender.  Also liked the suggestions on how to use each sponge. Will buy again when it&#x27;s time 😀</li>
    <li> I usually prefer brushes but when it comes to blending concealer or highlighter, beauty sponges are the best!&lt;br /&gt;For the latter, I definitely recommend the pink teardrop because due to its pointed tip, it allows a very precise application on the sides of the nose and the inner corner of the eyes. Also, thanks to the stippling method, it doesn&#x27;t tear these delicate areas of the face.&lt;br /&gt;The purple pear sponge is nice for novices, since its shape assures you a firm grip. It&#x27;s however less precise than the pink version. It&#x27;s more suitable for large areas and can be used for neck and cleavage.&lt;br /&gt;Both may be used interchangeably for blending seamlessly liquid to creamy foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I tried my 1st cushion foundation to finish off the look. Beauty sponges work especially well because cushion pacts are meant to be pat in, not swirled in.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, they feel so soft like suede! They are firm enough but not as dense as, say Sephora beauty egg; they aren&#x27;t as airy as their cheap copy counterparts either.&lt;br /&gt;For that price, they definitely worth it, keeping in mind these cannot be kept forever, contrary to make-up brushes. So that&#x27;s a sensible investment.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the blue and green versions yet but will write a review as soon as I got to crack them in :)</li>
    <li> I really liked this beauty blender dupe. It is affordable and it works the same as the original. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used only one out of the pack- so far I really like them. Plus, I really appreciated the email that was sent from Beauty Blender describing the proper use and care for each sponge!</li>
