    <li> I greatly recommend this product! Sometimes \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; tints aren&#x27;t really sheer and end up looking like you put Kool-Aid on your lips, but not this one!!!! It&#x27;s not lumpy or sticky either. I am really picky about what goes on my lips, but I really love this product.</li>
    <li> My Co-Worker recommended this foundation to me and I love it! It goes on smooth and easy with no clumps. It&#x27;s light and fresh feeling on my skin.

    <li> This moisturizer is simply awesome!! It goes on great, it doesn&#x27;t feel like your face is gunked up with product, and considering it&#x27;s tinted you could use it as a foundation like I do.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for mothers day and she loved it.  Im thinking of getting her more items for her birthday.</li>
    <li> One word...AMAZING! I&#x27;ve had skin problems before, and I thought \\&quot;hey I should try a moisturizer.\\&quot; I heard they are really good for your skin and this one has spf 20, so that alone was a great deal. Another great thing is that it&#x27;s tinted, so it gives me a very soft glow. I just love this product! My skin has even improved from it! I think everyone should try Urban Apothecary tinted moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect mineral foundation for full coverage of my roseashia.  This item is great because it goes on easily, covers consistently and stays on for a full work day.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love this makeup. I don&#x27;t like to wear really heavy makeup, especially when it is hot outside and this has made a great difference. I normally have clear skin,  but it has different tones to it. This helps even out my skin tone and provide the right amount of coverage that I need. I like that I can wear it at anytime and I don&#x27;t worry about it hurting my skin, since it&#x27;s made of minerals. I hate oily makeup that clogs up my pores, and this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores up at all!</li>
    <li> The Urban Apothecary Supernatural Mineral Sheer foundation is like a moisturizer. It makes your skin feel soft and smoother even after I take it off. The best thing is its oil free. I recommend this 100%.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this to me, and I love it! It&#x27;s light and it blends great. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Urban Apothecary&#x27;s tinted moisturizer has more coverage that most tinted moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried, which I love. I have very oily skin so I&#x27;m always worried that a tinted moisturizer will be too greasy or heavy for my oily skin, but not this one. This one is lightweight and oil-free. Since I don&#x27;t like wearing heavy makeup in the summer, I&#x27;ve just found my new summer foundation. Another thing that sold me on it is the SPF 20 sun protection. This is probably the best tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> When I first found this product I was skeptical, but I love the way it makes my skin feel. My skin is now flawless! A friend of mine told me about it, and I have been hooked ever since! This is the first foundation that I have used that did not make me feel like i was wearing a mask. Its very light and refreshing.With my sensitive skin this has been a life saver, because I usually have a difficult time finding makeup that doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry. So happy to have found out about this product.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! Goes on very light yet the coverage is excellent. You hardly feel like you are wearing makeup at all. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. A little goes a long way. Great product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this makeup. I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup, especially when it is hot outside and this has made a great difference. This helps even out my skin tone I like the sheer tint and the protection from the sun as well. Great product overall!</li>
    <li> The mineral tint is the perfect cover up for all of your problem areas.  I personally get acne and have under eye darkness.  If you cover up these areas with this product your problem areas disappear! This product also evens out the skin tone matching perfectly with your own.  It made my skin look healthy and radiant, what more could I ask for!</li>
