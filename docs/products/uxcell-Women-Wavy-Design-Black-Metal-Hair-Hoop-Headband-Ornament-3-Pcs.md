### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it is great just what i was searching for!</li>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>They feel great when wearing around the house or the office.  </li>
      <li>They hold in place wonderfully and don&#x27;t slip easily.  </li>
      <li>then it will be good for you</li>
      <li>Very appealing design.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since these are metal, I’ll wear them till I lose them, which I hope won’t be soon, but I will be ordering more!</li>
      <li>These head bands are really cool and very stylish!  </li>
      <li>it is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable headband.</li>
      <li>I think these are cute in my hair</li>
      <li>I was a bit reluctant to try these based on some of the reviews, however, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, headbands cost more in the store</li>
      <li>Love the wavy look on my hair, but the set of 3 are snug and hurt my head by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>i have long hair (men) and this is perfect when i work or when i wash my face.</li>
      <li>Which normally would be a good thing, but for something going on your head, it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>The shape of these didn&#x27;t quite fit my head, but these easily adjusted shape.</li>
      <li>I’m going to point out here, the head band is unwearable unless you bend out the ends a bit to be comfortable on YOUR head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are still well worth it as the most functional headband I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Since I’ve bent them into more of a U shape, it’s pretty comfortable.  </li>
      <li>blends right into hair, holds well and is comfortable</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t what I expected but its a good item  </li>
      <li>so it’s worth giving these a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>By far one of my better purchases.</li>
      <li>I know I can’t use the headbands that have the elastic underneath, they just slide right out.  </li>
      <li>The design had potential to be super cute, but they are flimsy and just don&#x27;t work right.  </li>
      <li>It makes you much more likely to get a headache (if you a prone to get them like me while wearing headbands).</li>
      <li>These metal headbands hold all my hair back; I wish they came in more colors.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>These are sturdy and hold my afro styled hair pretty well.  </li>
      <li>but as an overall i am satisfied with the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok because it is tight on my BIG head, but it can hold my fringe effectively.</li>
      <li>It does look like the picture, but this item is a much thicker metal than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Perhaps they would fit someone else as everyone&#x27;s body is different.</li>
      <li>Very snug on head, works well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a ginger with straight, long, fine hair ...</li>
      <li>Nor can I wear the plastic ones for pretty much the same reason.  </li>
      <li>When looking straight on, there are obvious gaps on either side of my head.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love these headbands as I have really thick and wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>I can put them in my hair dry (versus wet) and they stay pretty much in place as well.  </li>
      <li>so it took a little while, but it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>, so I was really surprised that these headbands actually stay on and in place.  </li>

    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected but its a good item  I recommend it if you have longer hair then it will be good for you</li>

    <li> I like that they are thin but if you have thin hair they don&#x27;t hold. I will stick with ones with teeth.</li>
    <li> These head bands are really cool and very stylish!  I would recommended them to any lady that likes nicer things.  By far one of my better purchases.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok because it is tight on my BIG head, but it can hold my fringe effectively. I guess I need to tolerate the tightness.</li>
    <li> blends right into hair, holds well and is comfortable (I forget it&#x27;s there). Perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a ginger with straight, long, fine hair ... I was a bit reluctant to try these based on some of the reviews, however, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  They feel great when wearing around the house or the office.  I don&#x27;t get the pinched, head-achy sensation behind the ears; I even wear mine under my helmet when I ride my motorcycle to work and back with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order came from overseas so it took a little while, but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> it is great just what i was searching for! shipping took some time... but as an overall i am satisfied with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> With the $1.90 price tag, and free shipping I figured I couldn’t go wrong ordering these headbands.  Keeping in mind another reviewers comment about needing to bend some of the “tips” in, I did check for this.  Bending the headband out of its packaged shape wasn’t too hard.  I’m going to point out here, the head band is unwearable unless you bend out the ends a bit to be comfortable on YOUR head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length hair, so I was really surprised that these headbands actually stay on and in place.  I can put them in my hair dry (versus wet) and they stay pretty much in place as well.  Since I’ve bent them into more of a U shape, it’s pretty comfortable.  I like the little bit of wave I get in the front as well since I’m pulling back my bangs.  I think these are cute in my hair (and they don’t bother my glasses either!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I do have long hair, I wonder if the people that don’t like these have short hair.  I know I can’t use the headbands that have the elastic underneath, they just slide right out.  Nor can I wear the plastic ones for pretty much the same reason.  Anyway, headbands cost more in the store so it’s worth giving these a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since these are metal, I’ll wear them till I lose them, which I hope won’t be soon, but I will be ordering more!</li>
