      <li>The first time I tried this shaver was wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing the difference a de-fuzzing or de-pilling makes in one&#x27;s wardrobe.</li>
      <li>Used it on over a dozen cashmere sweaters and it worked nicely to remove pilled areas.  </li>
      <li>Its just not that effective</li>
      <li>This is handy for shaving all the \\&quot;pills\\&quot; off of sweaters, socks, blankets, or whatever.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t effective at all anymore.  </li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t see any difference after using this product.</li>
      <li>Please note that the picture is deceptive in the way it looks like it stands up on its own.  </li>
      <li>This product does a fair at most job for its intention.</li>
      <li>I was shopping for a better fabric shaver and based on good reviews bought this.</li>
      <li>But, it still performs nicely.</li>
      <li>Really really does a wonderful job.</li>
      <li>keep the Fuzz-Away handy, because I use it all the time.</li>
      <li>E-Z to use and clean out holding bin, great price on AZ.</li>
      <li>Made my coats and sweaters new again, works great!</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, too.  </li>
      <li>Works best on fabrics that are supposed to be smooth and not so great on sweaters unless you use a very lite touch and be precise with areas you will work on.  </li>
      <li>This clothes shaver is the best I have used so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use &amp; took all the fuzz away from pants to sweaters!  </li>
      <li>Use very, very light pressure.</li>
      <li>Luckily I know a good Ukrainian tailor in the Salt Lake area</li>
      <li>What more could I ask for.  </li>
      <li>It really works great.  </li>
      <li>The Remington Fuzz Away Fabric Shaver was way better than I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>and now everything is nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Anyway, it works tons better than a $5 shaver I bought at a craft store once.  </li>
      <li>It works like magic.</li>
      <li>I would use it more but made the mistake of opening it in front of my kids</li>
      <li>when I think how many articles of clothes it \\&quot;saved\\&quot; from Goodwill</li>
      <li>Actually, I&#x27;m glad it stops at that point, saves the motor from burning out.  </li>
      <li>but then I decided to try a \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; and have been incredibly pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I have restored many items because of it.</li>
      <li>I love this fabric shaver.</li>
      <li>Although the more lint on the garment, the more often you will find yourself emptying the lint trap.</li>
      <li>I may be looking a while to find one in my price range.  &#x3D; )</li>
      <li>Considering that within days of purchasing this i was able to salvage 3 sweatshirts, 4 t-shirts, 2 sets of pillowcases, and an assortment of wool items, its already paid for itself.</li>
      <li>rub it over the area more than once    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My roommate got me one of these as a gift and it changed my world.  Okay, that may be a bit strong, but it definitely changed it a bit.  Previously when a sweater or a winter jacket got the little fuzz balls (typically at the wrists, elbows,etc) it would go to Goodwill.  Once I got this little battery operated wonder it completely changed my MO.    A quick brush over with this will remove fuzz balls from just about any cloth- sweaters, blankets, winter coats, furniture, I think I&#x27;ve used it on everything that wasn&#x27;t moving in my apartment.   This will seriously extend the life of your clothing and keep everything looking new.   My first one lasted about 8 years and it was slowing down a little so I bought a new one to replace it- when I think how many articles of clothes it \\&quot;saved\\&quot; from Goodwill I can honestly say it was well worth the money. I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all- I&#x27;ve had this new one since Christmas and it hasn&#x27;t skipped a beat so I think the users who had issues may have gotten a defective product.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to work on my sweaters at all. It also got hot and smelled like burning when I tried to use it for too long. Would not recommend!!</li>
    <li> The fabric shaver does its job in that it shaves the fuzzies off fabric.  It also eats the fabric!  Even if you follow instructions and pull the fabric taught over a pillow or similar item, it catches the fabric and eats holes in in the garment...causing you to throw out what was a worn, but at least wearable piece of clothing!  I have had shavers in the past that had much smaller holes to minimize this risk.  I will continue to look for another fabric shaver that wont ruin more clothes than it saves.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t see any difference after using this product. It seems to be collecting fuzz in the receptacle area, but no noticeable difference on the 3 garments I&#x27;ve tried it on. Really dissappointing.</li>
    <li> This product works almost as well as hand trimming pills off a sweater, but takes much less time, of course.  Gentle touch is the key to not damaging fabric by cutting too deeply.  I found the fuzz collector chamber to be difficult to remove because of the tiny buttons that must be depressed.  Nobody&#x27;s fingers are that small.  Even though they assure that the collector won&#x27;t accidentally detach during use, the design could be improved to make intentional detachment of the collector easier while still preventing accidental detachment during use.  Because it does it&#x27;s job relatively well, though, it earned four stars from me.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t hate fuzz balls? With the Remington shaver, I can easily remove them and turn my sweaters back to new. It has been a Godsend this winter. Works especially well with some inexpensive cashmere sweaters I bought at Marshalls that fuzz much more than the expensive ones. Also works well with cotton pants. No more discarding clothes just because of fuzz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to remember is to keep the surface flat and smooth (I use an ironing board, always) and employ a light, firm touch. (Just like shaving.)</li>
    <li> Excellent little product.  Shaves unwanted fuzz without damaging the fabric.  Not just for sweaters.  Cleans dark lint off white socks and vice versa.</li>
    <li> I did my couch without a problem, it had fuzzies everywhere, and was really looking nasty, but now it looks brand new.  It will stop on you, when its too full or there is a bit of fuzz caught in the blades, but with a couch full of fuzz like mine, I expected that.  Actually, I&#x27;m glad it stops at that point, saves the motor from burning out.  That being said, if it can do my whole couch, best money ever spent.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews for this product and that what made me purchase it because of the good reports. This fabric shaver removes so much lint and hair from your clothes it&#x27;s ridiculous. The metal part is like a vacuum cleaner that sucks up the lint and hair. It makes old clothes look exactly new. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks and so far it has been working pretty well. Like some of the previous reviews mentioned, it can cut small holes when the material is thin and you did not lay the fabric flat and pushed too hard. But it works much better on thick fabric like sweaters and knit woven material. The suggestion is to try on your old cloth first to practice a little bit before trying on your newer cloth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for all my woolen wear that gathers fuzzy lint specially around the sleeves and elbows. I just used it today and I&#x27;d say it does a decent job of cleaning up the lint. It could do with a little more vaccum power and sharper blades but then again at $12.99 it does what you paid for.</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of crap. I wanted to remove fuzz balls on my baby&#x27;s socks. It does not remove at all. All it does is compress the fur balls onto the socks and  dirties them. Probably the blade is dirty or something. But how could that be, I bought it brand new. Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I love using it and it works great.  Works best on fabrics that are supposed to be smooth and not so great on sweaters unless you use a very lite touch and be precise with areas you will work on.  I am running into the problem of finding replacement blades...maybe they don&#x27;t sell them.  It seem a waste to buy a new one if my old one works great just to get new blades.  Sharp blades do make a difference though.  To comment on what other people have said about it getting stuck.  I have noticed that it gets stuck on some fabrics but it&#x27;s ability to cut the fabric fuzz is limited to its wattage.  So remember that it&#x27;s only working on two AA batteries.  When it gets stuck, I simply shake it a little, use my nail to get the stuck fuzzy (careful, there are blades in there and the screen moves), or take off the lid to the blades (for serious tangles).  I&#x27;ve not had it stop without being able to fix it right away.  When a fabric seems to get it stuck often, work slower and attack less fuzz at one time.  Anyone know if replacement blades?</li>
    <li> At this price, I&#x27;d say this fabric shaver is like a treasure to me. It&#x27;s inexpensive and get the job done. I used it on sweaters and jackets. It did remove the pills etc, although not as perfectly as I thought it would, but it did remove them as close as it could get to the surface of the cloth. I was worried it would cut the fabric if I pressed it too hard on sweaters but it was all good. No cut. I followed some tips that said just placed the sweater on a pillow and rub away the wrinkles first so it had a smooth surface, to prevent it from cutting holes. I also shaved the fabric using a circular motion. It works like magic. Really useful. I didn&#x27;t have the issue of the shaver to die on me too, although I actually used it non-stop for almost an hour on my poor wool jacket that I threw accidentally into my washer (I didn&#x27;t read the instruction tag that it should only be dry-cleaned only. You can&#x27;t imagine the mess I got when I pulled it out from the washer. But this fabric shaver came to the rescue. Although I should also mention I had to remove the pills from the small container several times because it got full quite fast. But the salvation operation was successful and my wool jacket was saved). Probably will work best if you pause for 30mins or so between jobs. Most importantly, the batteries do last a very long time. I also used this on my car&#x27;s seat clothes. LOVE IT! It&#x27;s like all-purpose fabric shaver and saved a lot of my fabric-material items. Really really does a wonderful job. I would recommend it to everyone I know that needs a cheap fabric shaver.</li>
    <li> It seemed at first that the Fuzz Away didn&#x27;t work.  Then I descovered there was a plastic cover over the shaving head.  When I removed the cover it worked fine. I put a piece of masking tape across the cover so I wouldn&#x27;t forget to remove it in the future. I even used it to remove the fuzz from some old winter woolen socks!</li>
    <li> This is handy for shaving all the \\&quot;pills\\&quot; off of sweaters, socks, blankets, or whatever. It makes the old look new again. Fun to use too.</li>
    <li> This shaver did an excellent job on a sweater I had given up hope on. The lint tray did not come off that easily but I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This works ok but its not a life saver.  Its just not that effective but it does an ok job of getting rid of loose threads and extra fabric and stuff. I think its kinda weak though.</li>
    <li> I have 2 complaints about the shaver:  1. It took bites out of fabric on several occassions  2. After 3 months of light usage (maybe 25 pieces of clothing) the foil began to crack and split; eventually an entire chunk cracked off and the device became useless, with the blades constantly getting jammed in the cracked foil and fabric being sucked up in the exposed part where there was a hole in the foil    Because the device failed after 3 months of usage I cannot recommend it and I give it a 1-star</li>
    <li> works great...I used this on some old sweaters, pants, and gloves and it made them look brand new&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY easy to use</li>
    <li> Ok but not the best    It doesn&#x27;t get rid all the tiny pills and it won&#x27;t make your sweater looking new again (like the other customer was saying )but you&#x27;ll notice small different on your sweater but not much...It doesn&#x27;t get caught on the fabric even if you press hard against your sweater. The battery seems to last longer - I did my 8 sweater and the battery still kept going.    Good use for the car too!</li>
    <li> Pound for Pound, this is probably the best investment i have ever made. Considering that within days of purchasing this i was able to salvage 3 sweatshirts, 4 t-shirts, 2 sets of pillowcases, and an assortment of wool items, its already paid for itself. It does exactly what you need it to do - which is to literally shave unwanted stray fabric, lint, piling - whatever isn&#x27;t supposed to be there, it eliminates. I have been using it for 2 months now and it works as well as the first day i bought it. I try to use it for 15-20 minutes at a time to avoid the complaints some have had in regards to using it for extended periods of time, but so far for what it is, its been a remarkably rugged piece of simple machinery.</li>
    <li> This is a neat product that makes old,  ragged sweaters look new again.  Very fun!</li>
    <li> It may be a super shaver, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  Amazon was was selling it with a Energizer ECR2032 Watch Battery.  Since the specs didn&#x27;t state what batteries would be required, silly me, I bought them together thinking Amazon was matching me to the need!  I thought it was odd something that big would use a watch battery, but Amazon never steered me wrong before!  When the watch battery finally arrives (it won&#x27;t fit either of my watches) I will have to send it back.  How incredibly annoying.  Two AA batteries are all you will need.</li>
    <li> I needed this product for a large old piece of furniture that had started pilling.  It worked great!  I had to double back over the piece, but now it looks brand new.</li>
    <li> I previously owned one of the little ones when they first came out. I was nervous that I would be able to find one that would work as well, but I did.  And just as important is the fact that it is much larger and so I can \\&quot;shave\\&quot; an entire sweater in far less time.  I have had no problems with it, but then I use it carefully and do not overuse it at any one time.  Please note that the picture is deceptive in the way it looks like it stands up on its own.  It does not.  Well made and easy to operate.</li>
    <li> Totally ineffective product.  Tried it on a sweater and on a lightweight   coat. It removed no lint or pilling. It deserves zero stars.</li>
    <li> This worked really great however, I got a little too excited and went over a wrinkle, causing it to cut a hole. So just don&#x27;t be stupid and this product will work great.</li>
    <li> When looking for a way to salvage several sweaters that were in need of replacement, I purchased both the D-Fuzz-It DFuzzIt Sweater &amp; Fabric Comb by Oak Hill as well as the Remington RPFS-100 Fuzz Away Fabric Shaver above. I found that both products worked well. The more expensive, battery operated Remington RPFS-100 Fuzz Away Fabric Shaver worked well removing larger, discrete fuzz balls from sweaters, but was less effective on removing fuzz before it balled up. The D-Fuzz-It-Sweater And Fabric Comb was more labor intensive and a bit messy, but was more effective on removing fuzz before it balled-up, giving more of a \\&quot;like-new\\&quot; appearance to the sweater. (Yes I have learned more about sweater fuzz than anyone should know.)     I would recommend both products. They have saved me a combined $300 - $400 so far.</li>
    <li> Like others, I ruined a sweater learning to use this item. It works wonderfully on fleece and heavy knits, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it again on fine knits. It actually pulled fabric into the cage over the blades and sliced holes in it. Use very, very light pressure.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver, but unfortunately after only a few months of light use, the metal grid that helps shave away the pills broke. I had never had a clothes shaver do that. Apparently the metal is very thin and fragile, and should not be pressed down on. I am very sad now, not worth the money. Get one at wal-mart.</li>
    <li> I just received mine a few days ago.  In my experience this is a useful tool, but not a game changer.  If one spends some time to go over a sweater pretty meticulously, this will certainly improve its appearance (in some cases dramatically).  However, you will likely not notice any difference if you just use it for 30 seconds prior to putting something on.  Personally I was hoping for more of a difference with less effort, but I suppose you can&#x27;t expect too much for $12.  That said, I&#x27;m happy to have it because I will invest the time to improve the appearance of some of my favorite sweaters.</li>
    <li> It worked great for one day then never worked again. I was very upset when it stopped working.</li>
    <li> I have had a Remington fuzzbuster for about 20 years, and I didn&#x27;t know WHAT I was going to do when it finally \\&quot;bit the dust\\&quot; a couple of weeks ago.  But, I thought, the internet has EVERYthing, so I went to my favorite site, amazon.com,and was rewarded very quickly.  This defuzzer, or whatever you want to call it, is perfect for every business woman and man who wants to look nice but can&#x27;t buy new clothes every week.  It&#x27;s not just for sweaters.  It helps maintain a professional look for years.  I wish everyone had one!      Deborah J. Cope, EA  San Antonio, TX</li>
    <li> This is an excellent fabric shaver.  We&#x27;ve had a couple in the past that didn&#x27;t work very well and decided to spend a few more dollars to see if a more expensive one worked better, and this one does.  We love it and are so glad we purchased it.  It takes the lint off of your clothes quickly and they look fantastic!</li>
    <li> My wife is a seamstress and is very pleased with this little tool. I was a bit scared by negative reviews and horror stories of shredded sweaters but with a bit of caution all appears good-and old sweaters look new! A money saver indeed.</li>
    <li> It works well in removing pills and stray threads.  It&#x27;s a little tough to open up to clean out the lint, but I guess that can also be a plus since you don&#x27;t want the catcher to fall off while your using it.</li>
    <li> Have a favorite sweater? Does it look like your favorite sweater? Give it new life, banish the pills. Gotta love the sweater shaver,should be called sweater saver!!</li>
    <li> I purchased my fuzz away because after picking up my comfortor at the dry-cleaners i noticed that there were lots of little fuzz nubs on it. The fuzz away took them all off and they havent come back. Now i use it on sweaters too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for some sweaters I have and it seems to work great. I haven&#x27;t used it much but when I did it did the job I needed it to do. I would say a good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I love my Fuzz Away Fabric Shaver!!!  It has saved me so much money!  I can&#x27;t afford to buy new clothes for work JUST BECAUSE the ones I already own - have pills... I have \\&quot;DE-FUZZED\\&quot; the work clothes that I already have, and now I have a great new wardrobe! Just go crazy with it!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. This one did not do the trick....Although the sweater is pretty big (long cable net with a hood), I think it would take about 2-3 hours to really get the job done and I&#x27;m not sure that would even do it! I thought it would be much more efficient however I haven&#x27;t tried others to compare. It just seems pretty flimsy.</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well, like others have said, make sure that your fabric it flat or it WILL snag and cause holes.  It is a must have for baby clothes and blankets.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake of washing sweaters with bath mat and sweaters came out of the washer with fuzz all over them and it looked impossible to remove them all, but this did the job.  Very easy to use, too.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> How many stars should I award this when it&#x27;s worth 5 stars for performance, but deserves 1 star for dying on me?  As other reviews have stated, the Remington Fuzz Away Fabric Shaver removes fuzz quite well.  I tried it on woolen and cotton sweaters.  Although it won&#x27;t return sweaters to like-new condition, in about 5 minutes of diligent shaving each, my sweaters were returned to near pre-fuzz glory.    Over the course of 3 weeks, a pair of AA-Energizers ran strongly while shaving 6-7 sweaters.  Not exactly \\&quot;industrial grade\\&quot; usage, but tonight, while removing fuzz from a woolen sock, the shaver died.  It could not be brought back to life with new batteries.    Thankfully, the Amazon return process was seamless and another will be on its way to me within days.</li>
    <li> I got this two weeks ago and absolutely love it.  I cant believe I waited until now to get one of these.</li>
    <li> My husband and I bought our black sofa 10 years ago without realizing how much the fabric would pill.  Before I got the fabric shaver today, the sofa looked gray-ish and you couldn&#x27;t see the black-on-black pattern under all the bumps and roughness.  Thanks to this shaver, we now have our smooth, shiny, black sofa back!  I can&#x27;t wait to start on our clothing.  Now for the fine print...  As one might expect, it has some minor \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; issues: For bigger projects, you&#x27;ll have to dump the lint tray often, so have a trash can or a box nearby (the fastest way I found to get the tray off was to have the handle facing me while I slid my thumbs down to dislodge the tray).  It might jam and suddenly stop running if it sucks up a pill that is too long, but don&#x27;t worry... Just unscrew the screen (TURN IT OFF FIRST!) and blow on the blades or shake off the debris.  There was a lot of \\&quot;dust\\&quot; that collected on the body of the shaver near the screen, so if you have severe allergies, keep an eye on that.  It&#x27;s a little noisy - like a combo of a tiny vacuum and some bees on steriods.  Also, after turning it on and off several times, the button stuck a bit and I had to push on it harder to make it start running.  This wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me, and I didn&#x27;t see any other reviews about this problem, so it might just be my shaver (which was practically drop-kicked onto my porch by our postal carrier!).  All in all, it&#x27;s a good little tool for the price.  Since I was working on a sofa, it would&#x27;ve been nice to have a larger shaving area, but I managed.  Enjoy your \\&quot;new\\&quot; fabrics! :)</li>
    <li> Got this today &amp; used it right away.  It&#x27;s so easy to use &amp; took all the fuzz away from pants to sweaters!  Now my clothes look like new again.  It uses 2 AA batteries.  Definitely a great buy, do not hesitate!!!</li>
    <li> Works great - but be careful. I let my 4 yr old use the fabric shaver on old sweater. Lets just say that sweater is in the landfill.</li>
    <li> This fabric shaver is pretty good for it&#x27;s price.  It is small, so you have to carefully go over your clothes, and it fills up quickly, so you have to take care to empty it of the fuzz that comes off the clothes.  Basically as long as you treat it well, it will treat your clothes well! :)</li>
    <li> Before buying this fabric shaver I used cheap razor blades to remove the lint from some of my clothes, which wasn&#x27;t the best way to deal with it... It took me forever to finish a single piece and I could only do it with a certain type of clothing, nothing too delicate.  With the fuzz away I am now able to clean up my clothes in a fraction of the time and best of all, I can use it for my heavy exercise pants or for a sheer blouse, just being a tad careful so that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;chew\\&quot; more than it needs to.  One day my mother accidentally placed a black lace skirt that she made herself with a load of clear clothes inside the washing machine, when it came out the skirt had white lint everywhere, she almost cried because she really liked it and thought that she would need to throw it away, I told her to let me try to clean it with the \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot; and sure enough, the skirt was like new again.  I would definitely recommend getting the fuzz away, I have owned it for five months now and use it pretty often, it hasn&#x27;t failed me once.</li>
    <li> This product works better than other fuzz shavers that I have used.  It seems like it will actually last awhile too.  You have to use a very gentle hand, no pressure, so it kind of takes a long time to do a whole sweater, I had to keep going over some parts, over and over again.  I love the fact that you can take the whole thing apart to clean it.  I would recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> An essential tool for wardrobe maintenance.  The \\&quot;Fuzz Away\\&quot; will perk up any garment prone to pill with a gentle touch as razor is hidden under a screen.  Good for your clothes and your budget.</li>
    <li> Best $13 I ever spent! Product makes your old clothes look new again! But be careful, and use smartly - it can make holes if you \\&quot;push your luck\\&quot;: don&#x27;t press too hard and use only on a flat surfaces (flatten each area of the material before shaving).    Cons: fills-up too fast, needs to be emptied several times during one shave.</li>
    <li> I love this fabric shaver. I used it on ALL my sweaters and wool coats. It made my clothes look new and refreshing. I went on a hunt in my closet to find clothes that need shaving. Easy to use and lots of power. Won&#x27;t slow down the longer you use it nor will it lose it&#x27;s powerful fan suction as the fabric catcher compartment gets full. I put new batteries   in and haven&#x27;t changed them yet......and I used it one day for over 40 minutes.  Fabulous product and a very trustworthy product name. If I ever have to buy a new fabric shaver it will be from Remington!</li>
    <li> I had a wool coat that I loved that was all kinds of nubby so I bought a new coat (it was getting embarrassing!) but then I decided to try a \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; and have been incredibly pleased with the results. The only annoyance (thus 4 stars) is that you have to go over and over areas to get a good effect. Otherwise, I&#x27;ve cleaned another coat and a sweater nd am thrilled!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what promises. Worked beautifully on my blankets, cashmere, merino wool and cotton sweaters. And with this price it is defenitly a must have!</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to keep my sweaters in good condition.  Worked well on fine cashmere, and on sythethic jacket sleeves. The shaving head area is larger than a previous shaver that I had owned, which makes the job much easier.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s some things for which this thing is amazing: removing lint, removing those little \\&quot;pills\\&quot; and lasting forever on two AA batteries.  This definitely gets the bigger pills off a sweater.      HOWEVER, this does not remove sweater \\&quot;fuzz,\\&quot; especially you are trying to get fuzz off acrylic sweaters (which is annoying since it cuts close enough to tear holes in your stuff, but not close enough to cut off fuzz).  The only way to really remove the fuzz is to literally shave the sweater w/ a razor.   I use my 3blade bic and it works great.  You&#x27;ll feel ridiculous; you&#x27;ll make a mess and you&#x27;ll spend 30 min. doing it, but your sweater will look \\&quot;new\\&quot; or as close to it as you can hope.  Still, it&#x27;s cheaper than getting new gear every few years.    This isn&#x27;t worthless.  It&#x27;s great in the morning when you just need to get some little pills off your clothes before you go to work, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t make anything look \\&quot;brand new.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s cheap and worth buying for what it does, but a lot of reviews are kind of misrepresenting what to expect.</li>
    <li> This item is very strong and it did the job in most areas but the holes on the device are so big that it can suck your shirt/sweater into it. The blade then ended up cutting the material.  unfortunatly now i must buy a new sweater.</li>
    <li> The Remington Fuzz Away Fabric Shaver was way better than I thought it would be.  It really works great.  I used it on a sweater I had been working on for a long time and walla the fuzz and balls started coming off immediately.  It was fun too because it was really working.  Not like some of the handy hint books I tried and failed to do much of anything.  Also it&#x27;s inexpensive.  What more could I ask for.  As usual Amazon got it to me fast so I was able to wear the sweater for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I had gotten to my wits end trying to use lint rollers to remove those stubburn little balls of fuzz that accumulate on sweaters and sweatshirts. So one day I went online to Amazon.com and found the answer to my prayers and pocket book. I ordered the Remington RPFS-100 Fuzz Away Fabric Shaver after ready reviews of many others, and I have never been happier with my choice. All of my sweaters, sweatshirts, as well as other articles of clothing now look brand new and I actually love wearing them again. Though it takes some time to use and if your clothing is riddled with fuzz (as mine were)you may need to empty the bottom container often this product delivers and keeps it&#x27;s promises. I love this fabric shaver! I&#x27;ve had this one for three months now and it&#x27;s works as great as it did the day I first took it out of the package, and I&#x27;ve only changed the batteries in it once! You have to buy this product!</li>
    <li> Some people in this review rave about this.  It works OK and takes going over your fabric several times to remove the fuzz.  I wouldn&#x27;t say \\&quot;it&#x27;s like getting new clothes\\&quot;.  Isn&#x27;t the best on the market I believe.</li>
    <li> It took off the piling on my sweater and it also ate part of my sweater! So now my sweater is smooth, but holey.</li>
    <li> My roommate in college had one of these and I have been trying to find out where to buy one for quite some time. This little thing is really an amazing machine. I have some fleece jackets and they are constantly picking up white fuzz balls no matter what I do. If I spend about 2 minutes using this machine to make a quick pass over jacket it will shave off all of the white cotton fuzz balls and the black fleece looks quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution, I used this on a grey Nike jacket when I first bought it and put a lot of pressure on the jacket and it snagged one of the threads and created a small hole about the size of a thumb tack. Luckily I know a good Ukrainian tailor in the Salt Lake area and she fixed this with no problems. But just be careful not to put too much pressure when using this device or you can actually push the fabric too far past the safety guard and get a snag which will literally cut the fabric. It&#x27;s pretty difficult to do what I did and shouldn&#x27;t happen with normal use- I was being extra aggressive in trying to get off every little lint ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my car&#x27;s upholstery (I have cloth seats), dress pants, hoodies, and practically all sorts of clothes where static makes fuzz balls cling to the fabric. It really works wonders and is a must-have in my opinion.</li>
    <li> All in all this is great and very simple device which will make your beloved sweater or pullover look like new. That is true. The only thing - you should careful apply it on too tender fabrics. My wife has made a hole on her blouse with that shaver. I suppose it works best on woolen things.   But in general it is very handy and useful Shaver.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent fabric shaver for spot jobs.  compared to the \\&quot;sold on TV\\&quot; versions, this shaver is more powerful and efficient.  I agree with the other positive reviews; this will make your clothes look new in minutes.</li>
    <li> This little shaver does a very good job. It is a little difficult to clean thoroughly - but is fine for removing those ugly pills.</li>
    <li> This fabric shavers works well in removing excess fuzz and almost makes the clothes newer. It runs on 2 AA batteries (not included). As with any fabric shaver, you have to watch how much fabric has been shaved as it might make the clothes a little thin. Works well though....</li>
    <li> Cons: Noticed some fuzz on a new dress shirt after laundering and decided to try this thing.  It seemed to be working removing the slight fuzz and all of a sudden it cut a hole in the fabric!  My new dress shirt!&lt;br /&gt;I think the openings are too large in the head.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Has lots of vacuum and works good on restoring an old small carpet and some furniture fabric.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use this for anything unless I&#x27;m ready to throw the item away. Keep it away from your good stuff.</li>
    <li> This shaver works really well.  It is just the right size and is very portable.  I have restored many items because of it.</li>
    <li> This fabric shaver did not impress me.  I have to clean it out frequently while shaving one garment.  The fabric gets caught in the wheel and its a pain to clean out...especially 2-3 times for one piece of clothing.  I suppose it does its job but I would have picked another user friendly model had I known.  It also takes a long time to clean one thing too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for a year or more--branded as Evercare, but the same shaver. It works great: cashmere sweaters, other sweaters, even pilly socks. And it has never done ANY damage while I&#x27;ve used it. The reports on this thing not continuing to work reflect the cheap on/off switch you can see if you take it apart. Thus: first you think your batteries are bad--no! Disassembly shows a switch consisting of a wire too thin to be a decent paper clip. Can this be fixed--I don&#x27;t know. Sadly, the unit itself functions so well that one really wants to make it work reliably. If I were to buy this or a similar unit again, I&#x27;d look for the A/C powered unit that Evercare has marketed. I find myself using this so much that it would be the better choice.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean up some handknit items my children wear, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work AT ALL.    I thought I was getting a bargain, but I got a piece of garbage instead.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, it really works good removing the lint, the only reason I do not give it a 5 star is due to it&#x27;s lint collector, it is hard to remove for an older person, my mom had trouble removing it it as well as the battery, it should be easier. In terms of doing do job, it does a good one.</li>
    <li> I only used this product on a few sweaters so far but it did improve the look of every one of them.  They are not 100% new looking again but there is certainly a vast improvement.  I would use it more but made the mistake of opening it in front of my kids and they both wanted to try it and now think it is a toy (the product warns to keep it away from kids, btw).  Anyway, it works tons better than a $5 shaver I bought at a craft store once.  I think this product is definitely worth a try</li>
    <li> Made my coats and sweaters new again, works great! Battery seems to last forever. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This shaver is simply amazing! Uses AA batteries and is easy to use. Is really quick and does not harm fabric.  It works best if you don&#x27;t press head very hard against the surface of whatever you are shaving.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> Simply turn the shaver on and slide the shaver over the fabric and it picks up all the fuzz.  After you are done empty the basket and remove the blade guard and simply blow the fuzz from the blades and replace the guard.  Great little product, mine is 6 months old and still no problems.</li>
    <li> This clothes shaver really works at removing all those annoying balls that grow on clothes over time whether you machine dry them or not and helps make your clothes look new again or newer...</li>
    <li> This product does a fair at most job for its intention. It just doesn&#x27;t take it off clean enough. But, it still performs nicely.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked very well at removing the fuzz from my sweater.  No damage to my sweater at all.  It looked like new.  The one problem I do have with it however is that the fuzz wanted to accumulate behind the spinning blades rather than drop down into the catcher for easy removal.  To clean it, I whipped out my tweezers and pulled the fuzz out.  Not hard, just not totally convenient.  Perhaps it was the type of yarn my sweater is made from?  I&#x27;ll have to see how it does on other sweaters.  The biggest thing is that it saved my favorite sweater.  A little added maintenance not an issue really.  It was a good price.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  used first on a large sweatshirt, and did indeed remove about 75% of all the \\&quot;pills\\&quot; that had come up since purchase of the sweat shirt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve needed one of these things for years.  After looking around on line for what was out there, I finally bought this model based on reviews and the price (seemed to be the best value).  So far I&#x27;ve only used it on one sweater, but I was very pleased with how well this device worked.  It easily removed the pilling from my sweater, so that it looked practically new.  Definitely no reason to spend money on a more expensive shaver--this one does a great job.</li>
    <li> I tried this shaver on a sweater with some pilling to see how it worked and it performed well, but it took a long time to get the job done.  Then I tried it on a sweater that really had a lot of fuzz to get at and it did nothing for it.  It wasn&#x27;t effective at all anymore.  I am taking it back.</li>
    <li> I just received this shaver today.  I quickly set about shaving my pilled sweaters and one pashmina throw that was accidentally thrown in the washer.  The sweaters did fairly well.  As one other reviewer commented, my sweaters look better, not new-looking, but better.  It took me about 30 minutes to shave three sweaters.  The \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; cashmere sweater came out worst, but it was the least expensive of the sweaters. It ended up looking like pills were pulled off instead of shaven off.  The nicer cashmere (tighter yarn) and the merino wool sweater came out looking \\&quot;cleaner.\\&quot;      Last but not least, the jury is still out on the results with the pashmina throw.  The shaver is not that large. The cup that holds the shavings is also small.  Combined, this means after 15 minutes of shaving and emptying the cup three times, I have only done an area about 8\\&quot; x 30\\&quot;. Definitely not working as fast as I would like it to work.  I have to go over the area being shaved multiple times to pick up everything.  The shaver definitely worked better on the sweaters than on the throw.      All in all, this is a good, not great product.  It does what it says it will do.  It&#x27;s on the small side, the shaving area is only about 2\\&quot; in diameter.  The cup to catch the shavings is small.  For the money, probably a good value.  I&#x27;m probably going to keep this one but continue to look for a larger shaver.  I&#x27;m pretty cheap though, so I may be looking a while to find one in my price range.  &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> This simply does not work at all. I have very simple pills to remove and I have gone over, and over, and over, and over, etc and it barely trims the tips off.  What a waste!</li>
    <li> This product works very well at removing pills from sweaters--until it sucks in the sweater itself and rips a hole in it.  I have had this happen several times now on lighter-weight sweaters with a looser knit.  If you intend to use it only on heavy and tight knits you will probably have good results, but BEWARE of using it on your precious cashmere.</li>
    <li> This baby does the job. As long as you are not rushing and apply it on a flat-ish surface, it works perfectly. Although the more lint on the garment, the more often you will find yourself emptying the lint trap. But it&#x27;s not a bother for me. The clump usually comes out in one solid clump.</li>
    <li> I had a smaller version of this gadget, but this one is much nicer.  It&#x27;s heftier and does a great job!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this shaver was wonderful. It performed flawlessly. However I could not get it to repeat that performance. The next time I picked it up - one week later - it wouldn&#x27;t operate at all. I changed the batteries twice. It was never dropped on the ground or dipped in water. It died without even a whimper.</li>
    <li> I think this is a nifty little device that somehow removes all the fuzz from your coats/sweaters (not angora or stuff like that, it might make some holes) and definitely helps them look like new. Please note it is more for removing pills and what not than for removing lint, but I really like it! The storage compartment is easy to remove and it is simple to use. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this product despite some of the bad reviews that I read on Amazon. I tried it on my clothes, and it worked great for about 30 minutes or so before it was dead. I was disappointed and thought, well, maybe the bad reviews on amazon were right. BUT, BUT, BUT, I then realized it stops working when the blades are stuck. All you need to do is just open the cap and clear the blades, and it will work like a wonder again. WAY TO GO!!! Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I works fantastic, I leaves the fabric as brand new. it really picks up every litle thing from the fabric, even though It does not pick up animals hair, it works prefectly on the rest on fabric litle cotton balls</li>
    <li> The first time I used this fabric shaver, I was pleased with the results.  After that, it was all downhill.  I&#x27;ve ruined two garments with it because I accidentally moved the fabric with my hand while I was shaving them (I did put the garments on a flat countertop as recommended).  Do not attempt to use this shaver on any item that is draped, shirred, gathered or pleated.  It will tear the garment, even if you carefully lay it out on a flat surface.  You should also use caution when shaving around seams on flat garments.  I would recommend using this product as a last resort only on items that you were otherwise planning to dispose of because of the pilling.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily to use on a fabric sectional couch that developed a lot of fuzz and pill over two years. This product works very well. My couch feels much better. With little effort all pills and fuzz was gone. Great investment so far.     Not tested on clothing, but I would expect the same results.     Design and ergonomics are great. Pop in two AA batteries, and you are ready. Its very compact, lightweight and super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of these fabric shavers... all of them.  But when expensive sweaters began to show little pills I was ready to give something a try.  A friend recommended this one.  So far it has worked well and restored those items that were worth restoring.  One comment:  Take the cover off the face of the shaver prior to beginning.</li>
    <li> I used it on a pair of pants that had been washed with a brand new bath towel.  I didn&#x27;t think I would ever get the green fuzz off the pants.  This product really did the trick!</li>
    <li> Great product but you have to be careful with thin fabrics and some of the larger knit sweaters because it&#x27;s easy to make a hole.</li>
    <li> THIS ONE IS SMALL BUT WORKS VERY WELL.IF YOU WANT TO FIND A GOOD FABRIC SHAVER,THIS WOULD BE IT.</li>
    <li> My wife is so pleased with her new Remington shaver.  Her old sweaters look like new!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this sweater shaver. I have not notice much of a difference to my sweaters after using and the blade dulls quickly.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to receive the Remington RPFS-100 because I&#x27;ve owned an older version of this fabric shaver by Remington since the mid-90s.  It was very good and worked on any type of knitted fabric, but finally gave out. The first time I used this newly acquired Remington RPFS-100 on a bulky woolen sweater it worked fine.  I then tried it on a finely knitted cashmere sweater and suddenly the shaver sucked in the fabric resulting in three tack-size holes!  I can only attribute this awful incident to the fact that the holes on the surface plate are too large to be used on fine woolen fabrics.  It may be that the shaver is intended for larger gauge woolen items only and not for finely knitted apparel.  So, if anyone knows of another fabric shaver that is suitable for finer woolen items, please let me know!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This clothes shaver is the best I have used so far. My sweaters look new. It is powerful so you have to be careful.</li>
    <li> First, If you do ever get this little machine, use new batteries. Upon first using it I used old batteries and switched, and the difference was noticeable    Second, The cover over the blade (the circular thing that holds the cheese-grate looking piece of metal) can be twisted, and if you do twist it, make sure you twist it so it goes down as far as possible. Otherwise, the blade inside will NOT work     Review time. I ordered a white zip hoodie off ebay and got it only to find it was heavily, heavily pilled all over. So i got this bugger and tried it out    And it works. It works really well. However, you have to rub it over the area with the pills 3-4 times slowly (well not slowly. Just not fast) to fully get the pills off. In total, a size small hoodie took about 40min to go over. But it works. I dont have any other experience with other pilling machines, but I did not expect the process to take so long because you have to 1) move the machine slowly and 2) rub it over the area more than once    But it definitely, definitely got the job done</li>
    <li> Used it on over a dozen cashmere sweaters and it worked nicely to remove pilled areas.  I did need to use a second set of batteries but I used it on a lot of stuff so that didn&#x27;t bother me.  My sweaters all look fresh and new.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to. I use it often to remove the little balls on my couch.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well for a couple of months and then got weaker and weaker (not a battery issue as I put in fresh batteries several times).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and it&#x27;s well worth the price. When I first received it I was so excited that I went to town on my cotton pillow cases, sheets and quilt (with no damage to the embroidery) and now everything is nice and smooth. I&#x27;ve since used it on clothes, too, and it works wonders on pills but it only reduces (does not eliminate) fuzz. Please be VERY, VERY careful when using it on any type of stretchy fabric as it may create small holes. You can still use it for cardigans and blouses just make sure you do small wrinkle-free areas at a time and DO NOT apply pressure and you&#x27;re good to go. You can do pants or jeans in a more leisurely manner, though, since it&#x27;s usually coarser fabric. After a few days the motor began to weaken and I thought it was broken but all it needed was new batteries so I suggest you use rechargeable batteries. I tried to find this product in stores with no luck so I highly recommend you get it here!</li>
    <li> My wool coat was constantly pilling at all of the edges, which made it look sort of ratty, even though it&#x27;s a nice coat. I&#x27;ve used this on it several times, and it works really well. I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a little weak, but it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these. One for my Mom &amp; one for me. It worked really well!  I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy it.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well because it&#x27;s a larger size that fits nicely in your hand, it doesn&#x27;t drain the battery quickly, and it removes the fuzz and pills quickly restoring the life in clothes.</li>
    <li> I used the correct alkaline (not standard or heavy duty) batteries, as per their instructions, but this product did very little that I could see.  In fact it was worse than doing nothing, as it did not affect the actual \\&quot;pills\\&quot; (which I ended up pulling off by hand), but it did shave the slight fuzz which was part of the original beauty of the sweater.</li>
    <li> Not worth it.  I tried the Brookstone version in their store and LOVED it.  I would have shaved my entire coat, if I didn&#x27;t think it would have drawn too much attention to myself.  It worked wonderfully.  But when I checked its reviews on line, it didn&#x27;t get the greatest reviews and this one seemed to do better, so I ordered this one instead.  I&#x27;m so disappointed:(!  I couldn&#x27;t get this one to shave barely anything off my coat. Brooksonte one has bigger holes (gets bigger pieces of line) and much stronger vacuum.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to add that I recently purchased the Remington Fuzz-Away and it worked great on everything I tried it on, including my sweaters, shirts, heating pad cover and bra.  I was afraid that it was going to pull at the threads, but it shaved the fuzz off very cleanly.</li>
    <li> After a little while, the razor inside, I guess, dulls, because it does not work as well as it first did, which was terrific.</li>
    <li> great for getting those pills from your sweaters</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing the difference a de-fuzzing or de-pilling makes in one&#x27;s wardrobe. When I got this thing, I tried it on a high-quality wool sweater that was showing its age. After a 2-minute de-fuzzing, it looked brand spanking new. I was so delighted that I went on a little fabric-shaving spree (nothing like a new gadget to get me going)! I revitalized so many jackets, pants, and other items that I probably doubled my work wardrobe in an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most satisfying use I found for the Fuzz-Away was removing the pills from my 2-year-old&#x27;s beloved satin blanket. He watched me, fascinated, then felt the blanket, then announced: \\&quot;Mommy cleaned dat!\\&quot; Then he insisted on using it himself on our quilt -- which I had no problem letting him do, because this item is incredibly safe and doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;cut\\&quot; or \\&quot;shave\\&quot; anything in the normal sense of the word. It just sort of \\&quot;whisks\\&quot; fabric blobs away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the Fuzz-Away handy, because I use it all the time. Once you have tried it, you too will keep it at the ready with fresh batteries.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail the other day and it has worked WONDERS on my sweaters!  I have a few favorite sweaters that I&#x27;ve had for a few years and I hated that they were all so pilled/fuzzy.  This Fuzz Away makes them look brand new again! Great product!</li>
    <li> What a great item, it did the job!  Finally something that works to take the pills off of all those sweaters.  It&#x27;s sturdy and the batteries are lasting longer than any I have had before!  Only awkward thing is getting the  collector off to discard the fuzz.</li>
    <li> This works great and my clothes and sweaters look brand new again.  My only complaint is that the fuzz kept getting stuck in the shaver and didn&#x27;t go down into the holder like it is supposed to.  I kept having to clean it out.  But this may have been because of the angle I was holding it in.  If the shaver was more upright, it may have worked better.</li>
    <li> The blades are strong and I even use it to get fuzz off our carpets.  It has a plastic cover for the top and is easy to clean and empty.  Appears well built.  Overall, I am glad that I went with a brand name verses a generic Chinese product.</li>
    <li> It worked really well the first 4 or 5 times that I used it but now it hardly works at all.</li>
    <li> For a gimicky type of product, this does the job pretty well. Dead clothes are dead clothes in all honesty, but using this fuzz remover will give your favourite pullover a little extension of its natural life span.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver, it made a lot of my shirts new again, but you have to be careful with wrinkles, if you shave them you can get a hole. Just use a pillow and you will be good to go.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that said this was helpful for removing cat hair.  I used it repreatedly to try to remove hair and lint from a fleece jacket and cuorduroy pants with NO results.  It is useful as a pill remover but should be advertised just as that.</li>
    <li> If I hadn&#x27;t already thrown away the packaging, I would have returned.  It does not work.  I put the batteries in, turn it on.  It starts running.  I put it down to the surface of my sweater and it stops running.  A total piece of junk.  Send me one that works</li>
    <li> I have two of the smaller shavers, and they work alot better than this one.  This one is too big and it does not do the job like the smaller one I have.</li>
    <li> This is such a great sweater shaver! It takes care of the pilling and is so much less time consuming than some of the other types of sweater shavers I&#x27;ve used. I was very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> This is a must have product. I had a basic Fabric shaver but it was weak. I was shopping for a better fabric shaver and based on good reviews bought this. I am very satisfied with this product. It will not make your clothes brand new again but it will make them pretty good. It is specially good on sweaters. If you don&#x27;t yet own a fabric shaver... get one now!</li>
    <li> Worked great for getting rid of the little fuzz balls that had accumulated on my couch.  The couch looks like new again!</li>
    <li> Works! It is a lot better than the one I had TV marketing one. E-Z to use and clean out holding bin, great price on AZ.</li>
