      <li>However, what was more the case was my hair getting tangled in the brush</li>

      <li>I rarely use the brush, but when I do, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still available in USA</li>
      <li>When we found these at the great price they were listed for, we bought several.</li>
      <li>I love it a lot when I first use it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to find products tailored to shorter hair since most simply will not work.</li>
      <li>This brush is good quality but is much smaller than I imagined</li>
      <li>I thought I would try a different brand because the price was good</li>
      <li>But if you have hair that is short than shoulder length, this is a good brush to use while blow drying your hair.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money</li>
      <li>And just nice to use for short hair.</li>
      <li>This is nice but smaller</li>
      <li>It has just the right size barrel for shorter hair.  </li>

      <li>feel great, just wish the individual knob ends were slightly larger</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t anything hot about it.</li>
      <li>First bought this brush over 10 years ago whilst on holiday in USA.</li>
      <li>First use</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it on hair more than 2-3 inches long or curly.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use for short hair</li>
      <li>and it keeps the curl when I am blow drying not too big and easy to handle.</li>
      <li>but I love the way it warms up when you blow dry.</li>
      <li>Good, long lasting brush.</li>
      <li>What I received was the large antistatic model by mistake.</li>
      <li>The concept of this brush is pretty cool (the barrel absorbing blow dryer heat, thus curling the hair), and it actually works, -</li>
      <li>FAST shipping, HIGHLY recommended!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Now when I brush my hair, the gentle massage,  once comfortable touch of my head skin became sharp scratch.  </li>
      <li>Love this round brush.  </li>
      <li>THIS CONAIR SMALL ROUND BRUSH IS PERFECT FOR MY SHORT HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD</li>
      <li>It could be the bristles but it makes my hair curl funny unlike another brush the same size.  </li>
      <li>A little smaller than I would have liked, but works well for short hair.  </li>
      <li>No problems with it so far.</li>
      <li>However, after only few month of use, most of the tip balls fall off.  </li>
      <li>I only bought this as a back up when I don&#x27;t use or don&#x27;t have access to my heated hot brush.</li>
      <li>This is the third of these hair brushes I have ordered - the first two were correct, this one is a much larger version.</li>
      <li>It is a small round brush but its nice</li>

<li> I love the small size of this round brush.  </li>
<li> Too small to really be of any use.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s way smaller than I expected</li>
<li> I have straight thick long hair.  </li>
<li> I think if the brush was re-worked with different bristles, (that didn&#x27;t grab the hair so tight)</li>
<li> The brush was a little smaller than I  </li>
<li> it works, doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair, looks like it will last me a lifetime - or at least until I let my hair grow out and need a bigger one.</li>
<li> Not really their fault</li>
<li> not very aesthetically pleasing-</li>
<li> My hair is naturally wavy and not too thick.</li>
<li> This is a small (1 inch) brush made for short hair people.</li>
<li> Be careful!</li>
<li> this is not a hot curling brush as advvertisesd.</li>
<li> /&gt;Would recommend if you&#x27;re looking to purchase a small brush for short hair.</li>
<li> I think I purchased this because of too much static in my hair, and I&#x27;m sorry to say that instead of helping, this made it 10 times worse.</li>
<li> Always need a brush with close, tightly packed bristles to grab my hair, but not the type that scratch your scalp and fray your hair.</li>
<li> It brushes through my hair without much trouble and does the job to styling my hair.  </li>
<li> I got the medium size, its actually really small.</li>
<li> I bought the wrong brush, this one is for short hair.</li>
<li> I have hair past my shoulders</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for years and the other was worn out, but very hard to find these.  </li>
<li> It catches my hair and pulls it too hard sometimes, but I knew that would happen when I bought the brush.</li>
<li> and gets tangled easily in my thick</li>
<li> /&gt;It is very small-</li>
<li> the diameter of the brush is approximately 1/2 -3/4 of an inch&lt;</li>
<li> Threw it away as it is useless to me and too inexpensive to take the time to return.</li>
<li> Definitely the worst hair experience of my life happened with this brush.</li>
<li> and it was painful trying to get it out.  </li>
<li> It hurts a bit. :(</li>

    <li> this is not a hot curling brush as advvertisesd.</li>
    <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great brush, large and well made.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Always need a brush with close, tightly packed bristles to grab my hair, but not the type that scratch your scalp and fray your hair. My hair is naturally wavy and not too thick. Length above the shoulder.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed ;o)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great styling comb and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I think I purchased this because of too much static in my hair, and I&#x27;m sorry to say that instead of helping, this made it 10 times worse. I used it once and then stopped.</li>
    <li> No problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> This brush is well made.  It has just the right size barrel for shorter hair.  Hair does not get tangled around the brush.  It is easy to hold as well.</li>
    <li> Definitely the worst hair experience of my life happened with this brush. I have hair past my shoulders and I think this hairbrush is for very short hair. Anyways my hair got so tangled in this brush that my boyfriend and I had to tug and cut a lot of my hair out of it. Be careful!</li>
    <li> I like it works well on short hair/</li>
    <li> Nice brush! It&#x27;s easy to use and comfortable to hold. My hair comes out great! Very happy with it! I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> Good quality. And just nice to use for short hair.</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ve been trying to find these thru our suppliers for quiet some time. When we found these at the great price they were listed for, we bought several.</li>
    <li> First bought this brush over 10 years ago whilst on holiday in USA. Now on it&#x27;s last legs and I was so pleased to find it&#x27;s still available in USA so have purchased another 4 via a friend in NY to ship over to me - that&#x27;s how good it is!</li>
    <li> This brush turned out to be just what I had in mind.  Round hair brush, diameter as expected, and bristles comfortable on the head--not scratchy.  Good choice.</li>
    <li> feel great, just wish the individual knob ends were slightly larger</li>
    <li> Very easy day to day brush.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I would have liked, but works well for short hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it on hair more than 2-3 inches long or curly.  It would get tangled.</li>
    <li> I love it, it works great to give my hair lift and life.  It is as good as any I have had.</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong brush, this one is for short hair. But if you have hair that is short than shoulder length, this is a good brush to use while blow drying your hair.</li>
    <li> I got the medium size, its actually really small. I recommend getting the biggest size possible. Other than that no issues its a pretty good brush.</li>
    <li> Great size, though I only received two, not three. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> What can I say....it works, doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair, looks like it will last me a lifetime - or at least until I let my hair grow out and need a bigger one.</li>
    <li> The concept of this brush is pretty cool (the barrel absorbing blow dryer heat, thus curling the hair), and it actually works, - I got perfect curls.  However, what was more the case was my hair getting tangled in the brush and it was painful trying to get it out.  I think if the brush was re-worked with different bristles, (that didn&#x27;t grab the hair so tight) it would be a vast improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for years and the other was worn out, but very hard to find these.  First use I remembered why I like these brushes.</li>
    <li> THIS CONAIR SMALL ROUND BRUSH IS PERFECT FOR MY SHORT HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CONAIR PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my hair.</li>
    <li> I thought this was an actual blow dryer brush, not a brush to use with a standard blow dryer. Because of the way it&#x27;s packaged, I couldn&#x27;t see that there is no power cord.</li>
    <li> Too small to really be of any use. I knew it was smaller but thought it would still work &amp; I wanted a smaller brush for my camper. This just doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> It is a small round brush but its nice</li>
    <li> The brush gets caught in my hair.  I guess it&#x27;s for very short hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for blow drying my hair. It lifts from the root and makes my fine hair look thicker and fluffier, without pulling it out.</li>
    <li> Brush was much smaller than I had thought it would be. Was hoping it would be a replacement for a brush I currently have - not even close.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect for short hair that needs all the volume is can get. I t gives me enough body and I don&#x27;t need to use a curling iron. Lasts well also.</li>
    <li> The display was not right,it made me think it was an electric curling brush.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t anything hot about it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase because I have an older one that my daughter is using and I had to search the internet for this exact brush. So we both have one now. Good, long lasting brush.</li>
    <li> The brush was a little smaller than I  thought but I love the way it warms up when you blow dry. Does a good job to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. Easy to use for short hair and it keeps the curl when I am blow drying not too big and easy to handle. I love this brush.</li>
    <li> This is nice but smaller than I thought it would be.  Brushes hair well and survived my blowdryer.  I would recommened a bigger brush.</li>
    <li> Great hair brushes.  Been using this type for 25+ years.  Walmart had them for a while .. but I know I can always count on Amazon to have what I want!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller! FAST shipping, HIGHLY recommended! Thank you! AAA+++</li>
    <li> This is the third of these hair brushes I have ordered - the first two were correct, this one is a much larger version. Threw it away as it is useless to me and too inexpensive to take the time to return. What I received was the large antistatic model by mistake.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try a different brand because the price was good&lt;br /&gt;on this brush. It works fine it is just that I guess I am just too used&lt;br /&gt;to using the Spornette brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way smaller than I expected and I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use it. I wanted a larger one. Not really their fault I&#x27;ll give it to a friend. It&#x27;s a perfectly good brush.</li>
    <li> I love the small size of this round brush.  I liked it so much i bought 3. One for home, gym bag and work!</li>
    <li> Love this round brush.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a small (1 inch) brush made for short hair people. Conair should indicate the diameter of their brush</li>
    <li> I love it a lot when I first use it.  I have straight thick long hair.  It brushes through my hair without much trouble and does the job to styling my hair.  However, after only few month of use, most of the tip balls fall off.  Now when I brush my hair, the gentle massage,  once comfortable touch of my head skin became sharp scratch.  It hurts a bit. :(</li>
    <li> I tried to curl my hair using this, and my hair got stuck in it so I had to cut a chunk of it. I googled it and found another video of a girls hair stuck in the same brush</li>
    <li> Works great- BUT- the diameter of the brush is approximately 1/2 -3/4 of an inch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very small- not very aesthetically pleasing- and gets tangled easily in my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The measurements given on the website- includes the length of the bristles-</li>
    <li> This brush is good quality but is much smaller than I imagined it would be for a &amp;#34;small size&amp;#34;.  It could be the bristles but it makes my hair curl funny unlike another brush the same size.  Good product but don&#x27;t work for ME, which is why it only got 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, great for the money. Holds up over use. Ordered a second one.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend if you&#x27;re looking to purchase a small brush for short hair.</li>
    <li> Yanks hair it is awful</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this brush can definitely deal with it well. It&#x27;s nice to find products tailored to shorter hair since most simply will not work.</li>
    <li> I only bought this as a back up when I don&#x27;t use or don&#x27;t have access to my heated hot brush. I rarely use the brush, but when I do, I&#x27;m satisfied. It catches my hair and pulls it too hard sometimes, but I knew that would happen when I bought the brush.</li>
    <li> Good brush. Well worth the money</li>
