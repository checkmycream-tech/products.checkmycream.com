<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it but Im guessing my face has to first get worst before it gets better Ive been using this for almost a week now so ill give it time to see what next</li>
    <li> I love this natural soap. I use it on my face only.&lt;br /&gt;I actually firms the skin and brings a natural glow.</li>
    <li> I guess it worked because the person face cleaned up but not fast it took a while!!u just got to stick with it</li>
    <li> This soap was exactly as it said it would be. Love it. Will be purchasing this again at some point in time.</li>
    <li> Very good soap, good for your hair and skin. I wash my hair only with the soap, it makes it soft and strong.</li>
    <li> Shipment was very prompt and the product met advertised specifications.  This is a great product and I would recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> When I read poor reviews about this awesome cleanser, I get very agitated.  This soap is wonderful!  Period! If you&#x27;re not familiar with it, then move to a commercial pretty brand that pleases you.  Stop leaving negative comments about the good stuff that African women prepare by hand.  This soap has been around for CENTURIES and multiple uses!!!! It&#x27;s not now that you&#x27;re going to leave ignorant remarks of something you obviously know nothing about.  Go buy some Dove and be quiet.  Thanks. -_-</li>
    <li> I sent this to several people who have ALL raved about how wonderful it is.  The goal is to keep the young women looking young forever, and to make those of us who are no longer spring chickens look youngER.  Seems to be working for the gals in the frigid North as well as the grannies in the tropics!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer. Have always had a good experience with this seller. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap for cystic acne on my face.it arrived very quickly and as soon as I used it I could already tell the difference.it left my face feeling soft and smooth.I love this soap and I highly recommend this soap to everyone.this soap has already dried up most of the bumps that was forming on my face and the sheabutter in it makes it feels so good.I will never use store bought soap again.truly a blessing and soap is 100%pure natural</li>
    <li> This soap was wonderful although it did not look like the picture (I&#x27;m glad).  The soap was a Golden Color and looked Pristine compared to other african black soap.  If makes a thick, pure looking lather (like the other african soap)and makes the skin glow .  It seems to infuse skin with the shea butter making it feel  moisturized.  I like both raw african soaps.  I hope they keep making soap like this so that those with weaker stomachs will try African Black Soap.  I think this one is more moisturizing than the plain african black soap.</li>
    <li> This cannot be raw ABS like the description suggests. If it is, then it&#x27;s the lowest quality raw ABS I&#x27;ve ever seen. Maybe I got a bad batch but what I received was incredibly hard, dry and crumbly. The color was very light through out instead of being a medium-dark brown. Unlike all the other ABS I&#x27;ve used, this soap makes my skin horribly dry. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now, my skin is peeling and I&#x27;m debating whether to throw away the rest of it or try to salvage it somehow.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for me. I absolutely love this soap. It leaves my skin feeling like silk. I rarely even use body lotion anymore. I gave a piece to a friend of mine and she thought it was fabulous as well and I ordered some for her.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. The delivery was on time. the lather on this soap is marvelous. I diluted with warm distilled water and put in 5 8oz bottles.  I used on my hair and to wash dishes. Leaves me squeaky clean. Other people said it left their skin dry because the soap thoroughly cleanses, my skin was not dry.  The smell is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend for people to try.....a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the price was good also.......................Merry 2011 Xmas!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it does not last long. It is so soft that I use it up too fast.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  Gave some to my daughter and now she is hooked on the stuff as well.  Package contained four hand sized chunks and several smaller.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Dove was my usual soap of choice for my face but about a month ago I went to a skin care spa party where we had facials.  The products that were used broke my face out and left my skin extremely irritated.  I started using Dove again in hopes of clearing up and repairing my skin, but I was really interested in using a natural product that was less drying and chemical free.  I read the other reviews for this soap and decided to order it for myself.  Well the first time I used it, it tingled a bit but in a good way.  After using the very first time, my face was very soft and smooth and immediately felt less irritated.  It&#x27;s only been 4 days but I can already tell it&#x27;s healing my skin.  I&#x27;m also using a small amount of Raw Unrefined Shea Butter as a moisturizer and I really love the way my skin is feeling and looking.  I&#x27;m looking forward to the blemishes lightening up and hopefully disappearing all together.  I even lathered a bit of it up to use as a shampoo.  So far I&#x27;m loving the results and I believe that I&#x27;m now able to say goodbye to Dove forever... Thanks for such great products!</li>
    <li> At first I was very impressed with all the good reviews about this soap so I went ahead and ordered 2 blocks the first time. I got through 2 little pieces of the first block and had to stop using it because I started breaking out in little bumps on my arms and on my face. Two of my friends also ordered this soap at the same time I did and they also experienced the breakout and discontinued use. It did make my skin feel squeaky clean, but the breakout is what caused me to stop using it. Now I have all this soap that I have to throw away. I won&#x27;t be trying it again.</li>
    <li> I have been fighting moderate acne for over 12 years.  I&#x27;ve been on and off Prescription medications for this stubborn condition for the entire 12 years. In just one week of using the African Black Soap and  Raw African Shea Butter, my skin looks AMAZING! In just ONE week, my skin looks better than it ever has in 12 years of using prescription meds.  Natural is the way to go!</li>
    <li> *UPDATE* 9/27/2012: even though this soap didn&#x27;t work for me, my sister swears by it. she&#x27;s been using it regularly and she swears it got rid of her BV (bacterial vaginosis), athletes foot and this weird fungal infection on her body. her skin looks great- it even cleared up her acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think it&#x27;s fair to say that if you have sensitive skin, then you would be better off looking for a gentler soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my sister has \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin...she can sit in the sun without getting sunburnt (she only gets tan), wear cheap metals if she wants to (i&#x27;m allergic) and can use virtually any skin product without fearing that it will give her a rash. if you are like her, then you have nothing to lose by trying this soap. if you&#x27;re like me, then just be cautious and pay attention to your skins reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even though it didn&#x27;t work out for me, i&#x27;ll be buying more to give to my sister since it has worked out so well for her :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, in case you didn&#x27;t want to read my rant (totally understandable): my skin had finally cleared up after a six month bout with eczema. Upon using this soap, my skin got markedly worse - I now have patches of eczema on my face that are bleeding. :/ Every ones skin is different, I already know that. Just keep in mind before buying this soap that it isn&#x27;t a cure-all and will sometimes not work as it claims it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After suffering from an extremely bad case of eczema for six months, I finally went to the doctor and was prescribed prednisone (an anti-inflammatory pill) as well as triamcinolone acetonide cream. Good news is that the combination of these two made my skin calm down and go back to normal almost immediately. I was told that once the eczema cleared, I should start doing \\&quot;preventative maintenance\\&quot; (which is what I was basically doing for those six months...little did I know, they just kept my eczema at bay...not necessarily getting worse or better). The prednisone made my skin breakout terribly...to the point that I wouldn&#x27;t go outside (definitely worse than having eczema). So, after doing some research, I stumbled upon this soap - Raw African Shea Butter Black Soap from Ghana, that claims to help with eczema AND acne. I was beyond excited and ordered some immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have been a little too eager the first time I used this soap, because I actually got deep scratches all over my body that started bleeding from it. I didn&#x27;t let that stop me though- I moisturized with jojoba oil and tried again the next day. During my month long experiment with this soap, I found that the best way to use it for people with skin like mine is to take a block of it (think of the size of a normal bar of soap) and while in the shower, rub it between your hands until a rich lather is formed (which happens fairly quickly, might I add). Then, hold the soap in one hand and with your free hand, rub the lather over your body. Repeat until body is finished. It takes a little longer but in my experience with this soap, I absolutely cannot have it rub directly on my skin...there are small \\&quot;ash\\&quot; granules in it (this soap is made from the ashes of various plants) that do not dissolve easily and can definitely cause a scratch or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case anyone is doubting my credibility here or thinking I did something wrong to cause this to happen...I didn&#x27;t leave the soap on for a god-awful amount of time and I thoroughly washed it off after each use. I take short, luke-warm showers. The only thing I have actually changed in my beauty routine in the last couple of months has been this soap. And quite literally after the fourth use, I developed contact dermatitis (a different form of eczema) all over my body. I couldn&#x27;t wear jeans because of how itchy my legs were, and I had to wear baggy shirts because there were patches all over my stomach, armpits, chest, back, etc. I had to have my hair up in a bun for well over a week because any hair on my chest wouldcause this terrible itching sensation. My bangs had to be bobby pinned up because my forehead was covered with patches eczema that looked like mass amounts of small pimples...my cheeks were covered with the itchies, too. Overall, bad experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to give up hope though because of how amazing everyone was saying this soap was...so I quit using it after the fourth application and began using my eczema cream until the itchiness left. After a week or so, I began using this soap again and after the fourth application it came back just as noted before. :/ I kept using it though because I thought that maybe it was something else. Nope. It is the soap. Sigh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I had high hopes for this soap and really hoped that it would work. I just can&#x27;t use it though. I still have terrible acne on my face right now from the prednisone and large patches of eczema from this soap that aren&#x27;t responding as well to the prescription cream as they were before. I gave this soap 3 stars because it does lather well, I like the smell (very earthy!) and it does one hell of a job leaving my skin squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my sister has been using this soap ever since I bought it and she actually swears that it has gotten rid of her BV (bacterial vaginosis - basically, a smell \\&quot;down there\\&quot;) as well as this fungal/bacterial (I&#x27;m not sure) thing that is all over her body that causes white spots of discoloration on her skin. She was really embarrassed by it and the spots actually have disappeared! I&#x27;m so happy that she has found a cure and that this soap can be put to good use...now I need to find a soap that will cure my skin...</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail today and it looked really nasty I was kinda scared to touch it but any way I did and took a nice size chuck out of it and made some liquid soap for my face I used it for the first time a few hours ago and it was pretty nice for me it dried me out a little bit but a lot of face soaps do that to my face but other then that it was all good I won&#x27;t have to buy any face soap for a long long time Great buy</li>
    <li> I decided to go the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; route and stop purchasing ProActiv. I started using the black soap and it instantly cleared up my skin. I loved how smooth &amp; clean my skin felt. And then.. 2 months later, doing the same routine, my face broke out HORRIBLY! I thought it was something else, but my sister did the same routine and 2 months later? SHE broke out too.</li>
    <li> I love the soap and it works wonders especially on the face. It&#x27;s good for the whole body.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. It may not be pretty, but you won&#x27;t care! I ordered this soap hoping it would help clear up my skin. In just a week my skin is less oily, and perfectly clear! This soap leaves your skin squeaky clean. It eaves your face feeling like you had an estheticians facial, firm and taught!&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my hair. Wow at the lather! And once again, left my hair literally squeaky! I may look into buying this wholesale to offer to my customers, I love it that much!</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this soap. I have to hide it from my family. They love it</li>
    <li> Soap looks like a stone but the quality speaks for itself, all great things in the world dont look good except for I-phone :-)) ..It is a great moisturizing soap and lathers well,  it is made of natural products like shea butter!! Highly recommended and multiple times better than say a Dove soap which is full of checmicals.</li>
    <li> OMG this soap is amazing!!! It really does what it says. Smooth skin, really cleans does not dry the skin  and even tones down the dark spots.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to use on her face and it did a good job for her skin.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. I was a little skeptical at first, but I&#x27;m glad I ordered it. It came the next day. Why use soaps that are harming your body with chemicals when you can buy something that is 100% organic and from the earth? Not to mention it does a better job. I don&#x27;t like to use it on my hair, but it has done wonders for my face. I&#x27;ve had acne for years and while my prescription topical cream has been working for a while, this made my complexion much better and cleared it up even more. And again, no chemicals. This is a no brainer :-)</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product a few months ago, was about to order another, when i was the price had gone from 6.25 to 13$ ,effectively doubling the price, i will be looking for another type of raw african black soap from a different distributor who dosn&#x27;t double the price.</li>
    <li> love it away buys this kind</li>
    <li> I will never use store bought soap ever again. It is so cleansing, but in such a gentle way. After using it for about 2 days I saw a radiance in my skin that was not there prior to using this soap. It is truley a wonderful product that will benefit anyone who uses it.</li>
    <li> I received this so-called soap. It&#x27;s very drying to the skin and doesn&#x27;t lather for very long. I have purchased other black soap product with much better results. Try another brand or just go back to products like Dove or Ivory.</li>
    <li> ad says it contains 33% shea butter but the label does not mention shea butter in the list of ingredients. i e-mailed Alive and Aware to see if i was missing something, they NEVER responded. product did not arrive as pictured,it came in a bucket with a bunch of chunks like Jonathan Sabins picture. if it has shea butter i do not know, I like the soap ok, probably order from a different company in the future.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this and I was totally blown away by what it does! Looks funny at first but after using it I couldn&#x27;t believe the dead skin rolling off. Always use the Chaacoca mitt though! This is one product I&#x27;ll always purchase!</li>
    <li> What I like best about this soap is how it sloughs off dead skin cells with very little scrubbing required so it exfolliates without being abrasive like the gritty scrubs are. My pores on my face are very clean &amp; have closed up so I have much smoother looking skin.  One thing that surprised me was how all the clogged pores came to the surface over a couple of weeks use so they could be dealt with once &amp; for all. It didn&#x27;t break out or anything, but rather just brought blackheads to the top so they could come out. After that the pores closed &amp; look terrific now. No more problem skin! I will say that it is very important to put a moisturizer on afterward. I tried the shea butter but in our humid warm climate that broke me out because it traps bacteria against the skin. I use a moisturizer that is all organic except adds a 1% \\&quot;safe\\&quot; preservative that is paraban free. Even if you have oily skin you must moisturize after using the black soap. While this soap is gentle, it is extremely thorough in cleaning so you need to put a thin veil of moisture back to allow your skin to seal itself after this pore cleaning experience. I absolutely LOVE this soap for my body &amp; soaking my feet in a solution of it to soften heels. My heels &amp; elbows have not looked this good since I was a kid! All in all this is an excellent soap and the price is good as well.  Just remember to roll it up in balls &amp; place in a plastic sealed bag because this soap is not hard but a soft hard clay consistency.  You will have to protect it from being wet.  It&#x27;s very easy to use too much soap because a tiny bit of water will gather off a LOT of soap on your hands or cloth. After a few uses I got used to using about 1/4 of what I use of normal soap because this soap is super rich &amp; lathers great.  Can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff! (no I was not paid for this... just a happy customer!)</li>
    <li> I love this black soap, its cheaper than all other retailers and it helps clear up my acne and black spot will most def. buy again!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to buy this product and give it a try and Iam glad I did. At first when I did use it it stinged a little but it made my face very very soft My face looks and feels alot better...will keep u updated after i use it for a month.</li>
    <li> I shampoo my hair with this product and I have gladly replaced salon shampoo&#x27;s for this natural wonder.  My hair is baby soft after I rinse.  I comb my hair w/ a wide-tooth comb &amp; no hair loss!  I&#x27;ve made the choice to use as many natural beauty products as I can and this is a winner for me!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how this was supposed to work but someone said that you have to try it to know the difference between regular soap and this soap so i tried it and it was great. It made my skin feel so amazing and it helped my acne and dark spots and that is the main thing that i wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Disolves very easily and works up a nice lather. Not too odory I found it to be a very light scent that is not offensive. Will definetely be purchasing this product again .</li>
    <li> Buy a few of these blocks! I bought this for my wife and tried to leave it alone. That didn&#x27;t last long.  3 showers in and I broke. I was too curious.  So, I lathered up with what was left of the blob on the tray....&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m hooked. The stuff lathers up better than most soaps I&#x27;ve used.  No, it&#x27;s not the best smelling... actually has no scent, but it will clean you like nada else.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it for my hair, then tried shaving with it. Perfecto! Razor bumps? Nope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, buy a couple of these and you won&#x27;t be sorry!  This is not a fake review by the way. Just one husband who felt kinda guilty for contributing to the quick demise of his wife&#x27;s stash (even though I bought it). LOL</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying I was pleased how quickly this product was delivered...however the advertisement states this product is \\&quot;1lb Raw African Shea Butter Black Soap from Ghana\\&quot;, this absolutely is not at all what I received!&lt;br /&gt;#1) The picture is obviously used to entice the consumers, what came was a crumbled mess of dehydrated vegetable glycerin that had remnants of what I&#x27;m guessing was to resemble the ingredients of what would be in the real deal soap. Even the wrapping (kitchen plastic wrap) was labeled vegetable soap.&lt;br /&gt;#2) Shea Butter most definitely does not smell or look like vegetable glycerin...\\&quot;Shea butter originates from the Karite Nut tree, also called the Mangifolia tree, found in the semi-arid savannahs of West and Central Africa\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I rated this two stars because I have used vegetable glycerin soap before and it does have many purposes; such as my husband at times can be a bit of a grease monkey, and this soap cleanse his hands without the harshness &amp; drying side effects other mechanic soaps have/will. I definitely  know I was extremely over charged for what this soap actually was &amp; will never purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> This product is so great I can&#x27;t stop talking about it. My feet sweat so much, now no more sweat. My children and I have a very dry skin and have tried every lotion there is but once the lotion wears off you can see the dry scaly skin again. I cut pieces for my children to try and all our skin problems are gone.&lt;br /&gt;No more sweaty feet.&lt;br /&gt;No more feet odor.&lt;br /&gt;No more scaly dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Brown spots diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;Black &amp; white heads clearing.&lt;br /&gt;Our skin now are so soft.&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it claims to do. I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a review for this African black soap for the longest, but now I have almost a year of using the product daily to truly back up my opinion!   First off, some background- I had gone through using many &#x27;organic&#x27; and dermatologist recommended cleaners to help with my horrible consistently bad acne, all to no avail. So after taking the initiative to end my skin problems once and for all I did some research and stumbled upon raw shea butter, also known as African black soap. It&#x27;s created using ash from roasted plantain and palm tree leaves, cocoa pods and shea bark then coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oils are added and the mixture cures for about two weeks until it solidifies and becomes &#x27;soap&#x27;. You literally can not get more organic than that! If all of those oils scares anyone with acne prone or sensitive skin, I have a news flash for you- oils are GOOD for your skin and will not clog your pores when combined with the natural, vitamin rich cleaners like the plantain, palm leaves, cocoa pod and shea bark ash. The &#x27;soap&#x27; arrives in a big 1lb. hunk/block and I simply cut off a chunk about the size of a typical bar of soap and then moistened that chunk with a little splash of water and molded it in my hand until the substance became pliable and rounded. I did this so that any potentially jagged or rough pieces of ash could be worked out and prevent my skin from being cut, which another user experienced and submitted pictures of. This is one draw back of using organic products, but it&#x27;s more proof that this is a totally natural soap! Usually these bar sized chunks would last me about two weeks, and I typically wash my face 2-3 times per day. All in all the 1lb. hunk lasted me about 9 months which is pretty amazing when you consider that it&#x27;s only $11!.   Experience: The shea butter/ black soap (I really can&#x27;t decide the proper term for it) surprisingly lathers extremely well- more than any other soap I&#x27;ve ever used, one rub with a moist handor washcloth will give you enough suds to wash your whole face thoroughly, yes I&#x27;m serious. I highly (can&#x27;t stress this enough) recommend using luke warm water, or even on the colder side when washing with the shea butter. For some reason when the temperature of the water is too warm, the shea butter soap suds cause a burning sensation which also dries out the skin, but when used with cooler/ warm water it&#x27;s perfection. It&#x27;s very cleanings, always removed the toughest eye makeup and caked on foundation leaving my skin squeaky clean and clear! Black heads on my nose always removed, blemishes cleaned and not irritated and before long I noticed my blackheads were completely gone- all day long, and my problem areas and old acne scars were vanishing before my eyes. I primarily use this soap on my face and any random area that has a blemish pop up and it always gets rid of the issue.  I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this wonderful, natural soap enough! I&#x27;ve converted my mother, sister and a few friends and they all swear by it like I do! Yes, it&#x27;s not your conventional cleanser, but it&#x27;s the best you can buy! Don&#x27;t damage your skin and strip your natural oils with synthetics and chemicals when you can clean and enhance your appearance with a natural product straight from mother nature!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love everything about this soap.  It is all natural with no chemicals or preservatives added.  It has a very mild odor and leaves my skin feeling very soft.  I&#x27;ve noticed after using this soap for a little over a week, it has made my skin look more \\&quot;even and smooth\\&quot;.  I have also noticed that I don&#x27;t have to use as much underarm deodorant, it seems to have helped with odor.  Now I know what you&#x27;re thinking....Eww, body odor...  I work in an environment where I do tend to sweat a little and this soap has seemed to help control the typical underarm odor FOR ME.  I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, just what I&#x27;ve observed for myself.  I bought this soap along with Unrefined Raw Shea butter and use it after I shower.  I have the softest, smoothest skin of anyone I know :)  Not to toot my own horn... ;-)  One thing I can recommend, do not leave it on your face for a significant amount of time, it does tend to sting a little.  I had a few spots on my face that were pink (one is from the sun and the other I think was a small scar) and both pink spots have almost disappeared.  I&#x27;m so amazed with this product, I have recommended it to all of my friends and will definitely purchase more in the future!!  The product is as described and shipping to my location was fast!  Thank you for such an amazing product!  5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this african black soap for acne bc i was told it works on acne &amp; many other things. I always read reviews before i buy anything on amazon, But it does dry you&#x27;re skin out like i&#x27;ve read &amp; just use alot of moisterizer and you&#x27;ll be fine. And it also made my face soft. So day one went good!! Hopefully this stuff works like everyone says it does..</li>
    <li> I love it. Cleans face very well and a little bit goes last a long time.</li>
    <li> pros   my face is not as oily anymore   Its all natural   the texture of my face has improved  cons   I still get random breakouts   my acne scars are still very visible    kinda irritates sensitive skin if you dont dilute it enough  i use my black soap by adding it to water and making it into a liquid, it lathers very well and feels very nice and silky when it is being applied, it doesnt leave that dry draggy feeling that most soaps leaves behind, my acne has improved alittle but i think i still need to give it more time to work especially on my spots,as i havent seen much of a difference,(i have been using it for the past three weeks...) also i have used it to wash my hair a couple times and i cant say i have had much of a change there either. overall its ok and i would buy it again</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m loving this soap....it really seem to be working on my son&#x27;s eczema.  along with the soap, i use African Shea Butter after his bath.  doing the same thing for myself to work on my stretch marks...looking forward to the results.  i&#x27;m definitely gonna buy more of this....super happy</li>
    <li> Shipping: 4-5 days  Appearance: Nothing like the picture, it came in a air tight vacuum bag in small airy chunks. No bueno.  Smell: earthy, lathers up alright  Feel: Like a hedgehog  I&#x27;ve tried an amazing source of black soap before, and this in my opinion does not add up to my expectations.  Will not be buying again, TOTALLY not worth the price.</li>
    <li> The soap works well but there are chunks of black looking coal in it. This is my first experiance with raw black soap so i&#x27;m not to sure if the big chunks are in all the raw soaps.This soap would be perfect if they took the time to ground the ingredients down more finer. If you are a person that likes to rub soap bars onto your body this soap is not good for you because it will possibly scratch your skin.Its best if you lather it up onto a wash cloth or your hands and then wash. I use it to wash my hair,face,body and its gentle enough to use on my 8 month old.This soap is perfect for natural kinky hair. I have a baby with a really big and thick afro and the soap makes his hair cottony soft and it also makes my locs squeeky clean. I would buy this soap again but I would make it into a shampoo or bodywash because of the rough chunks. [[ASIN:B0036LMFYO Raw African Shea Butter Black Soap from Ghana - 1 Lb]]</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3EQXI4GTWJ6MO]]This is the second order for me cuz I liked the product before. But this time, when I opened the box, I got so disappointed. Is this powder soap or what?&lt;br /&gt;Do you think this is the same product you see in the screen?</li>
    <li> I just recently received my order of this black soap. It came in a large brick, with the texture of a dry dough (like oatmeal cookie dough) and smells earthy, but not at all unpleasant. It breaks apart easily enough, so I can pinch off however much I need to wash my face at the moment, and preserve the rest in a mason jar (it fit into a quart jar with a lil to spare). The soap lather is very soft and dense and I really feel like it cleans my face without stripping away the moisture that it needs. I have very sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or over dry it. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but I have already noticed a change to my overall skin tone. Acne scarring and red blotchiness has lightened, and the texture of my skin itself feels much smoother and softer. I usually am really oily in my T-zone with dryness along my cheekbones. Lately, however, I&#x27;ve had a pretty uniform complexion, my cheeks feel and look hydrated, and my skin doesn&#x27;t get shiny &#x27;til the end of the day- A huge improvement from being only 10 minutes after doing my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good :)</li>
    <li> I like the way this soap cleansed - I felt really smooth and fresh afterward.  But there are some sharp parts that don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re exfoliating, they&#x27;re just rough and scratchy.  Also, there&#x27;s a faint, distinctive bad smell to it that&#x27;s I&#x27;m starting to notice on myself (I shower with it every day).  Almost like a burning smell.  It also doesn&#x27;t suds up as much as I&#x27;d like and it stained my shower brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of all natural cleansers, but this one wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the soap for 3 days. Day one I made shampoo! My hair was so clean and soft and very easy to detangle(I&#x27;m black with natural hair). I&#x27;ve used it to clean my face twice a day!  It&#x27;s amazing so far! I had a dry patch on the bridge of my nose for months...I scrubbed and rubbed and moisturized it but it would go away. The 2nd day of cleaning with this soap and it&#x27;s gone!!! I&#x27;ve even started bathing with it....makes my skin really soft!!!</li>
    <li> Really like this soap. Clean and fresh no hard pieces. Softer than other black soap I use in the past.It arrived super fast. Lathers well. Last a long time little bit goes a long way. S/H is pricey. Need to be wrap better I paid also $20 for this soap including shipping. Really think packing can be better. Will look for a cheaper deal but would buy again. Don&#x27;t think I got a lbs.</li>
    <li> this is a great price for the amount of soap u get. Have bought in the past at an open air market for same amount of soap for much greater cost</li>
    <li> Someone at my job had told me that I should try Black Shea Butter Soap for my skin. Her son had real back acne and it took it all way, it rid his blemishes, her daughter&#x27;s eczema, it provided moisture to their skin and also the skin was smooth. At first she said it would tingle as well so she gave me all the pros and I noticed no cons. So I ordered and man! Was she EVER right. This product...I will always want. My skin is smoother, it&#x27;s taken away the white heads, black heads and even dry skin that was peeling on my nose. I didn&#x27;t experience the tingle. My skin instantly took to it without any problems. My 3 year old daughter also has eczema and her skin is smoother than ever. No more Dove for her. We are black shea raw shea butters. The price is worth it and so it the product. A little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> This soap does not look like much, but looks are deceiving when you compare it to the results it leaves on your skin. I love this stuff. It lathers wonderfully and makes the skin so soft and smooth. I have very dry skin with some discoloration (light and dark spots). The soap seems to work well in providing some improvements of these discolorations. Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> This soap does amazing things for my skin. Dark spots have gotten significantly unnoticed . My face is supple and softer than ever and the liver spots on my arms have faded. I shampoo my hair with it. It works well in solid form and crumbles as needed to make liquid soap, shampoo or body wash. Loving it!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing and it works from the first time , you&#x27;re gonna love it , don&#x27;t miss it</li>
    <li> Helps with my face and body acne.  I use it with my clarasonic (just a lit bit of it) and it lathers up real nicely.  Dried up my skin for a couple of days but it went away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just received my Black African Soap, and boy i tell you i love it. I&#x27;m reading some of the reviews and this lady is talking \\&quot;too much soap she can manage\\&quot;. See you can&#x27;t please people if, she recieved a small amount then she say you didnt get what she paid for. I love the soap i just use a knife and slice off a small piece and place it in my soap dish. I take off a tiny piece, wet it and rub it together and then place it on my face. Yes, it does dry the skin out, so i bought the african shea butter to moisturize my face. But let me tell you, my face feel clean using this soap. I&#x27;m yet to try it on my body and see  how it works. The shipping was fast because they stated it would reach by the 4th of January 2012 and i recieved  it lastnight. It&#x27;s worth the price with a deal where you spend 25 or more to get the free shipping. Best thing since slice bread in my opinion. Oh before i go, i store it in the bag it came in then place it back in the package and place it under my bed. Go buy the product you will feel the difference. No they not paying me to say these words trust me but i&#x27;m happy i bought it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for three weeks, and my pores are disappearing before my eyes! My skin is terrible, lots of blackheads, scars, and large pores. Makes me feel clean and refreshed! I mosturize with coconut oil after washing and I am good to go!! Recommend to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> My order was super late! They apologized for the delay and said they were sending me a free gift in return for having to wait so long. So what is the gift you ask? NOTHING.... I even emailed them about it, not just because the order was hella late, BUT it came looking nothing like what I orderd it was light brown and round. It literally looked like two turkey patties. They should not send you something that looks NOTHING like the picture then make you wait 2 months to get your product then turn around and say your order is on it&#x27;s way along with a free gift but then nothing. So irratated. Never again. They lost my word of my mouth advertisment which I do for every product that I enjoy. Their loss.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and all of my grooming products are fragrance-free. I am beyond pleased with this product. I also use it as a shampoo (I have afro-textured hair) with great results. I do recommend using a moisturizer after bathing/shampooing with this soap, and also watching out for rough pieces leftover from the making process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that breaking off chunks to use, rather than soaping with the entire block, is most useful. I also left about half of my soap wrapped loosely in plastic on a bedroom shelf, and when I used it six months later, it worked completely fine. I love that it has a long shelf life without drying out! I&#x27;m definitely buying this product again!!</li>
    <li> I thought Dr.Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap was wonderful but this is even better! Especially for acne. Its only been exactly 6 days. First 3 days I purged on areas I expected to purge because I had too many small bumps along my cheeks. While that was happening the large pores on my cheeks are dramatically getting smaller that it looks like I never had any at all.The old acne i had before using this product was drying up and getting smaller quickly as well. It takes off my makeup with little effort and when I clean it with my toner I do not see any left over makeup. The last 3 days of using it I&#x27;ve notice my face has a matte and slight dewy look. Usually at the end of the day my t-zone looks like it could reflect light. I didn&#x27;t have to use my oil absorbing sheets for the past few days. Even though its been less than a week I really can&#x27;t help but notice how my skin is looking. For people with really bad acne who has been using chemical base products expect a bad break out with this. I believe it sucks the crap outta your face so you just have to wait it out. I hope this product works for others because this is a great affordable soap for people with problem skin. Also  I&#x27;ll make sure to up date my journey with this product since I had such little time with African black soap.</li>
    <li> This product had very sharp bits of something in it - twigs, perhaps -- which made it very difficult/painful to lather on your body like regular soap.  I expect that is the case with other Raw African Shea Butter Black Soaps.</li>
    <li> Wow it looked like a crumbly fruit cake when I first saw it with a sweet earthy, nutty smell - pure wholesome natural goodness to me! I sliced it into 4 pieces and took one piece to shower with and oh my it really does lather up, it really does deep clean - you feel SUPER ultra squeaky clean after and it&#x27;s not too drying due to the fact that it contains big chunks of pure Shea butter. I was told that if you have oily skin then use only Black African soap, but if you suffer from dry skin like me then use the ones that are mixed with Shea butter. I always always use the unrefined pure African Shea butter after showering so if you feel its still drying after using it then moisturize! I keep mine in a small air tight container in my shower and made sure that no water gets into on the advice of the other reviewers on here. Yes there is a little black residue which I presume comes from the extract of plantain skin but hey the benefits far out way a little bit of discoloring on you wash cloth which washes away any way! I am now a conformed naturalist in my bathing routine and have thrown out all of my Aveeno&#x27;s and my Dove&#x27;s, no more chemicals!    However I will be shopping around other sites for better deals as I would like to start buying it in bulk and store it in a large air tight container.</li>
    <li> I did not really know what to expect with buying this soap, but I am pleased with it.  It comes looking like a mini wood log wrapped in brown paper (like a paper grocery bag), within a plastic tub. Definitely no cost in how they packaged it, but it is no issue for me.  I cut the soap like a salami/sausage and wrapped the remaining soap in a ziplock bag for later.  this soap is great for really dirty or greasy hands because it has a texture to it that will exfoliate and rub off anything that is on your skin.  So be careful if you are not using a washcloth. This can be harsh if rubbed against your body (skin) too hard.  It has no scent so it is good for men and women.  It is not too drying, just normal.  You do feel clean after using it.  There is no soap residue either.  It is a brown soap, clumpy and reminds me of a dirt claud.  My son told me I was bathing with a lump of dirt!  Ha ha!  The soap can fall into pieces easily and I smash it back together. It is definitely an \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; soap.  It is a good soap for the price and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this to cleanse my face for about a month now and at first my skin felt dry but I used a toner and a good moisturizer and my skin looks and feels great. This is a product that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have very dry sensitive skin with rosacea.  It seems that any product I use causes irritation, break-outs, or discomfort.  I was getting really tired of trying every product on the market and not getting any relief.  Not to mention all the money I was spending on items that didn&#x27;t work or caused harm!  I don&#x27;t know how I came across it, but I saw something about African black soap and was intrigued by all the positive reviews.  I also liked the idea of going natural - no more fancy products with ingredients I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  I admit to being very skeptical at first.  The product was so cheap, how could it possibly work?  And I&#x27;ve been burned so many times before.  After almost of month of debating it, I took another leap of faith I decided to order it and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  It does not turn my face red; though I do find it to be drying (I use raw, unrefined Shea butter to combat the dryness).  It leaves my skin feeling clean and the smell is quite refreshing.  Nothing artificial or perfumey - just very natural.  And the lather is so creamy.  If I get a pimple, this soap seems to clear it up pretty fast.  Like I said, it&#x27;s drying, but I think in time my skin will get used to it.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, just give it a try.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, I know, but so far I&#x27;m thankful I took a chance on it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had any bad side effects other than the slight dryness.</li>
    <li> Purchased some of this and so far i am seeing soft results. I am satisfied this far with it. At first I was skepticle, but now I am convinced.</li>
    <li> Intention:  I purchased this product with the intention of treating my moderate acne.    Presentation:  The Shea Butter Black Soap arrived packed inside zip plastic bags. The presentation is very rudimentary and is prone to crude jokes from friends (it looks more like something else rather than soap). However, this is expected from Raw Unrefined Soap.    Procedure:  When you apply this soap to your face, it feels VERY greasy. However, after you wash it out, your face feels soft and clean.    Conclusion:  The reason I gave it two stars is because I had read somewhere that unrefined shea butter African soap was a miraculous cure for Acne. However, after using it for a week, my acne broke out horribly. I had to make an emergency stop to CVS to get alternative acne treatment products.    Recommendation:  This product may be for you if you are looking for a humectant, or if your acne-prone skin is not oily. For me, it was counter-productive.</li>
    <li> It did the opposite it MADE my face break out , so had to stop using it.. also, you can not use it as a bar soap..it falls apart, very soft.. you have to break off small pieces and mix with water in a separate bottle so it is like a liquid soap. Might work for someone, not myself though..</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help with my mild acne, as I heard it is great for clearing up acne and to even your skin tone.  It definitely helps to keep my acne at bay, but it is not a miracle product for acne.  I believe that it does help to boost your skin care fight against acne, but is definitely not to be solely used alone to treat it. I use it in conjunction with raw shea butter and my skin is definitely smoother.  I am a medium brown toned african american woman and I do still suffer from hyperpigmentation which is what I purchased both products for, but it doesnt seem to be helping as much with that issue. Overall it gives your face a very clean squeaky feeling.  Im sure with time I may see more noticeable improvements.  I have been using this product for about four months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap as lot of people were highly recommending this product for sensitive skin. The soap comes in big chunk of &#x27;soap bar&#x27; and it need to be cut down into smaller peices ... it lathers easly and it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin but you will feel like nothing on the skin (not like other facial cleansers as you &#x27;feel&#x27; a film of product is left on skin even after rinsing). I use it on my combinational and acne prone skin .. I am use it for about a month (I switch between this soap and my regular facial cleanser daily). I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin by using this soap, it might because I am not so strict to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to cleans my body as well and it feels so good. I love how it keeps lathering forever (even when it is in the size of rice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to be able to purchase this product again as it saves money on saop and it feels good on skin.</li>
    <li> This product is a must. I wash my face with it every morning and night. My face actually shines afterward. You get your wash cloth nice and hot and put a pearl size chunk on the cloth and work into a lather, wash face and neck, then rinse. I take it in a small container with me on trips. I&#x27;ve turned friends and family onto this product. Yes you can take it in the shower with you as well. The only down fall of this company is in the way they package this product. They must improve on it. When it is delivered to me I like to put it in a glass pyrex dish with it&#x27;s lid. It keeps it fresh. Anyway, purchase it and enjoy. ~V~</li>
    <li> What shea butter?  Advertised as \\&quot;33% shea butter\\&quot;.  However the label on what I received is this:  \\&quot;RAW BLACK SOAP  100% Vegetable Base  Ingredients:  Traditional Black Soap contains mainly water, cocoa pod ashes, plantain skins ashes, and palm oil.  Imported from Ghana\\&quot;  Fine - but where is the advertised shea butter?</li>
    <li> my skin was so dry and white after taking a shower It&#x27;s better if you buy the raw African black soap.</li>
    <li> I have tried several versions of African black soap, and this is the best of all! I&#x27;ve recently been trying goat&#x27;s milk facial soap, but they all burn my sensitive eyes. I tried this on my face and it did not irritate my eyes at all!  The lather is fine, creamy, and abundant, not slimy. Very faint/natural soapy scent, not gritty or burnt-smelling as some African black soaps are. It left my face feeling clean without any tightness. A pound of with will probably last me a couple of years. A little goes a longway. Highly recommended as a body soap, complexion cleanser, and shampoo.</li>
    <li> My step daughter wanted this. It looks like a rock to me but she assured me that thats what she wanted and she says its great.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser, but feels waxy after rinsing. Maybe this is typical for black soaps? It melts very well if you choose to put it in liquid form for easier application and washing</li>
    <li> I love this soap and the way that it was packaged. The soap was shipped at a timely matter and the soap is easy to break up so that I do not have to get the whole pound wet in one use. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it makes my face feel so clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> This soap makes me itch and break out in a rash.  However, I think it smells nice and lathers well.  It also left my skin, the 3 times I used it, very soft and moisturized.  Even though it didn&#x27;t work out for me I would recommend that people give it a try.  Maybe it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I received my black soap, and it was exactly like the picture shown (the tree stump looking one). My Black soap is smooth to the touch, so I am assumming that it is fresh. After using the soap the first time my face did feel dry, and had a slight tingel to it, so I used a little of my Ivory Shea butter, and it went away. I think this is WAY MORE product than I will ever use, but am happy about getting my money worth. The problem I am having is that I am not sure how to store it to keep it fresh. Currently I have plastic wrap around it, and placed it into a ziploc bag.</li>
    <li> The soap it God sent.   The first time I used it I could feel the difference... THE VERY FIRST TIME.   My skin felt clean and smooth, but kind of dry.   The first couple of times I used it, it was very drying.   But now, two weeks later, its not so drying.   After you use the soap, just make sure to lotion with good lotion (pure or organic because store bought lotions are FULL of chemicals).   I ordered some Jojoba Oil (Pure and Organic) and it moturizes my skin perfectly.   I use the Black Soap and Jojoba Oil (Pure) together, great combination.!     Well worth the price because black soap last sooooooooo very long.   Check youtube.com for video reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the black soap for more than two weeks and am satisfied with the result. I have combination skin and occasional breakouts. After reading all the good reviews, I wished to use the black soap to control oil in the T zone and minimize pores. The first time I used it to wash my face, it left the skin a bit dry and dull-looking. In the past two weeks, there was no dramatic improvement but my face did become less oily in the T zone. I&#x27;ll continue to use the black soap and report any new results.     By the way, some reviews said good things about using the soap as shampoo. I can&#x27;t speak for all, but personally I would not recommend using the soap on the hair. I have fine straight hair, and the soap left my hair dry, tangled and hard to comb through.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in April and I am just now running out of it.  It arrived in the same looking block as pictured.  It has helped to smooth my skin and clear up my acne.  I gave some to one of my teen twin brothers and he stopped using his prescribed medication because this soap started to clear up severe acne within two days.  I will be cutting this one short so that I can go order some more now, for me and for my brother!!  BUY IT!!!!  It is so worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of raw soap.  This one was a pleasant surprise:  - Softened and moisturized my skin  - Lasted a long time  - Great on the face  - Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still undecided but I like this product so far..... it is really great at getting my skin cleaner than I have ever felt before. when I get a few acne breakouts I reach for this soap to clean my face with and when I do they seem to clear with no extra effort on my part. the part I am not so sure about is that it is suppose to help clear away marks and dark spots and I am not seeing that as quickly as was promised, and it has been about 3 straight weeks now since I have been using the product. But I will continue to use the product and see what happens, but generally it does lather like crazy, I like that it gets my skin squeaky clean I like that even more.</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday. I tried it last night and to my surprise it reminds me of a laundry soap in the Philippines. The name is PERLA, this is a laundry bar soap for white clothes to whiten them but a lot of people are using it as a facial for their acne and guess what? it works. The consistency, smell and the after result of using the shea soap is very similar to PERLA. I wonder if they use the same ingredient in making the soap. I don&#x27;t have acne on my face. I am only looking a soap at the same time a moisturizer that does not have a strong ingredient to it. So, I thought this shea soap is all natural base on alot of positive reviews here. After using it last night my skin was dry. So, I just put shea butter on my face but I did not put moisturizer on my body. I&#x27;m really curious what they mix with shea soap. The packing it not presentable at all. I really don&#x27;t mind the packing but I hope they put the ingredient on it. PERLA has a strong ingredient and can whiten the clothes. So, I&#x27;m not sure yet if I will like this shea soap.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dark spots on my skin which formed after shaving. I love black soap. It does tend to dry my skin after bathing or showering but I use shea butter on my skin afterwards. I love how clean my skin feels from using black soap. I will buy more. Its great to get rid of itchy skin. I also love the earthy smell of the soap. I store my soap in an air tight container so that it isnt contaminated. I use my soap with a loofah and my skin looks clearer. The dark spots are lightening some have faded away.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  It has great antiseptic properties that help clear up break ouys caused by dirt and oil. Because of this it can be drying so you will need to use a good moisturizer afterwards.  Make sure that the moisturizer isn&#x27;t to oily otherwise you will re-clog those nicely cleared out pores.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin so soft. Also smells great:)</li>
    <li> I absolutely am in love with this soap! I started breaking out on my chin and neck after I turned 31. Nothing I tried to clear up my face was working. I came across this product and decided to give it a try. It works soo well to clean and clear up my face. I love the clean and natural sent that it leaves on my skin. I will never go back to another cleanser! I have sensitive skin as well, as this has not irritated it at all. I use Cetaphil face moisturizer after washing my face because it does tend to dry out my skin a little. (but I have naturally dry skin) I have recommended it to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> My skin feels amazing after each use...my breakouts have decreased 100%, my skin is also less oily. It has made such a magnificent difference in my skin care routine, in addition to darkened pigmented spots, on my already cocoa complextion, begining to fade. I have got my teenage brother loving it, my mother whose in her late 50 &#x27; s and others sharing. Will be purchasing again soon.</li>
    <li> This soap is great and makes my face and body feel so clean. I feel like it is toning my face and slowly getting rid of my acne. It is really fresh too so it needs to stay out of any moisture so it does not get smaller. Break off a piece and use it and the amount you don&#x27;t use just put it back. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been showering with Pears soap for several years, (and buying it by the case) but when I went to purchase another case recently, I read some reviews stating that the formula had been changed rather drastically and the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Pears soap was nothing like the old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try something really different, and boy, did I find it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RAW AFRICAN SHEA BUTTER BLACK SOAP FROM GHANA arrives in misshapen broken chunks in a plastic tub. (SEE MY PRODUCT PHOTO) Though this in and of itself is not really troubling, my wife took one look at it, raised her eyebrow and said \\&quot;you&#x27;re going to rub THAT all over your body?!\\&quot; I did. And if looks were the only problem with this soap, I would have given it perhaps four... maybe four and a half stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some big issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost is its abrasive nature. While most \\&quot;abrasive\\&quot; soaps (think \\&quot;Lava\\&quot;) have their abrasives mixed evenly throughout the bar (or fluid, for the pump-type soaps), the abrasives in this soap seems to be rather unevenly distributed...and more importantly, sized. On two occasions while showering, it felt as if there was a tiny bit of very sharp rock embedded in the soap and I emerged from the shower to find large, red scratches on my skin. (SEE MY OTHER PRODUCT PHOTO)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m done showering with this stuff. It&#x27;s one thing to scratch the heck out of my arms and chest. There are other parts I REALLY don&#x27;t want scratched with bits of crud from who-knows-where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the soap lathers really well and the fragrance is, while tough to describe, anything but girly. It&#x27;s kind of an earthy smell, but really, it sort of defies description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other factor to consider is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all that long, which in my case is not really all that awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be throwing out what remains however. It occurred to me that this will be a pretty good soap to keep at the utility sink. As a hand-cleaner, I think it&#x27;ll work rather nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Jonathan Sabinthan Sabin</li>
    <li> It is good at cleaning out EVERYTHING on your face but not so good with the waterproof stuff on my eyes.  I ended up looking like a panda bear with black circles around my eyes.  It is kinda of drying too.  I think other ingredients much be added with the soap to make it more moisturing.  I&#x27;ll use it maybe just once a week for a thorough clean without my make up on.</li>
    <li> I am a real user of this product. I got this on the 6th of August and it is the only soap I use now. I did not expect the quick results. My face is clear of blackheads/whiteheads and it is glowing. The blotches and discoloration on my body is fading😊 (I finally found a soap that actually works).. And for my STRETCH MARKS fading😁 (they are smooth and I can&#x27;t see them disappearing).. I have to buy more after my sister saw the results I gave some to her.... and my mom... and my aunt lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I will say the first time I used it I did experience little stinging but after that none***</li>
    <li> so i just got ma soap and it doesnt look like the picture it comes in a white tub with a bunch of diffrent sizes piece ...gonna start using it wish me luck.</li>
    <li> Soap lathers good and leave, stains on whites, and in the bathtub but I think there were stones in it that were sharp plus pieces of charcoal it does work good I will not buy again.  Yes.  I had to cut in half.  It was too large for the tub.</li>
    <li> No Shea butter, wrapped in paper not plastic bag. (more text to meet Amazons minimum word count - STUPID, STUPID, STUPID)</li>
    <li> I do not buy this. its break up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;its not easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;i am sure you can find somethig better black soap than this.</li>
    <li> I will never use anything else but African Shea Butter Soap from now on!!  I&#x27;m a believer... This soaps not only thoroughly cleans the skin, it also tightens it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khalfani</li>
    <li> Very good soap and my skin loves it. It can fall apart while handling it, but it&#x27;s nothing major that will effect you from getting great use of it. If it does fall apart a little just smach it back together. P.s it came packaged great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 27 y/o white guy in the super dry, frigid tundra of Minnesota.  Because of how dry it is here, my skin gets quite parched.  Being such, I usually only shower every other day and soap up my crevices, while doing a once-a-week full body scrub down.  Any more than this and I leave my skin without any of its own natural oil and I quickly shrivel up like jerky in this arid environment.  So, imagine my surprise and delight when I tried this soap and not only did I feel completely clean afterwards, but my skin wasn&#x27;t dry or flaky at all afterwards!  It has a very earthy, natural smell (think of your grandma&#x27;s basement), and it is a little bit scratchy from some of the ash, which didn&#x27;t get completely crushed/incinerated, and is still technically charcoal.  But otherwise I won&#x27;t use any other soap ever again!  And it came exactly as pictured.  And wasn&#x27;t 1 lb, but 1.20!</li>
    <li> The quality on this one was okay. It was really rough with large pieces of debris. I understand that black soap is essentially a crude soap but I expect better quality than this. I found large (1 in) pieces of debris.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE black soap. I had been buying my black soap from a seller named blackonyx for a little over a year and I did not feel like I was getting my money&#x27;s worth. This seller sends you a HUGE block that lasts for ages! So worth the money! All you need is a tiny quarter sized piece because the stuff lathers really well. It has don wonders on my dark spots and scars. It make me feel squeaky clean when I use it. I would not recommend using it down below because it burned me a little.</li>
    <li> Amazing soap! I have dry, sensitive skin and it worked great. Its probably the best exfoliate I&#x27;ve ever used, but it is somehow non abrasive. It does wonders for the skin!</li>
    <li> It removes makeup very well but also leaves the face feeling dry so you must moisturize after. Most people say it&#x27;s good for breakouts. So far it has done nothing for mine and I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a year.</li>
    <li> Oh, I meant a ROCK in my SOAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used African black soap for a while now.  I have been blessed (cursed?) with very sensitive skin.  Everything on the earth seems to irritate it and leave me with eczema, rashes, acne, etc. but not African black soap!  Absolute heaven for sensitive skin.  I decided to try a new supplier here on Amazon, and here is my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a large plastic Chinese-food-looking container with a sticker on top, and wrapped up inside in what turned out to be a paper wrapper from cement (hopefully not used), but that gave it a very \\&quot;organic\\&quot; quality so I sort of liked that.  My chunk of soap did not look like the block shown in the photo, but was more cylindrical, to fit into said container, and looked exactly like the \\&quot;filth\\&quot; (direct quote from the seller) that another user posted, once I broke it apart into 4 sections.  The scent is very light and natural, love it.  I saw a photo review that included someone&#x27;s body who was all scratched up- and I thought surely he was just applying too much pressure since little bits of plantain skins are normal in this type of soap... Uh, yeah, no.  This soap is full of little sharp shards, and even tiny rock particles, so much that I had to keep picking them out and I used the soap very carefully so as not to scratch my skin.  I posted a photo of the rock in the \\&quot;Customer Photos\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap did something I&#x27;ve never experienced with black soap; it stung my eczema slightly, which leads me to believe the ingredients are not as earthy as the wrapping looked.  Not sure what that is all about, but I guess I won&#x27;t be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now just when you thought my review couldn&#x27;t get any worse? I took one of pieces I broke off and molded it for use.  As I began to use the soap I actually cut my arm!  Wait a minute, that didn&#x27;t feel like a shard of plantain!  I took a good look at my soap and there was a ROCK in my SOAP!  It was a decent size rock, larger than a quarter, and certainly took up some weight of my one pound of soap.  I have posted a photo for all to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes this soap is African black soap, but every African black soap that I&#x27;ve used, whether it be organic, hand made, mass-produced, etc. has been better, and I&#x27;ve never had a rock or been cut by it.  So buy wisely and be careful.  Maybe this was just a bad batch.  I am very disappointed, but my son is happy to have a rock that he believes is from Ghana for his rock collection, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t use the soap/rock on him!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for little over a month, and so far it has worked like charm.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it both as a body soap AND a shampoo, which I would not think would normally be possible...  from my understanding majority of soaps, even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or organic ones are just a bit too harsh for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not this one - it does not dry out the hair, nor does it leave any sticky/greasy residue, that would make the hair look or feel limp.&lt;br /&gt;Just cleans it out thoroughly, makes it feel very light-weight and manageable, and leaves very clean, neutral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same for the soap part: the presence of shea butter helps to prevent potential drying out of the skin, so it almost works as a moisturizer while it cleans thoroughly - once again, with no build up or soapy residue left on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a (very lightweight) block, that is easy to break apart.  Since it has tendency to absorb the moisture easily, I just keep the bulk of it in a Ziplock bag, and dissolve several pieces into a plastic bottle with a flip top and use it as a liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for its versatility and effectiveness!!</li>
    <li> Was a little thrown off bc the texture was a little different than what I was used to but I always love Black Soap and 1lb was bigger than I thought so this was a great deal!</li>
    <li> I love this soap so much! I have oily skin and it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t rough at all and it doesn&#x27;t have a smell. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I saw this product for the first time on Dr. Oz as an aid for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an exercise specialist so I sweat a lot sometimes teaching up to six classes per day.  Living in the North East with the drying winters wrecked havoc on my skin.  I would buy expensive moisturizers, lotions etc. but my skin would be dry very shortly after showering with the friction of the gym clothes rubbing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my soap two days ago and wow!!!  I only changed the soap to have an honest opinion.  My skin is still soft after teaching three classes and it is not ashy. I have been using the same body lotion only changing the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really works.  The difference in my skin is obvious after just four showers.  I AM SOLD.  I had never heard of this before.  Way to go Dr. Oz for doing the research making it easy for the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product.  Lathers easily, not very scented so good for sensitive skin types, moisturizes and soothes dry chapped skin.</li>
    <li> I love this soap... I use it more so in the evening when taking off makeup. I have terrible acne problems as of late, and was hoping that this would help with that, but it really didn&#x27;t... still have small breakouts, and I still have the hideous scars and red marks... Nonetheless, it definitely takes off all my makeup, and it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin at all. It comes in a huge brick, and I just take off a small amount for the week. I leave most of my soaps in the shower, but this you cant, it&#x27;s very clay like, and if you&#x27;re not careful, it will all melt away. Also, be careful of the small flakes... Apparently, it&#x27;s normal, but they can hurt a little if you&#x27;re caught off guard by them.</li>
    <li> This really does work. I have dry skin and this soap has a great lather and my skin doesn&#x27;t look flaky at all. It looks and feels moisturized. Will buy this again. And what a big bar. I could easily make 3 or more from this chunk.</li>
    <li> I love this--it is great for your skin. It lathers up good. I always re-order when I run out.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. It works well on face and body, but I will not use it on my hair as it gets very dry, very easily. Lathers awesome and gives a super smooth shave! My face feels squeaky clean but not dry when I use it.   I just break a little piece off to keep in the shower and replace as needed.</li>
    <li> i threw this away. smells gross, is horrible on hair. my skin started to look patchy and weird. i will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> I received the package quickly which was nice; but upon opening it I found it was just lumped into a large plastic bag; not made into bar&#x27;s as shown in the picture. Also it was full of little hairs, like facial stubble hair, or animal hair... It all seemed a little too sketchy for me and I ended up tossing it. I wanted to like this product, especially for the price, and all the positive feedback I have read about black soap; but this purchase was a major disappointment. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ive tried many acne products on my face such as Aveeno, neutrogena, clean n clear, clearasil, proactive, etc. After researching the harmful chemicals in them which could potentially cause cancer or other issues I began searching for natural products. I tried Burt bees but, pimples would disappear then reappear shortly after use. I came across African black soap yet, it wasnt the 100 percent pure kind from ghana and the soap didn&#x27;t work for long. I decided to purchase the raw African black soap from ghana and its the best soap i have ever used on my face. It keeps the pimples away for a very long time and seems as though it cures acne problems all together. Bar soaps are already great for acne but with the ingredients in raw black soap its even better. I use this in combination with aloe Vera or burt bees spot treatment and my face is clearer than any product could have made it. Its worth a try, thanks for this great soap</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t ever use any other soap on my face again!  Pimple healer!  Be sure to use a moisterizer after about 5 minutes after your face is dry.</li>
    <li> So before my mother had introduced me to this probably like a year ago she told me how i could use it on my face and it would help clear up my skin. so I used it once or twice a week and it worked wonders. This one is totally different I broke out on my chest and my back from it but yet my skin was soo dry.</li>
    <li> We love this soap. I shared this with my daughter and my mother n law and she fell in love also. It is a bit crumbly but that is probably the way it is suppose to be. Thanks for the fast shipping. Will definitely order again. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will definitely keep purchasing this item.  It really is a great natural way to clean your skin.  Definitely my new beauty secret!</li>
    <li> When I opened the box, I could smell the fresh scent of the soap, that&#x27;s the only way I can describe it, fresh. Mine looked exactly like the main picture, and was definitely a pound or more in weight. It took awhile for me to get accustomed to how to lather the soap, and yes there are tiny fragments to be aware of. After the first use, my skin actually looked brighter, and after 2 weeks of use, the hyperpigmentation scars on my face are getting lighter, my stretch marks are minimally smoother, and getting better, and the bright, glowy look of my skin is being maintained. I&#x27;m noticing that the more I use it, the more my skin seems to be learning to hold on to moisture, meaning that my skin is not drying out halfway through the day anymore. This huge block seems like it will last a very long time, as long as you keep it away from water when not being used. I love it, and I will never switch back to regular soap!</li>
    <li> My mom and my sister decided to buy this soap from some street vendor in Harlem. I cannot express how much I love this soap. At first I was a little annoyed because it is quite sudsy and takes a little extra to wash all the residue off your skin. I&#x27;m pretty sure I have combination skin that&#x27;s prone to acne breakouts. I also had quite a few dark spotes that resulted from acne and this soap has literally made them disappear. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than four months now and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how clear and soft my skin is. I wash my face twice everyday, in the mornings and at night. I&#x27;ve also noticed that this also works as a make-up remover. Like many, I&#x27;ve tried tons of over the counter acne medications and washes that haven&#x27;t done much for me. This natural soap has cured me of my acne problems and I&#x27;m so grateful for it! Nowadays I only break out when I&#x27;m PMSing and it&#x27;s never more than one or two pimples here and there. I recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> This is REAL black soap.  It cleans your face like nothing else can.  It&#x27;s a cleaner and exfoliator all rolled into one.  If your skin is sensitive it may be too harsh for you.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using black soap and I was impressed with my results, it came in a clear plastic bag. I made my own liquid soap from it (as shampoo) and used the regular soap to shower. It was wonderful on my body, face and hair. I only use Dove soap because I have sensitive skin but now I don&#x27;t think I will go back to using anything other than black soap, plus I love that fact that this soap has the shea butter included. But be aware for females...it does sting if too much gets in your private area. Other than that...I love this product and use it everyday in the shower and on my daughters hair as well.</li>
    <li> I recently turned to organic health and beauty products to help with my acne and dry skin, and found everything I used helped more than any mainstream product.  Unfortunately, this product hurt more than it helped - it left my skin tight and dry when used as a body soap, my scalp dry when used as shampoo, and caused huge break outs when used for the face.  I gave it two weeks before I turned back to burts bees for my face and doctor bronners for the rest.  It didn&#x27;t work for me, so be warned it might not work for you.  The soap arrived early, is loved by most reviewers ( I guess I&#x27;m just weird) and seemed like a quality product, so it only loses two stars</li>
    <li> I used this soap several times, it&#x27;s a good soap and cleans my body well.  I also used it as a shampoo for my hair, but definitely use a moisturizing shampoo afterwards.  The reasons why I gave it one star are: 1. this soap was terrible on my face, it caused me to break out and it&#x27;s caused a burning sensation on my face. 2. The soap has some very sharp materials in them, use a loofah instead of rubbing the soap directly on your skin. 3. This soap did not arrive in a nice big block, but it was all broken apart.  It didn&#x27;t matter to me, but I still used it.</li>
    <li> Nice soap. This soap was less powerful than common bar soaps of these days and nice. It seems very earthy, which makes sense considering it&#x27;s used to clean off earthly impurities. The ash, small chunks/streaks of char, swirls of shea butter and more rarely bits of uncombusted (plantain skins?) are prominent. Ask yourself, does this make sense? It&#x27;s not a hard bar of Dial hand-soap with powerful sudsing properties and a sharp scent- or even a common oil-scented boutique bar. It can soak up some water and get soft. I think that is kind of nice compared to a powerful soap, the black soap gives more leeway without &#x27;drying&#x27; the skin.  I may well order this again soon, or perhaps another &#x27;humble&#x27; soap. Peace and remember my only teacher: the whole Earth to the gentle and kind!</li>
    <li> cleans entirely, good for oily and normal skin. Don&#x27;t leave on face for too long, &#x27;cause it might cause undesired dryness.</li>
    <li> This soap last longer but I don&#x27;t know how to store it properly. I did seal it tight so no moisture could get to it but my biggest concern is making it last longer than it has now. I did use this on my face and body... the result is my body is nice and smooth but my face still has pimples but it&#x27;s drying in. I tried using it for my hair but my hair is a lot so the soap almost done even though I chucked out a nice big one. Can any one help me on the pimple part and hair part of using African Shea Butter Black Soap?</li>
    <li> If anyone has this same experience as me please respond and let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 5 weeks. The first 4 weeks i was amazed!!!! i told everyone i knew about how it cured my acne and even sent some to my cousin by mail for her to try, (as she is plagued with horrible acne as myself.) It had really been a miracle and cleared every spot of acne and blemish i had on my face! I would use twice a day everyday, and follow with shea butter as a moisturizer.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of a sudden i break out almost everywhere on my face!!!!!:/ I have tiny bumps, (all even in size) and lil white pus-filled bumps in places i&#x27;ve never broken out before! I know some ppl may attribute this to purging, but is it really??? could i be allergic to it?? should i stick it out and see if my skin balances and clears up again?? If this has happened to anyone else please give me some advice!</li>
    <li> Not like the soap my mom gave me, this stuff burned my skin. Cant use it everyday so this will last a long long time. Not what i expected and not like the one I had before that worked well and not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived in timely fashion and it&#x27;s very different from anything I&#x27;ve ever bought, let alone washed with. It&#x27;s very rugged and rough but soft at the same time. It smells very different too. I like the way it makes my skin feel after I shower. The look is off putting but it&#x27;s well worth it. I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> My skin looks better each day. I have used this soap as a facial cleanser and shampoo. I really like the results. My skin does not feel dry after using it. Lathers up a lot so a little can go quite a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before it really cleans my skin. I would recommend you use a good moisturizer after your shower because it tends to dry your skin if you don&#x27;t. Other than that great product!</li>
    <li> THIS SOAP IS NOT THE NORM, IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE ALL THE PERFUMES NORMALLY IN SOAPS, BUT IT IS REALLY NICE; IT MADE MY SKIN FEEL SMOOTH, NOT DRY AND TIGHT. THE THOUGHT THAT IS REMOVES ACNE DARK SPOTS IS ALSO A PLUS. I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE OF THIS SOAP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. Dries up my pimples and helps to even out my skin along with using shea butter as a moisturiser</li>
    <li> 2 words, Loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me and my wife use this soap every day, it has helped our skin out in so many ways tremendously. It&#x27;s soft and you can shape it into a regular bar of soap if you like. Here is what you do, you break off a very small piece get in the shower/tub let water hit your skin place the soap on your skin and the soap automatically starts to lather. Once done your skin feels refreshed, nourished, and warm. No need to put on any lotions or oils because this soap tells your body, unh unh we don&#x27;t need any of those chemicals in your skin today :) You will notice a big change while drying off, I guarantee it!</li>
    <li> After reading so many great reviews and seeing videos on youtube, I immediately ordered the soap and desperately wanted it to work for my acne problem that I have been dealing with since a teen, now 45 years old and still deal with acne...errghhh.  Anyway, this soap did tighten my skin and made it feel very clean but after a week or two of using my skin started breaking out worse, especially in areas that I never even had acne before.  Now I have even more blemishes to deal with too.&amp;#34;  Not to mention, my skin was actually doing pretty good before I started this but just wasn&#x27;t moving fast enough, so I decided to try ABS hoping to get faster and better results.  Well, needless to say, I&#x27;m back to my original regimen and my skin is doing better already.  I hate that I have so much of this soap left. I only used like 2 small pieces of it.  Maybe I could use it as a body soap?  Hopefully, it won&#x27;t do any harm there.  If anyone is reading this and would like to purchase the remaining portion that I have, please contact me.  Will sell at a reasonable price.  Blessings</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent in that it lathers a lot, cleans my skin really well. Could actually feel that it unclogs the pores. What I do is I cut it into smaller pieces and rub with some water on my palm to lather it. Don&#x27;t try using the soap directly onto your skin as it has lots of debris inside (looks like little pebbles inside) and could hurt your skin. After use, remember to apply moisturizer. Skin can get really dry afterwards. I use jojoba oil and Shea butter. If it was not for the little debris inside the soap, I would have given it a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 28th Oct 2012&lt;br /&gt;A better way of using the soap without getting hurt by the little debris I mentioned is by adding water to the soap. Cut a small piece of soap and put it in a small container with almost equal amount of water, let it soak in and liquefy the soap. Then just pour the liquid part onto your shower sponge. Discard the debris.</li>
    <li> I begin using this product to clear up my acne and I use it for my entire body. Love this soap.</li>
    <li> Just what we wanted, nice.</li>
    <li> I have really bad Acne and well with this soap it has helped me get rid of them little by little. Also I had some really scars on my face do to acne and little by little they have gone away... of course this is not the only thing that I&#x27;m using but I starting using this and I had great results from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a friend of mine had really bad dry skin on her knees and I told her about this soap and since she has been using it... the dry skin has been going away too. I really love this soap I tell everyone about it.. :-)</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It is awesome since I&#x27;ve tried it a year ago, I have bought singer bar of commercial soap. I have a family of six with all different skin types from oily, to dry, eczema. It seems to work like magic for everyone. My mom and sister and her family now use it too. I also use it to bath my dog. Seller is awesome as well.</li>
    <li> Amazing soap! I used it for my body, skin, and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after one week, my soap disappeared. I think one of my sisters took it, which shows you how great this is.</li>
    <li> This product irritated my skin as well as cut me... I will not EVER purchase this soap from them again. Nor will I recommend anyone to buy</li>
    <li> Great quality, I&#x27;ve bought from here a few times and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. Since I started using african black soap I never buy any other soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 years of age I have acne prone skin this product is good it help even my skin tone made it more smooth even somewhat clear my ance up I still get pimples but it&#x27;s not as bad as before my suggestion is I wouldn&#x27;t use the soap everyday espically if u have acne basically it brings pimples and blackheads to the surface of your face be gentle when using it because with my experience I kept using it on my break out areas and it Lelf an scar somewhat but ance clear up I would find a good facial moisture because It would help with the dryness this soap can cause using it frequently overall this is a good product i will update my progress in another 3 months it&#x27;s only been a month and a half</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly!  I purchased for my face because I have mild acne and sensitive skin.. well.. I cant say that it worked wonders but I also didnt give it much time before I stopped using on my face. However I bathe with it daily and it seemed to help with my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I think it&#x27;s a great product just not sure if it is beneficial for my face.</li>
    <li> For anyone out there searching for a natural skin healing product, this is it. Been using for about three weeks and already my skin is in better condition then it has been in years. So glad I found you. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the soap can&#x27;t believe it manages my acne like it did in less than a month I get 3 or so bumps every now snd then especially if I drink caffeine but irs usually gone within 3 days...it doesn&#x27;t help with my spots though...but its better than anything my dermatologist ever prescriped I&#x27;ve been using it just over a month now I love it except it dries my face out a lot</li>
    <li> Package delivery was on time, the bars was not as big as advertise (2 small bars). Once open but to my surprise, there is no smell and the texture is very soft like cookie dough and I only use a pea size portion to lather up.  After applying on my face for the first time pat and dry, my face was soft with no patches of dryness after washing. I even waited  15 mins later to see if the dry patches appear, None What So Ever. The shea butter added has really been a big help in moisture my face before applying my coconut oil moisturizer  \\&quot;This is the bar for me, my face loves it\\&quot;. I will continue to purchase more in the future, the item is prices though but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Love love this product.  I will not go back to regular soap.  I use for hair, face and bath/body.  Has been beneficial for my hair, only use this do not need conditioner any more.  My hair is not brittle, seems thicker and I use less product when styling.  This has helped with age spots on my face along with other products I have learned about from Amazon reviews, thanks Amazon customers.  This soap has helped with dry skin, I love using a hot tub, but it can be drying to skin.  Use  the liquid sometimes for convenience, but I had to buy the solid again, I cannot do without it.  It lasts a long time!  I am addicted to this product, hope I can always get it.  Will continue to buy, love Amazon</li>
    <li> First and foremost I love the fact that this is an all natural soap. As a person with oily skin I can say that this soap is a miracle worker. And let me tell you, if you bathe with it, you&#x27;ll feel so super clean that you almost feel old soap scum coming off. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel soft but the smell is not good at all. Also the hard bits in it irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Be careful not to get in eyes as it burns much more than regular soap.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FACEBOOK FRIENDS TO BUY IT  SUCH AN EXCELLENT GOOD MOISTURIZING SOAP I EVEN USE IT ON MY HAIR GREAT STUFF</li>
    <li> I bought this soap a long while back and can still remember the rich lather that this soap gives off and the way it is good for the skin. I don&#x27;t recommend using this on your face more than twice a day because this soap is very strong and may cause more harm than good. It has a pungent smell but not bad in my opinion and you can even wash your hair with it, just ask your beautician her opinion first if you use chemicals like the salon. I learned this soap is hand made and is 100% pure. I have been using it every since along with Dove, you can order it on line or go to a local store that sell this type of product, you find this in Publix or Kroger. Try it, also men can shave with it.</li>
    <li> I love Black soap and I like this product. I will order it again in the future I just wish the packaging was consistent whenever I ordered.</li>
    <li> So.. I ran across a review of african black soap on Youtube that one of my fav gurus had done. And decided to try some out. I ordered it on Saturday and it arrived today(Wednesday). Yay! Very quick delivery. I have face wash that I use daily but after using this soap I&#x27;m passing my face wash off to my boyfriend!  I ran warm water on my washcloth and used a small piece of the soap to get a little lather and washed my face. It definitely leaves the skin clean but not dry at all. I then applied a small amount of moisturizer. I don&#x27;t really have skin problems other than dark spots on my neck. Cant wait to see what the future holds for this product and my skin.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this soap cause it is all natural, it came in a sealed bag and seems fine. After using the soap for a few days on my face with the shea butter my face started itching, i stopped and just use the soap alone and it was the same thing. My face became very dry and then started peeling. I do not blame the seller, i just feel that this product is not for my skin. If you have sensitive skin like i do then be careful. Every skin is different, it may work for you. Sure didnt for me.</li>
    <li> I used this soap  to help me clear up my acne and it works. I heard about it from a Youtube review and thought I&#x27;d check it out. I used to purchase from my local African Supermarket but realized that I got more for my money by ordering it online. Not only was the product authentic but the shipping was fast and my product was secured properly. Have and will continue to order!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife, and she has been using it, I decided to sneak a piece from her and wow what a refreshing soap. I love this product, and will buy a few more LBS of this stuff for both of us.</li>
    <li> very nice gets you squeaky clean and no dryness afterwards</li>
    <li> very good product for face with acne, thoroughly cleans the skin as well as the whole body! my recommendation for girls</li>
    <li> I have used in my skin (oily) and works very well, but the soap break easily, so I dissolved the soap with water and mixed with essential oils geranium (from Africa) and copaiba (from Brazil).</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time purchase of the Raw African Shea Butter Black Soap. For the price and size it made it worth the initial investment. I am familiar with Shea Butter and it&#x27;s wonderful skin care properties as well as a natural/homeopathic healthcare supporter/advocate. I&#x27;ve read numerous benefits and many happy customers of this product. I&#x27;ve used it once thus far (received it yesterday) and this combined with my facial rinse of Apple Cider Vinegar give very satisfying results. I am looking forward to the possible restoration of the skin on my forehead. There is some discoloration due to sun exposure and I hope to even out the area. We&#x27;ll see how this goes.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the product but just getting a little pricey, found it cheaper on another persons page, but would oreder from them if had too</li>
    <li> Bought this soap from a different outlet. This is real soap with lye so beware of getting it in eyes! It is a little drying for dry skin. I added coconut oil by melting soap and mixing in 20%. Much better.  It&#x27;s a good base for making a milder soap.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this soap, I really had high hopes for it. It says its supposed to be more moisturizing than regular ABS because of the added Shea Butter. Well, let me tell you, this soap is THE MOST DRYING soap I&#x27;ve ever used in my life! Its like washing with pure Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, and I do have oily skin, but this stuff is so drying it literally left a layer of ASHY DRY SKIN all over my body, and I&#x27;m WHITE! I&#x27;ve never had ashy skin like black people get on elbows and dry skin sometimes, but this stuff is so INCREDIBLY DRYING it sucks all the moisture out of my skin. And that&#x27;s not even the worst part!&lt;br /&gt;Washing with this is so exfoliating it hurts. And believe me, I LOVE exfoliants and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin by any means. I make my own CP soap and load it up with exfoliants, I can even scrub hard with a soap that has poppy seeds and pumice powder and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. But THIS, is something entirely different! I don&#x27;t even know what it is in the block of soap, but its ALL OVER the soap, so I can&#x27;t just wash with a different area of the soap. It&#x27;s like tiny SUPER SHARP rocks or something, but it literally feels like I&#x27;m scratching myself up with glass. Even pressing super soft still hurts like heck. I could deal with it but whatever it is is extremely sharp so there&#x27;s no way of comfortably using it. I look like I got scratched up by a cat when I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;So THIS SOAP WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I don&#x27;t understand how different batches of the same soap can be so different person to person. I see a lot of people had great reviews about this, and apparently they didn&#x27;t get the soap with the scratchy things in it because if they had, they definitely would have mentioned it in their review! I bought it to use myself and add to my product line if I liked it, but there&#x27;s no way I would subject anybody else to this painful experience.</li>
    <li> I like it but it crumbles easily every time i break a piece off. It also seems to dissolve quicker than other soaps in the shower.  However its not bad for the price and leaves you feeling squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> african black soap is a life saver finally have no white heads, skin is alot clearer then before a bit drying at first but with patience and a good moisturizer it works wonders.I will continue to purchase this soap. Thank you Halaleveryday.</li>
    <li> Like the soap but seems to lose it&#x27;s spark after the first topcoat is used like an old school hot ball candy for those who know about that. It does gives a great natural feeling lather that leaves you clean and wanting more.</li>
    <li> All of the items are awesome picks that use with great satisfaction....what else can one say about quality I love it.</li>
    <li> They gave the right size of 1lb soap as promised, thanks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I shared it, used it, and it&#x27;s time to buy some more. it did not Strip my skin like most soaps, has a nice mild aroma, and is just great! Love how pliable it is and making my own pieces. Be careful with white towels but who cares! It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and son who both have very dry skin and they love it! It looks a little funky in the shower, but if you roll in into a ball and sit it on a small sponge it won&#x27;t run/drip down the soap dish thingie. It makes your skin clean, soft and smooth and has a very nice smell, very light. I even use it on my face! It has a few hard peices that feel like charco or wood but you can pick them out, nothing to get all weirded out about. Absolutely Amazing product and I highly recomment it. I just purchased another pound!</li>
    <li> My 4 yr old has severe atopic eczema and nothing seemed to clear it up. Between prescribed steroid creams and spending over a hundred dollars a month on OTC \\&quot;Dermatologist Approved\\&quot; soaps and lotions that still did not improve her poor skin, I got fed up. I hated seeing my daughter suffer in agony from itching, red , inflamed patches all over her body. I decided to try it out because I saw all of the good reviews. So what the heck...it was a whole lot cheaper than what we had been paying for treatment. Today, my daughter&#x27;s skin has improved tremendously and she barely has break outs anymore. This soap is so mild on her skin and it seems to provide a nice moisture shield as well. The OTC soaps and lotions that we once used to buy always dried out her skin causing severe itching after baths..this soap does not do this. My husband and I also started to use it and have noticed a complete difference in our skin as well. All of our skin is clear, tight, and healthy looking...and soft. I have NEVER had skin this clear in my whole life and neither has my daughter and husband. I even stopped using my OTC Olay Regenerist products, because this works way better and cost less. I can really see that much of a difference. I don&#x27;t even have to moisturize after showering(but I still do, for the extra softness). This soap has totally tightened up my open pores on my face and removes all residue. I am absolutely in love with this soap because it has helped my daughter&#x27;s skin..even though it looks weird. This soap does what it says and is worth every penny. I was not paid for leaving this comment...I am just a real overly satisfied customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I also decided to buy Erzuli 100% Natural Shea Butter for my daughter and I for after shower moisturizing and that is also a great product in combo with the soap. love it!</li>
    <li> I really love this and will never use anything else now that I&#x27;ve tried it. It&#x27;s a little messy and stings the first few times you use it, but I saw a huge difference in my skin fairly quickly from it. It isn&#x27;t pretty looking, but for the results I can over look that! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Melts quickly and leaves a black stain.  Burns on contact with skin that has insect bites etc.  I can&#x27;t honestly say it helped in any way what so ever.</li>
    <li> To be fair, gave three stars only cuz I threw most of it away. May be good for someone who knows what to do with it. Seller was good and all...</li>
    <li> Prior to this soap I used Kirk&#x27;s Castille coconut soap and really like it but it is drying so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  I like the black soap but it is drying as well maybe not quite as much as the coconut soap.  I&#x27;ve used the black soap for my body, face and hair and that works pretty good too.  The down side of this soap IMO is that it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I do not keep it in the water--it hangs in a mesh net away from the shower spray but it seams to wash away while using it.  Also there are bits of bark or something in it so if you shower by rubbing the bar directly on you skin rather than in a cloth it can scratch.  Overall I like it and may buy again.</li>
    <li> I love black soap. It&#x27;s the only stuff that works for my break outs. I&#x27;ve had it before from my family. This is a great amount that they give you for your money, however it is VERY soft. Therefore, it disappears extremely quickly if you do not keep it dry. I keep mine in a soap dish, and I wet an exfoliating face pad, then rub the soap. This helps to keep the soap for longer.     I would definitely buy some more of this from this seller.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market. My skin and hair loves this stuff.  Your skin is left feeling so healthy.. Rapid shipment. Will repurchase..</li>
    <li> So good so right! (no chemicals)I love it,I can even wash my cooch cooch without feeling a tingling sensation (lol) and I even love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Soap is not quite ready to use rite out of the box, I softed it then molding into soap bars. I could deal with the brain stains it was leaving on the tub since they easy scrubbed off, the smell is not very nice since there is no perfume added which is a plus but still. I used the soap for about two weeks till I went through the first bar. Though the winter was doing a toll on my skin cause it felt so tight and dry so I applied lotion after every shower then one day I noticed scaling on my legs as I looked closer the skin on my shins were literally peeling off in sections. Since I was not using any other different products on my body I mediately tossed the soap in the trash. A few week later my skin recovered after using daily oil rubbed and lotion. I think the product has been processed with harmful petrols and eats at your skin. Do think it makes a good shop soap for cutting grease. Do not recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough wonderful things about this product.</li>
    <li> At first glance this soap looks nothing like what I am accustomed to using. However, after washing my face I can say that I am hooked. This soap left my skin feeling soft and radiant. I have struggled with break outs for years, but am so pleased with what I am seeing after using this soap. This is an excellent, natural product which is perfect for anyone who has sensitive skin. I will say that after a few initial uses my skin felt a little itchy but that was only if I left the soap on my face too long. So I would suggest washing off quickly. Overall, wonderful, natural soap with a pleasant light scent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it. ...it was not crumbled apart. The texuture is so nice. It was easy to slice into little squares. No scraping of my skin...just pure cleanliness without drying out my skin. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> The soap can last for a long time when I use it with my bath scrub and keep it dry afterwards. However, if you use it directly over the shower with continuous / running water, the soap will become soft and it can dissolves in shorter time (I divided the big chunk into smaller bars). So, I think if your style of bathing is with continues running water, you may want to find a bath scrub to create a lather first, so to keep the soap longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to help me with my acne and scars. It really worked I am glad I gave it a try I plan to buy more to share with my friends &amp; family. It&#x27;s easy just cut it off a piece and use it. I like that it leaves my skin soft, and it shrinks pores. What more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> Love it.. i keep ordering all the time</li>
    <li> works very well  for my skin amazing. Can be drying  i use shea butter after using  Skin feels squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I started using the Raw African Shea Butter Black Soap four days ago and it has already flattened out all of my acne cysts like nothing i&#x27;ve ever used in my life. It also seems to be controlling my oily skin. It slightly stings acne cysts but then within hours they seem to flatten out. My skin seems brighter so I am hopeful that the soap will also help to lighten my acne marks as well. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I wanted to let fellow acne sufferers know...give it a try. So far...it&#x27;s rocking my world!!</li>
    <li> I was told to look out for foreign material within the soap but I found none, it was completely clean! I know because I crumble it apart and then make palm sized balls that I take into the shower. This is an awesome product with awesome results! I would tell everyone I know to buy this soap but i am trying to keep it a secret!lol And it was delivered on time. Thank you seller!</li>
    <li> Finally I have found my staple skin care product! I am a Black female with a dark complexion and I have suffered from hyperpigmentation and oily skin.  I have tried every product on the market twice and nothing compares to this soap.  Literally after one use I saw a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I&#x27;m still impressed.  My skin is not 100% clear YET and the dark spots are much lighter now. I use this soap twice a day and use a light moisturizer afterwards.  FYI; This soap is potent and if you use a lot of soap it will dry your skin out too much.  Less is more with this soap when dealing with sensative facial skin.  I just use a LIGHT lather and work it into my face and rinse.  Again, this soap is potent and I would rinse off immediately after gently washing my face.  Don&#x27;t let it stay on your face for longer than 1min if that!  One last tip-this soap can become messy when wet, and storage in the shower can be a headache. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to dissolve the soap in purified water and use it like a body wash. I just estimated on the soap to water ratio.  You will be able to tell if you need more or less soap/water by how the mixture lathers up.      This product has dramatically changed the way my skin looks and feels, and I highly recommend that anyone with skin problems give it a try.</li>
    <li> I just started using this soap about a week ago, twice a day. Now i&#x27;m use to breaking in new products and giving them time. I&#x27;m just curious if this soap made anyone breakout badly first? I&#x27;ve noticed at a lot of the spots where there&#x27;s always a little under the skin blemish is where I&#x27;ve been breaking out and I&#x27;m guessing its just by pores clearing out. Did this happen to anyone elsee?</li>
    <li> This soap is so gentle; it could very well be used on baby skin.  After use, skin is so soft and smooth.  No tacky residue; wonderful!</li>
    <li> I dont normally review products, but this one was so bad I figured I should. Definitely not good for acne. It made me break out in small bumps all along the side of my face. The only thing it was good for was fading scars (to an extent) and it did make my hair feel pretty clean. Thats why I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> this is some really great soap ! you have to try it</li>
    <li> This is cost efficient because a little bit of soap turns into an infinite amount of suds. I love using this and it is especially efficient at makeup removal. It is a great cleanser. I&#x27;ve even tried it on my hair as a shampoo before conditioning and it did a great job.</li>
    <li> This is A ok block of soap!  It smells ok but not great!  It does not levee A waxy feeling on your skin!  The only bad thing about this block of soap is that if you have open sores and cracks on your hands it kind of burns rubbing it onto the washcloth!</li>
    <li> I expected this black soap to get rid of my acne on my face and my back and shoulders as the description said it would. But instead , my face broke out even more, it turned red and looked very ashen. My body acne stayed the same and the scars did not go away at all. It&#x27;s nicely scented and makes the skin smooth, but only for certain people and I&#x27;m not one of those people. I can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, so everyone interested will have to try it for themselves and see how their skin fares.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  Soo 4months after use and I&#x27;m just now running out.  This soap is a miracle bar I gave tons away but it still lasted long, kept my acne at bay and I got so many compliments on my skin! I have natural hair and I actuall used this soap to wash my hair, it feels lovely. I think because I cut up the soap into smaller pieces it wouldn&#x27;t lather on some of my thicker bath towels but still this soap is worth it and I&#x27;m now placing my order now again. Oh also I wouldn&#x27;t keep the soap on my face for long when first using it u can dry your face out but I think now I&#x27;ve built a tolerance now. I love it  ORIGINAL  I didn&#x27;t mean to get this soap WITH the Shea butter in it I thought it would be somewhat artificial or not as natural it works well I just got it yesterday and washed my face with it as soon as I took the cheap plastic wrap off....it made my skin feel super soft and my hand too after I rinsed my face my hands felt so soft! My face was clearer and I plan on continuing on with the use of this product I do not advise you to place the soap DIRECTLY on ur face there are some sharp pieces in it that may cut u nothing serious but just lather in ur hand and place on your face I used it as a body soap this morning and again I loved it not one complaint also a little goes a long way! I gave it only 4 stars because I want to see if it works on smoothing out my skin</li>
    <li> First, this is an awesome product. I have plaque psoarsis and have been using this product for over a month. It was recommended that I use it by my sister who is very much into organic products and whatnot. I got a piece of teh soap from her disolved it in some water and use it like a body wash.   ***  Over the past month my skin has cleared up and i have less breakouts. It has a healthy radiant glow and i couldn&#x27;t be happier.   ***  The seller was very prompt with the shipping and the item was exactly as i ordered. I intend of using this seller again and i will use this product forever.   Thanks..</li>
    <li> Chicken bumps on arms and legs are gone. 4 y..o. Sons winter dry skin rashes are gone. It&#x27;s clean smelling. Not wicked though. It does have a brown after drip if u don&#x27;t lay it on an absorbent sponge. I use a loofah that opens n u drop your soap in and close it up. I gotta say be patient. Took about 3 weeks till all our skin issues cleared. Had surgery n coukdnt use it or 2 weeks. Bumps came back. Now I started using it again and 2 weeks later skin clearing. It seems a tad harsh for the face. If u apply n rinse quick it&#x27;ll be ok. I use Clarisonic brush so it does make soap feel more harsh on your face. I&#x27;m sorry for the people who&#x27;ve not had great results. I can only speak for me and my family. I ordered 2 more pounds and am donating all other bar soap. I wish I could have a liquid version for my pump dispenser!  Luv it. Luv the supplier. Fast fast fast shipping. Just give it about a month n ik you will feel the same way!  Before you know it, your skin issues will b gone.</li>
    <li> This soap is truly exceptional. In the past, I suffered from cystic acne - no longer since I&#x27;ve started using this soap. I&#x27;ve have been using this soap for over two years and my skin is better than ever. I also use this soap as shampoo, body soap and I even clean my make up brushes with it. Nothing compares to this soap. I am so glad that it exists!!</li>
    <li> Shipping is fast, and i absolutly love these product, natural, raw, green friendly, clears my skin from undesire oiliness , acne and blackheads, in less than a week is so gentle with the skin ans sutil smell, i usually cuts these in four pieces and they still look bigger than a regular soap bar.</li>
    <li> When I bought this soap, I just added it on as the extra thing to make my order be $25 for the free super saver shipping on Amazon. I did read the reviews early on and I thought, let&#x27;s try this thing out, especially since I was already looking for some natural soap. When it arrived, it looked exactly like it does in the photo. I immediately chopped it into several bars and cling wrapped it for future use and I put a tiny piece in the shower caddy to try it out. I was especially interested in seeing how it would interact with my boyfriend&#x27;s skin since he refuses to put on lotion and has dried skin. After having used this thing for about a month now, I have to say this soap is REALLY awesome. It works for both of our skins. His skin is starting to clear up and it is not even remotely dry anymore. I love this soap for my skin as well and I will keep buying it. I also noticed that it has really reduced the number of ingrown hair I get when I epilate, something I did not expect it to do. I suppose it works the same as black head removal so YAY for me :-D Give this thing a shot, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> My husband has bad allergies which have made his skin very sensitive over the years.  This soap is a so gentle and just works perfect on his skin.  This one adds a little extra moisture/lotion effect.</li>
    <li> It makes my face burn... but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> After a week I noticed changes. Really works, my skin was soft and glowing!!</li>
    <li> I thought this soap would help clear my back shoulder and chest acne. It didn&#x27;t help much and also wanted it to lighten the hyperpigmentation but I don&#x27;t think it did anything. My stomach was black after giving birth and its definitely not anymore but I can&#x27;t be sure it had anything to do with this soap sense my acne and scars didn&#x27;t move a muscle. Its good though for smelling good and feeling squeaky clean after a shower.</li>
    <li> I am a man of 55 years old.  I have been using the Raw African Shea Butter Black Soap from Ghana for about four (4) years.  I don&#x27;t have much hair on my head, but what I have I want to be in good condition.  Also, in the winter when we have very little humidity my skin gets extremely dry and itchy. On my face where I injured myself in a car accident, which led to plastic surgery with a great outcome, the skin gets extremely dry and flaky.  I MEAN IT DID! BEFORE I found this great soap.  Now my skin is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to know: this soap, having no chemical binders and hardeners, is very, very soft when wet.  It is crumbly when dry.  To make sure this never becomes a problem I do a few simple things.  I make sure that the soap dish on the sinks in the bathroom have a lifter which lifts the soap up from being on the bottom of the soap dish.  This allows the Shea Butter to drip and is then ready to splash on my face for extra cleansing and softening.  The soap become malleable.  It can look kind of odd.  Not to be rude, but, it can look like something from your cat litter box.  To keep this from happening I just make it into a square or a ball.  M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shower I do need to protect it from the constant stream of water or it will disappear way too fast.  There are two simple solutions to this: 1) I use a small plastic container with a lid - perfect, though, it does get a bit messy in the container.  Who cares, no one else is looking at it (I hope).  The other thing to do is even simpler, just keep it out of the stream of water.  But know that it will drip a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL OF THE ABOVE ISSUES ARE WORTH THE RETURN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to take the brick of soap and cut off a slice about 2 inches wide and give them as simple gifts to people who have commented on how much they like the soap.  Many of them now purchase this exact product.  You can get a similar product in a bar shape, but, you will have the binders and hardeners in the bar.  You decidewhat works for you - try this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that this is probably not for everyone, but, for me and many of my friends it is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, this soap, being only made with the best natural ingredients will take off almost any type of dirt, even permanent pen marker ink.  I wish I knew how to make it work in the laundry wash.  I think it would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.  If you don&#x27;t like it you can always go to the bar type of this soap, but, I think you will stick with it.  The 1-lb lasts me close to a year, if not a full year.  That is pretty good.  Be well ....</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap from halaleveryday and I&#x27;m not impressed in the least. This soap is very hard; I had to use a sharp knife and bang the blade into the soap and cut into pieces. Secondly, it has LOADS of sharp pieces and rocks that scratch and cut when trying to shower with. Thirdly, it doesn&#x27;t lather up well with a washcloth. Fourthly, nowhere in the ingredients is Shea Butter listed, which means, false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I end up doing was putting the soap in a blender mixed with water and just making a body wash from it and disposing of the settled particles at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to try black soap again, but I will never purchase it from halaleveryday again.</li>
    <li> For some reason this soap was rough on the skin and felt like sharp objects was in it not for me</li>
    <li> Good soap. Keeps skin clear and I use it on my face, body, and to remove make up. Deeply cleanses skin without stripping. I also used it as a shampoo for a month which went well. It&#x27;s better than a sulfate-free shampoo as it&#x27;s natural and leaves hair more moisturized but I will say it won&#x27;t clean scalp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Clean as a whistle!</li>
    <li> My favourite soap! I love the deep cleansing this soap gives. There is no strong scent so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a bunch of scents blending together when you add lotion and perfume to your skin. It makes your skin feel tight and clean. Make sure you use a good skin moisturizer on damp skin after bathing with this soap.</li>
    <li> when i first bought this item, i was not sure if i would like it, but i did!  i am buying a 2nd one now.  it lasted me at least 4 months.  i love to wash my face with this soap.  make up get removed and give a very clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Shrunk my pores and cleared up my acne.  My 12 year old daughter is also using it and it is clearing up her face also.</li>
    <li> This soap is fanstatic.  My skin has been glowing since I started using it.  I cannot believe how clear and soft my face has become since using this for only a week.  This soap lathers up very well and you don&#x27;t need much, so the bar should last a long time.  I will start using on my body soon.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ll start off with the GOOD news! The good news is that is does in fact work(with patience and tolerance). Recently I moved to Bangladesh, a dirty and polluted placed. I had always had acne prone skin but it was under control in the states after finding a product that worked for me. Got here to Bangladesh where the humidity is so high and the air is so polluted that it traumatized my skin! Inflammation occurred and turned into pimples, pimples turned into post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and once again my face looked plagued like it did in high school.&lt;br /&gt;I had heard about African Black Soap here and there but that was it. I accidentally came across it here on Amazon on my desperate search for a stronger cleanser. Anyways, so I ordered the soap, yada, yada, yada, it came in wrapped up in paper looking like feces! But that&#x27;s not the point! My first time using it, of course I wasn&#x27;t gonna see results but after one wash I already knew that it soap was a keeper. It&#x27;s been a little over 4 weeks, and overall my condition was gotten a lot better, inflammation has settled down, my acne is greatly reduced, not I&#x27;m just letting nature take care of the post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;The soap also deep cleans without leaving your face dry, or tight feeling, but I still recommend a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The BAD! Okay so I said it works if you have patience (like you should with any product) and tolerance. When I first used the soap, I wasn&#x27;t stupid like some people who literary put this earth made soap on the skin and got scraped! I had common sense and I lathered it in my hands. Anyways, so as I&#x27;m using it for the first time right, after about 30 seconds I guess, I felt some type of burning sensation in the areas I had acne in. After washing the soap off, I realized that the soap was so powerful (not harsh, but powerful) that it literally melted its way through the thin membranes of my surfaced acne. So I&#x27;m assuming that the sensation I felt was the reaction to the soap on the open sores it was causing from rupturing my acne?&lt;br /&gt;So as the weeks past, the soap continued to \\&quot;do its thing\\&quot; to any surfaced acne while at the same time giving me a deep pore cleanse bringing dirt and oil embedded deep inside unreachable pores to the surface. Oh yeah, and the soap visibly sloughs away any current dead skin that&#x27;s ready to go.  Now some would say that the soap broke me out with more acne but the truth is, I was already breaking out badly before I started using the soap. Eventually there came a point where that burning sensation stopped. As my face healed, and my acne lessoned, the more the soap felt like a regular cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not it, what you&#x27;re reading in other reviews about rocks being in the soap is VERY TRUE! I actually picked through a piece of soap I cut and found like 4 or 5 rocks. Small ones so don&#x27;t freak out! It&#x27;s handmade, from Africa, use your imagination!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with how the soap helped my condition here in Bangladesh.o the soap on the open sores it was causing from rupturing my acne?&lt;br /&gt;So as the weeks past, the soap continued to \\&quot;do its thing\\&quot; to any surfaced acne while at the same time giving me a deep pore cleanse bringing dirt and oil embedded deep inside unreachable pores to the surface.

    <li> This is by far the absolute best soap I have ever tried - and I&#x27;ve tried many. I do not have sensitive skin or anything so I can pretty much use any kind of soap without reaction but my husband has very sensitive skin and cannot use any un-nautrally scented soaps. He started using this black soap about a year ago and he loved it. I refused to try it because it was ugly and messy. Our daughter thought someone pooped in the shower! I eventually tried it because I ran out of my own soap and I fell in love with it after one use. It has a very nice soft scent that isn&#x27;t floral or strong enough to trigger a reaction, it&#x27;s just perfectly soft and clean smelling. It makes your skin feel like silk all day and your whole body feels completely refreshed. Plus, my husband&#x27;s skin is SO soft now I can&#x27;t keep my hands off him. Hopefully, my skin will catch up to the softness of his with continued use. I love it - try it and you will too!</li>
    <li> Again, I thought I had previously reviewed this product but will happily review it again.  I absolutely LOVE this black soap.  I cut off a chunk of the soap, added hot water &amp; bottled it so that it is now liquid soap. I have showered with it, washed my hair &amp; it leaves your skin/hair feeling clean &amp; fresh.  You do need to use a good moisturizer &amp; I had purchased it with the Shea Butter 2lb block so they both work beautifully together.  I have also given a separate review on the Shea Butter, another fantastic natural product. The soap does have a slight plastic odor but it wears off quickly and can easily be covered with perfume.  Since this is a natural product it can also be used on sensitive skin as it has helped with my roscea issues and my daughter&#x27;s acne. Have also given samples to friends with the same positive results.  Will definetly be re-ordering from this supplier.</li>
    <li> **Please note that I am reviewing this for bodily use and not facial use**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this soap for over two months now, and I have to say: make sure you use it religiously! During the first month, I used it only two or three times a week and saw little to no improvement in my skin tone or complexion.  In the second month I decided to give this soap my \\&quot;Optimal Use Test\\&quot;.  This is when I use a product religiously for three months.  I haven&#x27;t even broken the second month of use yet and I have definitely seen improvements in my skin complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a loofah everyday to wash my body, but I was not seeing the results I wanted until I started using this soap everyday.  I was suffering from large pores along the back of my thighs and buttocks had a uneven complexion.  Within a few weeks of religious daily use I started to see my thighs look better; last week I noticed that my buttocks were looking better as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the soap itself, I must agree with others.  It looks like something you pick up off the side of the street.  The appearance is rather shocking, so don&#x27;t be surprised when you receive the actual item and think, \\&quot;What is this?\\&quot;  The soap comes in a sealed clear plastic bag and unlike the photos, looks more like chunks of mudpie.  To add, because of the shea butter, it feels a bit oily/greasy.  But do not give up hope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other customers who have reviewed this soap, I placed a chunk of the soap in a empty soap container with a lid, and filled it with an equal amount of water. When placing the soap inside the container, try and find a container with a large neck, otherwise you will be sitting there trying to shove small chunks of soap in the container. When I want to use the soap, I simply pour out the soap and only the \\&quot;liquidated\\&quot; soap comes out.  It lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few problems I have had with this soap include irritation to my face, finding razor-like chunks in the soap, my skin being very dry after use.  I used this on my face because I ran out of facial wash and immediately after, my face felt irritated, and I rushed to wash it off.  I have sensitive skin, in general, so I would not recommend this soap on use for those with sensitive facial skin.  Upon one incident, I was running low on the liquidated soap and poured out some onto my loofah and found, what I believe to be, a razor sharp rock in my loofah. Ever since this incident, I make sure to keep the liquidated soap mix full so I won&#x27;t pour out the razor chunks on the bottom.  As for the third problem, I thought the shea butter would leave my skin feeling somewhat hydrated but, be it my dry skin or the soap, I must apply lotion on my body or I will look like a snake after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to recap...&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves the skin feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does improve complexion when used religiously.&lt;br /&gt;2. Nice earthly smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves the skin very dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;2. May irritate skin if used on the face.&lt;br /&gt;3. Chunks can be sharp and cause skin breakage.y after use.

    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought this soap and I love it. Even though we have soft water using this soap makes my skin so much softer and I use it for my curly hair. It makes my hair so clean it squeaks and it&#x27;s so shiny. Curly hair is hard to manage but with this soap my hair doesn&#x27;t friz as much and the shine is incredible. I recommend it to everyone I talk to with curly hair. I&#x27;ve had a problem with eczema for years. I started using this on my hands every time I washed them and in a short time it had cleared up. I ran out of the soap and had to use the regular soap for a while and the eczema came back. I use it on my dogs for bathing because it rinses out so easily and completely. Leaving any shampoo or soap on their skin and they get itchy and dandruff but not when I use this soap on them. One of them is black and she just shines with the combination of this and the coconut oil in her food.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time. It came in a plastic cover as displayed in the picture and is really very nice soap. No bad odor and my breakouts are getting better.</li>
    <li> Great for skin......recommend purchasing this...in the place of buying regular bath soap.</li>
    <li> Great item will buy again</li>
    <li> Reordered after a year of using and sharing with everyone I know. This is a great soap from a great seller. The soap tingles on your skin and the longer you leave it on, the better. It has cleared my pores and softened my skin a lot. The little bumps on my daughter&#x27;s forehead are gone and her skin is clear and bright. You can spend a ton of money on products, we all have, but this is the one facial item I will keep reordering. I use it with my Clarisonic and the results are fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this odd looking soap after reading the reviews here on Amazon. Well it does not disappoint. It lathers well and leaves my skin feeling extremely soft and silky. It is definetly a soft soap and does melt quickly. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will clean and moisturize at the same time, this is it.</li>
    <li> This soap is the best for me skin it clear my face smooth and very soft.and my body too, I used it all over,This soap make my skin beautiful,thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very much satisfied with this product, it works very well and I receive it in the mail in very good shape... ABOSULTELY LOVE IT***</li>
    <li> A little on the scratchy side if I were to use directly on my skin, but I believe that is the nature of the soap.  I lather up a scrub cloth and have no problems with little scratchy bits.  The soap has a very neutral smell, gets my skin very clean but never itchy.  Anxious to try it diluted as a liquid soap.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> So I just recieved my package today and my soap was all broken up and not in a block like the picture. I can tell it is super soft but I was wondering if anyone elses came like this? I&#x27;m so excited to use this so I will be doing a review once I use this for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a returning customer. The first order arrived just fine and I was able to cut the 1 lb block into bath sized bars.  I use it with scrubby glove so I didn&#x27;t mind the rough texture and I was satisfied. The second order I placed I ordered 2 lbs.  One arrived in block form and the other lb arrived all broken up, like they had just thrown the odds and ends into a bag and thought this would be OK! The box it arrived in was in good condition so it was not the shippers fault.  I contacted the seller to have them pay for 1 lb shipping back to them and a refund (or another 1 lb block) on this damaged 1 lb, so that they could rectify this error.  They told me they wouldn&#x27;t do this and that I could fix the problem with the crumbled pieces myself!  It&#x27;s unusable in this form for me as I have no idea how to form the crumbled pieces together, and shouldn&#x27;t have to! They don&#x27;t advertize &amp;#34;crumbled pieces&amp;#34; they show a 1 lb block.  It&#x27;s not worth paying for shipping back to them and so I won&#x27;t be receiving a refund either. But sadly I won&#x27;t be ordering from this seller again.  Not the way to handle customer satisfaction or customer service especially in these lean times.  The result... They&#x27;ve lost a client who otherwise would have stayed with them.  I can&#x27;t use regular soap because it irritates my skin. I&#x27;ll find another seller who honor&#x27;s their product. Too bad for them. I gave them 2 stars because I do like Black AF. Soap. But that is the ONLY reason!</li>
    <li> I was dissatisfied with my purchase. It was all broken up and feels very gritty, not like I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I bought it over the summer and I still have way more than enough to use and it&#x27;s JANUARY (so about 4 months shy of a year)! It worked wonders for my skin. My complexion is really smooth and sometimes makes me wonder whether or not I applied makeup in some pics. I do have a few blackheads that are visible under certain light but I suppose the product&#x27;s ability to work varies amongst buyers. I still highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
    <li> Its smells stinky and doesn&#x27;t smell clean!  I bought this because I couldnt pass up the great price, but this must have some other filler.  I compared to the good black soap I have now and this is stinky.  Dont buy this.  I returned mine.</li>
    <li> Even tho it is really drying and I have hard water as well this stuff is great. I suffer from adult acne and tried the &amp;#34;Black African Soap&amp;#34; from the store first. All that did was give my tub a black soap ring. Since I started using this with a moisturizer my face is all clear. Last for a long time. I recommend getting a soap saver thing you let it dry out on b/c if it sits in a container that has a little water in it it becomes mushy.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I have been using ABS for almost three months, and the discolorations/hyperpigmentation has almost disappeared!  I have oily/acne prone skin, and ABS helps to control the oilness on my face.  I have recommended this soap to my family and friends, and they really like the results they have seen by using ABS.  ABS will be apart of my facial regime from now on!</li>
    <li> This soap is so gentle on delicate skin yet leaves your skin feeling so clean and smooth. Soap is good for all skin types try it you will so glad you did!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It got to my house intact and weighs about a pound. I didn&#x27;t have much acne before I started using this soap so I can&#x27;t say whether or not it helped get rid of my acne. But I did have eczema on my face and arms. Before buying African Black Soap I was spending 40+ dollars on a steroid cream to combat my skin problems that(the doctor says) will cause permanent damage to my skin. When I used the soap after a week my eczema had cleared and I no longer use the steroid cream. :) I would recommend it! It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell at all. It&#x27;s smell is what I would describe as \\&quot;Earthy.\\&quot;  I will definitely be ordering it for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> It was just what I read about it. My daughter and I use it daily and we really like how it makes the skin feels and really a little goes a long way .I have even shared with co- worker that have also enjoyed using it .i would recommend and buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> The Black soap w/shea butter arrived sooner than anticipated. The big 1 pound perfect cube of soap came wrapped in plastic wrap with bubble wrap within the shipping box. I made a liquid soap. I boiled some water, cut off a small chunk of the black soap and placed it in a bottle. The hot water melted the soap and I shook the mixture as well. I placed the remaining soap in a plastic container (in a cool location) still wrapped in the original plastic wrap that it arrived in. I don&#x27;t like my liquid soap. My problem is that I didn&#x27;t make it concentrated enough. I like for my liquid soap to be \\&quot;syrupy\\&quot; or thick like good dishwashing liquid. Mine was watery and it took me a few squirts of it to make a nice lather for my shower. In the middle of the shower I remembered that I had a huge block of the soap so I went and cut off a small slab and placed it in another plastic container. I used that chunk of soap to lather my cloth and- PERFECTION! I got the sudsy lather that I wanted! The soap has my skin soft and smooth! It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that as a moisturizer I use a pure shea butter/cocoa butter cream on my skin that I made from ordering 100% pure unrefined shea butter and 100% raw cocoa butter from Amazon. I will use the liquid soap for my hand soap. The soap was easy to cut. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the pebbles that some have said that they got in their soap and I&#x27;m not crazy enough to rub the soap on my body to possibly receive the knicks that some have complained of. I already have the soap on my wish list for re ordering but I probably won&#x27;t need anymore of the soap for about 2 months because a little goes a long way from this 1 pound block of soap. It is excellent from literally head to toe; for your hair on top of your head down to the soles of your feet. I made a life decision to be more natural about what I put in and on my body and this natural, skin softening, skin healing shea butter soap is PERFECT for me. *I am LC from NC*</li>
    <li> Great soap for hair and face</li>
    <li> beautiful!  my skin shines, it doesn&#x27;t leave it dry, and I intend ot order more, this soap lasted three months.  fades dark spots and makes your skin glow. highly recommend!</li>
    <li> When it came it seemed dried out and in crumbs. Had to add water to clump into single piece.Lacked moisture. I guess photo doesnt concur with actual product</li>
    <li> I was 26 years old and embarassed that I still have acne.  So I went to a dermatologist.  She told me &amp;#34;I want you to get something called &#x27;African Black Soap.&#x27;&amp;#34; I wanted to hit her, thinking &amp;#34;I came here for benzoyl peroxide&amp;#34;! But i decided to try the soap anyway.  I feel bad for doubting her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is the only over the counter product that has ever gotten my skin completely clear for any period of time. And it&#x27;s a bonus that it&#x27;s non-pharmaceutical as I really try to avoid animal testing at all costs.  I agree with the past reviewer who says it&#x27;s helpful to cut the soap - it comes in a HUGE, square block, and can be hard to manage and discintigrate fast.  I break off a few chunks and knead them into a ball like clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of warnings: the abrasives in this soap can be pretty sharp and have left scratches on my face when i&#x27;m not careful, so that&#x27;s something to be aware of.  I use my hands to lather it up first and break off any sharp abrasive pieces before I apply the soap to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product burns/tingles and made my face red at first.  For me, I prefer that, because it *feels* like it&#x27;s working, but I gave some to my sister and she hated it for that reason.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!! I use it every other day on my face because it dries my face out if I use it daily. I do however take showers with it daily &amp; the results are amazing. I saw improvement in a few days. Don&#x27;t use the soap directly on your skin because it has pieces of the tree bark and plantains in it, other than that this is definitely my soap of choice for my body and face.</li>
    <li> My fav i use it everyday</li>
    <li> My mother recommended this product for my daughters so we bought some.  We love the way it lathers and cleans.  It smell wonderful too!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have used.  Makes me feel very clean without being too dry.  Learn how to use it first.  It can be a little tough on delicate skin</li>
    <li> This soap has definitely helped moisturize and soften my skin.  More skin looks and feels healthier. And I love that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> could feel and tell a difference soon after using.  after a couple of weeks there is definitely a change that others notice. the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is the soaps rapid melt down. Other than that, if you want good looking skin;  I would recommend using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using black soap for almost a year and my skin feels soft and glowy. It does take an adjustment period for skin to be use to it but I kept at it and now if I use anything else, I feel a strange residue. I even wash my face with this soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is okay. A bit harsh for my sensitive skin though. Received it quick and packaged properly. I cant use it often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing to buyers I bought t this item I was not please with it. It dose not work for my skin it left dark marks on my face and is very drying even after I use moisturizer it still seams dry and my skin is always hitching me now if you have sensitive skin this might not be the product for you and you will not get you money back I really which it did work cause I have been looking for a product help me even out my skin tone and get rid of blemishes this really didn&#x27;t help me at all</li>
    <li> Great soap, really helped with fading dark marks and blemishes on my face and neck. Will buy this product again</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for a full month and my face only seems to have gotten worse...I use a cleanser to remove makeup , then this, then coconut oil. And face looks dry rough and bumpy. Even worse than before. I really looked forward to this working and clearing me up :( did come quickly and packages in ziplock bag. Does not look like picture..mine was bright looked kind of like granola bar.</li>
    <li> My Black African Soap arrived quickly that I ordered from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the service.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this soap about 4 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;No dry skin after washing with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I even used it for my hair.....which is moisturizing....but it does change the texture somewhat.....not bad though.&lt;br /&gt;I will re order this product</li>
    <li> I love fragrances, and have many soaps that smell very good but I am not pleased with their cleaning ability. I like this soap, however I prefer the regular kind with out added shea butter, I would rate that a 5. I use this soap on my hair as well as skin, to be honest I even like it better than my normal shampoo, and I use high quality shampoo. After I am done using the already purchased pricey body wash &amp; shampoo, I will not be buying again, for this does the job for me.</li>
    <li> My face is just skin now like this is amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this soap before but from a different supplier but was unable to this time because Amazon listed it as an add on item which was disappointing to me .There was a difference in that this one was more rough and had some sharp particles in it. My family and I broke out after the first couple of uses( a few bumps) face and body. So I&#x27;ve started using it twice a week instead of everyday and it seems OK. I&#x27;ll try tovpurchase from my previous supplier next time.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product, definitely a legitimate seller and product. My skin has never looked better and I suffer from cystic acne. It does dry out the skin a lot and found it difficult to find something that suited my sensitive skin to moisturise with but I ended up finding something perfect for my moisturiser and you can read it here: http://margaritalipstick.tumblr.com/post/126875534880/how-to-get-rid-of-acne-new-skincare-regimen&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t just take my word for it, just look at my before and after photos! I will continue to use this African Black Soap for years to come! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had black soap of this quality.  To make the soap more user-friendly I used a recycled container to dilute/melt it.  While in the shower long weave fibers/carpet or something squirt out of the bottle into my hands. I threw it away, and wish I made a review sooner. Apparently the surroundings aren&#x27;t very clean where the soap is packaged.  This has nothing to do with Amazon, they didn&#x27;t supply or ship the product.  It also took too long to receive it.  The soap also very dry and crumbly, it looked nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> What can I say about african black soap and shea butter combined.  I love this product for my skin, it keeps it wrinkle free have been using black soap for about 1 1/2 years. I no longer use soaps that are full of fragrance and other unknown chemicals.  love it!</li>
    <li> This has lasted so long!</li>
    <li> I am 8 months pregnant with my second child and have been using this soap every day for face wash and in the shower as body wash. With my first child I had terrible hormonal acne and got a few stretch marks. So far with this pregnancy I&#x27;ve had wonderful glowing skin and with only a few weeks left to go I haven&#x27;t gotten one new stretch mark (knock on wood) I think it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been using this soap and extra Virgin coconut oil as moisturizer. Even my sister who has troubled skin saw a huge improvement in her complexion within 3 days of using this soap. Her acne cleared up and her skin tone looks more even as well. I highly recommend this stuff! You can even find recipies online to liquify it. I like the exfoliation from the bar but it can be a little messy in the shower so I turned it to liquid and store it in a huge hand soap refill bottle in my bathroom closet and keep a little bottle with a dispenser cap in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Black Soap from several African sources.  But because of the price, I decided to try this brand.  I felt the ratio of Shea Butter compared to the other ingredients was too great.  And when the product arrived it was rather hard and brittle.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I&#x27;ve tried another African black soap before that didn&#x27;t have shea butter and it dried out my skin a little too much. This soap still does dry out the skin (which is how it gets rid of all of my blemishes and awful white pimple-looking spots on my upper arms), but the shea butter gives me some much needed extra moisture and leaves my skin feeling very smooth and nice. It&#x27;s the best black soap I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Your complexion really does improve, I like that shea butter is in it so you wont get completely dried out. You will definitely feel this working after a shower, some itchy areas after I dry off, but oooo boy is it a very clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap a lot it makes your skin feel soft and it makes you feel clean. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love black soap so much because of the wonders it does for cleansing and toning my skin. I still have about half my rock left and its been over a year.</li>
    <li> I use it as a daily body soap or i dilute it for a body wash. Becareful sometimes it has what i call little stones. When ever I feel one as i am washing I just pick it out and keep cleaning. I also make shampoo out of it. It cleans well and does what it needs to. I use the shea butter after and keep my skin hydrated and happy.</li>
    <li> The title just about sums it up.  It is still a nice soap and it gets the job done but a stick?  I mean really, a Stick?</li>
    <li> My boyfriend turned my on to this product. He said really good for your skin and hair. I only used a few times on my skin (I have chronic allergies-so not good for me) but my hair really loves it. I use WEN and I mix this soap with it and get a really deep cleaning. I plan to buy again. I will say that I had to buy a soap dish for it cause it can be a little messy-but don&#x27;t let that stop you. This product  is great</li>
    <li> Thank you jesus is all I can say. I ordered this once and I&#x27;ve been using it for a year (daily) I only use it to wash my fave but when I want to feel super squeaky clean I wash my body with it and follow with cocoa butter mixed with palmers shea butter . It can make you feel dry at times but you&#x27;re supposed to moisturizer your face &amp; body anyways. This stuff clears my face and gives me a glow.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works wonderfully. I have replace all of my other soaps with this product and I must say I love the results. Although it is great I have not tried it on my face just yet so I hope it will do the same there as well</li>
    <li> I have used  this product in the  past . And came back because of breakouts. This has really helped to clear my skin of acne, And brown spots. I use it from head to toe. No need to buy so many products. The fact it does not have so many chemicals is a plus.</li>
    <li> I bought both african black soaps, and I prefer the one with the shea butter (only because I have sensitive skin).  I would purchase again from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks For Everything&lt;br /&gt;:D</li>
    <li> I have purchased their regular black soap several times and love it - imho. their black soap is the best on the market. My son, and now his girlfriend, are converts to this soap now. They both have oily, break-out prone skin  and it helps them very much.  I have psoriasis and  it is under control due to this soap.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to re-order my soap this time, I accidentally selected the shea butter variety .  It is a luxurious soap that works well as a shampoo. I will use this variety all year for shampoo but honestly, it is a bit  to moisturizing for this time of year for my skin. I hope you will try it, as it is economical and all natural. Your face and body will thank you!</li>
    <li> Yes...exceedingly..couldnt be more happier..very grateful for African shea butter soap..hope it stays around forever..love love love it!!! Thanks very much! I Only use this kind because the original is too strong</li>
    <li> I rely on African black soap, and have just given another brand a five-star review. This came in a plastic bucket, which was fine, but when actually using the soap, it&#x27;s really hard to make a significant amount of it stick together. The tendency of the soap to crumble while using, or not to coalesce in any sort of bar-like chunk, makes it a decent hand soap but probably not a specific brand of this product that I&#x27;d order again. It is free from a lot of the usual gross additives that come in beauty products -- no sodium laureth sulfate here, for example -- and for that reason it&#x27;s great for people who have fragrance allergies or just sensitive skin in general. I just had trouble using my particular order of this product.</li>
    <li> My wife was having breakouts from the hormones when she was pregnant.  I bought some of this soap and it cleared up her skin in a couple weeks.  She still uses this every day.</li>
    <li> Quality changes from batch to batch, I believe. Sometimes it can be rock hard, other times very soft almost clay-like.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on sensitive skin.  However, it will bring out anything and everything that is under your skin.  Please be patient.  It does work.</li>
    <li> I have loved this soap ever since I tried it a year ago.  It looks a little strange but it is good and lathers and it feels so good after you use the soap</li>
    <li> Highly Recommened Seller, wonderful handmade product, just as described!!</li>
    <li> Very quick shipment. My soap arrived on the first estimated arrival date. The soap left my skin soft and smooth and not as dry as it is when I use regular black soap. I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Works AMAZING. A little bit goes a long way so it&#x27;s lasting really long and still going strong. I use it for my face and body! It does dry out your face so be careful if your skin is on the sensitive or dry side. Just moisturize right away, always makes my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Totally Amazed!&lt;br /&gt;Received on 9/27/2014.  Was anxious to try it out.  I washed my face with it after making a small lather.  My skin felt a little tingly at first but this is not new to me.  After drying my skin, I had a glow and texture that I had never felt before. I tried many products that made my skin dry after washing and had to use a  moisturizer.  I purposely did not use a moisturizer to see if my skin was going to feel dry and tight.  I noticed my skin was looking as though I had used moisturizer on it except without the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> black soap is amazing for sensitive skin types. when my nephew was a baby he had a ton of allergies and horrible eczema. the only product we found that wouldn&#x27;t irritate him is black soap (along with pure shea butter after bathing). prior to this we tried many expensive organic baby products, but none of them worked as well. i recommend cutting them into small pieces (a sitting bar of soap breeds bacteria) to keep things more sanitary. i&#x27;ve also put mine in a container with water and essential oils to make a body wash.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome can I say organic soap. I see some reviews about it being abrasive or leaving a rash, well can I tell you why. This soap is made completely old world style, water is dripped through the ashes of plantains and hard woods and also cocoa pods. then the liquids is mixed with the fats of various plants like shea butter and cocoa butter. it is NOT filtered so you will have ash and sometimes the potassium hydroxide that is made from the ashes is still un-reacted. So this is the best method I have formed, get a mason jar with PLASTIC lid, fill it 1/4 and then put the soap in pieces to melt it into liquid keep adding pieces and water till its full but has the same consistency as liquid hand soap. This will ensure completely reacted soap and ashes will fall to bottom and this will also make the soap last wayyyyy longer. This soap only takes a little bit to go a long way. Their really is not any better soap out there that is not full of hazardous waste chemicals! All real soaps will dry your skin a little! Dont trust TV adds! You see soap is working when it pulls the old oils and dirt out of your skin!! when your through washing, then you put natural oils back into your skin, like shea butter. If you use a soap that leaves your skin oily and silky, chances are you never really deep cleaned your skin. I saw a review where a person was mad that shea butter was not in it. Well all the ingredients in it are not longer the same properties and are reacted into the final soap. So you are right and wrong. I hope I helped some people out here and settled some myths. I for one am very pleased and will buy again until I have my own soap recipe as good ass this!</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I have used black soap for 3 years now and I will never use anything else on my face. I always melt mine down into a liquid soap then fill bottles for my whole family to use. It keeps our skin looking absolutely radiant! I make sure I never run out of it also. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. My husband loves to bathe with it...it creates a great lather. If you are considering ordering this product you will not be disappointed. I get compliments on my skin all the time...people want to know how I keep my skin so smooth, clear and youthful looking with no wrinkles in sight. I tell them \\&quot;first of all, I have great genes thanks to my mother...and second of all I use black soap daily\\&quot;. I am 40 years old...but no one ever believes me! Lol!! I love it!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to add to what others have already said.  Gets your skin super clean, feeling smooth, and shrinks pore size.  No other soap compares.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  I bought this from a provider on Amazon...and found it to be dryer than the last soap I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, fast delivery and it comes right to my door..is the factor that interests me most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally disabled from my disintegrating spine [from a car wreck].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, any purchases I make have to be convenient for me and at least comparable in price &amp; quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came quickly, was well-wrapped and the delivery man left it right at my door [in the apt building].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a mess from medications I am required to take for pain and neuropathy.  This soap is a miracle..no m ore dry patches, and all those other skin problems we  Pain Patients seem to get.  AND here&#x27;s the biggie::: No chemicals..right from the Earth...no perfume and nothing to cause allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS::I only wish this soap was as moist as the batch I bought from an Independent seller online.</li>
    <li> Poor quality with rancid smell. I know shea butter and this must have been a terrible batch.</li>
    <li> Looooovvvveee this soap !!! Great product that lasts. It&#x27;s been a month and I  pleased with the effects. Just got two new pimples so not sure about the benefits for acne. Love the way it feels!!</li>
    <li> too mushy to use it just would just not hold together would not buy it again does not really do much.</li>
    <li> Shipment came very quick, I was surprised.. Big chunk, I cut a piece that last up to 2-3 days because I wash my full body, it makes me feel squeaky clean. It&#x27;s very dry so lotion and moisturizer after.. I&#x27;ll purchase again soon</li>
    <li> Works great but if you have sensitive skin beware. Do not put on your face if you have skin problems and/or sensitive skin. It will break your face out. That&#x27;s what it did to me and my son.</li>
    <li> Great product. Black soap is a little ugly to look at so often you&#x27;ll find products that look good, but aren&#x27;t it,&lt;br /&gt;If you want &#x27;authentic&#x27; African black soap this I the stuff. I can&#x27;t recommend it more highly</li>
    <li> Not for me. It seemed to dry my skin out more than mosturize. It might work well for some but not me.</li>
    <li> To be completely honest lol after opening the bag i was hesitant to use it because it smelled so friggin bad. I mean hot damn it stunk lol. If you have ever used sulfur 8 shampoo it smells similar to that  but 10 times worse when its dry. The smell was more bearable when i wet it. LOL if you think sulfur 8 times 10 without any fragrance is earthy and pleasant then you will love this stuff (i have sulfur 8 and it has a slight perfume compared to this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok the first thing i did was use this without a sponge BIG HUGE MISTAKE. This stuff will cut you up lol just no dont do it. I read the review that said it \\&quot;sloughs off dead skin cells\\&quot;  lmao next time i&#x27;ll buy a loofa. What works for one person doesn&#x27;t work for the other and there was no sloughing when i used it. When i used a sponge it was fine. Lathered up awesomely so that was really good.  Immediately i rinsed it off squeaky clean lol there wasn&#x27;t a drop of body oil left. NOTHING! Before i even dried off the water i could feel my skin shrinking away from my bones (especially my face) i was soooooo dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke out in little bumps on my right arm and this is just the first day but i&#x27;m not sure if it was due to the fact that it scratched the hell out of me  or because it dried me up (i&#x27;ve had a similar reaction before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use up the batch i have if it doesn&#x27;t cause any more problems but other than that i dont plan on buying anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because it looked exactly like the product  pictured and it got me clean lol basically i got what i paid for lol this might change when i&#x27;m  done with it.</li>
    <li> The African black soap met my needs and I love it. It has my face smooth and is preventing new breakouts from coming. It also is making my dark spots disappear and I love that. Soooo two thumbs up for the African black soap</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m 24 and african-american with combination skin and mild acne. I&#x27;ve accumulated a huge stash of facial skin products over the years but all of it will soon be trash. This soap came in weird (kinda gross)looking semi-soft chunks which is easily broken. It lathers very well to the last crumb. A very small amount is needed so a pound will last a while. The first use left my skin looking and feeling super smooth ALL DAY long with zero irritation. My skin is already clearing up and my tone has evened out. I use Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel (which I also bought on Amazon) as a toner and the combination is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely be introducing my family to it.</li>
    <li> The soap I received from Deeva Fulfillment Services, Inc is great quality black soap.  It came in one large piece, wrapped in heavy paper, inside of a plastic container.  The soap smells great, lathers well, and makes my skin feel really clean.</li>
    <li> This soap is good for getting rid of spider vein&#x27;s,muscle ache/pain and make&#x27;s your skin soft and beautiful.It&#x27;s good for stretch mark&#x27;s.the only thing i dislike is that it melts away fast while using it.</li>
    <li> A must have for basic cleansing for the entire body! Worth every penny in my humble opinion! This has truly helped my skin on showing its natural beauty naturally.</li>
    <li> This soap was able to do what $200 worth of sephora products could not.  And that is, shrink my pores!  I noticed a decrease in pore size after 1 day.  This black soap has also lightened my eczema spots tremendously!  I am so happy with it.  I have been on this health kick and want to start using all natural products so this will replace my face and body wash.  Keep in mind that it is VERY alkaline and you should use a toner and/or moisturizer to counteract the alkalinity but the look and feel of my skin is proof to me that this is a keeper.  It is a raw product and may scratch due to rock/ash particles that remain in the soap so do not use directly on the skin.  Lather in hands or washcloth before applying to the skin to prevent scratching yourself with the soap chunk.  I sometimes place a chunk of the soap in a container with water to create a face wash.  I leave the grains and particles in the mixure which adds an extra bit of exfoliation. It lathers very well also with just a little bit of soap.</li>
    <li> So nice to get this in the USA.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews. I bought this soap to use on my acne prone skin. I don&#x27;t have a lot of breakouts, but I have a lot of scarring (from using Proactiv) huge pores, and very oily skin. So I began just using the soap every other day.  I would lather the soap in my hand, wash my face, wait a few minutes and then add an acne cream with 2.5% BP, wait a few minutes, and then add moisturizer.  After some time I started using it morning &amp; night.  If anything, I would say that this soap made my pores MORE noticeable! After about a month and a half I really saw no improvement, so I stopped using it on my face. I decided not to let the remaining soap go to waste, and used it on my hair. I am African American and have what is termed \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair. When I used this soap as shampoo, I was surprised. My hair was so soft during the shampoo process and very manageable afterwards. It is very rare to find a good shampoo that does this! So I will use the rest of the soap as shampoo. But I primarily bought it for my face, so all in all, I am still disappointed.</li>
    <li> My skin had a terrible allergy reaction to this. The palm oil in the product leaves you really slippery, and even with the shea butter, it leaves you unmoisturized. My skin turned cracked and itchy from it.&lt;br /&gt;It gets you very clean, though. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I guess you should get this instead.</li>
    <li> Got the amount I paid</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I love this soap very much. It has helped my acne clear up so much more than I thought it would its getting rid of my dark spots which I thought would never go away its all natural which is a good thing. I would definitely recommend this soap to anybody who is looking to get rid of your acne and dark spots</li>
    <li> Terrible. Found very hard pieces of something in the soap that left scratches all over my body. Seller seemed to not believe me when I notified them of this obvious safety hazard. Now I purchase from a different seller and I&#x27;m very happy with their black soap</li>
    <li> It burn my face never buying this again.</li>
    <li> Best soap I ever used, smell lovely, feels lovely on my skin , cleans my trouble skin nicely. Packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> This raw black really has worked for me I combine it with the raw shea butter for a great skin care treatment.  I also sometimes combine a piece of the black soap and sugar to make a scrub which I use all over my body and it&#x27;s great.  Really does clear up your skin for me when used in conjunction with the shea butter.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this product.  The first time ordering this product, the soap was very soft and everything the reviews had to say about it.  I loved it so much that I ordered it again but this time a larger size.  The second order soap was very hard.</li>
    <li> This soap has done wonders for my skin. It has made it so soft and clean feeling. I have made a shift to natural and organic products and am never turning back. This was definitely my best purchase yet for my skin.</li>
    <li> My face has never been as clear and shiny as after using it. I would say that it is not meant for hair but for body use only.</li>
    <li> I had recently gotten a super bad flare up, like really bad ... My eczema was out of control. After buying this product my itching calmed down. It stings because of the breakage of skin but it leaves my skin clean soft and smooth. It also lightens dark spots. I also have this medication from a hospital called Mometasone ointment. it works well to clear up eczema</li>
    <li> Price-per-ounce, this is the best deal on soap I&#x27;ve come across.  I&#x27;ve been using daily for more than six months, and have been more than satisfied.  I can&#x27;t speak to it having any magical properties, but it cleans my face, is all-natural, and is cheap!  I can&#x27;t ask for much more.  (It does look a bit disgusting on your my dish, but I can get over that.)</li>
    <li> This soap was really good!! It has a major spa effect while in the shower! Also, this soap is very good at lightening and/or evening out dark spots if you have them; enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this black soap. I loved it, my skin was glowing after i used it. I had no burning or drying of the skin. I would buy this product again. A little goes a long way. Told my son about it and i will send some to him in Afghanistan for his skin.</li>
    <li> Product had significant amount of mold. I do not know if this was intentional but nonetheless, I did not use it. I still have no regrets for buying it simply due to the money going to less fortunate in Ghana.</li>
    <li> Trust me when I say that I have used everything under the sun. I have struggled with acne as a teen and well into my adult years. I cannot begin to list every product I have used in my futile attempt to rid myself of acne. Cystic, blackheads, whiteheads, pustules, papules, (okay, you get the idea!). According to the dermatologists who saw me, I didn&#x27;t have severe acne, but there were times when I felt like I did. And the prescribed medicines (creams, gels, and facial washes) did little to improve my ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;Then I stumbled across this product after hearing about it from Dr. Oz. There&#x27;s plenty of \\&quot;so-called\\&quot; black soap being marketed out there, but I was told that you will truly see the effects using a raw soap, versus one that has been mixed with other artificial ingredients. After doing some research, I brought this soap and after two weeks, I was able to see a noticeable difference. The acne was going away, and the blemishes were becoming lighter. The first time I tried the Raw African Shea Butter soap, it did slightly sting my face and was very drying. My first initial reaction was to stop using it, but I wasn&#x27;t about to let my money go to waste, so I kept up the routine, washing my face in the morning and again before I went to bed. I swear, I have never been more pleased! If I could include both before and after photos to this review, I would. I have been using this soap for about 5 months, and the blemishes have noticeably faded, as have my pores become smaller and my skin smoother.&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this soap, my suggestions would be to cut it into small \\&quot;bar-like\\&quot; pieces as they ship it uncut in 1-pound form. Also, to keep it fresh between uses, you should store it in a small Tupperware like container, because once water gets on it, it will soften the soap. And if left in a bathtub or shower exposed, it will create a brown mess! Also, you want to moisturize right after. I use Neutrogena Multi-Vitamin Moisturizer during the day and Raw African Shea Butter at night. Believe me when I say that you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am an adult that suffers for acne,pitted cystic type and wanted something organic to try, This was it. Got the product very fast. I didn&#x27;t really care that it came in chunks, as long as I had a 1 pound order. A little go a very long way. The size smaller than a pea does the whole face and neck. I use a size half the size of a marble and do my whole body. I was very surprised at the amount of lather it makes. It does make my skin feel oh so good. I still get a small break out but thats around the time of the month it should happen,but a lot less and none that are cystic. I would not however leave it setting in water, it will turn to mush. The tiny little pieces you will have left over will be very tempting to just let go down the drain. I put those in a nylon knee-high and when i get enough I tie up the end and now you have a scrubber to bathe with. I can&#x27;t think of anything I can say negative about this soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never wasting another dime on commercial soaps like Irish Spring, Dial, or Ivory. This soap gets you CLEAN. I mean C-L-E-A-N.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; for a couple of months now and saw a youtube review about african black soap for your hair.  I bought this but do not like the consistency for my hair so I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and body instead.  It has really helped get rid of blackheads and clear up my skin.  The smell is a very mild \\&quot;CLEAN\\&quot; smell so its great for both men and women.  In fact, my male co-worker bought some for him and his mother and they like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the liquid african black soap here on Amazon for my hair.  I mix it equal parts with water and it works fantastic.  [[ASIN:B000W3WP1W 100% Pure African Black Liqiud Soap 8 oz]]</li>
    <li> I first bought this and used it to wash my acne probe skin. It was extremely drying; however, after finding the right moisturizer (100% kosher vegetable glycerin), my skin had never looked better. I no longer deal with terrible acne. I will say that if you have sensitive skin, you should slowly being using this soap. Start off with every other day for a week or so and also, if you break out (I did), your skin may just be purging. Keep at it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Honestly gave my skin a nice glow. Does burns a little when first using it but it&#x27;s the best black soap I&#x27;ve ever use my skin feels perfect</li>
    <li> This soap works marvelously but unfortunately I can&#x27;t afford to buy it again as shipping costs me over $30.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product made me itch really bad.</li>
    <li> Awesome nothing ever works on my skin!! I was scared at first when my skin started to break out after two days but after a week my skin looked better than ever!! I will NEVER use any other facial soap again :) AMAZING product!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and prematurely rejoiced! This soap is just very drying soap. I felt like there was a residue on my skin after using it. I continued to use it daily for a full month and my skin condition did not improve, it only got dry, flaky and sensitive. As others suggested, I used it as a shampoo and my hair became severely dry and tangled!! I would NOT order this again nor would I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works great. I have used this type of soap before and it works wonderful on the skin and tightens right up.</li>
    <li> Loved it and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I have used another brand of african black soap and loved it,  but I thought that I would try this out because I liked the idea of it being soft and not in bar form. What a mistake! I kept it in a tupperware container but it quickly turned into a glob of mush. Another reviewer said that it was grainy and felt like it was exfoliating the skin. I thought that it felt like a huge glob of snot with random hard pieces of \\&quot;something.\\&quot; It smells like campfire smoke, and perhaps worst of all it stung and burned when it got near my private parts! Do I really want to put something like that on my body?! I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality of this product and would never recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a problem with the seller.  I did not contact them regarding my distaste for the product nor did I try to return it. It was cheap . . . and sending back used soap just seemed silly. It was packaged adequately and was delivered quickly. I have no reason to believe that the seller would not have responded appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not mention the brand of the other black soap that I have used because I don&#x27;t want people to think that I am just writing this bad review to recommend the other product. As a matter of fact, I would encourage people who are interested in using black soap to try many other brands - black soap is a wonderful product and there are probably many suppliers who sell something of a good quality. Anyone can look at my other reviews and see that I have never written such a scathing review of any product. I don&#x27;t take this lightly. I always read reviews, take them seriously, and want them to be truthful. I find this product to be of terrible quality, having many unpleasant characteristics and wasting away quickly. Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Thi soap does what it says it does. It works wonders, i rarely get pimples now and it helps with darkspots. You only need a good moisturzer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this black soap. Some sellers try to pass off imitation products as African Black Soap but this is truly the real thing and it works wonders. Cleanses, tones and leaves your skin looking and feeling refreshed. I would recommend this to ANYONE and I will definitely be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I conducted a lot of research on this soap before I made this purchase.  My skin issue is dryness. This soap is so luxurious you look forward to cleansing. My skin is smooth and soft like using a face cream only without the chemicals and stickyness.  I have given my two daughters (acne issues) pieces of the soap, and they love it as well.  We&#x27;re waiting to see if it works well on acne.  I would definitely recommend this soap to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This soap lasted me for one year and it helped lighten the dark spot on my face but it did dry my face out a little so make you moisturize after appying.</li>
    <li> IIt&#x27;s good. you need a good moisturizer tends to dry out skin great for acne&lt;br /&gt;help with blemishes . would like a recommended moisturizer</li>
    <li> This stuff is nasty! There are bits and pieces of charcoal, ash and what looks like bone fragments imbedded in the soap. I actually cut myself on a sharp piece of bone while showering with this stuff.</li>
    <li> This was a good, economical soap.  My husband liked using it, even if he doesn&#x27;t really notice those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that it is quite brown and if you have white tubs, sinks, you better get a good soapdish.  This lasted well over a year and was not as drying as regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might also have to be explained if people aren&#x27;t familiar with it when they come over and see a brown glob in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> I used this soap on my face and body it is kind of harsh. Not good for sensitive skin. It caused little tiny red pimples on my face and chest.</li>
    <li> Hi I&#x27;ve been using black soap  all my life.and it&#x27;s different from all the other ones in the past. It&#x27;s very  soft  when you first get it .  But what I like about this one doesn&#x27;t have rocks in it  like the in past years. The texture on my skin  has changed because of the Shea butter make&#x27;s feel  my skin super soft .And drying at all like other ones</li>
    <li> If have been using this soap for about 3 years_ if absolutely love it; cleared my psoriasis up! I use no other soap!</li>
    <li> I liked the soap also shared it with my friends .&lt;br /&gt;Rosie</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry skin so have only used this product twice, in tiny bits. It has sucked all the oil and moisture from my face and I now have a rash beginning. BUT that is my own fault as I was curious to try it. I bought it for my daughter&#x27;s acne. I LOVE the smell. It smells so fresh and clean. Makes for a lovely hand soap. And I have discovered it also works to remove fresh blueberry stains from pure white fabric - took the stain right out and there is no sign after at all. I would buy this again. Great value for the hunk you receive.</li>
    <li> I have severely dry skin. This works excellent for me.</li>
    <li> I received so many compliments on my skin. Love this soap! My marks are fading and the dark spots are evening out</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, so this soap was exactly what I needed. After about one week of using, my dark spots started to clear  and my skin, since day one, has been really smooth. I wash my face twice a day, so I think results may change depending on how often you use the product. If I had to say anything bad, it would be IT CAN DRY OUT YOUR SKIN if you do not moisturize your face right after using. Other than that, GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I have VERY OILY skin that can tolerate just about ANYTHING, but it CANNOT tolerate this soap.  I was hoping to have found my &amp;#34;golden ticket&amp;#34; to remedy the overabundance of oiliness I have and being a &amp;#34;Greenie&amp;#34; (I try to use 100% natural products all of the time),  I was wishful after reading many reviews on Amazon that Black Soap could have possibly been the answer to my oily skin, especially because all Black Soap is recommended for oily skin.  As I said, I have skin that has tolerated soaps, toners and treatments that others would have ended up in a doctor&#x27;s office for, NONE of which solved my oil problem.  I ordered this, waited patiently until receipt, jumped in the shower and lathered up.  The MOMENT I put it on my face, I should have immediately washed it off, but I figured the stinging wasn&#x27;t a cause for concern, as other products I have used produced the same result.  I washed my face no more and no less time than I do with any other soap/cleanser and upon rinsing off, it was instantaneously noticeable - this strange almost nerve-like pain (not stinging, not burning, but PAIN) that I could not get rid of.  My skin felt like it had a residue coating my face and it was, and I did not think this was possible, MORE OILY. Finally, my skin actually looked as if I had sunburn.  Upon going to the doctor, she said it was NOT an allergic reaction, but was fairly close to a chemical burn and that my skin was raw.  The icing on the cake was that my skin began to produce MORE OIL  I do not know if it was to process used to make the soap, or the Palm in it, but it took two days for the pain to go away and an additional 3 for the redness to follow suit.  I use Raw Shea Butter as a moisturizer every day and have used it on my face in the past when indulging in too much sun - no reaction.  This soap is HARSH, and that is a mild word for it, and while my experience may not happen to everyone, or anyone, I would highly suggest that if you purchase, you use on your hands of another body part first to see if this may happen to you.  As always, this is my own personal experience with this product and your results may differ.your hands of another body part first to see if this may happen to you.

    <li> This was the best soap ever I used it for my hair and body and love how great it lathered up. Left me feeling super clean and very moisturized!!</li>
    <li> Great for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap on the market for dry skin.  It might look strange, but it cleans and softens your skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this s*** African soap makes my skin so soft I like the way it feels like the creaminess of it got a nice scent to it will stick with it</li>
    <li> This soap is very soft and helps my skin to be soft.  I love it in the shower.  It helps my skin exfoliate.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the African Shea Butter Soap twice now.  I have shared it with my friends. We all agree it is the best soap we have ever used.  I never let another soap touch my skin. Do not let it sit in the shower, I keep a small piece cut off and sitting on the bathroom counter. It will last a long time doing this.</li>
    <li> This will be my first review for anything. Since high school, I have had a problem with rough and uneven skin but using this soap have changed it all!!! My dark spots are not gone yet, but they are starting to get lighter. My skin is so smooth to the touch that my boyfriend says he&#x27;s gonna take my soap from me and use if for himself! I recently got the all natural shea butter and i use that after i take a shower. What a difference a week make! My skin is smoother and healthy-looking. I am never going to use regular soap and cocoa butter again!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about three weeks now. It works wonders!!!! My face has never looked better.I am a young african american and i have darker spots on my face. The dark spots are getting lighter and lighter by each use. I use it in the morning and at night the put a light lotion on my face because it does dry it out a little. Over all its a great product I would highly recommend this soap!!! I hope this helped. My skin looks beautiful!!! Im so happy I decided to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I have ordered shea butter black soap before and love it! but this one I ordered was dry and crumbled as soon as you touched it. Will be finding the last seller I got it from and not here!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone &amp; very sensitive skin. I have been using this product for 3 days. Day 1 I woke up and my skin looked so bright &amp; refreshed. Its now day 3 and it has dried up most of the small breakouts I had.  I love that it is natural with no harsh irritating chemicals. I think I have found my next beauty must have!</li>
    <li> Thhis soap is UGLY it will definitely not make a pretty gift basket addition.  However, if you like the rustic and unusual this is right down your country lane.  This soap first smells, well, rustic, and it does moisturize and also leaves chunks that may be ash or something, not sure, and they are visible in the tub by the drain usually.....I thought it was cool to try this soap, but I am over it.  Recommend to try you may like it.</li>
    <li> It was a complete waste of money . Did not work for me wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, made my face and oiliness worse.</li>
    <li> One of the best soaps I have ever used. It cleans and lathers up quite nicely. I use it as is or drop a few bits and pieces in a water bottle and make my own liquid black soap.</li>
    <li> love washing my hair with product, it gets my hair very clean lots of suds, great product to buy, excellent choice.</li>
    <li> Soap is very good at cleaning.  But because of the particles embedded in it you have to be careful or use a cloth instead of the soap directly on your skin.  Also unlike other soaps it melts quite quickly if left in an area with moisture.  Makes a good liquid soap and still cleans effectively.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin is so soft! It also helped even out my skin tone from the breakouts I had that left blemishes</li>
    <li> This product was great but it was sticky once wet. I was expecting a more solid bar. I like how the product cleans. I can use it on my face and my face not break out. I will order this product again but next time I will mix this product with another product to give it more consistency.</li>
