      <li>This is a good product that our orthodontist recommends b/c</li>
      <li>It has a clean taste, very pleasant to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest and frank-</li>
      <li>It must be getting popular now</li>
      <li>I expect I&#x27;ll be using Closys for the rest of my days, it&#x27;s clearly an effective hygenic.</li>
      <li>No taste and no alcohol is perfect for my sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy two bottles for $23 and change.</li>
      <li>It has paid off handsomely when my dental hygienist cleans my teeth.</li>
      <li>some vigorous flossing and brushing my gums look a lot better with CloSYS.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, better checkup.</li>
      <li>We love it.</li>
      <li>; I thought maybe I&#x27;d noticed something going on in the mornings before getting up and brushing my teeth, but wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
      <li>this is good mouthwash, no flavorings, no burning, very cleansing.</li>
      <li>and It is fabulous.</li>
      <li>Tastes clean.</li>
      <li>I use Closys Mouthwash and like the clean way my mouth feels.</li>
      <li>I did some quick google research and found out about &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Pretty sure this stuff really works.</li>
      <li>It does the job, and it pretty much tastes exactly like water, which I prefer over the overpowering flavors of most mouthwashes.</li>
      <li>My gums are healthier and my mouth feels fresh after using Closys.</li>
      <li>It certainly feels like it works, despite being so amazingly mild to taste.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After my next cleaning I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.</li>
      <li>So far I don&#x27;t see any plaque or tartar and no bad breath.</li>
      <li>Walgreens, much cheaper than here.</li>
      <li>But I noticed that the price on Amazon was DOUBLE what I paid at a chain drugstore that begins with W, and they have free shipping over $25.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered it twice and getting ready to order again.  </li>
      <li>Helps keep gums pink and healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years based on the recommendation of my dentist, who said it would help rid my mouth of much of the bacteria.</li>
      <li>Better than other OTC.</li>
      <li>Well worth the extra cost.</li>
      <li>, the mint and gum offers ceased almost immediately.</li>
      <li>Helped stop a puffy gum infection - I took my toothbrush and gently brushed around the sore spot and it really helped.</li>
      <li>Unlike other mouthwashes that are so strong in taste that they are unpleasant to use, I have a choice of leaving this flavor free or adding a light touch of mint (included) to the mix.</li>
      <li>As far as any cons might go, the first 3 days of using the product it made water taste funny, I thought about stopping based on the horror stories I was reading here, but all of that passes after a few days and before long it becomes a non issue.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyways, My pocket depth is generally 4-5 mm and I plan to change those number with the help of CloSYS.</li>
      <li>They keep telling me to bush and floss more, as if 3 times a day was not good enough!?</li>
      <li>Mints and gum offers were solid confirmation.</li>

    <li> Better than other OTC.</li>
    <li> It is the only mouthwash my wife will use.</li>
    <li> This is a great mouthwash for those experiencing the beginnings of periodontal disease as I am.  My dentist recommended this mouthwash.  There is a little bottle of mint flavoring that comes with this mouthwash that you can add to the mouthwash as you wish.  I use the mouthwash &#x27;as is.&#x27;  It has a clean taste, very pleasant to use.  And in the short time I have been using this mouthwash, the hygienist can already see a difference in my gums after just one bottle.  I will order this again, and again!</li>
    <li> Helps keep gums pink and healthy. No taste and no alcohol is perfect for my sensitive gums. Helped stop a puffy gum infection - I took my toothbrush and gently brushed around the sore spot and it really helped.</li>
    <li> this is good mouthwash, no flavorings, no burning, very cleansing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and frank- A while back, co-workers and friends were suddenly offering me mints and gum. Uh oh. I&#x27;d become &amp;#34;that guy.&amp;#34; I thought maybe I&#x27;d noticed something going on in the mornings before getting up and brushing my teeth, but wasn&#x27;t sure. Mints and gum offers were solid confirmation. I did some quick google research and found out about &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; non-alcohol chlorine dioxide mouthwashes, and the importance of tongue scraping vs. mere tongue brushing. So, I tossed my usual bottle of Listerine in the trash and invested in a bottle of Closys and a Dr. Tung scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, the mint and gum offers ceased almost immediately. Pretty sure this stuff really works. It certainly feels like it works, despite being so amazingly mild to taste. I almost tastes like plain water. Even right after brushing and flossing, rinsing with this occasionally knocks stuff loose that had stubbornly remained behind somehow. I tried a few doses with a drop of the included mint oil added to it, but I definitely prefer it unflavored. I expect I&#x27;ll be using Closys for the rest of my days, it&#x27;s clearly an effective hygenic.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few years and It is fabulous. I have notice great improvement in my gum health and breathe</li>
    <li> great product I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that our orthodontist recommends b/c it does not contain any chemicals or food dyes or sweeteners.  But I noticed that the price on Amazon was DOUBLE what I paid at a chain drugstore that begins with W, and they have free shipping over $25.  Do a little web searching before you pay the price here.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash on the market...bar none! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. The only bad news is, Amazon is now making it cost prohibitive to purchase here. I used to be able to buy two bottles for $23 and change. It must be getting popular now so they increase the price by $16 for two bottles... That is a 59% increase - TOTALLY INSANE! It can be purchased at Walgreens for between $13 and $15 per bottle. Which means it&#x27;s not the manufacture increasing the price. Walgreens, much cheaper than here.</li>
    <li> The dentist suggested this and I prefer it to other mouthwashes.  This is a great price for the two pack.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, better checkup.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for all our family</li>
    <li> Every 6 months my dentist is scrapping my teeth away like a city construction jackhammer. They keep telling me to bush and floss more, as if 3 times a day was not good enough!? Then they sell me on some over priced industrial strength fluoride or wash that only stains your teeth brown. &amp;#34;Fool me once, shame on...shame on you. Fool me — you can&#x27;t get fooled again.&amp;#34; -Bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, My pocket depth is generally 4-5 mm and I plan to change those number with the help of CloSYS. It&#x27;s been 3 months from my last dental cleaning and I&#x27;ve been using the CloSYS mouthwash and their toothpaste twice a day. I only use about a half cap, so this bottle will last a really long time and because it doesn&#x27;t burn I tend to use it for several minutes. The flavor is optional and that&#x27;s a great plus if you like tooth paste flavors that don&#x27;t mix well with mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some vigorous flossing and brushing my gums look a lot better with CloSYS. There are times I use my waterpik for hard to reach food, and my electric tooth bush to grind away at stubborn tartar inside the lower front gum line. I have also found that GUM Soft-Picks are really good for cleaning under bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically in the morning after breakfast I floss, then use the mouthwash and follow with brushing and rinse. After dinner I tend to floss, brush and use the mouthwash last, never rinsing with water, only spitting it out. So far I don&#x27;t see any plaque or tartar and no bad breath. As far as any cons might go, the first 3 days of using the product it made water taste funny, I thought about stopping based on the horror stories I was reading here, but all of that passes after a few days and before long it becomes a non issue. So my advice is to keep using it and reap the rewards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my next cleaning I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years based on the recommendation of my dentist, who said it would help rid my mouth of much of the bacteria. This makes for a cleaner breath and less plaque. Unlike other mouthwashes that are so strong in taste that they are unpleasant to use, I have a choice of leaving this flavor free or adding a light touch of mint (included) to the mix. My gums are healthier and my mouth feels fresh after using Closys.</li>
    <li> Been using Closys for 20 years now and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else</li>
    <li> Started using this on the recommendation from my dental hygienist. It does the job, and it pretty much tastes exactly like water, which I prefer over the overpowering flavors of most mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> I use Closys Mouthwash and like the clean way my mouth feels.</li>
    <li> Excellent product recommended by my dentist. The alcohol in regular mouthwash was irritating. Well worth the extra cost. I don&#x27;t use the flavoring. Tastes clean.</li>
    <li> I have used Closys mouthwash as well as the Closys toothpaste for several years. It has paid off handsomely when my dental hygienist cleans my teeth. Her chores involved with cleaning my teeth have been reduced ever since I switched to Closys.</li>
    <li> Half the price of the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this to me when it was discovered I had severe ginvitis, the only problem the price the dentist was selling it at was astronomical.  I Looked on Amazon ordered it and now Im hooked!  I have ordered it twice and getting ready to order again.  It helps and Amazon delivers as expected.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested this product. We love it.</li>
