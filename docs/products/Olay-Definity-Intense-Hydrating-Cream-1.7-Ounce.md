      <li>At $21, it sure beats the $73 for the Clinique version at Macys.  </li>
      <li>A+ :)</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance of this lotion.  </li>
      <li>arrived before time and I am glad.</li>
      <li>This is not the same product as the awesome silky definity cream we love.</li>
      <li>It feels light on your face, smells great and really adds moisture to your skin.</li>
      <li>This cream does not come with 15 SPF (neither does Clinique), so if you use this as part of your morning regiment, you should put a light 15 SPF cream on top.  </li>
      <li>I am always being told that I have great looking skin and that I don&#x27;t look 66 years old.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy, nongreasy.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizer doesn&#x27;t need to be so strongly perfumed.  </li>
      <li>I do wish they had a scent free version of the product</li>
      <li>it makes my skin look and feel moist, bright  and soft.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to sound paranoid, but considering the cost of this stuff per ounce...</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and lightly fragranced.</li>
      <li>Olay definity Hydrates my skin leaving it smooth and feeling comfortable.</li>
      <li>I hope that it will continue to be available.</li>
      <li>find the product has a light, feminine floral scent which I enjoy.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know if my concerns are justified, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this type of product online again unless I know.</li>
      <li>leaves your face moisturized; yet with a clean, non-greasy, light feel.  </li>
      <li>Like all things, unless you&#x27;ve got money to burn, it&#x27;s best to do a little research to see if a product will be right for you before buying.</li>
      <li>Between the Olay Regenerist, Total Effects, and Definity product lines, it took me a long time figure out which Olay product would best meet my skin care needs.</li>
      <li>Blogs elsewhere have more objective, varied reviews, and I strongly recommend researching those before purchasing.</li>
      <li>My skin looks far more even, the scarring has faded and I&#x27;ve not had any acne breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I love it because it is light enough to disappear and not feel greasy.</li>
      <li>This Definity cream is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>Why Olay would discontinue the Definity line when it works so effectively, was definitely a corporate mistake on their part.</li>
      <li>glad to have found it, because they don&#x27;t sell this in any stores near me anymore, thank you so very much.</li>
      <li>It goes on cool and smooth and makes your skin feel soft and touchable.</li>
      <li>Well and good for oily skin as well as dry or normal skin.</li>
      <li>Surface skin regenerates every 28 days and Olay recommends 8 weeks of steady use to see the full effects of the product.</li>
      <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t find the scent of the Definity products to be overwhelming.</li>
      <li>This was my favorite Facial Hydrating Cream &amp; used it for years</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have seen it this color.</li>
      <li>If you tend to be sensitive to scented cosmetics, take advantage of the Olay company&#x27;s free product sample offer on their Web site.</li>
      <li>( Glad I could purchase this one and hopefully Olay will bring it back!</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product but cannot seem to find it any more.  :(</li>
      <li>I am outside in the sun most of the time.</li>
      <li>Not bad for an old lady...</li>
      <li>The added benefits of reducing fine lines and discoloration is a big plus.</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily and acne prone.</li>
      <li>I contribute this to Olay Definity Intense Hydrating Cream....</li>
      <li>I really like the Intense Hydrating Cream and haven&#x27;t found a replacement.</li>
      <li>I have been using Olay Intense Hydrating Cream for about 5 years .</li>
      <li>It is light enough to use either day or night time.</li>
      <li>My face is much firmer looking and the age spots are fading.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Definity Correcting Protective Lotion and Intense Hydrating Cream for two weeks</li>
      <li>It really changed the texture of my skin.  </li>
      <li>It does not seem like much.</li>
      <li>My facial skin was still moist in the morning, and the texture as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>I made both me and my Mom very nauseous.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t care about wrinkles and aging.  </li>
      <li>I was really exited to try this product after reading the reviews.  </li>
      <li>It sinks right into my skin and leaves it feeling smooth.  </li>
      <li>Within three weeks of starting this product I have seen a significant change in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Did lots of research and even Consumer Reports states that Olay is much better than other products they rated.</li>
      <li>I will finish this particular product and not ever buy this hydrating cream again.</li>
      <li>Another reviewer stated it was a cucumber-y scent but please be aware that this is like a strong cheap imitation of a heavy designer scent.</li>
      <li>I normally have to wear a lot of foundation to hide the unevenness in my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been using the Aveeno Ultra-Calming Facial Moisturizer and L&#x27;oreal Ombrelle (only available in Canada)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> glad to have found it, because they don&#x27;t sell this in any stores near me anymore, thank you so very much.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now and I absolutely love it.  When I put it on my face, I feel like a different person.  It makes my skin feel really nice - not oily or anything. A+ :)</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care about wrinkles and aging.  I just wanted my skin to stop hurting!    I&#x27;ve been struggling for years with super dry, sensitive skin with eczema that hurt and stung and turned red if I didn&#x27;t get moisturizer on it right after cleansing and would break out in red, splotchy rashes, turning into oozing bumps and flaking skin every winter or whenever it&#x27;s dry or if I used the wrong product.  Medications had some effect but my face would become resistant after awhile.  My dermatologist told me to keep moisturizing.  I&#x27;d been using the Aveeno Ultra-Calming Facial Moisturizer and L&#x27;oreal Ombrelle (only available in Canada) Sunblock products which helped somewhat, but my facial skin still felt tight and uncomfortable.  I was looking for a moisturizer without sunscreen that I could use at night and accidently bought this.  I am so glad I did because within 2 days, my skin cleared up.  Finally!  My facial skin stopped hurting and stinging and the splotchy rashes disappeared.  It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and all of the little bumps on my face are completely resolved.  And, yes, as a bonus, the little fine lines and wrinkles and brown spots are disappearing too.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so happy with anything I&#x27;ve ever purchased before!</li>
    <li> Goes on easy, nongreasy.  I can see and feel a difference.  Lasts for a long time, only need small amount.  Another great product from Olay.</li>
    <li> Be cautious of the reviews here--many are posted from the Olay web site, where not a single negative review exists. (Even one as bold as to claim a Sephora employee commented that everyone she questioned with beautiful skin attributed it to Olay.) Blogs elsewhere have more objective, varied reviews, and I strongly recommend researching those before purchasing. No skin care product works perfectly for every consumer, and this item is no different. While I appreciate the light, whipped feel and subtle scent, the \\&quot;luminosity\\&quot; in the cream cakes into the few fine lines I have (I&#x27;m 27). After applying it, my husband thinks I have dry skin flaking on my face. Overall, the product is mid-range for me, but I am offended by Olay&#x27;s attempt to mislead consumers with fake reviews, as I rely on honest consumer reviews to help me make informed purchases. As a result, I will not again purchase skin care products from Oil of Olay or its parent company, Proctor &amp; Gamble.</li>
    <li> I was devastated when I found out that Olay had discontinued their Definity product line. I really like the Intense Hydrating Cream and haven&#x27;t found a replacement. Was so happy to find the cream at a reasonable price. It was a great find!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product  for the past 4-5 months now. And I must say that Olay has finally done  it! Almost all of my facial acne and other marks have disappeared, and age spots also have gone. Leaving my face radiant and shiny skin. My cheeks used to be very red like rosacea, and that is gone too. All in all, it has proved to be THE  face care product I have been looking for all my life. My skin is very oily and acne prone. But now it is also showing improvement and the acne marks from a few pimples  every month are cleared by it. It is lightweight and lightly fragranced.Well and good for oily skin as well as dry or normal skin. I give it  two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> The products Olay puts out keep getting better.  They are not oily or greasy or irritating to most skins.  What can one say other than Olay knows about skin and has been in the business forever. There are many selections and there is something for everyone&#x27;s type of skin.</li>
    <li> I guess that&#x27;s the problem with online purchases...but when I received this, everything seemed legit except for the fact that nothing was sealed. No plastic wrapping, no sticker seals...nothing to indicate that this was not tampered with.  I don&#x27;t want to sound paranoid, but considering the cost of this stuff per ounce...how am I to know that I am receiving the actual product or a quick scoop of some other bulk lotion when there are no seals?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if my concerns are justified, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this type of product online again unless I know.</li>
    <li> The cream is wonderful to use. It feels nice, smells nice, and makes my skin look so good. It is light enough to use either day or night time. I don&#x27;t believe in having dozens of products for my face. This one is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> I was really exited to try this product after reading the reviews.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy but I was immediately struck down by the horrible stench of the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;. It smells like the most horrible cheap perfume you could ever imagine.  Unfortunately the odor does not dissipate as you would expect.  Why produce a working product for only the smallest percentage of women who prefer a call-girl aroma?  Another reviewer stated it was a cucumber-y scent but please be aware that this is like a strong cheap imitation of a heavy designer scent. I made both me and my Mom very nauseous.</li>
    <li> I got this product because my skin was getting really dry from the winter weather. I didn&#x27;t think I needed a night cream yet so I got this to hydrate my skin at night.  This product left the strangest sticky residue on my face. I really do not like that at all. I will finish this particular product and not ever buy this hydrating cream again. I use Olay&#x27;s daily moisturizer and I love that product. This one, just is not working for me.</li>
    <li> I live where is is sunny every day of the year - not far from the equator. I am out in the sun at least 30 minutes every day. It does not seem like much. BUT, I was starting to notice visable sun damage to my skin. It was even starting to make me look older. Since I really like the Olay Facial Scrubs I thought I would give this a try. It is expensive, but sooooo worth it. My skin looks clearer, healthier, and younger.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product because of all the reviews I read, however, after 4 days of using it I had to give up.  I&#x27;m mid 20&#x27;s, medium skin color, with combination skin (slightly acne prone).  [Be careful with reviews, you don&#x27;t know what type of skin people have, so it could work for one person but not the other solely based on their skin type.]  I used this in the morning and at night, and these are the cons:  1. Clogged my pores! My forehead broke out, and that&#x27;s very uncommon for me.  2. The smell is terrible. Moisturizer doesn&#x27;t need to be so strongly perfumed.  3. The skin on my nose dried out and became flaky  If you&#x27;re in your 20&#x27;s, and have combination skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product as the awesome silky definity cream we love. Beware of the imitations which u can feel the difference. Face not as smooth after applying and hands felt sticky and needed to be washed. :(</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful....leaves your face moisturized; yet with a clean, non-greasy, light feel.  Lightly and pleasantly scented.  The only thing missing from Olay Definity Cream is sunscreen (which you CAN find in the Olay Definity Moisturizing Lotion (SPF15).   Love it!</li>
    <li> Tried these products and think they work better than most \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; products. Did lots of research and even Consumer Reports states that Olay is much better than other products they rated.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on sale and decided to try it after unhappily trying several pricy moisterizers at Sephora. I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s and my biggest skin issues are leftover acne scarring from my teens as well as some acne breakouts now and having combination skin.  I normally have to wear a lot of foundation to hide the unevenness in my skin.  Within three weeks of starting this product I have seen a significant change in my skin.  My skin looks far more even, the scarring has faded and I&#x27;ve not had any acne breakouts.  I have even started to go out without foundation because my skin looks so good on its own now!  I do wish they had a scent free version of the product but the results have been so good that I&#x27;ll over-look the perfume in the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Olay definity Hydrates my skin leaving it smooth and feeling comfortable. It last throughout the day without drying my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face cream and I am crushed that they no longer make it :0( Glad I could purchase this one and hopefully Olay will bring it back!</li>
    <li> I like you&#x27;re product, but the price keeps going up. Won&#x27;t order anymore until price comes down! I&#x27;ve shopped around and found it cheaper elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am 58 and have skin discolorations and wrinkles. I am outside in the sun most of the time. After about 2 weeks I could see an improvement. My face is much firmer looking and the age spots are fading.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been hard finding Olay Definity Intense Hydrating Cream in a regular store.  My wife swears by the product and I was extremely pleased to be able to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I got this cream when my Clinique Dark Spot Corrector ran out.  I have always been happy with all Olay products and thought I&#x27;d try this out.  At $21, it sure beats the $73 for the Clinique version at Macys.  To my surprise, it works just as well.  It even feels like Clinique&#x27;s.  It sinks right into my skin and leaves it feeling smooth.  I know that other reviewers have noted breakouts, etc. with this cream.  Here&#x27;s what I learned:     1.  When you are using a lightening cream, like this, you should always have at least 15 SPF on your face or you will do more damage to your face.  2.  This cream does not come with 15 SPF (neither does Clinique), so if you use this as part of your morning regiment, you should put a light 15 SPF cream on top.  3.  I found that if I put a 15 SPF cream on, it makes my face too oily and I end up breaking out.  I think this is because I&#x27;m double moisturizing w/this cream and the sunscreen.  4.  My solution - I put this cream on only in the evenings and put a 15 SPF cream on in the mornings.  It works great.  My spots are much lighter and not as apparent and I am not breaking out.    This and Clinique&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector are NOT dark spot correctors (i.e. they don&#x27;t remove them - at least not in my experience), they simply lighten your skin and make the dark spots look much lighter, almost disappearing.  If you stop using this or similar creams and then go into the sun, your spots will return.  This becomes one expensive habit.</li>
    <li> It really changed the texture of my skin.  I so hate that Olay no longer makes this product.  I keep searching for outlets that still sell it.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product but cannot seem to find it any more.  :(</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in the store and was very glad it was online.&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived before time and I am glad. Sender did a good job</li>
    <li> Makes you look 50 years younger</li>
    <li> Between the Olay Regenerist, Total Effects, and Definity product lines, it took me a long time figure out which Olay product would best meet my skin care needs. I selected the Definity line because it does not contain Retinol but is still suppose to provide \\&quot;corrective\\&quot; effects that even skin tone. I&#x27;ve been using the Definity Correcting Protective Lotion and Intense Hydrating Cream for two weeks and I do notice that my skin is smoother. The rough, ruddy patches on my cheeks are beginning to fade. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference on a dark age spot near my jaw but I&#x27;m hoping that will even out with continued use. Surface skin regenerates every 28 days and Olay recommends 8 weeks of steady use to see the full effects of the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find the product has a light, feminine floral scent which I enjoy. I tend to be sensitive to strong odors, so typically don&#x27;t wear perfume. Personally, I don&#x27;t find the scent of the Definity products to be overwhelming. Nowhere on the packaging does the company claim the product is scent-free. If you tend to be sensitive to scented cosmetics, take advantage of the Olay company&#x27;s free product sample offer on their Web site. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though Olay is considered a \\&quot;drug store brand,\\&quot; I find spending $20-plus on a jar of skin cream expensive. That&#x27;s why I researched the product and its ingredients and even took advantage of contacting online beauty consultants before making my final decision. Like all things, unless you&#x27;ve got money to burn, it&#x27;s best to do a little research to see if a product will be right for you before buying.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay Intense Hydrating Cream for about 5 years . I am always being told that I have great looking skin and that I don&#x27;t look 66 years old. I contribute this to Olay Definity Intense Hydrating Cream.... it makes my skin look and feel moist, bright  and soft. I love this product!</li>
    <li> this cream does wonders for my skin , I feel terrible that Oil of Olay has stop make this cream</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for a few years now and have been generally satisfied but the last jar I bought has a brownish tint. This is the first time I have seen it this color. Anyone else experienced that? At that price I&#x27;m thinking it hard to through it out.</li>
    <li> Excellent face cream!</li>
    <li> I have used this before but cannot find it locally anymore.  I hope that it will continue to be available.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite Facial Hydrating Cream &amp; used it for years but Olay no longer offers this particular product.</li>
    <li> This Definity cream is worth every penny. It goes on cool and smooth and makes your skin feel soft and touchable. Not bad for an old lady...</li>
    <li> I choose Olay because it is the only face cream I can use. I have Lupus and it is the only product that doesn&#x27;t burn my face. I was disappointed when the product was no longer available in the retail stores.  It works wonderfully on your hands also and I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  The added benefits of reducing fine lines and discoloration is a big plus.</li>
    <li> Made my face breakout...... yuk</li>
    <li> Did not diminish brown spots.  Not what I expected for the price.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face cream for a few years. I love it because it is light enough to disappear and not feel greasy. I am very sad that it isn&#x27;t sold in stores any more as I haven&#x27;t found anything like it for a replacement. Olay, are you listening?</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I have Rosecea and this is the only thing that works great!</li>
    <li> I have a war going with melasma -- so I use facial peels and Retin-A creams regularly. They work, but the last mild peel I did left the skin a little dry and irritated, so I used this hydrating cream last night, not expecting much from it. I was very pleasantly surprised. My facial skin was still moist in the morning, and the texture as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I could see a difference. Overnight!  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but it works.  I want to see if it will do as advertised and fade some of these lingering brown spots. This cream is very rich, so a little goes a long way. The fragrance is nice, but not overpowering for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer posted that the good reviews were written by people who work for Olay. I want to state for the record, this is an honest review. I do NOT work for Olay, Proctor and Gamble, or any of their affiliates. Why Olay would discontinue the Definity line when it works so effectively, was definitely a corporate mistake on their part. If you suits at Olay are reading this, listen to your customers and bring Definity back. Please.</li>
    <li> Tried this product before and it was great. Don&#x27;t know if they changed the formulation, but it wasn&#x27;t the same. The product leaves my face sticky and it becomes hard to put on makeup. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> The best skin lightener and brightened I&#x27;ve ever used. Recommended by my doctor.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance of this lotion.  Also, not a heavy cream.  Cannot find it in stores anymore so glad to find it here!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It feels light on your face, smells great and really adds moisture to your skin. And, it only takes a small amount to cover a large area.</li>
