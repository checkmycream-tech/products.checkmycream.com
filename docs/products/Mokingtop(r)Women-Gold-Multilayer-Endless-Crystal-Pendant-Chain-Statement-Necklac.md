    <li> beautiful especially for the price I was very happy with this product it did take a while to receive I had even thought mayb something had happen but the product its self was lovely</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this necklace...I will only wear it if I am going somewhere very special...You don&#x27;t want to over use these type chains so you must keep them wrapped in plastic when not wearing them and they should last for awhile..Beautiful piece but if you are picky about costume jewelry this may not be for you...But for me perfect on the neck and lays on the chest nicely....</li>
    <li> very nice to wear on a casual outing, will keep.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a 3 day trip to Vegas...which was all it lasted before falling apart. It is cute though.</li>
    <li> The necklace looked just fine when I got it.  I put it on and within minutes every layer of chain broke in pieces.  I was very disappointed as it was a very pretty necklace.  Since the price was so low it wouldn&#x27;t be worth sending it back.</li>
    <li> came in earlier than stated, it&#x27;s beautiful, but the necklace is actually long.</li>
