### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I found this to be the best ever detangling comb I have used.  </li>
      <li>Best comb I have ever had, couldn&#x27;t find in the store</li>
      <li>This comb has turned into my best friend,lol.</li>
      <li>This is a great comb but it broke after about two months of use.  </li>
      <li>it is great......</li>
      <li>I have tried many detangling combs, but this works the best.</li>
      <li>Since I am 70 and have used many combs in my life, this is a great compliment to Goody and the comb!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I suppose it might work for people whose hair is more manageable, but since it is marketed as a detangling comb, you may want to look at something more sturdy.</li>
      <li>It is very light weight, goes through coarse hair nicely without the ouch, great comb</li>
      <li>but we both have fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair, medium length, and wanted a comb I could use in the shower for combing my conditioner through.</li>
      <li>cant say it was extremely comfortable.</li>
      <li>nothing special about the comb</li>
      <li>If I had seen the negative review from the African-American woman (women with beautiful curls KNOW their hair products),  I would NEVER have purchased this detangler comb!  </li>
      <li>Good enough   for now,</li>
      <li>I have seen, but it definitely does the job and is a good buy.</li>
      <li>I think older versions of Goody combs used better quality of plastic type ingredients.</li>
      <li>I find it works great for that, and is much cheaper than a lot of the detangling combs that are advertised in different places-</li>
      <li>(mine broke on the first stroke)!  </li>
      <li>It really works!!</li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair which tangles very easily.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely better than my old comb, but still no dice.</li>
      <li>Not really ideal for styling but perfect for detangling.</li>
      <li>It is VERY unusual for us to break detangling combs</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>and they BOTH broke the first time we used them</li>
      <li>Broke my first one so bought 2 this time</li>
      <li>and I needed a brush that would not get tangled in my hair but was also strong enough not to break.</li>
      <li>I know several reviewers say they&#x27;ve had issues with this comb, but mine has been fine.</li>
      <li>We usually purchase the sturdy Goody \\&quot;been around since the &#x27;80&#x27;s\\&quot; detangler (looks like a rectangle with super sturdy tines that are &#x27;just&#x27; wide enough to detangle perfectly) which NEVER break (but in my house, we lose everything--lol--only to be found when the replacements arrive).  </li>
      <li>But works a bit better than my other wide-tooth combs.</li>
      <li>My hair is curly and when pulled straight is down to my top lip.</li>
      <li>Love its flexibility as it works through tangles in black hair.</li>
      <li>Its durable my tight curls did not kill the comb :)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The tooth&#x27;s on the comb are wide and smooth.</li>
      <li>and really, this is no different.</li>
      <li>Works very well for my fine, thin hair ... and that says a lot.</li>
      <li>The teeth are a little bit closer together than I would have liked (although not necessarily moreso than the picture) and the comb itself is not as flexible as other shower combs</li>
      <li>The reason for 3 stars though I love the comb is the quality of the plastic is poor.  </li>
      <li>The comb tines are WAY too WIDE to actually detangle your hair and they are made out of VERY flimsy plastic.  </li>
      <li>Use it to deep condition and detangle my hair without major breakage.</li>
      <li>I realize my hair may be a little more tangled than some, but this comb didn&#x27;t last past three uses.</li>

<li> you just need to comb your hair while it&#x27;s wet...</li>
<li> We both have long hair (down to our waist in the back) &amp; fairly thick hair</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
<li> I had a hard time using the comb.</li>
<li> I got this because I have very thick curly hair</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry sometime</li>
<li> Silly me.  </li>
<li> still get bad tangles with this comb but with the conditioner comb it goes through smoother.</li>
<li> I use to hate combing, what I call &amp;#34;my nappy hair&amp;#34</li>
<li> I am Very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <li> I purchased two of these combs for my daughter and me and they BOTH broke the first time we used them (mine broke on the first stroke)!  We both have long hair (down to our waist in the back) &amp; fairly thick hair but we both have fine hair.  It is VERY unusual for us to break detangling combs BUT this one did!  The comb tines are WAY too WIDE to actually detangle your hair and they are made out of VERY flimsy plastic.  We usually purchase the sturdy Goody \\&quot;been around since the &#x27;80&#x27;s\\&quot; detangler (looks like a rectangle with super sturdy tines that are &#x27;just&#x27; wide enough to detangle perfectly) which NEVER break (but in my house, we lose everything--lol--only to be found when the replacements arrive).  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  If I had seen the negative review from the African-American woman (women with beautiful curls KNOW their hair products),  I would NEVER have purchased this detangler comb!  If you do decide to purchase, you&#x27;ll be pulling out tines from your wet hair for some time before you trek out to the drugstore with a head full of wet tangles to get the old-fashioned Goody one! :(</li>
    <li> This is a great comb but it broke after about two months of use.  My hair is a little snarly when wet but not so much so that it would break the comb!</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair which tangles very easily.  I found this to be the best ever detangling comb I have used.  Since I am 70 and have used many combs in my life, this is a great compliment to Goody and the comb!</li>
    <li> It is definitely better than my old comb, but still no dice. The tangles and puling of my hair can also be pertained to the reason that I have very thick hair with small curls in ever inch of it when wet.</li>
    <li> It is very light weight, goes through coarse hair nicely without the ouch, great comb</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African-American and I have semi-straightened hair, so I realize my hair may be a little more tangled than some, but this comb didn&#x27;t last past three uses. The comb structure is odd, with the tines attached to a plastic structure independent of the actual comb frame.  The tines of the comb kept falling off every time I tried to detangle my hair. I suppose it might work for people whose hair is more manageable, but since it is marketed as a detangling comb, you may want to look at something more sturdy.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my fine, thin hair ... and that says a lot. I have tried many detangling combs, but this works the best.</li>
    <li> I know several reviewers say they&#x27;ve had issues with this comb, but mine has been fine. I have fine hair, medium length, and wanted a comb I could use in the shower for combing my conditioner through. I find it works great for that, and is much cheaper than a lot of the detangling combs that are advertised in different places- and really, this is no different. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the handle (I wish I had bought one without one as I think it is easier to comb without it), but that&#x27;s not an issue with the product itself.</li>
    <li> Love its flexibility as it works through tangles in black hair. Broke my first one so bought 2 this time so I have one as a backup!</li>
    <li> It lasted a month before breaking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a plastic comb.  Not a life changer.   I don&#x27;t like the brown, but it only came in   brown. I went with the brand \\&quot;Goody\\&quot; and   expected somehow something above and   beyond the rest.  Silly me.  But, it&#x27;s   a comb and I needed a comb.  Good enough   for now, but I didn&#x27;t say \\&quot;Goody!\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Best comb I have ever had, couldn&#x27;t find in the store so I ordered on-line. It really works!!</li>
    <li> The comb was not engineered for Afro Caribbean Hair. I know that now. Bork after the 2nd use. I am Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Cutest comb I ever saw. It does comb without tangling. Just wish it had been&lt;br /&gt;longer. Arrived quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this because I have very thick curly hair and I needed a brush that would not get tangled in my hair but was also strong enough not to break. Not really ideal for styling but perfect for detangling.</li>
    <li> The reason for 3 stars though I love the comb is the quality of the plastic is poor.  Goody needs to make their combs stronger especially the &amp;#34;Detangler&amp;#34; comb.  I think older versions of Goody combs used better quality of plastic type ingredients.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Quality product.  Highly recommend. A+++++</li>
    <li> I think this comb is meant for someone with longer hair. My hair is curly and when pulled straight is down to my top lip. I had a hard time using the comb. I used to have long hair and would use combs like these effortlessly. Its durable my tight curls did not kill the comb :)</li>
    <li> I like the comb, but it will snarl my hair.  But works a bit better than my other wide-tooth combs.</li>
    <li> Use it to deep condition and detangle my hair without major breakage. The tooth&#x27;s on the comb are wide and smooth.</li>
    <li> cant say it was extremely comfortable. the comb is wide so it shouldnt hurts so of course its ouchless. nothing special about the comb</li>
    <li> The teeth are a little bit closer together than I would have liked (although not necessarily moreso than the picture) and the comb itself is not as flexible as other shower combs I have seen, but it definitely does the job and is a good buy.</li>
    <li> This comb has turned into my best friend,lol. I use to hate combing, what I call &amp;#34;my nappy hair&amp;#34; but this comb has truly made me look forward to waking up and combing my twist out....it doesnt hurt and along with Shea Moistures Shea Butter(white bottle) it is great......</li>
    <li> I have a conditioner comb that I think beats this, but if you&#x27;re used to reg combs this is a miracle worker lol&lt;br /&gt;I still get bad tangles with this comb but with the conditioner comb it goes through smoother. I&#x27;m sorry sometime you just need to comb your hair while it&#x27;s wet...</li>
