      <li>- I have no idea WHAT you have done to the low-poo, but you have completely destroyed the best cleansing product my hair had EVER seen!</li>

      <li>My hair has never looked better since I started using this shampoo and companion conditioner.</li>
      <li>I get more compliments when I follow a 100% Deva Curl regimen than when I have tried anything else.</li>
      <li>I have purchased it more then once.</li>
      <li>and my head felt so much better.  </li>
      <li>I have used many products for wavy hair.</li>
      <li>A must have, do I need to say more?</li>
      <li>or it starts to build up like most products.  </li>
      <li>it was WONDERFUL - left my 3c corkscrews</li>
      <li>I love this product, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the 12 oz bottle because it just has a lid.</li>
      <li>Very affordable, smells great.</li>
      <li>It really felt great in the shower, like it wasn&#x27;t stripping my hair of moisture, etc.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I have been using this shampoo for about a year and love it.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter who has a lot more oil in her wavy hair as a pubescent than her thirty something mother.  </li>
      <li>I love the Deva Curl products and I have been using them for years.</li>
      <li>The one thing I love is that I no longer have an itchy scalp throughout the day after washing my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a month now, and while I really think it does a great job at hydrating</li>
      <li>The drawback of that is that I notice more hair in the drain and would like to stop damaging my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels better than it ever has.</li>
      <li>This stuff is magic, a must have for curly girls.</li>
      <li>It is in much better condition since using these products.</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>Very rich controls frizz, defines curls.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is great but the pump came cracked at the top so had to use an old one I had.</li>
      <li>It Free Moisture lock when they are too wind blown, frizzy or have too many fly-aways.</li>
      <li>Have happily used deva on my own hair for a long time, but didn&#x27;t think it was working for my child.  </li>
      <li>Let me start out by saying I LOVE the no poo shampoo, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t clean at all.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working fine for now.</li>
      <li>Low Poo is really great for volume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try Giovanni &#x27;smooth as silk&#x27; shampoo - [[ASIN:B001G7PLDW Giovanni Smooth as Silk Shampoo, Packaging</li>
      <li>I have to use this product because it is sulfa free</li>
      <li>have completely switched to the Deva Curl product line and am very satisfied with the outcome.</li>
      <li>I must admit, it took me a while to get used to the \\&quot;no suds\\&quot; feeling of the shampoo, the thought that if there is &#x60;no suds&#x27; the hair must not be clean .  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is creamy and washes out clean.</li>
      <li>Great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip dry out your hair.</li>
      <li>and felt clean.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that the texture of my hair has improved any at this point, but it&#x27;s definitely clean and scalp isn&#x27;t itchy, so that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
      <li>So this is good, I expect the bottle will last a while for me.  </li>
      <li>This product seems more gentle on my hairs.  </li>
      <li>Great w/ the other Deva Curl products.    </li>
      <li>I also only use this once or twice a week, so the whole week hair looks great, but is all tangled up, and when I use the deva products at the end of the week, there is lot of hair loss.</li>
      <li>This works pretty good when you alternate the days you use it</li>
      <li>Has a strong smell while using it, but the fragrance is really mild once it&#x27;s rinsed out, and blends in nicely with my other products not a part of the deva line.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it really helps to keep it from getting greasy.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough, honestly.  </li>
      <li>A nice, mild shampoo for curly and/or dry hair.</li>
      <li>have used it twice out of curiosity, and found it was effective on my dry frizzy curls just to de-gunk.  </li>
      <li>The low lather worked great, not too much, not too little, and much better oil control than the no -poo.  </li>
      <li>That probably seems terribly dramatic, but whatever Deva has done to the formulation of their low-poo has absolutely RUINED it!!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>good thing since it is a little bit of an investment on haircare products.  </li>
      <li>Gentle on your hair with just a bit of the &#x27;suds&#x27; I need to really feel like my hair is clean.  </li>
      <li>you want a more natural, sulfate-free shampoo, save the high price of this and go to a drugstore and read labels.</li>
      <li>With this stuff i can&#x27;t last more than 8 hrs and that&#x27;s in 65 degree weather.</li>
      <li>I like this better than the No-Poo which left my hair a bit greasy.</li>
      <li>I use this daily- love Deval Curl</li>
      <li>Love the low-poo cleanser and especially in the 32 ounce pump.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I use the Deva Curl/deva girl method and the low poo cleanser is better for my hair than the no-poo.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of other products and this is the best hands down.</li>
      <li>I will never buy this again (though, who knows, maybe since Ulta has such a great return/exchange policy, I&#x27;ll try again sometime down the line out of nostalgia).  </li>
      <li>For the money I got a large supply.</li>
      <li>Absolute junk.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately nothing was damaged, but it definitely could have been.</li>
      <li>I really like that it lathers.  </li>
      <li>I really like this low-lather shampoo.</li>
      <li>Some of the reviews are correct, if you use too much of this product, or too often, you hair will have a greasy feel.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I expected this product to remove more \\&quot;dirt\\&quot; or whatever (excess conditioner, hair gel, etc.)</li>
      <li>I have spent years trying this and that &amp;#34;fabulous&amp;#34; salon, non &amp;#34;fabulous&amp;#34; organic blah blah, dermatologist recommended, more blah blah shampoo than me or my wallet</li>
      <li>... here&#x27;s to hoping!the temporary illusion of moisturizing (when really all they&#x27;re giving you is slip and shine).  </li>
      <li>It became very tangle-y and matted and eventually accumulated build-up at the roots, even though I was using all products with no &#x27;cones.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m learning to use this correctly.  After years of using regular shampoo, this does not lather as I was used to and still cleans my hair. For the money I got a large supply.</li>
    <li> It takes a bit to get used to the minimal suds, that is why I don&#x27;t use the no poo, but it is great.  There is no residue left on your hair, it helps the curl stay curly and not frizzy. I wash my hair twice a week instead of every other day or daily as prior to use.  The only negative that I have is it leaves a lot of gunk in the tub.  Since I bathe instead of shower, I end up with a ring.  To solve this problem, I wipe down the tub immediately after draining the water.</li>
    <li> Love my rejuvenated curly hair with this shampoo! Find the accompanying technique in the book \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; by Lorraine Massey. Naturally curly/frizzy girls -- it will change your LIFE!!!</li>
    <li> Love the low-poo cleanser and especially in the 32 ounce pump. I use the Deva Curl/deva girl method and the low poo cleanser is better for my hair than the no-poo. Definitely ordering from here again.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  A must have, do I need to say more?</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has a lot more oil in her wavy hair as a pubescent than her thirty something mother.  Have happily used deva on my own hair for a long time, but didn&#x27;t think it was working for my child.  The low lather worked great, not too much, not too little, and much better oil control than the no -poo.  She can easily wash her hair once a week with this product in the dry winter months.  We&#x27;ll probably add another round of lather into the weekly routine this summer:)&lt;br /&gt;I have used it twice out of curiosity, and found it was effective on my dry frizzy curls just to de-gunk.  Has a strong smell while using it, but the fragrance is really mild once it&#x27;s rinsed out, and blends in nicely with my other products not a part of the deva line.  I will probably try to get my hubby ( slave to lather ) to use it on his curly hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased the larger bottle of this, and it&#x27;s lasting longer than I expected...good thing since it is a little bit of an investment on haircare products.  The one thing I love is that I no longer have an itchy scalp throughout the day after washing my hair.  With dry, curly, semi-coarse hair, this can be a problem.  But the itchiness is no more!  I have long hair, not as thick as it used to be due to excessive shedding and thinning over the past three years, and I&#x27;m getting away with about 4 pumps of shampoo, sometimes 5.  So this is good, I expect the bottle will last a while for me.  I love that the scent is mild, and my hair does not feel weighed down or heavy.  I tried doing the conditioner-only wash over a year ago, and this did not do anything good for my hair.  It became very tangle-y and matted and eventually accumulated build-up at the roots, even though I was using all products with no &#x27;cones.  I like actually being able to wash my hair and know that I&#x27;m not stripping it completely and at the same time actually getting it clean.  I will eventually try out the Deva conditioners and see how they work for me as well.  I can&#x27;t say that the texture of my hair has improved any at this point, but it&#x27;s definitely clean and scalp isn&#x27;t itchy, so that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
    <li> I love the Deva Curl products and I have been using them for years. I use the Low Poo No Fade Shampoo, One Condition No Fade Ultra Creamy Conditioner and Angel Conditioning Gel every day. Here and there I use Mist-er Right Lavender Curl Revitilizer to give my curls a regroup when they are getting too crazy or a pick me up when they are looking flat. I also like to use Set-It Free Moisture lock when they are too wind blown, frizzy or have too many fly-aways. I am a regular person, I do not make any money from Deva Curl and I have no affiliation with them. I am just a customer who loves their products! I&#x27;ll admit the price is a hard pill to swallow sometimes for me but I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of other products and this is the best hands down. I have natural very curl hair and my hair loves this stuff. I get more compliments when I follow a 100% Deva Curl regimen than when I have tried anything else. Plus, after crunching some numbers, I spend about the same on these products yearly when I buy the big bottles of each product as I do for the cheap / lower cost store brands I&#x27;ve tried. A little bit of this product goes a long way each time, the big bottles last me several months, at least 3 if not 4 or more, and the quality is stellar. It takes double the amount of the cheap products to do a fraction of the job that the Deva Curl products do for my locks.  I always shop for the best deal here on Amazon. The products are literally double or triple the price anywhere else in the town I live (Jacksonville, FL) b/c the only places who sell it are salons. From one curly girl to another this stuff is awesome, I love it, it&#x27;s worth the price, buy it on Amazon for a better deal and if you know a place with even better deals let me know!</li>
    <li> I had to say I bought this product because of the great reviews here. I have fine,curly hair that is like of a &#x27;cherub&#x27; or wavy curly depending on the day of the week.     Anyway, I expected this product to remove more \\&quot;dirt\\&quot; or whatever (excess conditioner, hair gel, etc.) from my hair. It really felt great in the shower, like it wasn&#x27;t stripping my hair of moisture, etc. and felt clean. I air-dried my hair and scrunched and tossled it to define curls and give it volume.    Low Poo is really great for volume. I had loads of it after use. The draw back was that the ends of my hair were rough, dry and frizzy, wire-y. I really felt that either a) the product did not adequately wash out the gel in my hair from the previous day or b) there is actually hair gel in the shampoo to give the hair definition. Probably great for someone with thicker hair.     I will keep experimenting but in the meantime (and could be user error) I will keep using my clarifying shampoo to wash out the excess conditioner and hair gel. Having fine curly hair is a constant battle against limp lifeless hair and dry frizz, and my curls do not look near as shiny and healthy after a good clarifying shampoo every other day. The drawback of that is that I notice more hair in the drain and would like to stop damaging my hair. The No-poo is great but this also builds up over time.</li>
    <li> I really like this low-lather shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, but leaves it clean and soft. Great w/ the other Deva Curl products.    I like this better than the No-Poo which left my hair a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> I really like that it lathers.  I feel like I&#x27;m using quality shampoo that deeply cleans.  I wish the scent was nicer.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now, and while I really think it does a great job at hydrating, I am concerned about not combing the hair. Gliding fingers through the hair in the shower seems like a bad idea, since I tried it and lost lot of hair. Not sure how others are doing it ? I also only use this once or twice a week, so the whole week hair looks great, but is all tangled up, and when I use the deva products at the end of the week, there is lot of hair loss. If anyone has suggestions, please guide.Thanks!</li>
    <li> Since I have started using it. I am facing very very bad hair fall. So I have stopped using it. It turned out to be complete waste of my money</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over how grateful I am to the hairstylist who recommended that I use a sulfate-free shampoo, particularly DevaCurl products, for my naturally curly, long hair (curl type 3b for those of you who know what that means).  Getting rid of sulfate-containing products has totally changed my hair and curls for the better - my hair is glossy, not as dry, not as frizzy, etc., etc... I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough, honestly.  I use every other day with DevaCurl Mister Right in between washes to re-shape my curls.  This shampoo does a great job of cleaning my hair well without stripping it.  Bravo DevaCurl!</li>
    <li> After reading the Curly Girl Handbook, I decided to give this shampoo a try. I think the combination of the no-poo shampoo and conditioner are a great duo.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my extremely curly hair.  It is in much better condition since using these products.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo once or twice a week but condition every day. This shampoo is creamy and washes out clean. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the hype... I should have.  My hair looks and feels better than it ever has.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I LOVE the no poo shampoo, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t clean at all.Well it did wash out the the angel gel that was in my hair but the next day my hair smelled like sheep or cheese .. what ever your hair smells like when its dirty it will smell like that the next day. with the no poo shampoo I can last up to 3 days with out having to wash my hair again. With this stuff i can&#x27;t last more than 8 hrs and that&#x27;s in 65 degree weather.</li>
    <li> I live in a humid Florida environment, taming my curly hair has been a battle for most of my life (even in dry environments) until I discovered this product.  Thank you thank you thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin curly hair (spirals), that seems to absorb up all the moisture I throw at it, and still manage to get frizzy, dry and unmanageable.  I&#x27;ve been researching products for the various hair types, specifically curly hair types and this product was amongst the recommendations.  I tried it, and have not gone back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some of the reviews are correct, if you use too much of this product, or too often, you hair will have a greasy feel.  But what I&#x27;ve discovered, that since may hair absorbs so much moisture, this \\&quot;greasy feeling\\&quot; does not last long.  I must admit, it took me a while to get used to the \\&quot;no suds\\&quot; feeling of the shampoo, the thought that if there is &#x60;no suds&#x27; the hair must not be clean .  But my hair is shiny, soft and curly...beautiful from day 1 to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have completely switched to the Deva Curl product line and am very satisfied with the outcome.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair, I&#x27;ve tried all shampoos and up until now I have never really loved any of them. Not until deva curl. It is amazing stuff. Very rich controls frizz, defines curls. Very affordable, smells great. They have lots of accessories but he shampoo and one condition conditioner is all I need to have AMAZING curls. Look up one of the Deva curl hair dressers for an amazing curly girl hair cut too!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo.  My hairs tend to be dry and frizzy.  This product seems more gentle on my hairs.  I have purchased it more then once.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Deva but the shampoos I can&#x27;t do.  I used this for quite some time and my scalp started to itch quite a bit.  I finally stopped using it and my head felt so much better.  I still use all the other products I just use a different shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used many products for wavy hair. Deva-curl low-poo is mild enough to use. I find this is the best for my hair. Does not dry my hair out nor leave it grasy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know my hair loss was due to shampoo until I used this product.  Now my hair has grown all back. Yeah!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Bouncy soft curls follow where this product goes!</li>
    <li> Great for kids with Curly hair!</li>
    <li> Gentle on your hair with just a bit of the &#x27;suds&#x27; I need to really feel like my hair is clean.  Great for curly, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Not authentic Deva curl product, dried my hair out horribly and made my scalp itch horribly!!! Waste of money</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I have fine hair and it really helps to keep it from getting greasy.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, exactly what I ordered.  However, it arrived with the seal broken in a too-small box and some of the product was out in the box.</li>
    <li> Good product for baby fine hair.  It&#x27;s had for me to find hair products that don&#x27;t weigh down baby fine hair.  This works pretty good when you alternate the days you use it or it starts to build up like most products.  Baby fine hair is tricky to keep it looking moisturized with out looking greasy or weighed down.</li>
    <li> As someone with curly hair, this shampoo is perfect for me. Doesn&#x27;t dry hair and leaves them frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to use my normal shampoo after 2-3 days coz i don&#x27;t feel this cleans hair efficiently. I&#x27;m trying to combine both shampoos now. Seems to be working fine for now.</li>
    <li> Even if you have coarse curly hair, this product, when used correctly and when accompanied by other suggested Deva products, your curls will be soft and shiny.  I am a believer!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. I have to use this product because it is sulfa free and it was the only product that worked well on my hair, this product keeps my hair feeling clean all day.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> It helps to maintain the moisture balance in the hair and does not make the scalp too itchy or flaky like some products for frizzy hair do.</li>
    <li> First off let me tell you a little about my locks. I have mid back length, fine curly hair but lots of it. Curly on the bottom, with waves from the scalp for the rest. I do not color or otherwise try to alter my curls. I have spent years trying this and that &amp;#34;fabulous&amp;#34; salon, non &amp;#34;fabulous&amp;#34; organic blah blah, dermatologist recommended, more blah blah shampoo than me or my wallet cares to think about. I have never found anything that compares to this product. I use to have horrible itchy, tight, burning scalp. No more. One wash every three days, no itching. My scalp problems were finally attributed to P.C.O.S for any of you girls out there that may also have this little problem. Try this product, it really is worth a shot, dealing with hair loss is bad enough for a woman. Never mind having to deal with all the other itching and dandruff problems too. A million stars to Deva Curl, Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love DEva Curl products! I will also order this product through this company again. The price is great and the service was extremely quick.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER done this, but I&#x27;ve just deleted my 5-star low-poo review and must replace it with this 1-star review. That probably seems terribly dramatic, but whatever Deva has done to the formulation of their low-poo has absolutely RUINED it!!!!!!!  I was using a bottle that was purchased in October (from Ulta) and it was WONDERFUL - left my 3c corkscrews so soft, elastic and bouncy with absolutely no frizz! I just got a new bottle and couldn&#x27;t believe what came out of the bottle. It looked and smelled the same but it barely lathered (I had to use a lot more) and left my hair hard, dry, knotted and frizzy (after conditioning and styling/drying).  I was so taken aback! I then used the very last dregs I could squeeze out of my old bottle (the following day) and, ta-da! - bouncy, soft, elastic curls, so it wasn&#x27;t just my imagination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even RETURNED and exchanged the new bottle thinking maybe I somehow got an adulterated batch, but no luck! My sister even tried a THIRD new bottle and she had the same result as me - hard, knotty, straw-like hair - the complete opposite of our results with previous bottles of low-poo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEVA - I have no idea WHAT you have done to the low-poo, but you have completely destroyed the best cleansing product my hair had EVER seen! I so wish I had stocked up on big bottles of it this past summer, but of course I couldn&#x27;t have anticipated this. What a huge disappointment.  I will never buy this again (though, who knows, maybe since Ulta has such a great return/exchange policy, I&#x27;ll try again sometime down the line out of nostalgia).  This new formulation is HORRIBLE. Absolute junk.  Looks like my search begins again for a &#x27;curly girl&#x27; cleanser that will give me good results.  I&#x27;m going to try Giovanni &#x27;smooth as silk&#x27; shampoo - [[ASIN:B001G7PLDW Giovanni Smooth as Silk Shampoo, Packaging May Vary, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]... here&#x27;s to hoping!the temporary illusion of moisturizing (when really all they&#x27;re giving you is slip and shine).  And the cycle continues...  (Don&#x27;t even get me started on all the new sulfate-free shampoos out there that have silicone in them! Folks- these are loaded with other harsh cleansers and should be avoided like the plague. I tried them all before cluing in to the curly girl method and they all left my hair feeling like straw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, moral of the story- if you want to reap the benefits of low poo, DO NOT USE SILICONES (i.e.: &#x27;dimethicone&#x27; and anything ending in &#x27;cone&#x27;).  Low poo will absolutely remove natural oils: I use tresemme naturals with aloe (cheap at Target, drugstores, etc... and silicone-free) as a leave-in and curl definer and then put a dime-sized amount of pure jojoba oil on the ends of my curls as the last step of styling (only on days I wash my hair) and this never builds up when I use low poo a couple of times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, low poo still may not be for you, but if you are using silicones in your hair, then just realize that you really will never know if low poo (or the curly girl method in general) will benefit your curls.  You can&#x27;t just use half of the equation (no sulfates) if you continue to ignore the other half (no silicone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck curly girls!!</li>
    <li> A nice, mild shampoo for curly and/or dry hair. But the scant. Ugh. Like plastic and citrus.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better since I started using this shampoo and companion conditioner. Whenever I have to use something else, my hair looks like crap. This stuff is magic, a must have for curly girls.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been using this shampoo for about a year and love it. We also use the conditioner and gel made by Deva to get the full curly effect and have been really impressed by how well it works.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the 12 oz bottle because it just has a lid. But the packaging on the 32 oz bottle (which has a pump) was pathetic. The only protection it had was a single piece of tape across the top. It was shipped with other items, including some electronics, which had shampoo all over them when they arrived. Fortunately nothing was damaged, but it definitely could have been. Also, about an inch of the bottle had come out... Very displeasing. There needs to be extra protection in these shipments.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great but the pump came cracked at the top so had to use an old one I had.</li>
    <li> No more, no less. It lathers up a bit as opposed to the No-Poo variety, but other than that, there&#x27;s nothing notable about it. The scent is chemically, even though it does not contain the usual artificial chemicals most shampoos do, like sulfates and it gets your hair clean, no better or worse than any drugstore shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a more natural, sulfate-free shampoo, save the high price of this and go to a drugstore and read labels. There are a billion and one sulfate-free, chemical-free, moisturizing/smoothing shampoos out there for much, much less money that smell wonderful and do a great job. Burt&#x27;s Bees and the Say Yes To...line of products are two examples.</li>
    <li> I use this daily- love Deval Curl</li>
