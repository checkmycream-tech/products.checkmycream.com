      <li>Lightly on the face, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product exceeds my expectations my daughter and I have been battling head lice for years. So I now don&#x27;t believe the myth that only white people can get lice lol! I won&#x27;t lie it took a while for a doctor to diagnose it ,they kept telling me I was pulling her hair too tight because the lice infested her hair line and side burns. The medicine they prescribed was very strong so you couldn&#x27;t use it daily it took it away for a while but it always came back. After years of prescriptions and home remedies with mayonnaise Vaseline etc. I came across Neem oil when I googled lice products right here on Amazon I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work but to my surprise by the second treatment, It  improved her scalp dramatically and her hair is growing back in the front. I also used the neem oil shampoo along with the neem oil. I&#x27;m soooooooooo pleased with this product. If you have lice bypass all the over the counter crap and prescription pesticides get this product you can use it daily it&#x27;s safe and natural and it works!!!!!!!😄</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good quality product</li>
    <li> This oil has been adulterated. Real cold-pressed virgin neem oil will partly solidify in colder temperatures and is thicker. I&#x27;ve compared it to two other brands. This also irritated my skin which did not occur when I used the other two brands.</li>
    <li> Mixed the neem with little drops of dawn and water, sprayed it on the top of the hog waller and the little water beetles vanished!  Also sprayed it on the outside or their shelter and the flies dropped like... well, FLIES!!!</li>
    <li> this neem oil has begun to relieve the skin issues with -Keratosis Follicularis (Darier Disease)  a genetic disease that is horrible in every measure. I purchased this after trying a smaller bottle for my dad and sister. My mom states that his skin has improved dramatically. Seeing that she had to change his tea shirts 3-4 times a day and the meds they prescribed were NOT working. At a much higher Price I must add. She cant wait to get him to his dermatologist to show them the Results. now my sister is also showing great results with her skin condition .&lt;br /&gt;now take into fact that its a 9 point attack, internal with the anti type foods and regulated eating of fresh, so research eating limitations. They both use a natural body soap - no dyes or additives. Cotton cloths , nothing is better. Natural laundry soaps. A large selection of pure natural soaps look for probiotic types. they exist. Look for foods, herbs, soaps that are ANTI everything.  Not the best smelling but what do you want perfume or results. Do some research this was once used to heal people with leprosy. now my dad had some MRSA mixed in with his from the hospital , it appears this is in control as well. We experimented with manuka honey oils, Tamanu oils  to see which was the best in results. Neem won out. Bottom line if your doctor is not giving you at least an 8-9 step program for its control than they are just taking your money. most don&#x27;t believe in this type of healing anyway . just meds and expensive creams. As I  mentioned we tried as a sample of the other oils , All I can say is this- this is a non passing genetic disease for which there is no complete healing , so to me the next best thing was to ease their pain and suffering -which it look like it Has. good luck do your research.</li>
    <li> its great when you have skin  problems.i use it to make homemade soap for skin problem</li>
    <li> I am well pleased with the seller and with my Neem Oil.  It arrived before the expected date and the price is very reasonable.  I&#x27;ve used the oil several times since its arrival and I love how it makes may scalp and skin feel.  I will definitely reorder Neem Oil!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells but it took my dandruff away</li>
    <li> Very good oil to moisturize the skin ,,,i love it and i recommand it</li>
    <li> Neem Oil Virgin Organic Carrier Unrefined Cold... has strength in smell. It is used as a mosquito repellant.</li>
    <li> Great product with a horrible smell.  I like to include garlic in my cooking however I prefer not to smell of it.  I must however say that this product has MANY uses.  I now dilute it with other carrier oils to mask the scent.  The best thing is that a little goes a long way since it is such of a powerful oil.</li>
    <li> Got my product early. Strong smelling but amazing for the health of my scalp and hair</li>
    <li> The smell was kind of familiar but couldn&#x27;t quite get it until a coffee drinker took a smell of it and said it smell like coffee but in all it&#x27;s great, will order again</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, as described.</li>
    <li> It may smell like composted bananas and garlic, but there are so many benefits to this oil. I bought this for hair purposes such as growth stimulation and dry scalp/dandruff. The trick is to mix the neem oil with other nut oils and essential oils. I do a 3 part mixture: jojoba oil, castor oil and the neem oil. I also add some drops of tea tree to cut the smell. It works amazingly and I&#x27;ve never noticed a lingering smell. I also use this oil along with my TheraNeem shampoo and conditioner. They&#x27;re a team of amazing products. Whenever I run out of this oil I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> If its your hair or skin issue this will help..</li>
    <li> Pure oil that works wonders and is a great price for such a large amount. You could not find this in any store with such a great deal</li>
    <li> Seems very pure. The smell, though unpleasant, is not as strong / overpowering, as some reviews suggest.</li>
    <li> Have only used it once but it seemed to get rid of the insects.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> incredibly hard to use because smell is so repulsive. though I want to use it for the benefits</li>
    <li> Smells like strong old Coffee but it works very well. I just add some essential oil to it to mask the smell. It softens and Detangle my hair very well. I use it by it self and add it to my conditioners.</li>
    <li> I bought this Neem Oil for use as a natural bug repellant for my flowers.  I have yet to try that but it is a great oil for moisturizing the scalp and making my hair soft!  You have to be prepared because it does have an unusual odor. I have added a few drops to my shampoo and also applied some to my scalp before shampooing.  I like it!  I have read it is good to use with coconut oil which I will try next. This summer I will check it out as a natural pest control!</li>
    <li> I just used the neem oil recently in cold processed soap.  It turned out perfect.  I didn&#x27;t care for the odor but I covered the scent up with Patchouli and Lavender Essential Oils.  I would recommend this product to others for the quality and value.  I will be purchasing this product again.  It was also packaged very well and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product...it was well packaged or it would have made quite a mess.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is my first neem oil purchase. It definitely has an odor that is unpleasant to me. I use another oil with it to try to neutralize the scent of the neem, so far lavender and tea tree oil have worked to accomplish this. I will purchase another companies neem to compare at a later date.</li>
    <li> I have used abaco neem cream on my face which tightened my skin and prevented breakouts. I used this stuff twice and my skin is breaking out really bad. Not sure what or why.</li>
    <li> I just start using this product. I do not know yet how is going to work as a bug repellent.</li>
    <li> Very effective.  Wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> Best neem oil eeevver! God bless the company.</li>
    <li> The smell is bad...real bad. I&#x27;ll never buy his again; however, it works well for a itchy scalp....can&#x27;t lie</li>
    <li> I use this stuff for lots of things.  My weekly hair treatment, bruises and scrapes, and also mixed with liquid soap [[ASIN:B00028O7VS Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Sal Suds All Purpose Liquid Cleaner 16 oz]]to spray on my garden (fruits, veggies, and flowers) to get rid of every kind of pest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s natural, healing, and very useful to have in my home.  This is nice quality as well, I&#x27;m very happy with it and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Fast delivery. I got it on time and started using the oil as soon as I got it. The product has a great quality.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I wish I had pictures but this thing really does work. What I like about it is that it can be put everywhere on your head--not just the hair length, so I put it on my scalp to regulate the sebum. What I have to say though is that they fill it to the top so be very careful when opening it. Put it on a flat surface and slowly open the cap. Sometimes it overflows even if it&#x27;s on the flat surface because of the pressure but most of the time, it&#x27;s just to the tip top so it&#x27;s extra oil for the same price :). LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Depending on your hair and how often you use it, it can last a long time! I have bsl 3c/4a hair and use it about twice a week on the hair length, every other day on the scalp but every single day on the ends (so they don&#x27;t break) and it works like a charm. It minimizes breakage and I literally stopped using all other hair products after using this because it works for everything. All I use now is a homemade deep conditioner to wash my hair and this oil and I&#x27;m set for a week! Recommend this product for anyone who&#x27;s natural and looking for natural things to put on their hair for length retention!!</li>
    <li> Having read other reviews I was prepared for the smell of this, but it does take some getting used to. Whatever you do don&#x27;t get it in your mouth! It is a whole different kind of awful. From doing some research around the internet I decided I wanted to use this as a moisturizer at night because I had heard it makes your skin glowy, soft, and flawless. It did my my skin glowy and soft- it&#x27;s excellent for moisturizing. However, it broke me out pretty badly. I stuck with it for a month hoping my skin was just purging but the bumps worsened and I gave up. For some people this is a miracle, but it isn&#x27;t for everyone. I would recommend starting with a smaller bottle if you haven&#x27;t tried it before.</li>
    <li> I mix this with Argan oil and use this on my hair and my hair loves this stuff. I also use it as a bug repellent for mosquitos  while I&#x27;m working in my organic veggie garden.&lt;br /&gt;This is great because you can&#x27;t apply deet on your skin; yet I can use this on my face without any concerns for my health like I would have when using products made with deet.&lt;br /&gt;My bottle has a December 2014 expiration date but once you open any item and allow air into it the expiration date becomes a moot point. This is why I refrigerate mine.</li>
    <li> I have scalp acne. This oil is absolutely amazing  at preventing breakouts. I would definitely recommend this product for topical uses.</li>
    <li> Great oil for hair and foot crack</li>
    <li> It mmets my expectations.  I will buy again when I need it.</li>
    <li> Kills lots of bugs, scares away the rest. Very strong so must be diluted. Odor dissipates once it dries.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t 100% neem oil. It is always in a liquid state. Real neem solidifies at even the slightest cooler room temperatures. It&#x27;s cut with something else.</li>
    <li> i purchased this in June. i finally got to the end of my other bottle of neem. i am very disappointed in this oil. it is clear with no smell whatsoever. my other neem oil was think, dark, and smelled horrible. for all i know im rubbing vegtable oil on to my skin. i have bought other oils from this company and this is the first time i have been diappointed, but  it makes me wonder if this should be my last purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased it to use in homemade dog shampoo to repel fleas and ticks. Seems to work fine on fleas, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work on ticks. It also helps heal hotspots and I&#x27;d like to think it deters mosquitos; though I can&#x27;t be sure of that.  It has a strong smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it as my dogs stay in a kennel when they aren&#x27;t outside.</li>
    <li> Actually works by itself in water pretty well. And feeds plants.</li>
    <li> This is the most grotesque smelling stuff I have ever come across.  I bought it for Shingles and genital herpes outbreaks and I gag everytime the top comes off the bottle.  What a waste of money, at least for me!  I have found other alternatives for breakouts that are far superior to this horrible stinch!!!</li>
    <li> Dandruff went away within a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix it with Dr.Bronner&#x27;s Teas tree liquid soap and water in a dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;Works great</li>
    <li> No difference fleas still a problem</li>
    <li> This is amazing oil. I love how it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and makes my skin feel rich in nutrients. It is also great to leave in hair overnight. It makes your hair fell so healthy and silky after you wash it. I also use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t make you break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
    <li> Organic Cold Pressed 100% Pure if your looking for Neem Oil this is the way to go! 5 stars !</li>
    <li> This stuff is stink, yes. But not like poop.. It smells like a pesticide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix the neem with mint/peppermint oil and water and spray on my scalp and hair as a pre-poo, I follow with WEN and they work nicely as a cleanser leaving my hair soft and smooth and the smell is concealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff really, it&#x27;s not heavy when it&#x27;s mixed.</li>
    <li> Much better than drugs</li>
    <li> I love this oil, but mosquitos hate it.</li>
    <li> Always comes quickly and I love this oil use it on my skin and it feels so soft. Also use it when my knees or others body parts hurt and the pain stops.</li>
    <li> Good  product.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Good quality neem oil that I use for organic pest control in my garden.  I have also found it is a good addition to pest control for pets, too.  It arrived timely and well packaged.  Will order from them again.</li>
    <li> This item is okay, and the transaction went well. I like how the seller placed it in a ziploc type bag for extra precaution in case of spills during shipping. I do think that the oil is too strong and downright just stinks of odor to be use for what I planned. I think it would be good for sellers to include a detailed description on the exact uses for the product. I am not sure if I got the grade of oil that I had intended and more information would have been more helpful.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested my daughter try Neem Oil. She has two toddlers and was trying to get the upper hand on another round of scabies. After using the oil and bathing with Neem soap, the next day we noticed an improvement.  She has since disenfected everything with the oil.  Who knew?  I would definately recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> Except I haven&#x27;t used it on my teeth yet. The best part is that my dogs sudden dandruff went away lol ..boy am I happy the scratching has finally stopped. It makes our hair fuller but lacking in luster so use a good rinse. I mixed very little w/ everything. Even mixed it w/ a little water and saved my neighbors plants. Now his plants are shining and the insects and bugs are long gone!</li>
    <li> Neem oil is great for organic gardening! Great as a natural insect repellent...great for dry skin too! I will buy it again. It does have a strong nutty odor but it does fade rapidly.</li>
    <li> I have a strong aversion to smell. But it heals cuts and scrapes like magic!</li>
    <li> I have used neem oil for several years, on myself as well as my French bulldog. I rescued my bulldog @ 7 years ago she had a bad case of demodectic mange, broken, bleeding &amp; iitchy skin with major hair loss.  Vet had given me Ivermectin.. which only had a small, slow improvement, did nothing to relieve her itching &amp; the mange would return shortly after I completed the medication...several years ago I tryed neem oil on her mange &amp; it was AMAZING.. it immediately relieved her itching,  I could see her red irritated skin change color to a whiter/flesh color giving her immediate relief from the pain &amp; itching.. her skin healed very quickly (noticible improvement within 2 days) hair grew back, with only 3- 4 applications. Mange did not return for several years... Recently after frequenting a dog park, she ha another outbreak... On feet, legs &amp; belly.. I used neem again, straight undiluted, massage it into the skin (she did lick it, but without ill effects) . Again required only 2 applications &amp; she was back to normal... I have used neem on myself on open cuts &amp; abrasions &amp; burns. It relieves pain, prevents infection &amp; scars. I am current using to remove large wart like keratosis ...it is about 1/2 the size it was when I started, that was about 4 days ago.  Neem oil is indespensible at my house!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Works great. I mixed it with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s sal suds to make an organic pesticide solution and it works wonderfully! my veggies are not being ate up by bugs. Good quality and know it is safe! Will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> Quality neem oil for the price..</li>
    <li> The smell is unbearable and lingers for days. I regret buying this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice product to use in DIY projects!!</li>
    <li> We have been using this to help with eczema. There is less dry patches and i love that it&#x27;s 100% pure so I can dilute it as needed.</li>
    <li> effective organic product for insect control - received quickly</li>
    <li> Excelent product, on time</li>
    <li> Used it while doing battle with a suspected bird mite infestation. Works great as a repellant when applied lightly &amp; to smother any small bugs when slathered on liberally &amp; kept on for 30 mins. Also helps skin heal.&lt;br /&gt;Smells awful but I actually like it because I associate it with healing &amp; protection.&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;Edit 12/19/2014-&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is really working. I now just put it all over me before bed. Lightly on the face, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has cured my rosasea of 6 years &amp; also healed my dandruff. I mix it with a little olive oil or coconut oil on my scalp because it can be a bit drying. My hair feels so soft after I wash it post oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recently mixed it with turmeric &amp; ghee &amp; applied it to a very sore eczema spot &amp; it cleared completely in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;This will now be a part of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now off to buy the Thera neem toothpaste to see if it does wonders for my teeth &amp; gums as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------</li>
    <li> Just a whiff of it and you know it is the real thing! If you have not been exposed to it, you might think it is pungent and that is common, but it is ok! I used this not only on my skin (diluting 1:1:5 - Neem:Olive:Canola), I loved that when I sprayed on my basil plant which was infected with tiny bugs, all the bugs died in 3-5 days.</li>
    <li> Just what my family needed.  I even have my friend and her kids using it. It makes your hair feel stronger and healthier at the same time adding growth.</li>
