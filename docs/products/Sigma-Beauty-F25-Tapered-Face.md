      <li>I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>WAIT TO BUY MORE.</li>
      <li>So many things online, products to review and you never know if the quality is going to be there..</li>
      <li>I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BRUSH</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sleek and wonderful on the skin, but the size definitely takes some getting used to.</li>
      <li>Not as tapered as in pictures, more rounded.</li>
      <li>Great brush, good price, use it daily.  </li>
      <li>Then I purchased this one mostly for powders &amp; blushes.</li>
      <li>I love my Sigma Brushes, I have had no problems with shedding, etc.</li>
      <li>Love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it mostly to powder under the eye area after having concealed it.  </li>
      <li>This applies powder so perfectly and gives such a flattering finish.</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels.</li>
      <li>I love how it applies makeup.</li>
      <li>quality is ok and not bad at all, surprise!</li>
      <li>This brush is so useful, you can use it to apply a variety of cosmetic products and they all look amazing.</li>
      <li>Ever since I started doing my own makeup it looked so funky and fresh.</li>
      <li>I feel it&#x27;s perfect for that due to the shape &amp; fluffiness of it.</li>
      <li>I just love this line and this brush and can&#x27;t say enough great things.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply product</li>
      <li>good quality brush, no surprises, very soft and dense.</li>
      <li>gave this product four stars instead of five because it is HUGE.</li>
      <li>its huge brush though</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very reassuring to know that I can safely order my favorite brushes through amazon.com.</li>
      <li>nice soft and gets the job done...keeps the shape unlike the sedona lace one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really just being a picky brat about this :)</li>
      <li>PLEASE make a good Fan Brush available for single sale!</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s tapered and that it&#x27;s super soft.  </li>
      <li>Definitely will order more - just make sure it&#x27;s from a real Sigma seller.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tad spendy but worth every penny, IMO.</li>
      <li>Soft bristles, feels sturdy, glad I bought it upon recommendation.</li>
      <li>It dried perfectly &amp; kept its shape, &amp; is still just as soft as when I first purchased it.</li>
      <li>The shape allows you to go right under the eyes, around the hair line &amp; nose.</li>
      <li>It is dense enough to pick up and buff powders perfectly in place, but soft enough to not disturb my foundation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft so the powders go one lightly.</li>
      <li>It is so soft, but disperses product in a precise manner.</li>
      <li>I just want to give you guys who are thinking of purchasing this brush on Amazon, a review from someone who has seen this brush first hand.</li>
      <li>Shipping came really fast!</li>
      <li>This brush is pretty versatile -- you can use it for setting powder, blush, bronzer.</li>
      <li>I first purchased the Tapered Highlighter and it worked exactly as I&#x27;d hoped it would.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be trying more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
      <li>I have several of Sigma brushes and i will be getting some more, tried and tested, you wont be dissapointed</li>
      <li>I like because is soft and easy to use, The price is very convenient.</li>
      <li>Good for small faces.</li>
      <li>in all great brush, a little to big for under eye area (it&#x27;ll do in a pinch) but really nice for any other face powder.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super soft</li>
      <li>The tapered end makes it easy to blend your contour lines as you apply the bronzer and it saves you the extra step of having to blend after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Ironic that words are required to leave a recommendation, but this brush has me speechless.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>It was my first experience in \\&quot;profesional\\&quot; brushes and I&#x27;m really and sincerely surprised.</li>
      <li>This was my first professional makeup brush</li>
      <li>It is so versatile that I find I use it for many other things than what it is intended for!</li>
      <li>BUT SIGMA BRUSHES ARE MY NEW GO TO OVER MAC!</li>
      <li>I use it mainly for contouring bronzer</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I got this brush after trying several other Sigma products and LOVING them.</li>
      <li>The tapered shape is really unusual and the bristles are so incredibly soft.</li>
      <li>if there is ANYTHING on it, its not the worse by any means just not as nice as the first time after a wash.</li>
      <li>It came faster than I thought being that I live in Japan.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 brushes (F25 &amp; E75) and was surprised to see 3 brushes when I received my order...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not really a multitask brush. I use this to contour the perimeter of my face. Great quality.</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE I AM ABOUT TO SAY THIS BUT SIGMA BRUSHES ARE MY NEW GO TO OVER MAC! I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BRUSH CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO BUY MORE.</li>
    <li> this brush is really really indispensable to work your cheek!!!! if you want a slimer face, you can work your cheek with it!!!</li>
    <li> Gerat brush for my Clarins powder and my Benefit Hoola!! It was my first experience in \\&quot;profesional\\&quot; brushes and I&#x27;m really and sincerely surprised.</li>
    <li> This brush is so useful, you can use it to apply a variety of cosmetic products and they all look amazing. I&#x27;m using it for my bronzer at the minute and this brush makes it really easy to apply it perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Easy to apply product</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush!</li>
    <li> This was my first professional makeup brush and I really like it. I use it mainly for contouring bronzer but it would work well for powder foundation and blush. The tapered end makes it easy to blend your contour lines as you apply the bronzer and it saves you the extra step of having to blend after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product four stars instead of five because it is HUGE. Perhaps it&#x27;s my inexperience, but I was shocked at how large and unwieldy this product is. It&#x27;s sleek and wonderful on the skin, but the size definitely takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> nice soft and gets the job done...keeps the shape unlike the sedona lace one. i would purchase again. its huge brush though</li>
    <li> This brush is very fluffy and soft.  I use this brush to apply my matte bronzer and it works beautifully!</li>
    <li> These are my daughters favorite brushes she loves them great quality, super soft,&lt;br /&gt;for perfect application every time. Thank you Sigma</li>
    <li> good quality brush, no surprises, very soft and dense.</li>
    <li> Acabo de recibir mis brochas y estoy encantada con ellas. , son geniales y no son tan caras como las de otras marcas.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super soft and fluffy&lt;br /&gt;No shedding (I&#x27;ve only washed it twice)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I have to wash it after each use because it doesn&#x27;t glide as well if there is ANYTHING on it, its not the worse by any means just not as nice as the first time after a wash. I&#x27;m really just being a picky brat about this :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all great brush, a little to big for under eye area (it&#x27;ll do in a pinch) but really nice for any other face powder.</li>
    <li> I saw this brush on Youtube and decided to order one. Glad I did! I use it to add highlights to my face. I have also used it to apply blush. It&#x27;s very soft so the powders go one lightly. Love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 7/12/14: 2 months later and I am finding that I often reach for this brush. I use it for blush, highlight, as well as loose face powder. I love the way it feels. I love how it applies makeup. I have not noticed hair falling out like I do with my MAC brushes. I am a big fan of Sigma brushes now. I will chose Sigma over MAC.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush, so soft! Shipping came really fast!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product by Sigma Beaty. Excellent quality! I was travelling in US and it just arrived on time at my friends house.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting this brush for the longest time. Ever since I started doing my own makeup it looked so funky and fresh. It came faster than I thought being that I live in Japan. I use it all the time to apply my highlighter. When washed the hairs don&#x27;t fall or come out. I would buy this brush again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you</li>
    <li> Ordered from NetRush which is an authorized reseller. Brush does not look like the others I&#x27;ve seen. Not as tapered as in pictures, more rounded. Not saying its a fake, cause it doesn&#x27;t look like a fake, just wish I&#x27;d purchased elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I got this brush after trying several other Sigma products and LOVING them. I swear, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand. This brush is so different from any other powder brush I have. The tapered shape is really unusual and the bristles are so incredibly soft. This applies powder so perfectly and gives such a flattering finish. It sets my makeup without looking &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34;. I just love this line and this brush and can&#x27;t say enough great things.</li>
    <li> Nice brush and great quality. Definitely will order more - just make sure it&#x27;s from a real Sigma seller. I used etailz.</li>
    <li> But a bit too big for my face so F35 will have a try later. quality is ok and not bad at all, surprise!</li>
    <li> Love it, simply love it! So many things online, products to review and you never know if the quality is going to be there.. Well this product has quality and a reasonable price, so I&#x27;m a happy girl!!</li>
    <li> Ironic that words are required to leave a recommendation, but this brush has me speechless. It is so versatile that I find I use it for many other things than what it is intended for! It is so soft, but disperses product in a precise manner. I just love it! I recommend it for anyone who puts on makeup. If you&#x27;ve been on the fence because of cost or unsure of whether or not you need it make the leap now! Buy it!</li>
    <li> Powder, bronzer, even blush... This brush works beautifully for any of these applications. It is dense enough to pick up and buff powders perfectly in place, but soft enough to not disturb my foundation. This brush cleans up beautifully, holds that fabulous tulip shape and mine doesn&#x27;t shed, at all. It&#x27;s a tad spendy but worth every penny, IMO.</li>
    <li> I like because is soft and easy to use, The price is very convenient. I´m  really happy with this product,</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 brushes (F25 &amp; E75) and was surprised to see 3 brushes when I received my order... Sigma threw in an extra eyeshadow blending brush as a gift with my order! How awesome is that?! Not to mention, the excellent protective packaging the brushes came in... The brushes were encased in a Sigma foldable paper box and then in a very sturdy heavy-duty cardboard box that was the perfect size and shape for my order. I was super impressed with the packaging... especially since I had just had a horrible experience with the packaging of a Paul Dorf brush I had also ordered from Amazon. That brush was sent in a paper envelope lined with bubble wrap and nothing else. That brush looked like it had a good stomp from a combat boot before it reached me... *tsk tsk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Sigma brushes and love giving them away as presents! Very good quality for affordable prices. I highly recommend! It&#x27;s very reassuring to know that I can safely order my favorite brushes through amazon.com. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This tapered face brush is big and fluffy! I&#x27;ve used it with some highlighting powders before on my cheekbones and it works great. I&#x27;ve experienced no shedding and it cleans up easily. I would definitely recommend any Sigma brush if you&#x27;re looking to invest in quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to the $53 MAC brush I really wanted - and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I&#x27;ll be trying more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
    <li> I love my Sigma Brushes, I have had no problems with shedding, etc. I first purchased the Tapered Highlighter and it worked exactly as I&#x27;d hoped it would. Then I purchased this one mostly for powders &amp; blushes. The shape allows you to go right under the eyes, around the hair line &amp; nose. Very easy to wash with a good brush cleanser, I recommend Sigma&#x27;s Dry N Shape, keeps your brushes in amazing condition &amp; quickly dries them in perfect shape. This brush is also nice for contouring &amp; highlighting as well. This one is a must have in your brush arsenal! One thing for Sigma...PLEASE make a good Fan Brush available for single sale! I can only find the one in an expensive kit and would love one similar to the MAC 187!!</li>
    <li> This brush is pretty versatile -- you can use it for setting powder, blush, bronzer. I personally use it for my setting powder. I feel it&#x27;s perfect for that due to the shape &amp; fluffiness of it. I didn&#x27;t have any problems such as shedding or bleeding when I washed this brush.. It dried perfectly &amp; kept its shape, &amp; is still just as soft as when I first purchased it. I did buy this brush IN STORE at the Mall of America, opposed to here on Amazon. I just want to give you guys who are thinking of purchasing this brush on Amazon, a review from someone who has seen this brush first hand. It&#x27;s a good buy &amp; worth the money! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great well-constructed brush at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love it.. Good for small faces.</li>
    <li> I have several of Sigma brushes and i will be getting some more, tried and tested, you wont be dissapointed</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I love that it&#x27;s tapered and that it&#x27;s super soft.  I use it mostly to powder under the eye area after having concealed it.  It&#x27;s really great.  Sigma Brushes have become a staple in my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> Great brush, good price, use it daily.  Soft bristles, feels sturdy, glad I bought it upon recommendation.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out what to use it for... It&#x27;s super soft - I&#x27;ll have to check on youtube for some tutorials and recos.</li>
    <li> Pretty close to perfect.</li>
    <li> very nice brush high quality perfect for blusher and face powder.  Loved it</li>
