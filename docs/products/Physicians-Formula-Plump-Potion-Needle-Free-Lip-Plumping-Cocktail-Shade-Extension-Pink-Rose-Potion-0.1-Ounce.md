      <li>She color is nice.</li>
      <li>It plumps really nicely, for hours, it is shiny at the beginning.</li>
      <li>I also liked the color as you can put a darker shade of lipstick and finish it off with the plumper which does give the appearance of fuller, shiny lips:)</li>

    <li> I didnt like it. It made my skin around my lips red.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to putting a 5 star, if it was just for the sellers service it would be a 5 star but this is for the product itself which is why I gave it 2 stars. It is a pretty lip gloss but it had no lip plumping in it, at least not for me. I have been trying various kinds but haven&#x27;t found one yet.</li>
    <li> Too sticky (if you have long hair, you&#x27;ll see what I mean), the color is lighter than expected, and, to add insult to injury, no lip plumping after a couple weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I bought this assuming it was hype, but I liked the color and it was on sale so I went for it. Wow, it isn&#x27;t hype! Apply and wait 60-90 seconds and you will *feel* it working. The first time it was an uncomfortable feeling and I worried that I was having a reaction. And then I looked in the mirror and noticed my lips were in facts fuller. The tingling stopped and every time I have used it the sensation is less and less noticeable. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this lip gloss. When you put it on it has this tingling feeling then in 30 seconds you see your lips getting plumper then before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the product for several years now and really love it. Started using when my previous company stopped making Big Girls &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; lip gloss. This has the same &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; to it and really does plump. Don&#x27;t expect silicone injection lips, though - this is very gentle. Also, it thicker than most glosses, so stays on longer. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Lasts prettt long. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> I felt and saw the plumper work a little for me but the smell was hard to deal with.</li>
    <li> Did not find any effect from this product whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This works fantastic for me! I absolutely adore the color, gloss, and even the tingle it has! Makes a very noticeable difference in my lips and its shade goes great with everything.</li>
    <li> This left no effect whatsoever. The glass is very thick and sticky. She color is nice.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Makes lips so sticky without results.i feel i wasted my money,and i spend alot ofmoney at amazon.</li>
    <li> Nice to use under lipstick. Not sticky</li>
    <li> As soon as I put it on I can feel my lips tingle - in a good way, I know it&#x27;s working!  I love this formula..</li>
    <li> Nice, but didn&#x27;t plump very much</li>
    <li> Smells like ammonia (and who ever wants to smell like that?!). Very sticky, did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;If it had worked... I would have dealt with the awful smell, but it doesn&#x27;t, so I am returning.</li>

    <li> Very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> No really plumping but ur lips to feel smoother</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but you can feel it tingle when you put it on. The color is sheer so your lips just look so shiny!</li>
    <li> In theory I like this product but I don&#x27;t really like how sticky your lips become when using it. It does not play well with lipstick. The way I ended up using it, is by putting it on before I apply my makeup then wiping it off right before putting lipstick or a non sticky gloss on. It works well. The effects are subtle so don&#x27;t expect a huge difference in the way your lips look. It&#x27;s more of a just kissed lips than lip injections look.</li>
    <li> It plumps really nicely, for hours, it is shiny at the beginning. It only needs some color.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t plump at all.  Very &#x27;gooey&#x27; and sticky, it&#x27;s hard to wipe off.  Way too thick and I don&#x27;t care for the color, it&#x27;s icy, not a good color for me. Too much money to spend on just a gloss.</li>
