      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>and when I told them about this rinse, they were pleased and said it made sense with the level of improvement they saw.</li>
      <li>I also did my everything to keep my mouth healthy to no avail.  </li>
      <li>Finally I found the perfect dental products!  </li>
      <li>It leaves your mouth feeling very clean.  </li>
      <li>Ever since I was a child my teeth easily chipped, cracked, broke and got cavities.  </li>
      <li>Closys doesn&#x27;t have the strong alcohol / minty taste that others have.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best mouthwash out there.  </li>
      <li>Huge fan of this oral care line.  </li>
      <li>FANTASTIC</li>
      <li>The fresh breath stuff in the stores I find is better.</li>
      <li>but their toothpaste didn&#x27;t have the light minty flavor that Closys does.</li>
      <li>That being said, today my new hygienist complimented me on how wonderful my gums were, how terrific my hygiene is and NO CAVITIES, chips, receding gums..</li>
      <li>We love this whole line!</li>
      <li>Otherwise get your teeth cleaned &amp; problems fixed &amp; then start a new with good oral care!</li>
      <li>Since switching to Cloysis my six month checkup/cleaning are quick and followed up with &amp;</li>
      <li>Using both Biotene with the Arm &amp; Hammer gell costed less &amp; gave me better results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not paid to test products, but I do try my best to give real explanations for why something is great or not good.</li>
      <li>over, my dentist, who obsesses over the quality of products he recommends, tests them all with his family first, and reads all the ingredients to make sure they are what they say they are, highly recommended this product to me.</li>
      <li>It is worth trying.</li>
      <li>Fresh breath and whiter teeth without sulfates.</li>
      <li>Helps keep your breath fresh</li>
      <li>My mouth feels cleaner and more fresh, especially in the mornings.</li>
      <li>I think it works better than regular tooth paste and mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My flossing isn&#x27;t always the greatest, I know, but it is difficult to floss with bridges, which is always a hinderence.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying just what I need!</li>
      <li>I tried everything from baking soda and apple cider vinegar, to onions, pine tar, extra fluoride, better toothpaste...</li>
      <li>BUT I must admit, I noticed a change in my gums (in one particular area of concern) almost immediately!  </li>
      <li>#34;your teeth are very clean&amp;#34; from the hygenist.  </li>
      <li>It absolutely did.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t tell you how I crossed paths with this product</li>
      <li>I bought an Oral B powered toothbrush and Closys and my gums have improved so much.  </li>
      <li>AND my teeth are much cleaner and whiter now.</li>
      <li>I had heard that receding gums could only be fixed surgically, but my gums appear to be doing much better.</li>
      <li>Works much much better and longer than other leading brand mouth wash.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products if you are concerned about keeping your teeth as clean as possible.</li>
      <li>Well, I found this product about 6 months ago or more and have rinsed and brushed twice daily with it exclusively.  </li>
      <li>cost of this product is too high for what you get.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since August 2012 and can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;ve noticed a marked difference in my oral health.</li>
      <li>My gums never bleed now, neither while brushing nor flossing and are light pink</li>
      <li>I have always had difficulty with very soft teeth.  </li>
      <li>I use CloSYS regularly and really needed these sizes to take when travelling.  </li>
      <li>You will really see a difference at your next dental appointment.</li>
      <li>After using it for only a few weeks (twice a day), I returned to the dentist and found that most of the areas had stabilized or in some cases improved to a level 4.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my mouth feeling and tasting clean for hours after I brush, without tasting harsh or chemically or burning my mouth  </li>
      <li>The only thing missing is the strong mint taste.  </li>
      <li>No other mouthwash or toothpaste has performed like this.</li>

<li> Instead of 16oz mouthwash recieved small 3oz travel size.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> Not sure whether it is helping me or not.</li>
<li> I am no longer afraid of loosing all of my teeth at an early age.  </li>
<li> And if it&#x27;s not good, I may suggest another product as I did here.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
<li> Caused nausea and left the worst numb/bitter aftertaste for up to two days.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone who suffers from halitosis.</li>
<li> TRULY REMOVES SMOKE AND BAD BREATH  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product.  My dentist gave me a sample to try.  You cannot find it in stores.  So happy to see it was on amazon</li>
    <li> Of all the dental hygiene products I&#x27;ve ever tried, Closys is the best. It leaves my mouth feeling and tasting clean for hours after I brush, without tasting harsh or chemically or burning my mouth  - it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that accomplishes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More over, my dentist, who obsesses over the quality of products he recommends, tests them all with his family first, and reads all the ingredients to make sure they are what they say they are, highly recommended this product to me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! Mouthwash tastes like poison, even with the added mint drops. Caused nausea and left the worst numb/bitter aftertaste for up to two days. The &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; is a joke. Turns to water within seconds after brushing is initiated (literally cascades out of the sides of your mouth) and leaves no residual minty taste. I would recommend using a toothbrush soaked in Listerine over this junk.</li>
    <li> Very good product!!  It help me great deal. I see the difference between this product and the previous I used to use ,no comparison .good service it Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I love this product my only regret is that I waited so long to buy it after my dentist recommendation. I started using it two days ago and can already notice a difference, my puffy gums are no longer puffy and no bleeding while brushing!</li>
    <li> This has been the best oral care products I have ever used.  My dentists always recommends it to me too!  My gums bleed for years when I brushed.  After using this product they have never bleed again!</li>
    <li> it helps alleviate &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; breathe and does freshen/clean out the beasties in yr mouth</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> works great recommended by my dentist</li>
    <li> Hands down the best mouthwash out there.  But you can probably pick it up at cvs for less than you can buy the care pack or the mouthwash by itself online.  The toothpaste was just meh.</li>
    <li> During a routine cleaning I was told that I had 6 areas around my teeth that were 5 or 6 levels of gum receeding.  I had to return for a deep gum cleaning in three months.  I read about this product online and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. After using it for only a few weeks (twice a day), I returned to the dentist and found that most of the areas had stabilized or in some cases improved to a level 4.  They actually asked me what I was doing differently and when I told them about this rinse, they were pleased and said it made sense with the level of improvement they saw.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Great system for people who have problems with their gums.  Pre-periodontal or periodontal disease.  Great for people who are smokers.  Recommended by my dentist.  Gave to a friend.  Only chain pharmacy that carries it is Walgreens.  Cheaper price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product. My mouth feels cleaner and more fresh, especially in the mornings. I think it works better than regular tooth paste and mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it</li>
    <li> The products themselves are excellent but I received trial sizes as opposed to the sizes listed in the product description. Did not receive 3.4oz toothpaste but rather something tiny. Instead of 16oz mouthwash recieved small 3oz travel size.</li>
    <li> Had the best check up ever after using these products for 6 months.</li>
    <li> I like the non alcohol mouth rinse having no alcohol, the tooth pastes was a little messy. It is worth trying.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your breath smell good all day no more bad breath and the toothpaste even got hair dye out of my clothes</li>
    <li> Works great! Helps keep your breath fresh</li>
    <li> This product, toothpaste and mouthwash, is the best I have found for protecting my teeth and mouth from bacteria. It is also superb for keeping plaque off the teeth. No other mouthwash or toothpaste has performed like this. I highly recommend these products if you are concerned about keeping your teeth as clean as possible. You will really see a difference at your next dental appointment.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried this mouthwash you&#x27;re really missing out WOW! And the tooth paste is really great too!</li>
    <li> I use CloSYS regularly and really needed these sizes to take when travelling.  Thanks Amazon for carrying just what I need!</li>
    <li> Nothing you could not get at the drug store&lt;br /&gt;way overpriced for toothpaste and mouthwash</li>
    <li> I like how this works for me. I only wish the toothpaste came in a bigger tube. I&#x27;ve tried other products like Thera Breath but their toothpaste didn&#x27;t have the light minty flavor that Closys does. I would recommend this to anyone who suffers from halitosis.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just so so in my opinion. The fresh breath stuff in the stores I find is better.</li>
    <li> Giving these out as gifts to co-workers.  Have been using Closys for almost 2 years now.  Works much much better and longer than other leading brand mouth wash.  Was big into Listerine before...  Closys doesn&#x27;t have the strong alcohol / minty taste that others have.  I can actually swish it around for longer than 10 seconds without burning my nose/throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for your theeth</li>
    <li> TRULY REMOVES SMOKE AND BAD BREATH  FANTASTIC</li>
    <li> Finally I found the perfect dental products!  I have always had difficulty with very soft teeth.  Ever since I was a child my teeth easily chipped, cracked, broke and got cavities.  Cavities, receding gums, root canals and caps.  That&#x27;s my mouth.  I also did my everything to keep my mouth healthy to no avail.  I tried everything from baking soda and apple cider vinegar, to onions, pine tar, extra fluoride, better toothpaste...you name it, I tried it and still dreaded my dental visits.  Well, I found this product about 6 months ago or more and have rinsed and brushed twice daily with it exclusively.  My flossing isn&#x27;t always the greatest, I know, but it is difficult to floss with bridges, which is always a hinderence.  That being said, today my new hygienist complimented me on how wonderful my gums were, how terrific my hygiene is and NO CAVITIES, chips, receding gums..nothing.  I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with this product.  I honestly think it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am no longer afraid of loosing all of my teeth at an early age.  I know that this product is healing my mouth and preventing any further damage.</li>
    <li> We love this whole line!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a few reviews saying it would improve gum health. It absolutely did. I had heard that receding gums could only be fixed surgically, but my gums appear to be doing much better. I&#x27;m 100% pleased with this product. The paste has a bit of a medicinal taste and the rinse is a very light mint even after adding all of the mint flavoring.</li>
    <li> I bought an Oral B powered toothbrush and Closys and my gums have improved so much.  I use it twice a day.  My gums never bleed now, neither while brushing nor flossing and are light pink AND my teeth are much cleaner and whiter now.</li>
    <li> Does not perform as well as Peridex but does not stain your teeth either.  Not sure whether it is helping me or not.</li>
    <li> For the hype, it didn&#x27;t perform for me.  Maybe my problem is too severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like PerioBrite products better.</li>
    <li> Best prices I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> This is a great product that delivers.  I use the toothpaste and mouthwash.  It leaves your mouth feeling very clean.  The only thing missing is the strong mint taste.  It is probably not necessary I&#x27;m just accustomed to it.</li>
    <li> I got the better effects using Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s whitening enhancer. The peroxide in the Arm &amp; Hammer product is stable until used &amp;it didn&#x27;t leave my mouth dry. And that&#x27;s not good since I already have dry mouth problems due to certain prescription medications I take.&lt;br /&gt;The cost of this product is too high for what you get. Using both Biotene with the Arm &amp; Hammer gell costed less &amp; gave me better results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not paid to test products, but I do try my best to give real explanations for why something is great or not good. And if it&#x27;s not good, I may suggest another product as I did here.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dental problems, research products before trying them &amp; get the advice of a dentist. Go to a county dental clinic before waiting your money like I did.&lt;br /&gt;*The health of your gums &amp; teeth has effects on your entire body! If you have gum disease or need fillings it&#x27;s likely that your antibodies are working overtime. The infection that is in your mouth easily gets into your bloodstream &amp; hurts your organs! Prevention is the best course. Otherwise get your teeth cleaned &amp; problems fixed &amp; then start a new with good oral care!</li>
    <li> Fresh breath and whiter teeth without sulfates. Perfect ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell you how I crossed paths with this product BUT I must admit, I noticed a change in my gums (in one particular area of concern) almost immediately!  As a result, I decided to get it auto shipped every month! Also, with the mouth wash you get a choice. You can add the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavor to it (which they give you a tiny bottle to add in if you prefer) or, you can toss out the little bottle and have it flavorless. Last, keep in mind: there will be no &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; when you&#x27;re brushing your teeth. LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> It works good. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Huge fan of this oral care line.  Simply put...it works. I use it plain without the added flavor drops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since August 2012 and can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;ve noticed a marked difference in my oral health. I like that it does not taste like anything, but again I can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s been any improvement. Might start looking for something else to help with the oral care.</li>
    <li> Before starting to use this product I was using Crest Advance toothpaste and would require additional scraping during my six month checkup.  Since switching to Cloysis my six month checkup/cleaning are quick and followed up with &amp;#34;your teeth are very clean&amp;#34; from the hygenist.  All I did was switch tooth care products.</li>
