      <li>It has amazing balance...</li>
      <li>So I was taking a shower and figured let me use it and see what it can do as I had tried the honey and rose toner face wash</li>
      <li>kind of runny, gets in your eyes</li>
      <li>That being said, it has exfoliation and moisturizes nicely.  </li>
      <li>I got a sample of this in Birchbox, and liked it.</li>
      <li>and then I used a rose water and whitchazel toner.</li>
      <li>once i got used to the smell, i really liked it...</li>
      <li>Honestly felt that the soap didn&#x27;t work to take off my make up</li>

      <li>I have been using this along with the Rose Hips &amp; Carrot Perfecting Serum and the Rose Hips Regeneration Face Cream.  </li>
      <li>I know some people have mentioned the odor - I honestly don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.  </li>
      <li>I think using it a couple times a week are all I can handle, and to be honest with you, I&#x27;d rather just use an exfoliator that contains granules.</li>
      <li>Feels great on the face and leaves it feeling so clean.</li>
      <li>Love love this product!</li>
      <li>I cannot give an honest review on the product since I do not think I received an authentic version of the product.  </li>

      <li>I use it right after shaving and my skin looks and feels great after.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very prone to break outs when I use any type of exfoliator, this is just a soap wash and seems to work really good for me!</li>
      <li>Excellent product, a least work very good for me.</li>
      <li>The smell is great, it really feels like it cleans your skin, it lathers nicely, and seems to do the job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been purchasing and using this soap for over a year and love it. It keeps my face exfoliated (read the directions and keep it on a couple minutes, then massage for a few more minutes). It took a bit for my skin to get used to it; but now I cannot be without this soap!</li>
    <li> FYI: They changed the original formulation of the Rose Hips Black Soap, removing the following ingredients: organic shea butter, rose hips fruit, aloe ferox, rooibos tea, kigellia africana, certified organic marshmallow root, licorice root.&lt;br /&gt;Because of this change, the soap seemed to cause a chemical burn on my skin, leaving scabs. This had never happened with the previous formula.&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted Shea Terra Organics customer service, this was their reply: &amp;#34;There has been slight changes in ingredients. However, the website is the most updated ingredients list and basically both are the same just the labels worded differently. Still, you will get the same results.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like they didn&#x27;t even read my email. The soap is not basically the same at all. It is missing half of the original ingredients and instead of leaving my skin soft and clean like the old formula, it irritated and burned my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again and am returning this soap.</li>
    <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Shea Terra Organics - Rose Hips Black Soap Deep Pore Facial Wash &amp; Mask...&lt;br /&gt;Shea Terra Organics - Rose Hips Black Soap Deep Pore Facial Wash &amp; Mask...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months now and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin. Granted, I have quite an intense skin care regimen, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that this is the biggest help. But I do feel like it&#x27;s contributing. I use mine as a mask in the shower. I dry my face and hands, apply all over my face, neck, and back and then leave it for about 10 minutes. It makes my skin very soft and I&#x27;m loving these results! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really quite awful that I received this bottle with quite a bit of the product already leaked outside of it......please improve this.  Perhaps an inner seal in the future?  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a million different face washes and nothing seemed to work for my acne.&lt;br /&gt;This not only improved my skin&#x27;s over all appearance, it also didn&#x27;t dry it out and left it so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is NOT great but it works!</li>
    <li> I use this product to wash my face  after wearing make up.  I have used African Black Soap,  which was messy,&lt;br /&gt;hard to find, different consistency depending where purchased,  some too drying for my skin caused an itching.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Nozema, it was a little too oily and caused bumps on my chin. The quality of the product seem to meet&lt;br /&gt;my expectations, for I have just used it several times.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product 2 years ago and it was amazing. The last 2 bottles have been totally different, soap is like Black gritty water, doesn&#x27;t lather and sprays out of the bottle when I try and pump it into my hand. No way it would make a mask. If I try and shake it up to try and see if the ingredients have separated it comes out of the top of the botte where the pump joins and makes a mess and wastes the soap. I&#x27;m really disappointed because the first bottle was miraculous.</li>
    <li> With this product you are going to get a cleansed face, your pore sizes are going to be minimized and I noticed that the blackheads disappeared on my nose. however, the price compared to the product size is just unfair. Then I remembered from search results that I did for black soap there is Dudu Osun Black Soap, which is far too reasonable priced that this one. So, all in all I enjoyed the product, but not gonna buy it again because of the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s... okay, I guess. After using tea tree oil face wash, my skin was clear but a little red, so I picked this up. For the first couple weeks, I broke out in large, painful pimples that wouldn&#x27;t pop and made my face swell like I&#x27;d been stung. Then those were replaced by whiteheads, and then (yay!) clear skin. Despite the initial acne, there was a significant decrease in redness! I also didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that some people described, even though I leave it on my skin for the recommended amount of time (5+ minutes). The smell is a big issue for me, though. Kinda smells like you&#x27;re shoving your face into a smoker&#x27;s closet. And it&#x27;s WAY more expensive than the 5 stuff I had before. If you&#x27;re willing to deal with the initial reaction this might really help, but the downsides are a bit too much for me. I&#x27;ll probably go back to my cheap tea tree stuff at Trader Joe&#x27;s and use the money I saved on a sensitive skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how good this cleanser was until I switched to another product because it was given to me by a friend. I kept on getting a a new pimple every day even though I was already using a salicylic gel peel and my skin had cleared up a lot. I didn&#x27;t think a cleanser would make that much of a difference because it&#x27;s supposed to clean the skin, not worsen it.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to switch back to Shea Terra&#x27;s Rose Hips Black Soap and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new zits, just the old ones clearing up. I usually rub it onto my face and leave it on for a short while. After a while I can feel a mild stinging sensation, which I guess means the soap is doing its work of clearing out my skin. I use it daily because I have rather oily skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel drying for me.&lt;br /&gt;My second bottle however smells a bit different from the first. When I used the first bottle, I noticed it smelled of ashes. But the second bottle doesn&#x27;t quite smell the same! Nevertheless it&#x27;s a great cleanser and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week, I&#x27;ve gotten the same results as one microderm abrasion.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap due to the reviews on Youtube. It&#x27;s a good cleanser but im not sure if ill be re-purchasing. I think the Black Soap in solid form from Coastal Scents performs much better. This one smells like cigarette ash which really grosses me out. Won&#x27;t leave your skin smelling like it though, so don&#x27;t worry. Doesnt smoothen the skin as much as I thought it would, but it does leave a nice clean feeling and smoothens the skin more then most cleansers out there.</li>
    <li> This soap is a bit like gel and I little tough to get a lather (could be my hard water).  That being said, it has exfoliation and moisturizes nicely.  Face feels super smooth after using it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product works great for Hair. Skin, Scars and whatever you can come up with. I have ordered this product several times and will continue to have it on hand for my many uses.</li>
    <li> I use this face wash daily as a 5 minute mask, along with clinique toner, and trader joe&#x27;s face lotion. I find the combination makes my skin glowingly magnificent. I really do recommend this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy it through amazon not the company website. Ordered this once through amazon, and got it in 5 days, ordered it through the company site to get the 10% discount and waited three weeks, was overcharged, and then had a horrible experience with the customer service.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Leaves my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I love it! This product works so well for my skin. And I&#x27;m grateful because I&#x27;ve tried many things and almost gave up on cleaning my face with anything other than water. I have a mild case of pimples and spots all over and now my spots are almost gone. The pimples completely vanished at first, but when the monthly &#x27;time&#x27; hits, of course some came back... but that&#x27;s normal. Usually without a cleanser, it used to be worse, now everything is less, thankfully.</li>
    <li> I love including this in my Shea Terra routine.  My skin is too sensitive to use it everyday, but I like to use it once per week to give me that clarified glow and help to battle hormonal acne.</li>
    <li> Ever since I began using this stuff my face has become much clearer and healthier. It has amazing balance...it dries out breakouts yet moisturizing. I love it and recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It has a very lights scent. Cleans well and makes your skin very soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, so far very please with the result. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I will repurchase this excellent product.</li>
    <li> Entered a discussion group and they were discussing &#x27;black soap&#x27; and finally after reading what was transpiring pertaining to how terrific organic black soap is and on  and on.  I checked out the internet and people are raving about this soap as a facial wash and a mask to wash away dead skin.  Well, I just tried it for the first time and brother you can feel the soap working and actually expoliating your skin.  My face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s   a-s-s-   after ten (10) minutes.  Taking it off with warm water in rubbing face in circular motion gently with finger tipes is the trick.  It is suppose to break down the layers of dead skin and my face feels it is doing it quite efficiently.</li>
    <li> i dont think i am going to repurchase this cleanser. i didnt see any \\&quot;benefits\\&quot; from it that i cant get from my trader joes cleansers for much less. the only thing i liked was that it washes off squeaky clean. it stings the bejesus outta your eyes so be careful with that. ive used it wet and dry and it stings a little when you put it on dry. some days the smell was a little too much for me-very mud and earth smell. not a bad cleanser by any means but not a special cleanser for sure.</li>
    <li> I mostly bought this as an acne treatment.  I had acne vulgaris and this didn&#x27;t do much of anything in treating that, but I will say it does exfoliate the dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> First off, the bottle pump was broken upon arrival and I had to jimmy rig it to get it to work, which made it leaky. The face wash was VERY VERY thin, and was therefore useless as it spilled out of my hands before I could even get it to my face (forget lathering). I wanted to like this product as I normally love Shea Terra. But this one was a bust.</li>
    <li> Yes, its a little pricey for face wash, but its worth every penny. At first the product may make your skin tingle or have a burning sensation, its supposed to feel that way, so don&#x27;t let that put you off. I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin, and this did wonders for my skin. After six weeks my acne, and discoloration was 80% percent reduced. If you suffer from hormonal acne don&#x27;t expect this to fix that, only a prescription to balance your hormones can do that, it will help it be less severe, and heal faster. I alternate with this and the honey cleanser.</li>
    <li> The Rose Hips Blcak Soap is clearing my pores since the first day.  Excellent product, a least work very good for me.</li>
    <li> This is a very stimulating facial wash and even more so when used as a mask.  I use this product in combination with the Shea Terra Organics Marula Face &amp; Body Oil as  daytime oil and  Baobab Oil in the evening.</li>
    <li> In the process of researching the benefits of black soap, I came across this great product. Although it has potential to dry out your skin, I really do see benefits after using it. The recommendation on the bottle is to leave it on your skin for 10-15 minutes. I have tried doing that and am happy with the results, but have also just used it as a regular face wash. After rinsing the product off my skin, it feels smooth and clear, and I am convinced it helps with blackheads. The smell is also incredible. If I use it and find that it dries my skin, I rub unrefined shea butter on afterwards and my skin feels clean, refreshed, and moisturized. I would absolutely recommend this product to someone who appreciates well-crafted organic products. The smell is great, it really feels like it cleans your skin, it lathers nicely, and seems to do the job. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I was drawn to this product as a natural exfoliant that had great reviews, but was worried that it might be too harsh or drying for my sensitive skin.  I decided to give it a shot, and am glad I did.  I haven&#x27;t been leaving it on the full 5-10 minutes that are recommended on the package, but even just using it twice a week as a face wash has left my skin looking bright and flake-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job of smoothing away those dry patches and flakes that I get from using Retin A, and hasn&#x27;t left my skin irritated or red at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product, and intend to try out more products by Shea Terra.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash I have ever tried. I have naturally dry skin so I have to use a moisturizer after using this wash, but my skin has never felt so clean.</li>
    <li> i noticed a difference after one use. it made my combination/acne skin look radiant.</li>
    <li> Good product...Leaves face squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> Only order this on the Shea Terra website or the consistency will be incorrect. Every time I have ordered this on Amazon, it has been liquid-like, not thick and gel-like as it should be.</li>
    <li> Ready for the softest skin of your life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this soap through a make-up video blogger who was a model on a shoot I photographed.  She was very enthusiastic about this product, so I had to give it a try.  This black soap is amazing, and probably unlike anything you&#x27;ve tried before if you are used to conventional face washes.  This stuff really breaks down dead skin and works as a mild micro-dermabrasion. Your face will literally be squeaky clean when you finish using it.  I found that using it daily was at times too much for my skin, and I would peel a little bit.  So expect a bit of experimenting to find out what works best for you.  I use it about 3 times a week.  (I also use the Moroccan mint black soap on the days I don&#x27;t use the Rose Hips soap.  The mint version - which they now market as a body wash - is a bit milder and I like the minty tingle.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap (which really is black) has a thick, jelly like consistency.  You only need a small amount, but note that it will not lather like a traditional facewash.  It doesn&#x27;t really need to lather to work, but some people find it more satisfying to see lather.  If you are one of those people, follow these instructions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Start with a dry face/hands.  This is key, people are using way too much water, and when you add a lot of water to something that&#x27;s like a jelly, the product just ends up in your sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pump a nickle-sized amount of product into your palm, rub it a bit so it breaks down, and then use your fingers to start working it into your face.  As you rub the soap, it will break down from a thick, jelly-like consistency, to something that resembles mud. Get it to that muddy point on a couple spots on your face. You are not using any water at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This stuff is thick, so you&#x27;ll still have some left on your palm.  Now add just a few drops of water.  You only need a tiny amount of water! Lather the soap in your palm until you have a good amount of later, and then apply that to your face.  From here on out, just work the product into your face and add a tiny bit more water if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this method will allow you to get lots of lather, but it is a slower process than a normal face wash.  If it starts to dry down, you can add a few more drops of water and keep it lathering indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this product as a mask, I just rub it into my palm until it looks muddy, apply it, and let it dry down.  A little water worked into a small part will start it lathering when you want to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last tip, this stuff is black, and if you don&#x27;t rinse it all off, expect to have marks on your towels.  For this reason I usually use it before I hop in the shower.  I put it on outside the shower, because too much water will cause the product not to lather and slip down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is supposed to dissolve dead skin and you will feel some stinging as the enzymes do their magic.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be that bad, to me it&#x27;s enough to feel like it&#x27;s working.  My skin does not feel tight after rinsing.  I know some people have mentioned the odor - I honestly don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.  It smells different, but not bad.  I&#x27;d prefer something that smells natural to chemical fragrances any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap will give you amazingly soft skin. I have never been one to be really loyal to one brand of face cleaner or shampoo, but I have been buying this stuff for about 2 years now and don&#x27;t see myself ever stopping. It&#x27;s one of the only products I use that I actually make sure I stock up on well before I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - October 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest bottle of this product has a different consistency, it&#x27;s not as thick as it used to be.  I suspect part of this is because they have been experimenting with the packaging and going from a bottle with a squeeze top to a pump.  While I really do like most of Shea Terra&#x27;s products a lot, they tend to change their product formulations a lot, and it can be really annoying.  The soap is a bit easier to lather now, mostly because it seems to be less concentrated than it was before.  It doesn&#x27;t have that thick, jelly-like consistancy anymore.  I kind of preferred the old formulation, but the new stuff seems to be just as effective.</li>
    <li> I first received a sample of this product through a beauty subscription and instantly fell in love. To be honest the consistency, color, and smell intimidated me at first but it has easily become my most treasured beauty staple. My face has never been so smooth. After I wash my face with this I actually feel like my face has gotten smaller, especially my nose and chin. I use it 2-3 times a week and leave it on for the recommended 5-10 minutes(using it in the shower is an easy way to accomplish this). For sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t use this every day because it is a microdermabrasion, but it is gentle enough to use multiple times a week.  From my experience the heel of your hand alone is not enough to remove the dead skin so I don&#x27;t apply it a second time. The method that&#x27;s worked best for me is to leave it on for five minutes and then follow it up with a light exfoliator or wash cloth.  The first time I used it I experienced intense tingling but that subsided after a few uses. When discussing beauty products with friends and family this is the first thing I recommend and everyone has always loved it.</li>
    <li> This face wash leaves my skin brighter and smoother.  It does sting a little but just proof it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face wonderfully clean and soft; dries quickly, rinses easily, and smells great. I am definitely going to buy again!</li>
    <li> Feels like a peel, and results are like a peel- but better, no down time and no peeling- just soft, fresh, vibrant skin-without the harsh chemicals! My staple product for fabulous skin!!!</li>
    <li> This is my experience with the face wash,  and I cant speak for how it will react on your skin. This is a great face mask on my skin for once a week.  As a daily face wash it is to harsh and messy. It does pull the pimples out of your skin but you have to be ready for them to surface. If you are used to flawless skin DONT use this during the week.</li>
    <li> I have been using black soap for years so I know how great it cleans and exfoliates the skin. This is the first time I am trying it in a gel form. There is a learning curve to using it but once you get that down it is super easy to use. I really love that it makes my skin glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use:  1 day a week I slather on the gel and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before I get in the shower. You can feel it tingle and then it goes away.  Rinse well. I follow this up with tea tree oil rubbed on my t-zone  and then a small amount of coconut oil.  This has even out my skin and made a lot of the sun damage disappear.  The rest of the week I only wash my face with hot water and a microfiber cloth followed by Cerave lotion.  I have very oily skin and find that limiting the use of products on my face helps keep premenopausal acne at bay. (I am 46)</li>
    <li> I was delivered to my home with perfect timing. I also appreaciate the effort taken to the protect the item from damage as it is in a glass container. The soap is actually black which was a peculiar surprise, but I love how the smell was nice and light and my face felt super clean after. It also left my skin feeling clean and smooth which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had finicky skin, but my face loves this soap. It loosens dead skin and keeps me completely free of blackheads.</li>
    <li> Shea Terra Organics is a fabulous product...I&#x27;ve used their products for only a short 1 1/2 years&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER I will NEVER order these through amazon as the ToysnGamesETC company chose to mail usps a glass bottle with a pump that was NOT sealed in a small wrap of bubble sheet wrap in a soft envelope, so when I received the package, the soap was leaking all over the inside of the bubble wrap.  I was lucky the glass didn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;This shipping company has absolutely no common sense on packing&lt;br /&gt;Order directly from Shea Terra Organics to get your product safely and intact</li>
    <li> I only buy this face wash on Amazon because it has done wonders for my skin! It completely removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling fresh. The only problem is that it can easily over dry your skin if you have already dry or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It smells like  you are washing your face with a dirty ashtray!</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical about how over the top some of the reviews for this product were..but it&#x27;s really true! I feel like my skin tone, texture, and clarity have all improved since using this product. It does take a bit of effort to spread over your face…the texture is a bit goop-y, but I find it&#x27;s best to use by spreading in small circular motions over my face, jumping in the shower giving my pores a chance to open and let the product sink in (almost like a mask), and then use a damp spin brush to exfoliate with the product on. Leaves skin squeaky clean..I would absolutely recommend this to anyone :)</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like washing your face in ash this is not for you. Once I decided to try and get past the horrid wet ashtray smell, I dove in with good intentions. I&#x27;ve used it about six times, and I&#x27;ve not felt the tingling or experienced the redness they describe on the label. Nor is it thick like jelly as one person wrote. Rather this is runny like syrup (probably watered down since that author posted), coffee colored and does not lather - not that I was looking for anything sudsy. It&#x27;s possibly too early to see any real results, but so far I&#x27;m somewhat apathetic. If I find that I&#x27;m seeing some real progress or improvement like some of the others mention, I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for the second time because I absolutely love the way it makes my face feel.  My skin feels so soft and clean after I use it.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I was on-line looking for Osima Organics Rose &amp; Pink Clay Facial Soap and found the Shea Terra Rose Hips and Pink Clay Facial bar.  I read the reviews for the Shea Terra and they were all so good that I decided to purchase their Rose Hips and Pink Clay Facial bar.  It was better priced than the Osima Organics one and it had 2 oz&#x27;s more.  I noticed other customers also bought this Shea Terra Rose Hips and Black Soap Deep Pore Cleanser.  I added this to my cart too.  I am so glad I bought both this Rose Hips and Black Soap cleanser.  It takes off all of my make-up, deep cleans my pores, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight and dry.  My pores are visibly reduced and my face is left feeling very clean, smooth, and refreshed.  I have been using this along with the Rose Hips &amp; Carrot Perfecting Serum and the Rose Hips Regeneration Face Cream.  My skin looks and feels so smooth and the clarity has improved by 100%.  My face is smooth, soft, plump, and has that dewy glow.  I was a loyal Estee Lauder customer, but now a convert to Shea Terra.  Thank you Shea Terra for making such great natural products and for converting me into a new loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I know that the unusual dark black color may put you off, but keep going, because this stuff works miracles.  My complexion has never been so clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> smells terrible! Could not use without gagging</li>
    <li> makes your skin so soft and smooth .. nothing like it</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my daughters acne!! It does not dry her skin out like other acne things we have tried. She doesn&#x27;t mind the fragrance and this is one of the only soaps she has asked me to rebuy. Says it leaves her skin soft and clean. We stop using Proactive since it seemed to do nothing and started just having her wash her face 1-2 times a day with this. Major improvement and no reactions or peeling dry skin and red spots.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin. Since using this face wash my skin has started to clear up. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I cannot give an honest review on the product since I do not think I received an authentic version of the product.  When the product arrived, it was in an oddly shaped cardboard box - similar to the way a book would be mailed in a thin cardboard envelope.  The glass bottle itself had a thin layer of bubble wrap protecting it.  However, you could tell the product had leaked within the bubble wrap as there was brown liquid around the bottle.  I was afraid that the bottle had broken but luckily it hadn&#x27;t.  I rinsed the bottle off and proceeded to try the product.  The brown &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; has the consistency of water and sprays out of the bottle when pumped.  I&#x27;ve looked at other reviews, pics, and videos and this is not the consistency the product should have.  I tried shaking it to see if maybe it had separated but this sprayed the brown liquid everywhere.  I&#x27;m hesitant to purchase another based on how this one went.  The box said it was shipped from ToysNGamesEtc.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using a sample size because it does exactly what it says, it deep cleans your pores and leaves your skin feeling cleaner than a regular cleanser.  I also use it to treat acne, however it does dry my skin out a little so you need to use a moisturizer after.  I use it solely as a mask.</li>
    <li> It works well for my daughter.  She alternates this with other acne meds she has.  It works! For those of you that feel discouraged, just give it a try.</li>
    <li> Stars were hit my accident.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this cleanser. I applied it and all was well, until my face started burning. I have dry skin, and It hurt so bad, that there is actually a burn like mark left on the right side of my face from the face wash. May be a good product for those with oily skin, but if you have dry, sensitive skin, or eczema on your face, I definitely don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> love тнιѕ ѕтυғғ  wιll вυy мore</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Want to use it all the time. I use it every day and night right now and it&#x27;s changed my skin dramatically!</li>
    <li> I used the soap as directed  once and I have small spots all over my face and I stopped using it,I wish they could give me back my money. I  have oily sensitive and prone to acne skin, I look terrible and don&#x27;t know  what to do</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me, but I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it delivered exactly what it promised... just a little too much! I&#x27;m 21 years old and still have tight skin, but I got it for the cleansing power. The only problem is that it pulled my skin so tight that I got wrinkles when I smiled! I will no longer use this product because it doesn&#x27;t work for me, but if you are looking for skin tightening, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product in 2010. I used is periodically and really liked the smooth clean feel. Apparently the formula changed between then and now, however so far I see no difference (3 days in)</li>
    <li> I used this for a week back in June. I always saw great reviews and recommendations for this product. I only used it at night, just rinsing with water in the mornings when I noticed how strong it was on my first use. The first night I noticed some stinging, which is supposed to be normal, and by the end of the week the skin on my face and neck was horribly dry, itchy, and inflammed. What&#x27;s worse, now nearly a month since I last used it my skin hasn&#x27;t recovered! I&#x27;ve tried everything to get my skin back to its normal state and its still dry, tight, flaky, itchy and red.</li>
    <li> Ordered this based on the reviews.  Haven&#x27;t seen the results other reviewers spoke of but I do like it.  I have dry skin and use it as a mask almost every evening and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a definite improvement in my cystic acne since I&#x27;ve started washing my face each morning with the Rose Hips Black Soap. If you have oily skin this soap may not leave your skin feeling clean, since it leaves your skin feeling moisturized. So, sometimes I use this after cleansing my face with a face soap that dries me out and cuts the oil, but most days I just wash my face with the Rose Hip Black Soap. After washing my face, I usually apply a couple drops of essential oils depending on what my skin needs. The majority of the time I apply lavender oil and organic evening primrose oil. If I&#x27;m really oily I&#x27;ll use peppermint oil. If I have active breakouts or I fear active break outs, then I&#x27;ll use tea tree oil. After caring for my skin like this for one or two weeks, I stopped having any acne breakouts. I&#x27;ve probably been acne free for nearly a month now, and today I got one breakout; so I&#x27;m seeing some improvement since I used to have an average of 3 breakouts at any given time.</li>
    <li> First time using this, I&#x27;ve heard the African black soap helps with oily/complex skin. I&#x27;m very prone to break outs when I use any type of exfoliator, this is just a soap wash and seems to work really good for me!</li>
    <li> Great product for cleansing &amp; facial rejuvenation. Smooths out lines &amp; cleanses. Will recomend it to my grandson for minor acne</li>
    <li> this product is great! I used to use AHA and BHA to exfoliate, and now I use this everyday (have combination skin) - not very drying with suitable moisturizer (I use cetaphile)</li>
    <li> I was super excited since this is an organic product, but unfortunately after 2 weeks of using it, it made my face break out REALLY bad. I got tiny pimples all over my face and it took a few weeks to get rid of them all. :-(</li>
    <li> I really like this product for breakouts. Keeps my skin under control when my diet sucks. Works wonders on breakouts. Smells good! Arrived quickly and as described. Use as directions tell you.</li>
    <li> Wow! You get results right away, I have oily combination skin, and this leaves it clean and clear, I just don&#x27;t leave it on as long as instructed, otherwise it will dry my skin, also I have yet to use it as a mask</li>
    <li> I loved this product in the beginning.  Unfortunately, after a month it turns to a watery substance.  The company claims that this is normal as it&#x27;s all organic and can still be used.  I have tried and due to the watery substance it does not stay on your face or feel the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I first bought this almost a year ago it was in like sept of 2013. I did not initially read the directions and instead i stupidly went off of what other people said on here in reviews and even on reviews on youtube. They all said to lather and rinse on my face like a normal face wash. Wrong. This method did not work for me and i didn&#x27;t see any change in my acne so I of course put it in my medicine cabinet to collect dust.  I don&#x27;t know if  the directions changed during the time between the publishing of those reviews and my receiving the product or what, but my directions are different, which i didn&#x27;t figure out until about a week ago. The directions on my bottle say to leave the product on your face for 5-10 mins. Yes, my product says facial wash, not mask. Not even &amp;#34;facial wash and mask&amp;#34; just &amp;#34;facial wash&amp;#34;. I had been using proactiv+ from about late march of this year until about june. Proactive made my skin look more agitated than before i started using it and it never got better so i went back to what i was using before, cerave. Cerave was better than proactiv but did not solve all of my problems. I still had breakouts whenever my skin decided to and my pores continued to be ginormous. Sooo one day last week i decided that i had nothing to lose and gave this product another try this time actually reading and following the directions. Presto, my skin looks better than it has in years. Im 19 and am sick of having to worry about my skin. This product is the only thing that has successfully and effectively cleared my pores. Ive tried countless masks and charcoal face washes but nothing. This was just perfect. Im not all the way there yet since its only been a week, but my skin seriously looks better than it has in years.  I use this product twice a day everyday and leave it on for 5-10 mons usually ten but i start my soph year of college monday so that could change haha and it does not irritate my skin at all nor leave it dry at all but instead so smooth and soft. I love this stuff.l but instead so smooth and soft. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this for along time. The Organic facial wash black soap with rose hips has made my face so rejuvenated and clear that my skin has concoted it&#x27;s own natural glow. I&#x27;m a firm believer in Organic products especially when it has to do with my skin,hair, and nails. I am Beatific with my results and will be buying lots more products from this company in the near future!</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this face wash. I have been using Dr. Perricone&#x27;s citrus wash for the last couple of years at $40.00 a bottle. I never would have tried something new but I received a trial size of the Shea Terra Black Soap in my Birchbox and dropped it in my gym bag as a back-up. I had no real interest in using it because i liked my Dr. Perricone wash just fine, but as I rinsed this off my face I knew I had found something special. My skin was actually squeeky clean .. sounds weird ... but i&#x27;m completely serious. There was no residue left on my skin at all nor was my skin tight or dry feeling. The best part of all - its cheap!! I fully expected and was willing to pay more for this fantastic product but extremely happy that I don&#x27;t have to. :)</li>
    <li> This black soap works wonders on my skin. It is very effective. If you have oily skin it would probably work better for you.</li>
    <li> I keep this in the refrigerator and that seems to do the trick of helping it stay fresh. It does tingle a little. Sometimes i leave it on for 5 minutes and sometimes 10. I notice that my pores are smaller and my face tighter. It doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin, but my skin is not sensitive. I will definitely keep this to exfoliate regularly because I do notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I purchased several Shea Terra products after reading the reviews. This soap, along with the African Baobab Oil, really seems to have changed the overall texture and look of my skin. I love the fact that these are organics products, something I&#x27;m striving to incorporate into all areas of my life. I leave it on for 5-10 minutes and wash it off well with my Olay face machine thingie. (You might find the black does settle into your pores so you do need to use a scrub product to remove it all). Really impressed with these Shea Terra products!</li>
    <li> Just got this a few days ago and am very pleased with the results. My skin looks so much better that it is hard to believe. Does a great job of deep pore cleaning but no harsh after treatment feel. Love it.</li>
    <li> The best facial cleansing product I have ever used.  No more eye make up remover, cotton pads etc.  My skin is in better shape than ever.  Age 54.</li>
    <li> I used this for about 2 weeks before doing a review. The first few days I had an abundance of pimples but that cleared up with continued use. My blemishes are fading. My skin is so soft and I can see my natural glow without the use of any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t let it sit on my face as that slows down my morning routine. I wet my face and then apply the face wash all over. I then use my facial brush to cleanse</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It clears up my acne as soon as I see a spot I put it on it and let it dry then the net day the spot look so much better!! Get this product it is so worth a try!!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in Birchbox, and liked it. I have rosacea, so my skin is very sensitive, but this leaves it clean without irritating it. I dont leave it on for more than 30 seconds, and no more than 2 times a week.</li>
    <li> After following directions, my face has started to feel much more healthy and smooth! Love it. Smell was a little off setting at first, but after a few uses, I don&#x27;t even notice anymore. Will continue buying this.</li>
    <li> I got this product in a birchbox shipment. I love how deep it cleans. I have been looking to ditch the facewash i have been using for 5 years because it just doesn&#x27;t take my makeup off. If when i dry my face and my foundation is coming off on the towel i just don&#x27;t see how it can be cleaning. so i am trying this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how squeaky clean it makes my face and how clean my pores and tight my skin feels. I seem to be breaking out a bunch after using it for a few days but I am going to hold off in hopes that it is just doing some really deep pore cleaning. The spa I get facials at says that you should give a new face regimen at least two weeks before knowing if it is working or not. Hoping all this stuff clears up and remains clear! I will follow up with results.</li>
    <li> The best facial cleaner I ever used.  The first time my adult acne has been under control in years.  I have no idea why it works, but it is a miracle.</li>
    <li> Great product, I really love it. It is just too small. I wish it would come in a larger bottle that does not leak. The formula itself though is great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new cleanser and this does the job. My skin feels refreshed and clear. I&#x27;m thinking of trying other items by this company.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the face and leaves it feeling so clean. No residue.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and immediately bought it. I agree with all the positive reviews, this stuff is amazingly good. I lather it up in the shower and leave it on. When I rinse it off, it leaves my skins so, so soft (like a baby&#x27;s bottom LOL). I know I will be stocking up on this stuff. It&#x27;s terrific! If you don&#x27;t believe me, try it yourself. You will be delighted with the results!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend.  Prior to that, I had never used it or even heard of \\&quot;black soap\\&quot;.  Having bouts of adult acne and combination skin (dry and oily)...... this product has been a great change for me.  The overall feel of the skin is more smooth, tighter pores, and less acne.  I use the product 1-2 times daily as a wash and occassionally as a skin mask.  It only takes a small amount and works well.  I am a repeat customer and recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> This product has improved my skin so much. Wish I had found it years earlier!! It has normalized my oily skin which I thought could never be tamed.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash of all time. Makes skin soft and acne free.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this face wash a few times. I LOVE IT! I have very sensitive/adult acne prone skin and this works great for me. The quality of ingredients are very important to me in a product and that is why I initially purchased this. And I prefer my products in glass containers. It also works well with my Clairsonic. Try it !</li>
    <li> When I first started using the soap, it had a jelly like consistency, which adhere to the face and worked well. After 5 months it now turned into a watery consistency which just slips off the face like water and is now ineffective because you can&#x27;t use it as a mask. This lead me to believe that the soap has expired although I can&#x27;t find an expiration date on the bottle. I asked the seller to send a replacement but was declined. Their response was generic and that they can&#x27;t replace opened products.  It would be helpful if they explained why the soap turned from thick jelly to water.  I won&#x27;t purchase this soap again due to the sellers lack of customer service.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Rose Hip Black Soap from sheaterraorganics.com...I love it!! With the shipping it can get a bit pricy ordering from the website so I thought Id give Amazon a try. I paid $15 from this manufacturer about 2 months ago because I was running low with my first bottle. Today I have opened it and the packaging is different. The pump was different and looked cheap. When I twisted the pump to open, loose and thin layer of product squirted out. Also, I had to pump at least 10 times before the product came out. There were two labels over one another on the bottle, which right away made me think this is FAKE. The smell of this cleanser was different from the one I got from sheaterraorganics website.The color from this manufacturer was light brown where as the sheaterraorganics is dark blackish-brown. The consistency of this product was jelly like and clumpy rather than smooth like the one I had purchased from the sheaterraorganics website. Very DISSAPOINTED, had to throw it out into trash without even trying it out on my face. Ladies, this is a beautiful product, it works but this manufacturer by Natural Planet is selling fake sheaterraorganics products. Cannot even give a one star (I had to so that my review can be posted that way others don&#x27;t get ripped off as I have been), very disappointing and never am I purchasing anything from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates and cleanses but beware of sensitive skin.  Might make you temporarily red.  I use it in the shower after cleansing. Leave on for a few minutes until slight stinging, then rinse and rub face vigorously. Dead skin cells will rub right off.</li>
    <li> Love it. Can i get a discount if i order multiple bottles?</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - put it on, wait 5-10 minutes - take it off and skin is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I really think it has helped with my acne also</li>
    <li> I love this stuff been my favorite for a couple years I use it everyday .You can also useit as a mask . I use this and the rose water together it really gives you fresh skin feeling.</li>
    <li> I received a 1 oz sample of this which will last a while, i&#x27;ve used it for a week now and I love it! I am prone to zits that pop up here and there all the time but this has definitely reduced them and the ones I did have are clearing up. I am going to buy more of this when I run out. I am looking forward to trying more of their products as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best face washes/masks I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s very smooth, easy to apply, and the fragrance isn&#x27;t harsh at all.  And my favorite bit?  It&#x27;s organic. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every day, only about every 5 days to one week.  I use it post-shower.  I don&#x27;t wash my face in the shower, and then apply the mask after.  I end up leaving it on for about 20 minutes because I always forget it&#x27;s on my face. Hahaha But it leaves my face very smooth and soft after using, and I&#x27;ve noticed that it does help bring pimples to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m entirely satisfied with the product and I don&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
    <li> ...it really, really does. However, I&#x27;ve yet to notice the exfoliating effect it claims to have. I&#x27;ve used this for three weeks now, and am not as thrilled with it as I thought I&#x27;d be, in spite of the other reviews and the excellent quality of the Shea Terra Rose Water. I use it as directed--rubbing it onto my face with a circular motion. I also use a tiny bit of water as I rub it in to create a bit of lather. Then I leave it on for about 5-10 minutes and rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it has an offensive smell at all, and so far, have managed to keep it away from my eyes without any problems. It certainly does clean my skin, and I do get a slightly tingly/burny feel from it with a bit of redness as well. However, it leaves the texture looking pretty bad. I think it overdries me--my skin looks tight and shiny, but not in a good way. It also creates sore red patches at the corners of my mouth. I think using it a couple times a week are all I can handle, and to be honest with you, I&#x27;d rather just use an exfoliator that contains granules. My guess is the burny/tingly sensation comes from the ash that&#x27;s in it--ash + water&#x3D; lye, which is alkaline and will definitely exfoliate your skin if you use it a lot!! But for some one my age, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the best solution. I&#x27;m 50 years old and have sensitive skin, that is not, however, dry. This claims to be anti-aging, but I find it has the opposite affect. I will not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive, this may work for you. It isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ll use much of, however.</li>
    <li> This made my skin break out REALLY freaking bad. Before I started using this my skin was clear. It only made me break out on my chin which is where I break out usually but I normally only get at MOST two pimples, this brought out like 6 cystic pimples and 10 tiny ones. I am sticking with it for two more weeks to see if it&#x27;s just purging my skin. But since I ALWAYS get a scar from every pimple I now have so many more scars and my chin looks horrible. I hate my face right now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now and I love it. It is organic which I like but more importantly, it gets my skin clean and soft. I use it right after shaving and my skin looks and feels great after. As some others have noted and I can attest to, this stuff smells organic. While it does not bother me in any way, I could see where some might be put off by the smell. For me, it is an excellent cleaning product and that is what matters.</li>
    <li> I was so excited the day this product arrived. I figured since it was all natural and had great products it would wonderful for my skin. I&#x27;m a big fan of taking care of ones skin. So I was taking a shower and figured let me use it and see what it can do as I had tried the honey and rose toner face wash and it was pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;So as I put the product on my skin felt a little irritated but i figured this was the \\&quot;gentle exfoliation\\&quot; that was mentioned. It&#x27;s a week later and my skin around my cheek bones is red and blistered up the rest of my face is red, irritated and dry with skin flaking off regularly. I have tried multiple treatments to reduce or eliminate the redness and irritation but so far nothing has worked.&lt;br /&gt;I really wish Amazon would make it possible to email the seller or maker of some of these products to give them a piece of my mind.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really unfortunate and I feel quite depressed walking around with everyone staring at my face like I have some really bad sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is reading this and in the same situation, let us pray for each other.&lt;br /&gt;If you reading this and have a solution that I could try for the dry redness and blistering irritation on my skin please let me know! I would really appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase this product again nor recommend it.</li>
    <li> works really great. love it. seems to be working well. will know more as i keep using it. but love how it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
    <li> I get acne because of stress so I decided to try this out and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now after ordering it from Birchbox.com and it has completely cleared my face up. It&#x27;s very gentle as it cleans your skin without making it tighten up. Disregard the smell, and make sure to use either a dirty washcloth, or a colored one since it can stain.</li>
    <li> Careful! This soap stains! Aside from that, my face has been clearer, tighter and cleaner! I have decided to use this product in the shower, so that way it doesn&#x27;t stain the rest of my clothes. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorites!</li>
    <li> Loved the idea of an organic liquid black soap however this is too watery &amp; had unpleasant odor (kinda like wood). Due to the watery consistency, i do not even wet my face before applying the product. I will not repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first review I have ever written, and its because I feel this product is a rip off. I don&#x27;t see any results at all. I didn&#x27;t even get any of the same effects as others, such as redness, or it being harsh on my skin. I hate the bottle, because I put it away in my drawer, I left the product laying down, and it spilt everywhere and not from the spout, So I practically have nothing left. My advise it try something else! Didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this soap, as I am switching to organic skin care products in an effort to better care for the body&#x27;s largest organ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is indeed \\&quot;black\\&quot; (more a dark brown). It smells interesting, not bad, but not really a \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; scent (doesn&#x27;t contribute to my rating, just an observation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed two stars from my rating. The first star was removed because the soap leaves a noticeable film on the skin after rinsing thoroughly. I really don&#x27;t like that filmy, tight feeling on my face, and I think that film may also contribute to clogged pores or other skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second star was removed because I have been trying to use this in the shower, and any type of water seems to cause the product to run straight down into my eyes...and it BURNS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any noticeable skin irritation from this product, but I hesitate to continue using it because of the above issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Purpose facial cleanser by Johnson &amp; Johnson (I have used it for years now) and I may continue to use it. The Purpose cleanser leaves my face feeling clean without the tight skin or the filmy feeling. It&#x27;s extremely gentle and dries out the oil from my acne-prone skin, but doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or burn my eyes. It&#x27;s also very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness I will try to use this cleanser again, and see if I can use it for at least two weeks. I will write another review after a more substantial testing.</li>
    <li> Had received a sample, watch your pores shrink</li>
    <li> The bottle I received is defective, the pump doesn&#x27;t work. It is very hard to get the product out because of this. It is a very thick gel consistency so without a working pump I really can&#x27;t use the product. I was able to get a bit out and use it a few times though. It&#x27;s alright. Does the job, but doesn&#x27;t seem like a holy grail face wash. Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have struggled with sporadic acne breakouts on my chest and back and this product has taken care of this issue. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find the magic face wash or cream for my break-out prone skin.  I received a small sample of this &amp; it has worked wonders at clearing me up and fast!  I only do this at night about 3 times per week and it leaves my skin tight and clean! And any zits that have formed or starting are drastically reduced or gone by morning! I am amazed and have tried many things. (Even prescription creams). Don&#x27;t pass this up!</li>
    <li> This is a great soap that makes my skin look great and the pores are smaller. I have stopped using proactiv and my skin looks really good.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of the stuff from the website which is awesome.  I use it every so often when I feel like my pores need to be deep cleansed.  I leave it on for the five to 10 minutes that the instruction on the bottle say to.  using it like this I only use it probably maximum once per week.  I am thinking that maybe if I leave it on for less time I may be able to use it more frequently as it tends to dry my skin up a bit the next day.  anyways it is really amazing effective stuff and I would recommend it to anybody with blackheads as it really cleans out your pores.  and the little tiny bottle that I got from them for free which is one ounce has lasted me forever!</li>
    <li> I have had my share of acne, acne scars, and generally bad skin.  I&#x27;ve had numerous skin treatments; lasers, peels, etc....I&#x27;m sharing this in case anyone thinks I&#x27;m a 25 year old that has had 2 zits in her life and thinks she is a skin care expert.  Well, I read all of the reviews and decided to purchase the product.  I have to say, I&#x27;ve used many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin care products but this one takes the cake (and the mint black soap product is extraordinary as well).  This does exactly as advertised.  The smell is off-putting, but I can live with it.  It is like thick, black, jelly or tar, as others have noted.  It does dissolve dead skin and is really like a peel.  For me, that&#x27;s great!  That means I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of $$ on at-home peels!  It really shrinks your pores; even more so than a peel! I think some people have had reactions to either one of the ingredients (an allergic reaction), or the preservative.  It&#x27;s hard to say.  But for me, I look forward to continue using this great product that doubles as a peel.  I just left it on my skin for 10 minutes as instructed and did not use it as a wash.  It&#x27;s amaaaaaaaaaaaazing.</li>
    <li> Definalty minimizes the pores. A little drying at fist but the redness in my skin has faded a bit. I have been using it for almost a month. Gets rid of blemishes quickly. Overall, the texture of my skin has improved. Im sure over time, it will get better.</li>
    <li> I wish that I had found this product years ago. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for one week, and used it four times. The first time I mixed with baking soda. I didn&#x27;t care for the texture, it seemed to get more runny. The last three times I&#x27;ve used it as is. I wet my face and apply the soap with dry fingers. I keep it on for up to 20 minutes. My skin tingles when it&#x27;s on, but it&#x27;s a good tingle. My skin has never been bad, just a few pimples here and there, but I do have blackheads on my chin. Those are almost gone. This soap sucks them up and spits them out.&lt;br /&gt;I wish, as many others do, that this was sold in larger bottles. It would be great to not have to order it as often as I predict I will be doing, because my teenager has now used it three times. I actually hid it from her, because I think it&#x27;s helping with fine lines, although I&#x27;m not positive about that.&lt;br /&gt;I will never, ever stop using this soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that this comes in a glass bottle versus some cheap BPA-ridden plastic one -thank you Shea Terra for &#x27;getting it&#x27;! I&#x27;ve used this for about 2-3 months now and it leaves my face soft and clean. I also leave it on as a mask once it a while. My only issue is that it&#x27;s a bit runny, so one pump usually pours out too much soap for me and it drips down my hands and into the facet - wasteful! So I pump gently to avoid this issue. I definitely plan on purchasing more Shea Terra products.</li>
    <li> I could not get over the smell of this. First, it did not minimize my pores. I am willing to bet it even made my pores bigger. I have a few friends in the cosmetology industry who have told me that it takes about a 2-3 weeks of changing a regiment before you will notice the positive impact. They have even warned that changing a brand or type of product can cause break outs leading up to that 3 week shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I heeded their warnings and used it as instructed for one month with NO improvement. My skin became very dry. I used it in combination with the &amp;#34;Argan Face and Body Oil&amp;#34; which created a strange dynamic of oily and dry skin all at once. It felt like my dry skin was coated in a layer of shiny grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am a fan of natural products, I would gladly go back to chemicals to avoid this catastrophe to my face again.</li>
    <li> I reallllyy wanted to like this product, I have heard so many great things about black soap and I was so excited when it arrived.  I had ordered a couple face cleansing products and was really excited to use all of them. I had already removed my make up and proceeded to use the first product, French Green Clay mask which was great and then I used this back soap to further cleanse my pores and get rid of the clay residue and then I used a rose water and whitchazel toner. My face felt soo clean that I went without moisturizer and ended up getting extremely uncomfortable red flaky patches that turned into painful breakouts it was terrible and lasted weeks. I used an essential oil blend of sea buckthorn, argan, rose hip, carrot seed, and evening prime rose and also 100% Pure 100% Pure Nourishing Facial Oil 1 fl oz - 1 fl oz. Im not sure which one of those oils did the trick since i mixed them together and used all of them multiple times a day. But as soon as I started using them, I felt relief and the red/dry patches were completely gone in a matter of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the dryness was due to using all those cleansing products without any moisturizer so I tried this product alone and used a moisturizer afterwards and I still ended up getting the red/dry patches.  I&#x27;m really disappointed, I wish I could continue using this product, I love how squeaky clean it makes my skin but I cannot deal with the burning red patches :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it works for other people though, I still love Shea Terra and will use their other products!</li>
    <li> Works well at removing makeup and helped clear up my acne. Not too drying or harsh on the skin. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the price.  It does an excellent job of cleansing and brighten the face.  Feels good and doesn&#x27;t take long to do.  I use it about once a week.</li>
    <li> This product really helps with skin issues, especially during the Summer months.  It works really well for acne issues and keeps your skin in good shape.</li>
    <li> this is absolutely my favorite face soap. once i got used to the smell, i really liked it...it doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or sweet at all, but it&#x27;s definitely not unpleasant. the color freaks out my boyfriend-- he says it looks like i&#x27;m washing my face with &amp;#34;demon blood&amp;#34;-- but i just use it in the shower in the morning and don&#x27;t have a problem with it getting black gunk everywhere. love it.</li>
    <li> Great face wash! Received a sample in my birch box and fell in love. If you want a cleanser that cleans and feels clean this is for you! Also can be used as a mask! Love it!</li>
    <li> I just received my second bottle and next time I am buying a few bottles.  My skin never looked so clean and vibrant.  My daughter is now hooked on the black soap and she is getting her friends to buy it also. You just don&#x27;t know what I am saying until you try it for yourself. I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  Also, the pores on my nose are really getting smaller because it cleans the skin so well without feeling so drying.  You need to try it to understand.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful &amp; it smells good too! I have normal/oily skin (t zone) I use it once a week to every other week. It does an amazing job at removing black heads on my nose. And if I get a random breakout, I put the soap on the breakout, eat or clean around the house and after about 5 or so minutes I wash the soap off and I am good to go, it clears up that day or by the next day or two depending on how soon after I got the breakout that I applied the soap or how bad it was. I tell all my friends about it, I have even bought some of them a bottle just so they would have to try!</li>
    <li> Perfect!! This was exactly as described. The shipping was Super fast and was packaged well. It is a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my skin feel and it lasts a long time.  Love love this product!</li>
    <li> I thought that I just have to suffer from acne...in my 30s. Turns out it was the products I was using. The moment I switched to this face wash, it all went away IMMEDIATELY. Love it, highly recommend it to anyone with acne problems or those who live in large cities (we live in NYC) that need to de-polute their skin on daily basis. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out like most \\&quot;acne\\&quot; washes out there</li>
    <li> I really love this face wash.  It helped to clear my acne within three days.  The texture takes some getting used to, but a little goes a long way.  I used this in conjunction with my Clarisonic Plus and it left the texture of my skin glowing and refined!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried African Black soap in bar form and I prefer this form better.  The added rose hip seed oil is a plus because of the high Vitamin C content.  Although African black soap originates in Ghana and Nigeria, this soap reminded me of Moroccan Black soap (called savon noir) in the way it cleanses the skin.  The Moroccan black soap is softer in texture and olive based.  The texture of Shea Terra organics black soap is more jelly-like in consistency with a base of cocoa/plantain ashes and palm oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the price, the product does what it claims.  I probably won&#x27;t repurchase this again unless it goes on sale.  Just remember, less is more.  You don&#x27;t need alot to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This black, runny soap is a bit disconcerting.  Follow the instructions because it really does work at removing the dead layer of skin.  I follow it up with a nice neutralizing cleanser (Nourish Organic face wash).  It will burn your eyes, so be careful.  Excellent stand-in for when you&#x27;ve forgotten to do a scrub or microderm abrasion in a while, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The first bottle I ordered was a little watery, but the second one was great! For best exfoliation, wash your with just soap and water, dry, then rub this on like a mask. Let it set for a bit then wash off. I also use it as a daily face wash and my skin always feels clean and smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> The consistency has changed from a thick gel to just WATER! It is so runny and watery that I can&#x27;t even get it on my face! It would he like trying to wash your face with witch hazel.</li>
    <li> Too messy and hard to use. Also so much leaks out of the top that it left a mess in my shower and a stain. Not happy about that. And not even sure the product works to be honest.</li>
    <li> I used this cleanser for about a month.  I found it to be exactly what it claims to be...very exfoliating and deep cleaning as well as natural.  I was surprised that it was even able to take off my makeup which my previous cleanser certainly couldn&#x27;t do.  Unfortunately, I found it a little too harsh for twice daily, or even daily use.  My skin would sting and get quite red after using this, even without leaving it on for 5-10 minutes as directed.  I also felt like it was over-exfoliating my skin, like it was a little raw afterward.  I didn&#x27;t notice that it cleared up or helped prevent any blemishes...maybe with more prolonged use, but my skin was just to sensitive to find out.  I have since switched to a \\&quot;beldi\\&quot; black soap with is like a more gentle version of this so my skin likes it better.</li>
    <li> For someone with Rosacea it didn&#x27;t do much to help with it, however it does leave my skin feeling clean throughout the ENTIRE day and I love that! I also have very oily skin, especially on my nose and cheeks and this helped tone that down quite a bit. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great face wash! Really works well. A bit messy on the counter but yes I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the ability of this soap to cleanse and exfoliate.  Leave it on for 5 minutes,then rinse. Takes dead skin and impurities away.  Add in a little organic sugar and it is even more effective.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and it works beautifully.  I have sensitive skin, but this product nourishes my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry it out and has not caused any reactions.  A great product!</li>
    <li> I have not seen much difference &amp; the product is almost finished. I am not sure if I want to purchase any more of it.</li>
    <li> this has to be the best daily cleanser for combination skin i have been using it for 3 months now on my third bottle and can say my skin looks so good i dont break out anymore. try it out it is an amazing product. thanks shea terra organics.</li>
    <li> I use this face soap every evening, it is a light exfoliant and keeps my pores clear. Having trouble skin for the past few years I have tried everything. This product has definitely worked for me!</li>
    <li> This liquid soap works well but it is expensive to use...I prefer the bar of soap.</li>
    <li> I love this wash and recommend it.  I first received this product as a sample in Birchbox.  It exfoliates and cleans pores deeply.  It may cause a minor breakout when first beginning use as it draws impurities and below-suface blemishes to the surface.  Take care to use sun screen while using.  I use this two or three times a week.</li>
    <li> No difference in skin but man that stuff stinks.</li>
    <li> Love how clean this soap leaves my skin.  I have seen a lot of improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
    <li> This soap is great, I use it once a week for deeper cleansing.</li>
    <li> Unfortunally I found this soap so watery that most just goes down the sink...I did use it as a mask also not bad...I keep trying to work with it...</li>
    <li> Black soap Wash provides a thorough face cleansing .  I have seen a reduction in blemishes.  Warning, it can be drying to the skin so I would advise using 3-4 times per week.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every soap on the market.  I kept seeing great reviews for this and wanted to try it.  Within the first few washes, it went to work!  I love it!  Understand that everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  All I know is that it works for me VERY WELL and I will NOT be purchasing anything else!  Do yourself a favor and just try it, and then at least if it works for you, you&#x27;ve got a magnificent product, and if it doesn&#x27;t, keep moving forward until you find the one that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
    <li> I remove my eye makeup at night and slather this on, let it sit for 10 min then rinse off. my skin cleared up completely in two days. I love how bright and tight my skin feels. im also a product junkie, and im totally a die hard fan of this line now. im switching over from Aveda bc their stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and I woke up the next day and my skin was sooooo soft and supple! I&#x27;m not even in my 20&#x27;s yet and it helped with skin I pull on a lot (even though I totally shouldn&#x27;t). Will definitely repurchase! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell, but for its benefits, I will suck it up.</li>
    <li> A very interesting face wash to say the least. It has a black jelly like texture that is suppossed to be applied to the skin for an intial 5 minutes before being washed off and reapplied in a rubbing motion with your palms the second time around. It does not exactly lather, which I prefer going into my 30&#x27;s. There is an overall tightening sensation while the wash is on, but you&#x27;re left with a comfortable cushiness that&#x27;s very agreeable with my skin after you rinse. While I usually enjoy a good double cleansing, waiting around for 5 minutes may not always be efficient. Also, the product while natural, is very strong so daily use for some may be too much. I&#x27;ve opted to use this as a pick me up facial 2-3 times a week rather than a daily wash. I&#x27;ve seen improvements on texture and clarity, but beware, you may experience an initial &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; phase in the beginning because it&#x27;s digging deep to get all the gunk out.</li>
    <li> The product works but I am very disappointed that I am unable to use the pump. It seems to be sealed closed.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Got a sample from Birchbox, and decided to get the full size product.  I&#x27;m not disappointed.  My skin is a bit oily, and it responded well to this soap.  I tend to break out at certain times of the month, and this helped clear that up so there was barely a blip.</li>
    <li> I really liked the soap to begin with and it worked great with my sensitive skin. Then it started separating so it became a watery black liquid and I couldn&#x27;t use it because it ran through my fingers before I could get to my face. I had to throw it out. I reordered and had the same thing happen. Did not do anything different with the last to bottles than I did with the first two. I have now stopped using because after about 2 weeks it turned to water - seemed to seperate......</li>
    <li> abolish black heads. :( is very drying. works best for me as a spot treatment. I wish it got rid of blackheads, but alas. Also, smells just horrible. Smell lingers.</li>
    <li> So far, I am hooked. My skin is glowing. I use the dudu osun black soap for the shower - and have tried that as well on my face -- but this far exceeds dudu osun for a facial wash. My skin is soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> kind of runny, gets in your eyes</li>
    <li> I read an article claiming black soap was great for all kinds of skin problems so I searched and found this. Honestly felt that the soap didn&#x27;t work to take off my make up so I only used it in the morning. It was a thick gel and very hard to wash with. Finished the bottle but won&#x27;t re purchase.</li>
    <li> The only face wash that I&#x27;ve ever used that made my skin look noticeably better right after the very first use.  I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this stuff - I don&#x27;t use it every day, but maybe like 3 times a week.  It&#x27;s a bit too strong for me to use every day.</li>
    <li> Let me first say I have pretty awful skin, &amp;#34;asphyxiated&amp;#34; is the term the esthetician used. So I  have oily ish skin that doesn&#x27;t shed dead skin cells and thus feels dry and patchy and is prone to breaking out, so fun. This is as it says &amp;#34;microdermabrasion in a bottle&amp;#34; it refreshes my dull icky skin when I use it. I leave it on like a mask and then remove it with my clarisonic and boom fresh healthier looking skin. I originally received this in a sample kit and am so glad I bought the full size. It can tingle a bit at first but that subsides. Be careful not to get in broken skin or in your eyes, ouch!  I find if I moisturize right away it doesn&#x27;t make me too dry. I I&#x27;ll continue to buy this and will try more Shea terra products based on the effectiveness of this cleanser.</li>
