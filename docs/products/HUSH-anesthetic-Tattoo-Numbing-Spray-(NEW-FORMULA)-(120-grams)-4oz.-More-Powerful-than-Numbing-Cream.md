<li> I have had numerous tattoos done and this product does not do what is stated on the label, directions were followed and other ways tried there was no numbing</li>
<li> Though I was disappointed in the numbing gel, the spray, to be used after the skin is broken, was very good</li>
<li> this stuff is a total waste of money, does not work.</li>
<li> and though I have to grind my teeth in getting there (broken skin) it is much easier to endure once this spray is allied</li>
<li> Not sure if it works yet since I have a tat appointment on the 27th for a big side piece</li>
<li> The second time we applied it, around hour 3, it didn&#x27;t hardly do anything.</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> not worth the money for just 1 bottle and nothing else.</li>
<li> It both numbs my skin, and doesn&#x27;t mess up the ink, in the tattooing process.</li>
<li> It only made the areas worse to get tattooed on again.</li>
<li> It actually made the tattoo hurt worse than before using this product.</li>
<li> I am heavily tattooed.</li>
<li> Just a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
<li> I sprayed the Hush spray in my nose to numb before getting my Septum pierced and it barely numbed it.</li>
<li> and it says that the skin has to be broken.</li>
<li> Completely confused &#x3D;(</li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to try Dr. Numb for 100% numb ing.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t numb at all!  </li>

    <li> Did not work for me. It only made the areas worse to get tattooed on again. I definitely understand that tattoos are supposed to hurt, I have plenty. The artist was doing shading on my chest and stomach for two hours, then we decided to take a break and see how this stuff would do since I bothered to buy it. Sprayed it on and wrapped my torso up for about thirty minutes. After that, the pain was unbearable, once we started up again. It made the skin next to already worked on parts way too tender. I would have been able to sit for a couple more hours, instead I only did fifteen minutes.</li>
    <li> Hush spray is more of a gel than an actual spray. But over all it worked well, you have to start the tattoo and then apply HUSH. It works much better on open skin.</li>
    <li> not worth the money for just 1 bottle and nothing else.</li>
    <li> does not work as good as the gel , but decent. arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Stuff doesn&#x27;t work good</li>
    <li> I ordered this and received a day early! Not sure if it works yet since I have a tat appointment on the 27th for a big side piece and I couldn&#x27;t make a review without putting in something for the star area. I ordered this because it states that you don&#x27;t have to break the skin. Well I read the directions on the bottle and it says that the skin has to be broken. Completely confused &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Though I was disappointed in the numbing gel, the spray, to be used after the skin is broken, was very good and though I have to grind my teeth in getting there (broken skin) it is much easier to endure once this spray is allied</li>
    <li> I sprayed the Hush spray in my nose to numb before getting my Septum pierced and it barely numbed it. I thought this would be completely painless. I&#x27;m going to try Dr. Numb for 100% numb ing.</li>
    <li> Yes, works great , make sure to use it when the skin is already broken.  You know to take the edge off so you can finish up your piece.</li>
    <li> I am heavily tattooed. This product works, but give it time to activate. My girlfriend&lt;br /&gt;had her head done with very minimum pain.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Starts working in about 5-10min. No complaints at all it does the job!! I use it for my laser tattoo removal sessions and it works pretty dam good!! I highly recommend buying this product!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is a total waste of money, does not work. It actually made the tattoo hurt worse than before using this product.</li>
    <li> I used the gel before my session and the spray during and the two together made for a pain free 6 hour session.</li>
    <li> I used this product after the numbing gel wore off. I had been sitting for about 2 hours already so it was nice to take the edge off. However it didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped. The second time we applied it, around hour 3, it didn&#x27;t hardly do anything.</li>
    <li> Even better that the gel</li>
    <li> Purchased this and followed the directions as stated. Did not work at all. Just a waste of money in my opinion. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t numb at all!  No numbing affect whatsoever</li>
    <li> I have had numerous tattoos done and this product does not do what is stated on the label, directions were followed and other ways tried there was no numbing what so ever, I would not recommend this to anyone do not waste your money</li>
    <li> works great!  lasts as stated!</li>
    <li> Lot of work and time for this to work...Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work. I&#x27;m no chicken when it comes to getting tattooed,  this is in fact the first product iv ever tryed to help ease the pain a bit. I bought it based on a friends recommendation and the reviews I read on the website,  maybe it&#x27;s just me it didn&#x27;t work for, but unfortunately at the end of the day the only thing I can say is that it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer</li>
    <li> Hush is a great product.  It works very well for me.  It both numbs my skin, and doesn&#x27;t mess up the ink, in the tattooing process.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived fast and works as expected.</li>
    <li> Because i had a lot of tattoo clients looking for a way to help with the pain, i picked some of this stuff up.  It seems to work great for some clients, and not at all for others.  I tend to think, like anything else, it&#x27;s more the customer&#x27;s mindset and a placebo effect.  I&#x27;ve personally used this on myself when getting tattooed, and it did nothing for me in the way of pain, but isn&#x27;t part of the tattoo process working through the pain, knowing you&#x27;ll have a lifetime of ink on your body?  If tattoos didn&#x27;t hurt, every wimp would have one.</li>
