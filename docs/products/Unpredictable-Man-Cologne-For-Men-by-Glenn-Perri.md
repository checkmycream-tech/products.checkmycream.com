<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it ! HOWEVER I bought this product at the mall at a seller called Michael&#x27;s. I paid $55  bucks for this. Then I saw it here on Amazon and saw the price .DAMN  I over paid .  Im sooo mad , hahaha...  but it is a very good smell.  So fellas you wanna get the chicks attention . This is the  stuff..</li>
    <li> Smell didn&#x27;t last longer than 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne and delivered on time thank yall</li>
    <li> After I smelled in a local perfume shop, I had to come and get it. So I ordered it as a gift for my Father for Christmas. Im 22 and even I wanted it for my self, It kind smells fresh, and clean with a tiny hint of musky not too too much, Ideal for Night outings. Age range Id say from 18-55....Totally reccomend!</li>
    <li> i first saw this in the mall, and the lady wanted to charge me over $50 for it!  luckly i looked it up online and saw the avg price was about what i paid here.  it comes in a really cheap plastic bottle, but thats the only turn off.  sometimes i dont want to use my expensive cologne, but i still want to smell good.  this does the trick.</li>
    <li> Very nice fresh and clean citrus spring &amp; summer fragrance. In the opening I get a blast of Azzaro Chrome. When I first smelled it, for the first 5 minutes I was like Im not gonna like this Azzaro clone ( not that Azzaro is bad, I like Azzaro ). But then it starts to head into different direction. Its a fresh, soft citrus, sweet like scent. Very nice and save. Perfect for any 15-18 yr old to sport. Very casual and day time wear. For less then $20 its worth it. I got it for my 16 yr old son and he&#x27;s rocking it. Longevity is about 4-5 hrs.</li>
    <li> Great,just as described,really fast service.Just in time for the holidays,Thank you</li>
    <li> This is by far the best kept secret in the cologne world. I paid $60 at a perfume gallery store in the mall about a year ago and needed to replace it... found it on amazon for $23!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelt in my life...&lt;br /&gt;(i&#x27;m a young male and girls compliment it all the time!)</li>
    <li> Great cologne and very fast shipping. Very highly rated!</li>
    <li> good one for the price...my opinion...Glenn Perri Unpredictable Night is best among the lot in this line of scents...  second choice grey bottle...a bit fruity... like Be Delicious DKNY smells is better than Glenn Perri Unpredictable Eau De Toilette Spray for Men blue bottle... BLUE bottle smells like Azzaro Chrome...</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this cologne for me to try.  Well, I can tell you that I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments at work (from women and men) about how good it smells.  The comments come as a surprise because the scent is very subdued...to the point where I don&#x27;t smell it after a few minutes.  However, others can.      Definitely recommend the product to anyone thinking of buying it.    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031D1MDM?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;tag&#x3D;leas4prop-20&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B0031D1MDM</li>
    <li> nice scent , made a perfecgift</li>
    <li> This is not old cologne that smells like alcohol,  it smells just as if you purchased this from Macy&#x27;s,</li>
    <li> Bought for my boyfriend, it arrived quickly and smells great...stays on him the entire day!</li>
    <li> Bought this cologne and it smells great!!</li>
    <li> it smells great and i wear it all the time. not too strong, not too soft, just perfect. i recommend it to every man</li>
    <li> It smells good and last long</li>
    <li> I first encountered this fragrance at one of those mall kiosks and instantly loved it. I was happy to find that it was also available online through Amazon. If you&#x27;re wanting something that is just in the middle, then go for this. It&#x27;s not too over powering, yet not too &#x27;blah&#x27; . Also people that I work around can still detect it even when I can&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s definitely worth looking into. RECOMMEND !</li>
    <li> smells so fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the smell. However, it does not last all day. The smell fades very quickly. The spray knob also fell off. The rating is for the smell, not the low quality container.</li>
    <li> This cologne is great for daily use. It&#x27;s light and clean. The price I got it at Amazon is about half of what retail stores charge and it is not a knockoff. Great product even better price!</li>
    <li> the product arrived very fast and i was very happy with it.the price was well worth it, i went to the mall before i shopped online and the price was double.</li>
    <li> It came on time and without any problems so I was very happy.</li>
    <li> Yes it did great price and great fragrance : follow me on twitter @oneflylife &amp; instagram @carlosbowen, Im am very pleased</li>
    <li> I bought Unpredictable, Unpredictable Desire, and Unpredictable Night.  After having all 3 I prefer Unpredictable #1, Unpredictable Desire # 2, and Unpredictable Night # 3. Unpredictable is my favorite.  i like Unpredictable for day and Unpredictable Desire for Night!</li>
    <li> Very nice... like it a lot.</li>
    <li> A great price for a fragrance that was priced at TWICE the amount at a local shop.  The smell sticks to your skin throughout the day and has a very refreshing and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; aroma to it.  Even got one for my Dad as a X-mas present!</li>
    <li> I have to retrieve my previous review due to inconsistencies of this product&#x27;s content. Although my initial order came excellent, my husband and I noticed that the proceeding 3 orders (2 bottles@) in an interval of 2 months apart were  like water with a faint scent of the cologne! And you can&#x27;t return the item! It&#x27;s a rip-off!</li>
    <li> The lady&#x27;s love it I hear compliments all the time</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and I love the way it smells on him!!!  A nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> It smell so good I love it.</li>
    <li> This product has to be a fake. The product&#x27;s name of Unpredictable is quite ironic because I feel that is a perfectly good way to describe its quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible. It smells exactly like Chrome Azzaro.</li>
    <li> Smells great, friends ask what it is, females really like the smell, it last for a good few hours, if you wear an undershirt, spray it on that and then slip your shirt on and the smell will last a lot longer. it has the right degree of strong scent to it, not too much, but just enough its a perfect blend for a great price.....Have Bought multiples of this item.</li>
    <li> clean long lasting smooth smell sweet and mascline, one of my favorites besides subtil by salvatore ferragamo</li>
    <li> I sampled this in a mall and bought it 30 seconds later, wear it whenever I go out and have received many compliments, it lasts for hours and the girls love it</li>
    <li> I get many compliments with this cologne. It&#x27;s a great clean smell. Received it promptly and in great condition. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 18 year old brother for Christmas who is very picky and he loved it! It got here very fast especially during the holidays! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Holy s..... i can&#x27;t believe i spent 50 bucks at the mall and they said it was on sale. This stuff is really good.</li>
    <li> I normally buy a new kind of cologne at least once a year so I own or have owned all of the top/most popular brands (I&#x27;m 30 if that helps) and I normally get compliments on them but it seems like everyone wears the same cologne and most of the time the women that are giving the compliments already know which cologne it is and it more then likely is reminding them of someone else... Anyway this cologne might not be well known but it has a great smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming and I get compliments on it regularly from random women who want to know what it is and they always love the fact that it is something different...</li>
    <li> I stopped by a mall perfume store and tested this one.  I swear it smells like my favorite \\&quot;Chanel Egoiste Platinum\\&quot; but at a fraction of the price.  I tested on my skin which only lasted 3 to 4 hours.  Not a bad deal though.</li>
    <li> I love it! my husband always smells so good!!! long lasting!</li>
    <li> The Glenn Perri Unpredictable Toilette Spray for Men is lite and spells like you just got out of the shower. It&#x27;s all good!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing on my husband.</li>
    <li> Best colon I&#x27;ve ever smelled,not to strong and not to light, it is just perfect</li>
    <li> You know those Axe commercials where all the beautiful women chase and attack the guy who sprays that stuff on? Great advertisement of course but this product right here will have both men and women running after you. That&#x27;s just how incredible it smells. It&#x27;s light as to not overpower yourself with the smell yet strong enough to be noticed from a few feet away. With just a couple of squirts it lasts all day long and the bottle itself contains enough to hold you over for a couple of months(my experience on using it daily). One of those colognes where your going to wonder &amp;#34;Why wasn&#x27;t this more expensive?&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells really good for it&#x27;s price. It doesn&#x27;t last as much as i expected but it gets the job done. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cheap yet really good smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> Cheap and effective. I wear it regularly. The bottle looks elegant and stylish. Hope the chemical is good. Smells great! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad, if you are looking for a less expensive alternative to Azzaro&#x27;s Chrome this is it. But don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this stuff has very good longevity staying power.</li>
    <li> The cologne are cheap knock offs and should be in the dollar tree. please don&#x27;t buy this stuff it aint worth even 15</li>
    <li> THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER THAN THIS BUT JUST OKAY</li>
    <li> My wife loves this on me. It was so much cheaper getting it here than at the mall ($50 usually). This is not some watered-down version, it&#x27;s the real deal and worth it.</li>
    <li> Great cologne!!! Great price!!!! Very pleased with this product and seller!</li>
    <li> After almost buying this toilette spray at the mall, I decided to check online for it first.  I am completely happy with my purchase - not only did it come quickly and was exactly what I had wanted, buying it from this vendor saved me $30.  I fully intend to make any future purchases of this product from this vendor.</li>
    <li> my grandson loves this</li>
    <li> Great smell for good price. Get told many times by women that I smell good when wearing it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the sent but the cap was loose and the spray button came off</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I have ordered 2 times and always get compliments. The problem with the product is the container. It has broke both times (the sprayer and top has fallen off) Would have stars if everything was as quality as the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Will definitely be buying again! Can be a bit overwhelming though if sprayed too much.</li>
    <li> I use this scent before I go to bed so I can always smell fresh for the wife..the price bottle design and fast shipping cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Great price. My favorite fragrance ever. I wear daily. Men &amp; women inquire what fragrance I wear. It lasts all day &amp; lingers on my clothes. Fresh &amp; sexy.</li>
    <li> I have tried a bunch of colognes and am very picky. This stuff lasts all day, smells great, and is half the price of other colognes I use.</li>
    <li> I like fresh scents like Cool Water.  This scent is clean and less alcohol-y smelling than cool water.  It reminds me of a clean scented men&#x27;s body wash or anti-perspirant.  Bought this for my man and he smells so fresh and clean. :-)</li>
    <li> If you go to the mall to get this lotion you will spend 3 times de price&lt;br /&gt;here is cheap for the price 3.4 oz it is a lot smell awesome like the other&lt;br /&gt;people said not strong ,not to soft just right order Thursday got it Friday&lt;br /&gt;I mean can complain, will buy again for sure.&lt;br /&gt;may 21 I bought a 3.2oz Black Invincible my brother and I used it in&lt;br /&gt;the morning to go to work and ones after shower I still have more&lt;br /&gt;maybe10 days more  to give you an idea about how much of&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is in it.</li>
    <li> Really great for the price here. Unfortunately, I paid $65 for this at the mall. I thought it was well worth the 65. Now I know I can get it cheaper.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the girlfriend approves!</li>
    <li> Light and amazingly beautiful smell.</li>
    <li> This is great for the price the smell last a long time and if you like Chrome, this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this cologne,simply because I didn&#x27;t know how it smelt beforehand. So I trusted the reviews and purchased it based on the positive comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best decision EVER!!!! It&#x27;s a nice scent you can wear after work and suitable for daily use. IF you are not sure about purchasing colognes online in fear it may not smell good, please give this a try!!! Trust my review and previous ones!! Also for the price it makes a great gift!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant smooth and fresh summer fragrance, it&#x27;s a real shame the scent doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 mins, to may be 30 mins tops on my skin, due to this I won&#x27;t be buying it again, there are much better choices out there in this price range IMO, IE: Thallium, Wings, Nautica, Cuba, etc</li>
    <li> First time using this cologne and it is worth it</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! Get tons of compliments. Came fast. Will never buy from store again.</li>
    <li> Vanity mirror was completely destroyed, but everything else has gotten to me in good condition.</li>
    <li> Many times I go to put this on and I cannot find it, Why????? Because my 19 year old son has it in his room. I keep telling hem to buy his own.</li>
    <li> Yes, This smell will give you the smell of coming out of a washing machine. I only used it coming out of taking a bath</li>
    <li> Fake. The smell fades very quickly. I should have known for the price.</li>
    <li> great flavor and very good support ( problems with german custom :/ )</li>
    <li> The cologne smells SOOOO good and not only that but it actually last a while. I work nine hours a day and i can honestly say i was working away at my desk smelling this goodness! Totally recommend this cologne and for the price ITS A STEAL!</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I love this cologne. I&#x27;m often asked at work what it is. Like I said I love it</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of fragrances and fell in love with this one at a great price two I have bought those high end colognes and they do not match up with this smooth clean scent and long lasting fragrance I have been complemented so many times with this cologne; I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle I can&#x27;t see me switching anytime soon.</li>
    <li> OMG it smell  so good</li>
    <li> Love this cologne! It smells so good, and the best part is that it last so long when I wear it. Every time I use it, I get multiple compliments from people all day long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very manly but subtle but strong smell. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Excellent quality! Delicious fragrance!</li>
    <li> I would buy from this seller again. The product is the perfect gift for any young man or man. I bought this for my boyfriend because he is not to big of a fan of cologna. He some reason loves this product and I have to agree.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and the time frame which it arrived. I recommend the product period. I have to write three more words so he is eleven.</li>
    <li> Great item legit seller</li>
    <li> Originally came across this at a cologne store in an outlet mall and paid much more than I did here.  I have received a lot of compliments and really like the way the scent stays with me.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, just nice and fresh.  Like the title says, my woman loves this on me.  For me that&#x27;s the most important criteria!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FIANCE THREE TIMES AND THE FIRST TWO TIMES IT WAS FROM A RETAIL STORE COSTING ME 100 DOLLARS! I WAS AMAZED TO FIND THE SAME SIZE AND SCENT ON AMAZON FOR 15 AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED THAT I DIDN NOT LOOK BEFORE HAND. I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS COLOGNE AND HE DOES TOO THATS WHY I ALWAYS GET HIM A REFILL. ! I WILL ALWAYS BUYT FROM AMAZON FROM NOW ON!</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Hubby loves it... so do I!  Very manly very sporty. Great buy great price. fast shipping.  YUM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard about this perfume. So I looked the reviews. The smell is really good. But in my opinion it should not be used in excess because the smell turns a little annoying...</li>
    <li> Awesome long lasting fragrance scent. I recommend this perfume to all my friends</li>
    <li> Great scent, great smell, not too potent although it should be but it is ok and very importantly i have received many compliments from girls. Just purchased two more and probably will buy more in the future.</li>

    <li> just smells a lot like body wash.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. I blind bought this in hopes that I would like the smell. It smells wonderfully clean and I have already got good compliments from people I work with. It lasts for a long of time on the skin and more if you spray your clothing. I&#x27;m a fan of affordable fragrances that don&#x27;t break the bank and this will always be one I&#x27;ll come back for. Great cologne, great price!</li>

    <li> Wonderful delivery system including</li>
    <li> My purchased Arrived today and I would like to say,It Smells Sooooo Good but a little sweet.Fellas if you want to impress the ladies and turn some heads purchase this cologne</li>
    <li> This is a very good cologne for everyday use nd especially for evening wear also. Its not a strong scent more light and fresh smelling kinda just getting out the shower fresh fragrance. It last last for mostly all the day. Now its not strong and neither is it overbearing but it would appeal to your senses..Just think... FRESH...</li>
    <li> I regret so much that I believed those 20+ \\&quot;excited\\&quot; reviews!! I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;compliments\\&quot; you guys are talking about... It seems like you are the sellers themselves, or their friends. The smell is so awful, makes me sick. Can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s the ingredient that gives that sickening note, and there is no clear product description about smell components given. I just hate the smell. I bought it for my husband, for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and now the surprise is ruined (((( It was Unpredictable indeed, haha (( And I can&#x27;t even return this s***, because it&#x27;s under \\&quot;not returnable\\&quot; policy.</li>
    <li> Super sweet which I love, will be buying 3 more. This is now my favorite cologne</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this colgne for men and he also commented how it was a great buy from retail stores. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I actually tested Unpredictable Night at a cologne store and liked the smell so I ordered it on Amazon. Since it was such a good deal ($15 compared to $60 at the store), I decided to look at what else there was in this line. I saw all the positive reviews for this cologne so I ordered it as well. Best decision ever. This was the first time I&#x27;ve ordered a cologne without ever having tested it first and I am impressed. I actually like it better than Unpredictable Night. This cologne is more subtle and just smells clean and fresh. I highly recommend. My wife loves it too.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent. Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Good item, shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is great, but the design makes it hard to spray. All and all, for the money it&#x27;s worth the awkward design.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere else! My man is so happy that I did as he loves this cologne and it smells yummy!</li>
    <li> The after smell tend to stay around and had many asking what was that colonge again. I will definitely add to my stock for the summer.</li>
    <li> Great pricing. Awesome product quality. Fast shipping. Will do business again.</li>
    <li> smells nice and long lasting too</li>
    <li> A great product to add to my collection.</li>
    <li> Always on time and smells the best for the money . The product from amazon is always at a good price and well worth it .</li>
    <li> I took a while but the wait was worth it. I love this cologne. I bought it for the first time three years ago and I like the smell right away. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money. It last all dayour no matter what you do, and I&#x27;ve had many complements that I smelled good.</li>
    <li> this is my go-to cologne whenever going out I love this product Im sure to be complimented on how I smile whenever I wear it it has a very pleasant and sweet and fragrant</li>
    <li> Was given to me as a gift years back, now I keep it on hand as an everyday type spray. Price on Amazon is unbeatable</li>
    <li> Smells awesome when u have a FRESH bottle!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, has a musky touch on the opening, later sweetens up and the musk sort of goes away, still masculine and just smells really good overall. Longevity and sillage are both good too</li>
    <li> Go for it hands down if you want a perfume to last longer than a day.</li>

    <li> Smells bomb bought it 3 times now with this time. cheaper here bought it at az mills more expensive and her for about $15 less.</li>
    <li> i bought  this cologne fo rmy friend,  it smells great and  wear it all the time. not too strong, not too soft, just perfect. i recommend it to every man.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for cologne under $10 its a must buy. Teeh smell is good and it last for half day . Not a bad deal; I will buy it again</li>

    <li> Great price &amp; sexy scent for the hubby.</li>
    <li> I did not expect to many from this cologne,I wanted to give it a try from the&lt;br /&gt;positive reviews and the very cheap prize.Hey i was wrong! Like another reviewer said,&lt;br /&gt;it does smell like Chanell Egoiste but in a lighter version it lasts on me 5-6 ours projection is ok&lt;br /&gt;to not to heavy not to light the bottle looks elegant and heavy overall it looks like a 50 dollar cologne!&lt;br /&gt;This should be side by side with Nautica Voyage for the package and the very very cheap prize!</li>
    <li> its the best cologne that I have ever had!!!! it has amazing smell and get a lot of compliments every day :))</li>
    <li> This smells really nice on my husband and my son!  I notices there more products by Glenn Perri &amp;#34;Unpredictable&amp;#34; that I will be purchasing soon.  Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonya Hammill</li>
