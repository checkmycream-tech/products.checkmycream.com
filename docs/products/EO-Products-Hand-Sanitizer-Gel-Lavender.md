<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product! It smells great and works well. It&#x27;s the perfect purse size. This is a high end product that will cost you much more if purchased in a health food store. I&#x27;m still a soap and water girl when it&#x27;s available but so often it&#x27;s not. I love having this alternative!</li>
    <li> I carry this size with me in my car, in my purse, an use after pumping gas, handling a restaurant menu, etc smells good AND does not burn my hands.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand sanitizer I have ever used. Highly recommend. You will not be disappointed. A little goes a long way and does the job without drying out your hands or leaving a film.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and actually the first EO product I tried.  As a teacher and mother, I&#x27;m always dealing with germs.  I like that this sanitizer does not leave a residue and has a pleasant natural scent from the essential oils.  The price at first seems high but it lasts a long time.  I have one for the car and one in the diaper bag.  It&#x27;s a product I feel safe putting on my 2-year old when needed.</li>
    <li> I work at a cancer hospital and sometimes you can&#x27;t wave hello to someone without a latex glove--that&#x27;s just the nature of the facility, and we need to be safe and sanitary. I like the EO Hand Sanitizer because I get both while getting good organic ingredients, and without the nasty cloying smell that comes with the popular brand you find in every mall specialty shop. The lavender aroma is light and clean and very natural, not chemical-y or perfumy, and my hands are cleansed without being stripped dry. I just wish you&#x27;d make a nice citrusy one too!</li>
    <li> I tried one of these @ whole foods market and couldn&#x27;t believe a hand sanitizer could smell this good.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not the most cost effective option, but for the smell and the skin-friendly ingredients, it&#x27;s worth the extra buck (unless you&#x27;re using serious amounts everyday).</li>
    <li> I travel frequently and this is one of my favorite&amp;#34; Go to&amp;#34; products. Keeps hands soft (and clean). Soothing lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Oh so wonderful smell</li>
    <li> Beautiful lavender fragrance. Does not dry out my hands. I keep in my bag for easy use.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this hand sanitizer, I was at Whole Foods Market.  I loved it and couldn&#x27;t believe that it didn&#x27;t burn my very dry, cracked eczema hands. I work in a Surgical ICU, so I&#x27;m always washing my hands and using sanitizers.  I also like the Lemon Essential Oil, both smell great and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is not sticky or greasy and does not dry our skin.  It is a fantastic gel sanitizer and my favorite of gel sanitizers.  I would highly recommend it.  I have kept a small one in my purse and a larger one in my car for after school before snacks!  Wonderful lavender fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I am a repeat customer, smells great! My whole family and a bunch of friends are hooked onto it!</li>
    <li> Love using this product after getting hands in anything outdoors or indoors.  Always have it with me everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> As a hand sanitizer snob, this is my favorite kind of hand sanitizer in the world!</li>
    <li> We carry this with us when yard sale-ing and handling dust and rust and no access to sinks. It&#x27;s quick to evaporate leaving no residue, just a light lavender scent that is not overpowering...even my husband likes it!</li>
    <li> I work in health care and I&#x27;m constantly using hand sanitizer, especially during cold and flu season. I love EO&#x27;s lavender hand sanitizer and actually we keep a large bottle available for the customers in our pharmacy to use as well. My hands never feel dried out from using this product. And I like this particular size because it&#x27;s flying friendly and easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand sanitizer, and this size is perfect for carrying in my purse, carry-on (in that one little ziplock), work bag, etc. It smells great and is not over-drying. No nasty ingredients like in many other hand sanitizers! Be warned that if you re-apply many times (without washing your hands in between applications), you will start to get some filmy stuff on your hands. I&#x27;ve only had this happen when I was out somewhere for an extended time without access to running water to wash my hands too - but when I am using this product during a day of using yucky port-a-potties, I&#x27;ll deal with it!! If you start to feel it you can just wipe it off with a wet tissue/towel, no biggie. Long story short, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you love the smell of lavender this is the product for you! I used it once when I was at Whole Foods at the check out in the form of wipes. This smells a lot stronger and you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
    <li> I like that this is more natural than most hand sanitizers but the smell is very strong. It wears off after a few minutes but my kids fight me when I try to give them some after Wal-Mart.  It seems to do the job as well as regular hand sanitizers too, just wish the smell was a little less.</li>
    <li> Say no to Triclosan AND a LITANY of other ingredients in many of the popular antibacterial gels and hand sanitizers (Dial, Purell, Softsoap).&lt;br /&gt;When my step-father kept having muscle/nerve issues in his right hand, month after month (he is an avid hand washer and loved the variety of Bath &amp; Bodywork&#x27;s antibacterial soaps and sanitizers which are filled with Triclosan among other ingredients) he finally was sent to a neurospecialist that asked what he was cleaning his hands with and told him to stop using the antibacterial washes and sanitizers because of all of the neurotoxins. He stopped and his shooting pains went away in a little over a week. Took over a month to get full muscle function of his thumb back in that hand though. Sad that it took three doctor visits and finally a visit to a neourospecialist to finally figure that out! Needless to say we are big supporters of natural sanitizers that use grain alcohols instead of the more toxic and drying wood alcohols, and essential oils for added anti-microbial boost, but are void of many of the terrible ingredients that make me want to take my chances with the germs over the slow doses of topical poison...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the times when you need to eat while traveling or can&#x27;t get to a sink, etc. EO&#x27;s gel sanitizer is a life saver! It smells nice, not over-drying, leaves your hands clean and not sticky feeling. The 2oz is a great purse/car/travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Nice hand sanitizer, a bit spendy, but worth it. I love the herbal scent, really clean and not as drying as other sanitizes.</li>
    <li> I only gave the purchase a 4 star as of the six I ordered, one was badly bent up.  It didn&#x27;t leak and it works, just looked bad.  I gave the others to friends and family.  Everyone loved the product as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WANTING TO FEEL A SENSE OF CALM IN A BUSY HURRIED WORLD.  ITS A GREAT WAY TO CLEAN AND AVOID COLDS AND BACTERIA WHILE ENJOYING THE CALMING SENT OF LAVENDER..JUST DELIGHTFUL!</li>
    <li> I could smell the stuff in cardboard box even before I opened it because a small amount leaked, and the fragrance really is quite overpowering.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t have a chemical fragrance which is what I was looking for, too strong of a scent for my preference-- I don&#x27;t really want to be using my hands to eat after using it and don&#x27;t really want to smell like that for hours later after using it.  I ended up getting an unscented Kids Sanz and like it much better.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t have a weird smell to it but it did. It didn&#x27;t even smell like lavender.</li>
    <li> This smells so great, it&#x27;s so much better than regular hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> This sanitizer is great! it leaves your skin soft and smooth with the oil it contains. The lavender scent is mood altering.</li>
    <li> EO hand sanitizer is great. The reason I would say 4.75 stars is because this scent is not my favorite. They used to have a lemon version that I liked more but I can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore. That being said, I still buy and like this  lavender sanitizer because it doesn&#x27;t make my hands dry out and I like the natural scent instead of those perfumey smells like you get with those body stores from the mall. The 2 ounce size is nice for a purse or bag and nice and portable. I am not afraid to use it on kids or sensitive adults (I have eczema and this doesn&#x27;t bother me). The EO sanitizer is great for my holistic attitudes as well as being practical for the way we live these days, always on the go! This is my favorite brand of sanitizers and they make nice bath salts and soaps too.</li>
    <li> Smells more like Juniper than Lavender.  I was buying this as a gift to one of my friends&#x27; daughters, but I don&#x27;t think it would be a good thing for her to be reeking of Gin...</li>
    <li> I like the scent and appreciate the ingredients. Does a nice job of cleaning hands, when away from water and soap.</li>
    <li> This product smells horrible! It does not smell floral as stated. Do not buy! You cannot even return this product to Amazon. What a rip off.</li>
    <li> I keep a bottle of one of these (or the peppermint scent) in my purse at all times.  While I&#x27;m usually a big fan of just plain soap-and-water hand washing to keep my and my kids&#x27; hands clean, it&#x27;s not always practical.  I far prefer the EO sanitizers for their light, natural scents that don&#x27;t linger too long and lower chemical profile.  EO is the ONLY brand of hand sanitizer I&#x27;ll buy, for just that reason.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell how well it works, but it smells and feels nice and evaporates quickly without any residue. It smells very strong though - only get it if you really like the smell of lavender.</li>
    <li> Smells so amazing. Bought lavender and even macho hubby luvs it. No poison smell like regular stuff and no u do not have a lingering scent on u. Pricey though so I will make my own plus use the empty EO bottles to reuse. Also is not sticky and feels nice. The bottle is small</li>
    <li> Easy to carry; wonderful smell; responsible ingredients and manufacture process.  I bought three, one for different handbags so I would always have it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of EO products and scents. The downside to this purchase was that  the flip top lid was broken when I received the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this sanitizer. The lavender aroma is so soothing, very handy size for car, home or tote. Love it.</li>
    <li> I like to use a hand sanitizer after fueling up at the pump. I found this sanitizer smelled way too strong, and the smell remained for hours until I was able to wash them. This is nothing against the manufacturer or how well it works. But if you&#x27;re only looking for something to kill bacteria and dry off...this may not be for you. I recommend something that is not scented.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t usually go on over hand sanitizer but I&#x27;m hooked on this!!! I love the scent of the lavender, its not overwhelming but just enough when someone gets close to you, they give you a compliment!!!! And it gives my hands a softer feeling then those other hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> I was using this as my healthier alternative for a hand sanitizer, but had to stop because it was causing me to have an allergic reaction.  My eyes water and burn whenever I used it.  Burt&#x27;s Bees works so much better for me.</li>
    <li> I love the lavender scent! Easy to use gel. Dries quickly.  Would fit easily in a handbag or tote.&lt;br /&gt;Nicest sanitizer I have ever used! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I did not find the scent overpowering.  It smells as if you rubbed some fresh lavender between your hands.  Nice alternative to typical hand sanitizers.  I like the idea that it&#x27;s nature based.</li>
    <li> The hand sanitizer bottle is too small.  Not a good deal for the price.  The sealer inside the cap came loose and this is the first product that I ever ordered thru amazon that came to me with most of the product inside the box and not the bottle.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!  I have a little one and were always on the go.  If we can&#x27;t wash our hands we use this EO Hand Sanitizer Gel.  It feels great, smells amazing, and most of all it doesn&#x27;t dry out our hands!  I have purchased this a few times and plan to keep at least 2 bottles in our household at all times.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like most hand sanitizers because they always smell so fake to me or too medicinal.  I often end up using witch hazel or just plain rubbing alcohol which the latter of course can leave my hands dry.  This stuff cleans my hands without drying out my skin and the scent is actually calming to me.  I keep it at work by my desk and sometimes just put it on even when my hands are not dirty because it calms me down.</li>
    <li> It comes in a very neat and tiny bottle. The strong is not what I expected. It is very strong and definitely has that lavender smell. However, the combination of the lavender and the sanitizer really doesn&#x27;t seem to work well for me. I guess this is more of a preference than anything else. I would recommend buying the 2-ounce to try out before purchasing any larger quantities.</li>
    <li> Gluten free!  Nice fragrance and feels great.</li>
    <li> This a is handy bottle but the smell was very overwhelming.  I gave it to a friend who didn&#x27;t mind the smell. It works fine.</li>
    <li> Smells a lot nicer than your typical hand sanitizer, but not as nice as some other lavender cleaners I&#x27;ve tried.  While I usually find it pleasant enough, I&#x27;ve occasionally thought it had a kind of skunky smell.  One person has told me it smells great, while another once told me it stinks.  It&#x27;s rather thick, so I have to store it upside down in order to be able to dispense it easily without shaking.  What bothers me most is that it leaves a residue feeling on my hands; similar to most gel sanitizers but a little more so.  I might continue to get it simply because I haven&#x27;t found a source for a better gel, but I prefer the lavender spray cleaners for their cleaner scent and lack of residue.</li>
    <li> Bottle was half empty by the time it got here, but what was left didn&#x27;t smell good and didn&#x27;t feel clean when wiping off the bottle.</li>
    <li> It Smells great and is a very convenient size for a diaper clutch. I Like that is is triclosan free.</li>
    <li> I thought It would only be a light lavender smell but it is STRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can barely stand to use this stuff.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this product, but did not like the stickiness on my hands after applying, did not feel clean.</li>
    <li> This fits in my purse and gets a good workout whenever I go to shopping malls, etc. It smells lovely and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This hand sanitizer works so well, but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  I love the smell so much, I find I keep using it throughout the day.  Who doesn&#x27;t want to smell lavender?  I highly recommend it if you are trying to avoid the chemicals and high alcohol content of the standard sanitizers!</li>
    <li> I wish the container was more sophisticated.</li>
    <li> Love these things for travel.  And they smell great too.</li>
    <li> I hate the antiseptic smell of most hand sanitizers. This one smells wonderful, a true light lavender scent, not fake or perfumey. Dries quickly and the light scent of lavender remains on my hands.</li>
    <li> The scent of this sanitizer is so relaxing! I am in awe of EO sanitizers, I have tried the Lavender, Orange and Peppermint and I love each one of them. I am organizing a Career Day for my daughter&#x27;s school and ordered 42 bottles of the 2 oz lavender scent to include in the thank you goody bags for the presenters. I am positive that this will be one of the favorite items; not only is it effective it is a wonderful, refreshing scent with amazing properties. I am expecting to receive many questions about this item. I am also hoping that I get to keep any left over bottles :)</li>
    <li> ARRIVED ON TIME &amp; AS DESCRIBED, THANKS,  ART</li>
    <li> If there is ever a problem with your order, they will be happy to work with you to fix it! I love my Lavender Hand Sanitzer!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff at work. I like the smell and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like the isopropyl alcohol foam we have at work. This uses ethanol. It does have a heavy smell of lavender, but I like it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand sanitizer. It has a light lavender scent that is not overpowering. I use it regularly to sanitize my and my family&#x27;s hands. I&#x27;ve also seen a tot yoga instructor use it at the beginning of class to both sanitize the children&#x27;s hands and ask them to smell their hands after rubbing it in order to focus their attention.</li>
    <li> the peppermint essential oil in this is awesome, it smells super fresh &amp; you only need the tiniest pea sized amount to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I feel like I need to use another product *after* using it just to rid my hands of the stench.</li>
    <li> Very handy size bottles, easy to carry in a purse and smell amazing. There is a fragrance in the whole room when I use it. Also not as drying as some of the other hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> OMG love this stuff!  I have yet to buy it but WILL!  I am used to the horrid typical hand sanitizer that leaves your hands dry and smelling like a hospital ward.  This stuff makes my hands smooth and germ free!  I use it every time I check out at Whole Foods, where they keep it at every register.  Hands smell great afterward too...just like you picked fresh lavender!!!</li>
    <li> The lavender gel hand sanitizer is great because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin - i prefer the lemon scented one over the lavender but it still smells nice.  I feel my hands are getting germs killed without ripping off a layer of my skin.  I keep bottles in my car, at my house, and in my pockets.  I can&#x27;t leave the house without any!  It is all natural so it won&#x27;t harm me, plus it&#x27;s not greasy and you only need to put a little bit on so you get more for your money.</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong for me and the bottle is too hard...</li>
    <li> I totally LOVE this hand sanitizer - the lavender scent is so refreshing and the lotion itself is soothing.  One of my favorites, I alway keep a small bottle in my purse.</li>
    <li> THis hand sanitizer is great for my hands.  I always end up with cracks in my hands year round from washing my hands with harsh soap or alcohol based hand sanitizer.  This bottle is worth every penny.  I keep one in my purse and it&#x27;s just the right sized.  I have never seen it in the store before, just here on Amazon. It also smells amazing, it is like visiting a spa every time I use this.  If you aren&#x27;t a fan of lavender, try the other scent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Keep one in car and one in purse.  Nice that there are no harmful chemicals like trisclan in this.  And the smell- lovely.  Their lavender handwipes are awesome too.</li>
    <li> BEST HAND SANITIZER - HANDS DOWN - SMELLS GOOD &amp;  FEELS GOOD.... BETTER THAN THE NORM - MAKES ME FEEL SPECIAL</li>
    <li> Why 5 stars: top quality ingredients, perfect smell, and portable package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first EO products purchase and will not be my last!</li>
    <li> This is a small bottle. BUT worth it to carry in purse or back pack . WONDERFUL fragrance  --all my girlfriends want it now-- will order more for me and for small gifts !!</li>
    <li> I really, really like this hand sanitizer. I wish it came in a one oz size for my small purses. This is a perfect travel size or perfect for your car.</li>
    <li> I love this brand! It&#x27;s good to know I can rely on the ingredients they use in their products. It is offered at a good price compared to WholeFoods, but I still think it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side. I still think it&#x27;s worth it, though I might buy a bigger bottle next time.</li>
    <li> would buy this again . its the best hand sanitizer ever ! czn&#x27;t say enough about this product . just great !</li>
    <li> Love this hand sanitizer. Nice sent and not nearly as drying to your skin as some other brands.</li>
    <li> I was going to try to make my own alcohol based sanitizer to save money and avoid unnecessary ingredients but this stuff does the trick. It&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s much better than the traditional stuff.</li>
    <li> the EO hand sanitizer is sooooooo much nicer than the purell or other brands. it has a lovely lavender smell and really feels less chemically based.  would recommend these for sure!</li>
    <li> I first used the sanitizing wipes at Whole Foods and I really enjoyed the smell of their lavender. I did a search on Amazon and found out they had a gel sanitizer. I like how it makes your hands feel soft without over drying it like some hand sanitizers do.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and that it&#x27;s all natural. Will buy again. Or maybe I will find a cheaper all natural sanitzer and just add lavendar oil myself to it to get the scent</li>
    <li> bought for my aunt who went through chemo</li>
    <li> Pretty great stuff. The lavender is natural and smells pretty amazing. Like lavender should. Only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because of the added aloe in this gel, it can get sticky and leave a bit of a residue. In the cold weather when you have dry hands it will probably be fine, but I often felt like I needed to wash my hands after using it because the residue does not dry, or my hands would sweat a little and reactivate the stickiness.</li>
    <li> I like this hand sanitizer has a awesome lavender scent does not leave my hands sticky or with that strong Alcohol smell this is great to keep in my hand bag at all times also has not left my hands dry I will order more of this when I run low.</li>
    <li> Fantastic alternative to chemical laden other brands.  Smells great, a lot of other natural brands smell terrible.  Nice size, not drying to hands.</li>
    <li> the smell is so overpowering that I can&#x27;t use it.  Horrible and I like lavender.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this and that it has no triclosan or parabens. The whole family uses it. I have one in every bag!</li>
    <li> Smell was way too strong for me but product seems effective otherwise.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to smell it. Also it makes my headache.</li>
    <li> Perfect size. Like the company</li>
    <li> I feel just okay about this product. The lavender scent is overpowering even to someone who really enjoys that scent. And there&#x27;s a light stickiness after rubbing this in - enough to feel annoying. I don&#x27;t hate it, but also don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> Love this Stuff............</li>
    <li> My hands tend to feel raw from using generic hand sanitizer.  My hands tolerate the EO sanitizer a lot better.  The lavender smell is a nice bonus!</li>
    <li> I usually hate hand sanitizer, they usually have a slimy feel that dries sticky. This one makes your hands feel silky. The sent is strong, but not offensive. Because it is made from essential oil, rather than an artificial fragrance, it is a crisp smell, not chemical, and it fades quickly. Maybe the first minute it seems to strong smelling.</li>
    <li> I Love the smell of this lavender hand sanitizer. It&#x27;s a relaxing, spa-like smell. I will continue to purchase as long as I can afford it.</li>
    <li> Best hand sanitizer out there. Great way to start up conversations with the ladies at the bar!  Doesn&#x27;t dry your hands like most others, and works much better than others with moisturizing effects. Great for the auto delivery thing, I get one a month and seems to be idea.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff :)  So refreshing to have a nice lavender scent with sanitizer instead of an alcohol</li>
    <li> Smells so nice if you like lavender. Its mosturizing. Great product. I will not use any other hand sanitizer. It fits in my pocket and I carry it with me at work. I work at a doctor&#x27;s office so I really depend on keeping my hands germ free.</li>
    <li> Overpriced, but it is not drying and I like using it.  There was no scent that I could detect though.</li>
    <li> This is very nice.  What a concept, a hand sanitizer that smells like genuine lavender.  So much better than the sharp smell of regular hand sanitizer, I will purchase this again.</li>
