      <li>(The bottle is marked into 4 sections, so you know how much to use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Its as if they are brand new again.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
      <li>When I had human hair it significantly brought the hair back by 75-80%.</li>
      <li>the hair dried naturally on an open stand as advised... with a pick, boar bristle brush and comb was able to get it combed out and presentable for styling with a reasonable, modest amount of time and effort.</li>
      <li>Leaves wigs soft to the touch &amp; leaves them looking very natural when finished styling.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft.</li>
      <li>I washed a wig and a couple of ponyfall extensions in this, and they came out silky and fresh-smelling, and soft (the wig and ponyfalls are synthetic hair, btw).</li>
      <li>If used per instructions this product does not destroy the style and body of my wigs (as some of my former products did).</li>
      <li>It made my lace front remi wig feel soft but it did not bring it back to life.</li>
      <li>Breaks down &amp; removes hair product build up very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this product after I use a regular shampoo once to rinse out the dirt. Then I use this cleaner for my extensions followed by a moisturizing conditioner which I leave in for a while. Which is just long enough for me to finish my shower and they work amazingly! Its as if they are brand new again. I currently have protein hair and its just perfect. When I had human hair it significantly brought the hair back by 75-80%. This product is amazing. This is my second time purchasing it because it works so well. As an undergraduate science major I cant spend time and money getting my hair treated, primped, etc everyday. This brings your extensions back to life. Saves me a ton of money which is totally necessary. I really don&#x27;t have time for my hair and hate the time and money that is involved to look like beyonce. I do it on a budget and look great!! THANKS SOOO MUCH!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this one on my wigs either yet. But it arrived on time so that was nice. Hoping it works well too.</li>
    <li> Not a good shampoo for synthetic hair. It leaves a nasty sticky residue. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used baby shampoo and feel that it works equally well. I do like the smell but it didn&#x27;t stay in the hair anyway. The product was acceptable but I don&#x27;t think you need to spend this much money.</li>
    <li> I wear higher quality lace top human hair wigs. Purchased this to clean a newer hair piece with a highly rated conditioner on Amazon as well. I followed the directions... with all products. I was nervous as anyone with my hair concerns knows... would my hair be damaged ? Would it be ultra tangled ? The answer is no... the hair dried naturally on an open stand as advised... with a pick, boar bristle brush and comb was able to get it combed out and presentable for styling with a reasonable, modest amount of time and effort. Standing in the sun in my grocers parking lot seeing my reflection in the car window... my hair had a beautiful reassuring shine. Wearing a hair piece can be cause for self awareness... this product is a good part of the tool kit in managing this issue in some people&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> absolutely beautiful &amp; great quality!  I would buy another one in an instant, very good quality and makes wigs silky smooth!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice solution to wash your wigs with. It has a fresh citrus-y smell to it, and each bottle is good for three washes. I washed a wig and a couple of ponyfall extensions in this, and they came out silky and fresh-smelling, and soft (the wig and ponyfalls are synthetic hair, btw). I will definitely buy this again, I was very happy with the way my pieces felt and smelled after washing them with Fantasia.</li>
    <li> It cleans wigs very well, but there aren&#x27;t any suds. Use only the amount they recommend. Leaves wigs soft to the touch &amp; leaves them looking very natural when finished styling.</li>
    <li> It works. It&#x27;s simple, cost effective and on synthetic wigs it will do the job. I&#x27;m not an expert on products such as this.</li>
    <li> I washed my wigs and extensions in the shampoo and they looked and smelt great! My extensions had really awful tangles and I couldn&#x27;t brush them out. After using this shampoo the brush&#x27;s and comb&#x27;s teeth just glided across them! I would recommend to any amazon user with wigs AND extensions! Fast shipping and great price!</li>
    <li> It comes with four shampoos worth of product. My midback length wig really really needed the cleaning and it did quite a lovely job. Smells wonderful and washes out clean. Totally recommended.</li>
    <li> To me, the product seemed very chemicalized and smelled like industrial strength cleaner.  It said to only leave wig in sink for one minute, and sure enough that was all it took for the dirt to come out of the wig and color the clear water dirty.  However, I noticed the color, consistency and smell of product is very similar to the Orange cleaning products.  I wonder if this is made with the same ingredients as those orange cleaners?  It took several hand washings to get this out of my hands.  I won&#x27;t use it again, I&#x27;m too suspicious about the chemicals used to make this product.  Also, I was wheezing a little by the time I was done washing my wig in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a plastic bag with a piece of tape also holding the lid down to the bottle. It did not stop it from leaking.  It arrived with 3 ounces of leaked out fluid into the baggie. (The bottle is marked into 4 sections, so you know how much to use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up Fantasia products on the Skin Deep Safe Cosmetic site to try and find it.  I did not see this exact product in the data base, but other products by the same company had some very high numbers, indicating those products had a moderate-high hazard score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m choosing something more mainstream this next time.</li>
    <li> It made my lace front remi wig feel soft but it did not bring it back to life. It did give it a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> i put two wigs in one shoebox storage bin, put in one ounce, agitated them and let them sit for a few hours. after i rinsed, i put them back in the bin with a bit of v05 moisturizing conditioner, agitated them and let them sit for about 30 min. after i rinsed and let lie flat to dry, i had absolutely NO problem brushing out my wigs...absolutely no tangles! like magic! the only caveat is that the finish on the wigs are a bit dulled after this treatment.</li>
    <li> This is the best synthetic hair cleanser I have found. Leaves hair soft. Breaks down &amp; removes hair product build up very well.</li>
    <li> It cleans my wigs nicely. Does an ok job detangling. The smell sucks. It doesn&#x27;t stink per say, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell nice. It doesn&#x27;t go very far. Directions say to use 1/4 of bottle every time you wash a wig. I like it, but hope to find a better smelling wash next time.</li>
    <li> Keeps my wigs conditioned as well as clean.</li>
    <li> I used this but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  I wasn&#x27;t real fond of how the pieces turned out after but it definitely deodorizes</li>
    <li> Got to keep your wigs clean, and this is a great product to use.. Love it..</li>
    <li> Very good product leaves the synthetic hair clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> Works like it&#x27;s supposed to. Great product!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair pieces. If used per instructions this product does not destroy the style and body of my wigs (as some of my former products did). Love it!</li>
