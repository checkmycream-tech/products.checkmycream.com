      <li>This is one fragrance will always purchase, because it is  very easy to wear anywhere.</li>
      <li>I am a repeat of Natural Cosmetics and am impressed with their customer service and quality of fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Also the packaging was good and the delivery time was adequate.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m going to see if I like that better</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better bang for you buck.</li>
      <li>Have got many compliments on the perfume.</li>
      <li>Love this scent.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent...</li>
      <li>I may decided to spend more with the hope of receiving the true Egyptian Musk smell and a better quality oil.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommend Natural Cosmetics and their great musks.</li>
      <li>Worth way more than price</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that, shipping was fast and packaging was nice.</li>
      <li>This product fit the need that it was intended for.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such a great product.</li>
      <li>Very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>and I was NOT disappointed.</li>
      <li>Although it had a hint of the original Egyptian Musk Oil</li>
      <li>Overall a good purchase.</li>
      <li>Last time I paid $15.00 for something that smells really good, and this time I paid like $2.00 for something that doesn&#x27;t even smell like Egyptian Musk.</li>
      <li>After a year of using Egyptian Musk, I really fell in love with the stuff, but I don&#x27;t know</li>
      <li>Especially when it comes to perfume oils because the versions of an oil of the same name can VERY GREATLY from seller to seller.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I had an old bottle with a roller that I was able to pour the oil into.  </li>
      <li>I gave it to a relative who liked the smell as it smelled as they would expect and/or would want it to.</li>
      <li>#34;Nothing is like it use to be&amp;#34; however I was excited when I took off the top and took my initial sniff...</li>
      <li>Anyway, this particular one is very high quality and long lasting and it smells awesome!!!!</li>
      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it smells that hot.</li>
      <li>and the company sent my order extremely fast!</li>
      <li>I prefer the open bottle with a screw on/off top.  </li>
      <li>This smell is exactly what I smelled before.</li>
      <li>The oil was very fragrant and I received a lot of compliments.  </li>
      <li>Really disapointed.</li>
      <li>and it was very inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>I am still in pursuit of the original (back in the day)</li>
      <li>Scent was super thick smell weren&#x27;t strong enough smelled more like a Hair grease had to apply it more then once smell didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a longtime fan of Egyptian musk and when I saw the price of 3.50 for a decent sized roller bottle</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Egyptian Musk oil off and on for over 10 years now, ever since I discovered it in high school.  </li>
      <li>However the aroma may not last as long as a product costing more.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s light enough to be fun but pungent enough to last for literally days.</li>
      <li>Some people say it smells too pungent or mature.</li>
      <li>I would say that this egyptian musk is most likely diluted, as it does not last too long as compared to other egyptian musks out there.  </li>
      <li>The oil is very thick and great quality a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I was nervous about buying it because apparently there are different shades of this scent.</li>
      <li>, I find Natural&#x27;s E Musk to be long lasting and pricing is good.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime fan of Egyptian musk and when I saw the price of 3.50 for a decent sized roller bottle I was amazed.  But in the end, you get what you pay for.  I would say that this egyptian musk is most likely diluted, as it does not last too long as compared to other egyptian musks out there.  Another thing I noticed is that it was not thick (like long lasting E. Musk usually is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, shipping was fast and packaging was nice.</li>
    <li> If you are into a long lasting fragrance then this product will provide that for you. This product fit the need that it was intended for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Egyptian Musk oil off and on for over 10 years now, ever since I discovered it in high school.  This particular brand smells a little bit different than the others I&#x27;ve used but it does smell good, no doubt.  However, I think this oil is overpriced.  It is thinner than the other brands I&#x27;ve used and when I received mine, it had no roller so some had leaked out into the packaging.  Very disappointing.  Luckily, I had an old bottle with a roller that I was able to pour the oil into.  I have also ordered the Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess oil so I&#x27;m going to see if I like that better/it&#x27;s better bang for you buck.</li>
    <li> Smells good and the price is great. I am not embarrassed to say that I am sitting at my desk, sniffing myself.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t measure up to past purchases. Greasy with very little scent that lasted only minutes.</li>
    <li> I am still in pursuit of the original (back in the day) Egyptian Musk Oil and unfortunately this was not it.  Although it had a hint of the original Egyptian Musk Oil smell it just was not it....I should have known it would not hit the mark because it came in a roller bottle.  I prefer the open bottle with a screw on/off top.  The oil was thin and not as thick as I remember.  I know they say &amp;#34;Nothing is like it use to be&amp;#34; however I was excited when I took off the top and took my initial sniff...It had the scent but it was not potent enough. I guess you get what you pay for and it was very inexpensive.  I may decided to spend more with the hope of receiving the true Egyptian Musk smell and a better quality oil.</li>
    <li> I love this! The oil is very thick and great quality a little bit goes a long way. men and women can wear this oil. It smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  A little goes a long way.  Very fresh and clean. Just as good as I remembered Egyptian musk to be.</li>
    <li> Would reccommend this to someone. Have got many compliments on the perfume. Thank you for such a great product. Ty</li>
    <li> Nothing to it.  It had no fragrance whatever.  It was a heavy oil, but was not anything I had hoped for.  It must be very difficult to get any perfume oil that is fragrant.</li>
    <li> Love the scent... But it is not in a roller bottle. So how are you suppose to put it on? Stick your finger and rub it on? False advertisement!</li>
    <li> Scent was super thick smell weren&#x27;t strong enough smelled more like a Hair grease had to apply it more then once smell didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> This oil is a 5/5 because I think it smells heavenly. I found an empty bottle around my room once. I&#x27;ve been desperately searching for the same scent until I came across this one. I was nervous about buying it because apparently there are different shades of this scent. But I ordered anyway and I was NOT disappointed. This smell is exactly what I smelled before. That said I suggest you familiarize yourself with Egyptian Musk before you buy it. Some people say it smells too pungent or mature. I think it&#x27;s light enough to be fun but pungent enough to last for literally days. I recommend buying it. This stuff smells awesome. Also the packaging was good and the delivery time was adequate. Overall a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The oil was very fragrant and I received a lot of compliments.  The scent lasted all day.  Worth way more than price and the company sent my order extremely fast!</li>
    <li> The perfume worked because I got laid from it.</li>
    <li> It was the smell I was looking for but doesn&#x27;t last long and isn&#x27;t that poent,&lt;br /&gt;I had bought one a few years ago and that lasted all day.</li>
    <li> After a year of using Egyptian Musk, I really fell in love with the stuff, but I don&#x27;t know what&lt;br /&gt;these people did to it. The oil does not smell like what I bought at the mall last year at the Egyptian store. It smells like a teacher who just drank coffee and some type of bread. I don&#x27;t think it smells that hot. I should try getting my money back, but then the price hit me. Last time I paid $15.00 for something that smells really good, and this time I paid like $2.00 for something that doesn&#x27;t even smell like Egyptian Musk. So I guess by the price I&#x27;ll give this a 3 and the packing was very bad also. It was balled up and trashy looking.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat of Natural Cosmetics and am impressed with their customer service and quality of fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase for the Egyptian Musk.&lt;br /&gt;With all the discussion lately about &#x27;strength&#x27;, etc, I find Natural&#x27;s E Musk to be long lasting and pricing is good.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend Natural Cosmetics and their great musks.</li>
    <li> This is one fragrance will always purchase, because it is  very easy to wear anywhere. It is not loud, but a low keyed scent.</li>
    <li> Great and on time delievery but this product doesn&#x27;t smell like Egyptian Musk.  Don&#x27;t like the smell :(  Really disapointed.</li>
    <li> This musk had a very weak smell to it.  Not the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I gave it to a relative who liked the smell as it smelled as they would expect and/or would want it to. However the aroma may not last as long as a product costing more. I think it&#x27;s still a bargain.</li>
    <li> Very nice and would recommend to anybody that likes this scent, well made, price was fair, delivery was quick, thank you very much</li>
    <li> I loved my Egyptian musk! It&#x27;s not watered down! &amp; it lasts all day! I will be ordering more! Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> This review is for the Egyptian Musk oil that i bought from Nail Polish Supplies (NPS). I cant comment on any other sellers Egyptian Musk oil because i haven&#x27;t tried any of the others. I wish when people leave their review of a product that they would include the name of the specific seller they purchased their items from because it would make buying decisions easier due to the fact that different sellers may have a better or worse product than another seller. Amazon tends to group together lots of items that have the same name, but can vary from seller to seller. I know it would make it easier for me to decide if i want a product or not if the vendor name was included in the product review. Especially when it comes to perfume oils because the versions of an oil of the same name can VERY GREATLY from seller to seller. A lot of them sell their own version of the product. Anyway, this particular one is very high quality and long lasting and it smells awesome!!!!</li>
