<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Little slow getting here.  Too early to tell if it will work out .</li>
    <li> You have to have a little bit of patience with this product to get it done right. It is worth the price you pay for it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use this item yet...but according to the reviews it&#x27;s just what I needed!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> works great.easy to use.as far as the taste,not any worse than the dentist uses for 200 dollars.i recommend perma soft to anyone with dentures.</li>
    <li> Have used reline kits for years, always have done a fine job for me, best I have found. Mike Brown</li>
    <li> Money Saver For Sure.!</li>
    <li> This product dried almost as hard as a rock. I thought it would be softer like the dentist would use. It still worked but was difficult to clean edges. Had to use a glass file. Still recommend it though. I might have gotten a bad batch.</li>
    <li> Used this to reline my mother&#x27;s dentures which no longer fit well enough to use. Couldn&#x27;t have been easier to apply (you do have to read the instructions :), and worked great. She says they fit better now than when they were new. The material appears to be very solid, and well-attached to the dentures. Beats the heck out of a difficult trip to the dentist and paying $300 - $600.</li>
    <li> Overtime my dentures did not fit well at all . Even with denture adhesive it was painful every time I ate . I used the timer on my cellphone for perfect timing while applying the product. This product was  simple to use, and no more pain,&lt;br /&gt;Do the lowers first,if you divide one application in half and mix it in a different small container there is enough to do them over again, so you get a practice shot if it doesn&#x27;t turn out perfect the first time.  I can eat anything I want . My dentures no longer flop around . It&#x27;s like getting new dentures . I also purchased SonicBrite Professional Cleansing System, that cleaned them better than any thing I have ever tried, so it really was like getting new dentures.  This is my first day so I do not know how long it will last . Definitely worth 30 dollars , every penny. Much cheaper then the Dentist two hundred dollars,and that&#x27;s with insurance. Now eating an apple without cutting it up.Yahh</li>
    <li> I tried products that did not proform for me at all. I just wanted my top denture tighter. It worked so well and easy to follow instructions that I used that second kit to make my top denture tighter. The denture is not loose anymore nor did the liner come out.I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Used this on my temporary dentures several times to change the fit as my mouth healed, and then when I got my permanent dentures, I used it to line them for a perfect fit and seal.  I have celiac disease and I couldn&#x27;t find a denture adhesive that could guarantee that is was gluten free, so I just use this product instead.  With the great fit that this provides, I don&#x27;t need to use a denture adhesive at all.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product originally I had Denturite as a liner for my dentures. It worked good but was too soft for me to have a good bite. The Perma Soft is actually harder when set and helped me tremendously with being able to eat more things. I followed the directions to the letter, although I may have not gotten quite enough in certain areas when the product was spread. All in all it turned out well and is still in place. I only had to do some minor trimming and used a small finger file to sand some small areas that were not quite comfortable. Yes it does have an unpleasant taste and takes a few days to go away, but I am satisfied with the overall result.</li>
    <li> I have used various adhesives for the last year with mixed results.  One application of Perma Soft on both upper and lower dentures has eliminated the need for any adhesive.  No more wasting time with other products just follow the directions one time and forget about it.</li>
    <li> for a quick reline when you can&#x27;t get to a dentist. It only lasts a few months, not the year they say it does. At least not for me. Being unemployed I can&#x27;t get a new set until I get working &amp; insurance again, so this really helps to keep me going. I have used this before so when I received it without the packaging it didn&#x27;t bother me. Received it in perfect condition and rather quickly. Will use this company again.</li>
    <li> I knew I was in for a problem just by the smell of this product.  Mixing was not a big deal but once you have this gunk in your mouth the taste and smell will linger for weeks.  It tasted so bad that I came very close to getting sick. By the way that one star is a ghost. For my rating it would be zero stars.  Having this stuff on the market is not wise and could cause more problems.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews before ordering. Then read the directions 3 times before starting. The person who explained how to cover the product with saran wrap before biting down, was spot on. I cut a small piece, barely bigger than the denture, before mixing the compound, then placed it immediately after pouring the Perma Soft. Later, after eating, and again the next morning, I touched up a few spots with light sandpaper(220). Also, the vaseline idea is good. I will definitely use this again, when needed. BTW, before ordering, my dentist quoted $450 to re-line my lower, this is MUCH more affordable!</li>
    <li> I brought this product before and really liked the way it worked.    However this time it did not preform at all well, infact I have to    use fixdent with the liner to keep my teeth in my mouth.    I&#x27;ll be getting new dentures.    Thank You,    Ming Lea</li>
    <li> It ruined my dentures.  Now I have to spend over 1500 for new dentures.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for several years.  If he gets the paste on correctly it lasts several months.</li>
    <li> I was a new denture wearer and boy was it a nightmare, until I discovered perma soft. I never could get my bottom denture to stay in place.I tried several products and everyone of them failed to hold all day. I purchased the perma soft reline kit and WOW does it work, I still need a little denture cream, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all, because now I can eat anything, and my denture stays put all day without fail. It also lasts along time. And is easy to do, just follow the directions exactly as it says and you will enjoy all your favorite foods again</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions correctly your denture liner will come out just as good or better then the dentist. I was very please how the liner fit my dentures.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to use any denture adhesive anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melvin</li>
    <li> This DYI kit works well. I followed the instructions precisely (simple to use) and had no problems mixing and applying the material. My dentures definitely fit much better now, however, the taste is so bad I am miserable wearing them. I&#x27;ve had several professional soft relines by my dentist so I am accustomed to a mild glue-like taste and smell that lingers for a day or two after a reline.  Unfortunately, the material in Perma Soft is much stronger, extremely bitter and is not relieved by eating or drinking. In fact, EVERYTHING I put in my mouth now tastes like a poisonous chemical (even when my dentures are out, the bad taste lingers). I soaked them over-night in water and baking soda as another reviewer suggested but this did not reduce the bitter taste at all. I&#x27;m on day 3 with the Perma Soft reline and I don&#x27;t know which is worse, loose dentures or this horrible bitter taste. If you can tolerate the bad taste, the kit does do what it claims to do, but I can&#x27;t give a 5 star rating on a product that makes me feel physically sick. I will have to be in a mighty desperate state to use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting to me that people never find a negative review helpful. Actually, it&#x27;s suspicious....seller not liking a negative review? Whatever. I can&#x27;t conceive of taking the time to write a review related to my experience if I can&#x27;t be truthful. I lowered my rating to a two star since the horrid taste has still altered my appetite on day five.</li>
    <li> This is the worst stuff. First you have to get past the smell and i don&#x27;t even want want to talk about taste. For me it only lasted about a week. Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 packs of this and have giving one to my sister after using. My dentures were loose and NOW! I can eat anything with a small amount of polydent.  I will be buying more, just to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Being an old geezer struggling with my partial uppers and lowers has never bee \\&quot;fun.\\&quot; I needed something better than the ordinary, particulalrly with the lower partials, which used to be too loose.     Well, this stuff has done the trick. The new reline becomes about 80 percent hard, but it can be manipulated after dousing it with hot water. Now my lowers fit like a glove and I can eat with ease, but I have not been foolish enough to bite into an apple.:) Applying it is simple and it seems to stay in place for weeks and longer.    I highly recommend it as a very useful product for a reasonable price. It would make life much easier if dentists would also use it.</li>
    <li> In the past I used SeaBond&#x27;s Temporary Liner Kit.  When I needed to purchase more, it was very difficult to find.  I took a chance on the Perma Soft product and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  I will continue with this product.  It works great, and is better than anything I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and will buy it again.  It relined my lower plate comfortably and fits better than ever.</li>
    <li> the product was very good the packaging was not good.they should seal their product in their containers.the shipping process tends to cause leaks in the power.otherwise a great product.i will use again</li>
    <li> super item,works great.follow the instruction sheet and     you can&#x27;t go wrong.It saved me a lot on money.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and the product met my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> One of the front parts broke on my wife&#x27;s partial leaving only the denture tooth without a top. We ordered this and she carefully rebuilt the front flap. It looked great and worked very well till we could get the money to replace it. She told the denture place that she had rebuilt it will permasoft liner and they didn&#x27;t believe her because it hardens and looks very similar to the rest of the acrylic.</li>
    <li> this product works as it states it will. I don&#x27;t know if it will last 2 years but so far so good.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WORKED FINE ONLY PROBLEM IS FOR  WHAT THEY CHARGE YOU THINK THEY WOULD SEND A MIXING CUP ALONG WITH IT.</li>
    <li> save yourself $700 do it your self!!</li>
    <li> Items delivered  in a timely fashion and they were in good condition. I will not hesitate to use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I tried Perma Soft, and I like it.  The down side is that during the molding process, it tastes terrible, and the taste lingers, so get both the uppers and lowers done, one right after the other, and you only have to go through the bad taste once.  But it&#x27;s worth it.  WOW!  the teeth FIT.  I don&#x27;t have to glue them in with Fasteeth any more.  If anything gets under the plates, I can just rinse them under a tap and pop &#x27;em right back in my mouth.  I can eat raw carrots, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.  Perma Soft is easy to use, and a very attractive alternative to hiring highly paid professionals.  Saves money and the teeth are way more comfortable to wear now.  I should have done it long ago, but only recently learned about this product.  Tell everybody.  I want them to stay in business.[[ASIN:B00158J0EI Perma Soft]]</li>
    <li> This is not soft It hurt my gums in a matter of days after applying it  and the taste is HORRIBLE!!</li>
    <li> I could not find Seabond reliners any where, even on line. I came across Perma Soft reliners &amp; decided to try them. They are really good. They stink &amp; taste nasty until the last step when you wash them. They are very comfortable &amp; I would say to any one that use to use Seabond, to try Perma Soft. I think you will be like me &amp; find the product great</li>
    <li> I have used Perma Plate Reliner for several years. Normaly, it will last about two years before having to redo. It is very simple to apply, but once you have mixed the powder with the setting agent, have everything at hand to apply the material to the plate because it begins to set very fast. Tim Tyler.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00158J0EI Perma Soft (2 kits)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I must start off with telling you that my denture was 22 years old, and had worn thin, along with a couple of tiny holes in it where I had bitten thru it. They definately didn&#x27;t fit right anymore, and I was constantly having to \\&quot;glue them in\\&quot; with Fixodent. I found Perma Soft thru Amazon, and decided to try it although costly, because it claimed to last 2 years. It was the BEST decision and money I have probably ever spent.  The day before Thanksgiving, I was eating a peice of dried fruit, and I heard a \\&quot;crack\\&quot; sound. When I checked, I found that I had indeed cracked my denture in the front, and it appeared the Perma Soft \\&quot;saved\\&quot; the denture from coming apart. That night I got a package of denture fix, and \\&quot;welded\\&quot; them back so that I would be able to eat some dinner for Thanksgiving. Again I wasn&#x27;t so lucky. I had tried to eat a peice of turkey, and the denture BROKE completely where I had welded it, and AGAIN, thanks to Perma Soft holding them together, I didn&#x27;t have the peices of denture fall out of my mouth. The following monday I made an emergency visit to my dentist, and he rushed me through and made me a new denture, ( something that I stupidly had put off), and at the time the dentist himself told me that the reliner I had used ( Perma Soft) had \\&quot;saved my cookies\\&quot; and held them together, and continued to hold them together untill my new denture was ready 9 days later. I can&#x27;t praise Perma Soft ENOUGH for making such a FANTASTIC product! I thank you from the bottom of my heart!</li>
    <li> This product works really well. It last a lot longer than the other liner I tried. Make sure you put some petroleum jelly on the teeth and bottom/top side of your denture to prevent the liner from getting on that part, it will spill over. It doesn&#x27;t tell you to apply the petroleum jelly in the directions. But trust me you will need to. It can be really hard to get off if you don&#x27;t. Stuff taste really bad. I always soak mine in baking soda which really helps remove the bad taste from it.</li>
    <li> This product was just what I was looking for. I relined my treatment denture and it worked very well. I followed the directions and I was amazed how well it worked. The directions suggest using a 20 minute soaking with water and baking soda at the end of the instructions, I did that and after 24 hrs, the slight bitter taste was pretty much gone. Thanks Perma-soft</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago for my grown son.  It works beautifully! He is able to chew without any problem.  I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who wants to save around $ 300 for a denture reline from a dentist.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at how well this product works.  Instructions are clear and must be followed carefully for a good result.  Another reviewer suggested using vasoline on areas where any overflow might stick,  I used canola oil with success, which made trimming and cleanup much easier.    The result was excellent for the upper denture, and satisfactory for the lower.  Would recommend this product as a fast and economical solution for loose dentures.</li>
    <li> The reviews sold me and got me to try this product for relining my dentures. The results are amazing. The directions are simple and easy to follow.Don&#x27;t bite down too much , a comfortable bite is preferable to a hard bite.I bit down a touch too much and didn&#x27;t quite get the fit I wanted but followed through finishing the relining. I could eat more than before but I wanted more !!  A line of Fixodent on my lower relining gave me more than I expected....corn on the cobb,apples,carrots,steak you name it...I COULD EAT Again !!! ANYWHERE !!!ANYTHING!!!  There is a taste that is somewhat unpleasant for a couple of hours but it&#x27;s not as bad as you might expect....BUT the tastes you will experience later in the food you can eat again...the food you were afraid to eat but loved to eat is worth the wait. I highly recommend Perma - Soft to anyone who has loose fitting dentures. Saving money TOO!!! Actually had a hard time removing the dentures later.</li>
    <li> I really feel fortunate to be able to afford ANd HAVE THE EASY USE and affordable Perma Soft Denture Reliner kit and also be able to have it delivered with in a few days. Can fix the pinch or sore spots my self can give myself a better fit. I wore ill fitting detures for years not knowing I could take them back and have them fit right. Now I do it myself  get proper fit and bite.  I am happy with it.  I am thankful that I can easy order through AMAZON</li>
    <li> Its true this creates a great liner and it makes dentures feel and fit great IF directions are followed BUT the taste of the liner is absolutely atrocious! Smells like something dead. Im on day 4, have soaked in baking soda/water, lemon and baking soda/water, vinegar and water, apple cider vinegar and water. They have been soaking almost continuously so I cant go anywhere while waiting for the horrible taste to dissipate as others have claimed it would do. I think the chemical smell and flavor has been beyond bearable for me personally. I have used Cushion Grip and it doesn&#x27;t give as good a fit and it turns orange and it isn&#x27;t as pretty in pink as the Permasoft liner BUT at least you can put it in your mouth and it helps without making you sick. I just can&#x27;t imagine at this point how ANYONE can truthfully say this liner is great. Fix the chemical taste and it would be awesome. Otherwise USE at your own RISK...</li>
    <li> I have worn Dentures for over 15 years and was never able to chew anything without using adhesive. From day 1 they would come lose and gag me if I didn&#x27;t glue them in. They have been re-lined by the dentist and still were not snug. After using Perma Soft they stay put and feel more comfortable than the day they were new. I can now just take them out anytime I want to clean them and just pop them right back in without the glue. Thank you Perma Soft.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a relative who&#x27;s illness required him to see his dentist before he had a chance to use the product. Perma Soft issued a full credit with absolutely no hassle.</li>
    <li> I contacted the seller on the product because it was loosely packaged in a very unsanitary and unprofessional way. The seller promptly replied and sent a replacement package in which was packed in a box, but is still left alot to be desired on the sanitary issues with the stirring sticks for the chemicals being that it is just popsical sticks that I do not know who has handled. As for the product itself, it is an awesome product and 100% better than any I have tried in the past in relining my dentures.</li>
    <li> The best kit i ever bought, easy to use, Save me time and money, better than seeing  a dentist  that cannot do the right job .</li>
    <li> Bought it for Dad and he called the number and spoke to a woman who gave him excellent instructions. He is totally satisfied with this and saved himself $150 at the dentist!</li>
    <li> Its easy to use, directions are very clear and it last about 2 months or so, ...not 2 years, but its worth it to use it, it makes your dentures easy to wear and i can eat just about anything i want.</li>
    <li> Used original order and something went wrong.  Liner pealed on edges.  Supplier was kind enough to send me a new liner which I used and the new liner did much better.  Difficult to review a product like this since there is no way to know how long the product will be effective   until several months pass.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use with extremely simple instructions.  I have used it before and it does last which is why I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product. I relined an upper plate following the simple instructions. It now feels and grips better than when last done at my dentist. The taste is offputting but leaves in 2 to 3 days. It does harden more than it would seem from the ad but not uncomfortably so for me. It did save money but that wasn&#x27;t why I bought it. The hassle of getting to the dentist was why. I recommend it. If it wears out too early I will let you know.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use a shot glass to mix it and it only takes a little. It lasts a long time. I won&#x27;t use any other product. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Not for me but friend was pleased</li>
    <li> I would rather hide in my closet than to be seen without my dentures!!  The denturite had been discontinued!  O MY GOSH!  I found Perma Soft!  I was really worried that it would not do the job!  I am so happy to inform anybody like me that HAVE to have a correct denture fit!  You are saved from not being able to eat and looking like a toothless freak!  AMEN!!! It may be a bit costly and taste bad, but You will be so pleased!  Trust Me!!!!!</li>
    <li> This worked much better than I hoped. My dentist reclined my dentures but that had to be removed so I ordered this product.</li>
    <li> I had immediate dentures done several years ago.  Once the swelling went down my teeth looked shorter than my own ever did...not to mention the dentist chose &#x27;small, more feminine&#x27; teeth as opposed to matching my own.  Because there were done out of state, it was impossible for me to get back to have them repaired.  After almost 5 years, it&#x27;s only gotten worse. I&#x27;m soooo self conscious over this, I used to have a pretty smile, now I look freaky.  I&#x27;ve been using 2 denture pads rolled and placed in the cavity, which brings the denture far enough down that I look almost like I did pre-denture, but that&#x27;s obviously a serious comfort issue, not to mention not very secure, so I have to take the pads out at night.  It would be so nice to wake up and look in the mirror and not be ashamed.    Anyway, I all but gave up because I can&#x27;t afford $300 to have my own realigned...this product looks like a life saver!!  This has seriously affected my self esteem, now there&#x27;s hope!!!  My question is, with such a huge gap, would I be able to use two applications mixed together to bring the denture down and make my teeth look normal again?? I don&#x27;t want to do one application and have there not be enough.  Also, how long can I expect them to last...is two years really possible? Thank you for any information you can provide!!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter to try and she like it just find, and if need it again and she is out, I will reorder it again. MaryAnn P.</li>
    <li> I really like this reliner! It lasts a long time and is easy to apply. One thing I did figure out was not to soak my dentures in a cleaner over night...the liner breaks down faster. If you just hand clean them and put them in plain water it will last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> made my bottom dentures fit so much better.</li>
    <li> works good worth a try.i have used it a few times and it is nice not going to the denture guy every time they get a little loose</li>
    <li> I first bought this product for my husband 2 years ago.  His upper plate was about 5 years past its expected life expectancy and was starting to rub sores on the top of his mouth, and wouldn&#x27;t stay in place.  We tried this product and it worked!  2 years later we are finally buying this same product again - for the same upper plate!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this with expectations of promise.I was disappointed within days.the soft pliable stuff hardened and caused some very sore spots..then within  week the top came loose,so here I am back to try the liners.Also,my top needed more than I got.Lost again,ADVICE????</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome..I will buy it again, and recommend it to anyone who is tired of using the adhesive every day.  It has a bad taste for a day or so, but goes away and is well worth it.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Perma soft worked just as good as the old denture rite. I am very Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The liner peals right off, stinks, and tastes awful.  I would not recomend it to anyone.  It certainly does not last for two years as advertised.  Save your money and go to a dentist that can reline it for you.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results.  I have tried 3 or 4 others,  this one is the only one I found to be well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It is a good product and if used properly it is as good or better than havnig a denturist do it</li>
    <li> This is a better product than i have been using.  The instructions were easy to follow and i am satisfied with the fit.  It could be a softer feel as my gums are very sensitive.</li>
    <li> i relined mine about three weeks ago. it is peeling and falling apart. prouduct is lousy. i would not recommend this product to anyone. if product is possible for refund,ithank you.</li>
    <li> becomes hard its -so-so</li>
    <li> I was amazed how well this worked! My appointment to get my partial relined was 5 weeks away and it was way to loose to make it that long so I tried this and it worked so well that I saved a $200 reline from my dentist. Been in for a couple months and it is still like I just put it in yesterday. It does have a rather nasty taste that lasted about a day but it was worth it. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has false teeth!</li>
    <li> This product does the job better than expected. The price seemed high but after the results will buy again if needed.It is a mouth saver without that nasty taste of goop the other products have and is more permanent. thanks</li>
    <li> Not too sure how I feel about this product. I tried it once and was not too impressed. I am going to try it again. I&#x27;ve been looking for something to keep my bottom teeth in. I know it is a difficult process but geeze! I hate gluing them in 4-5 times a day. Especially in the middle of a meal! Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right the first time. Lowers are a hard fit. Somebody help me...I hate having my teeth come lose half way through a meal!</li>
    <li> Although I have never had one application last two years, I find the ease of application and the comfort that it brings to be very satisfying. And the ability to &#x27;do it yourself&#x27; saves considerable money.</li>
    <li> I  have used permasoft on my dentures in the past so when I got a new batch I didn&#x27;t know that it was a new formula.&lt;br /&gt;I got hives all over my back, hair and top of my body. not knowing where they were coming from I  lost 20 days of work and spent over $500. in meds and Drs&lt;br /&gt;If you get hives this is whats causing them.&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn</li>
    <li> This product is the next best thing to getting new dentures. You can save quite a bit of money because of it. The instructions for use are clear and concise and it is probably the same stuff a dentist would use for a reline</li>
    <li> Had never tried anything like this before. Was thinking, What if I mess this up, it might cost me Hundreds more and not to mention how foolish I would feel when I went in to the Dentist. Well this stuff worked GREAT! Used an Exacto Knife to smooth down some of the sharp edges and cut away excess. I did this in two nights so I could spend more time getting a good fit and not rushing to get the lowers done. There was an after taste for a few days, but not that bad. You can&#x27;t go wrong on this item.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Lasts 2 years.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT works just like it said stay on great had no problems what soever  will buy it again later as needed but for now it is great worth the price</li>
    <li> Works well, I don&#x27;t know about for two years. Its a little tricky to use until you get used to it, sets up really fast.  I suggest taking your time when you do it, that may help it to last longer.  I would have liked to know up front, how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> It is a product that is over priced  I am sure due to supply and demand. While I am sure the product is as good as they claim. It will require trial and error to obtain the correct method of application. I will purchase this product again It&#x27;s the only one at this time</li>
    <li> When using the Perma-soft reliner I had the most awful chemical taste ive ever tasted for almost a week I would use mouthwash and vinager to try and eliminate the taste that had formed with not much relief. I have used reliner products  of this type before but only had a short duration of chemical taste similar to what I experenced at my dentist when he did a reline. I dont know if the product was expired or what..? But this was a terrible experience ..! I only did one denture at the time and I am reluctant to use the remaining product for my other denture..!</li>
    <li> product came quick, in good shape, fresh.&lt;br /&gt;You have to work it quickly but not rushed once you begin- before it starts to harden.&lt;br /&gt;No bad taste at all. There is a taste that is just a taste but it is neither good nor bad and nothing near a chemical taste. The taste lasts only for the time its in your mouth the first time shaping it and once you rinse the flavor is gone.&lt;br /&gt;Its Very comfortable and makes it really easy to wear your dentures again. I was really impressed and grateful for this product. I will definetly use this product again if needed.</li>
    <li> This product did a better job than the dentist and much cheaper.  I bought another one as a backup  I thoroughly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product really works very well!  I bought a 2-pack in July 2009 and today (5/22/11) I am relining my dentures after nearly two years!  The only problem I have is that my directions have been misplaced.  Can anyone respond with brief instructions for me so that I may reline my dentures today?  I would be very grateful for any help!  Thanks! :-)</li>
    <li> Product came as described, very easy to prepare and handle. I bought for my grandma that she had a 18 years old bridge, that was never fit for her gum and with that time her gum line was virtually gone. When she smiled her bridge moved upward, and you got the illusion that she did not have any teeth in the front. With the Perma Soft she can use her bridge in the meantime she save some money for a permanent solution.</li>
    <li> Love that it lasts so long and is so easy to use!</li>
    <li> do not suggest this to anybody. currently applying the lining and my mouth is on fire and the taste is horendous!! i have used a different brand before when it was sold at walmart and never had a problem. wont buy this one again.</li>
    <li> The ad for this product says you can do this at home for a permanent fix to loose dentures. It arrived in a small unmarked box and when I opened and saw what it was and read the instructions they said  \\&quot;use for temporary repairs and see a dentist as soon as you can.\\&quot; So much for the claim of do it yourself. Cheap bunch of crap now I&#x27;m out $26+ dollars for some crap. That simple. I emailed amazon and got NO RESPONSE. THIS REALLY SUCKS!!!!!! I did learn a lesson though.</li>
    <li> I find that Perma Soft has a most excellent product that can be used at home rather than spending big bucks to the dentist. It is simple to use. My partials fit well, but the slight opening between the roof of my mouth and the plate cause the annoying whistling associated with partials and dentures. One quick treatment and the sound is gone! Each reline normally last 6 months or more. I recommend this for all partial and full upper dentures.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product when I was unable to locate any EZO very easy to apply,now I&#x27;m saving some money</li>
    <li> I was impressed with it. It sure is better than spending $450 to get my lower plate or upper plate done. I did figure out that it had to be done quickly after it was mixed up. No other complaints at all. It really helped the sores in my mouth from rubbing on a miss fitting dentures.[[ASIN:B00158J0EI Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit--Reline 2 Denture Plates]]</li>
    <li> This stuff was really easy to use and so far has done as I had hoped it would.It would have cost 350.00 if I had to go to the false teeth people.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00158J0EI Perma Soft Denture Reliner (2 kits)]]Happy with the product,Happy with way you run your company.</li>
    <li> Despite my not receiving the my original order (either lost or misdelivered),Perma Labs sent a replacement order no questions asked and in a very timely manner.  I will do future business with this outstanding company.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff, he had a pair of dentures he wasn&#x27;t  able to wear and this fixed them right up.</li>
    <li> Tried this product a few months ago and am still suffering today. The smell and taste was absolutely disgusting and even now i can smell and taste it when i think about it !! Steer clear and save for a professional refit is the best advice i can give. I followed instructions exactly but was very dissapointed with results and that taste, O M G !!!!!!! Spent the evening  2 hours)removing the nasty stuff.</li>
    <li> GAGGY, SMELLY BUT IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> The product needs  better instructions ! As written it leaves too much to guesswork. My advice is pass this product by !</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, the taste is terrible..the fit is awesome. I am a little sensitive to some chemicals and to latex, so the first three minutes in was a little uncomfortable due to a burning sensation. After the first rinse and trim though, it was merely the taste that was and still is uncomfortable.  I am hopefull that the other&#x27;s are right in that this taste will soon fade. (I am only two hours into using this product.)  Yes, I would recommend to others, especially to those that are looking for a cheap alternative to having the dentist do basically the same thing.</li>
    <li> This saved me a lot! Works fine and lasted quite a long time. Mixing is a little tricky. However, I&#x27;m ordering it again. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have my partial for about two years now and they have never fit right. Even after a very expensive reline from my dentist I still had use powder and strips. Now they fit perfect all by themselve. And it was easy and quick to do myself. Thank You so much !!! Best product. Best price. Will defintely be back to reorder.</li>
    <li> The product did just as advertised but the packaging left a lot to be desired. The picture that was shown to me was the product in a sealed package but when it arrived it was all free in a plastic bag. The two wooden sticks were open too. You can&#x27;t be too careful. Why did the sticks have to be touched  and taken out of the original package. I will purchase the product again as needed but not from this seller</li>
    <li> It even states on the instructions, if you are sensitive to chemicals, you might not want to use it. Well I&#x27;m not all that sensitive, but it made me slightly sick, while it was curing in my mouth. Better off to go to a dentist and pay the bucks to have it done right. I don&#x27;t have any money, so I had to use this product.  .  I have some knowledge as to how this stuff works and how quickly it sets, so the mixing part was easy for me. I poured the liquid into the powder and immediately mixed the two. I Kept Mixing until I was ready to put it into the denture. Constant mixing helps to ensure the powder dissolves into the curing agent. I mixed for about 2 minutes until the mix was thicker than \\&quot;honey\\&quot;.  .  I used a piece of kitchen plastic wrap to cover the denture after putting the mix in it. That isolates the mix from touching your mouth. The plastic (saran wrap) is thin enough to conform well to your mouth and you get a lot less bad taste from the mix. I did the 3 minutes in my mouth and then took out the denture and peeled off the plastic wrap, which did not stick to the mix. I rinsed the denture in cold water for a few seconds, flushed out my mouth and put the denture back in for 5 minutes. I rinsed it again and put it up for a half hour.  .  I used an exacto knife to trim off the excess. I did not do that until the denture had set for 30 minutes. I just ran the exacto knife around the edge of the denture and then just peeled off the excess material. I took a small piece of 800 grit sandpaper and just lightly touched the edges to smooth them and the deed is done. It fits better in my mouth than before, but I don&#x27;t notice it any softer. The pressure points are still raw, but they may get better with time.  .  Overall I would say it works as advertised, but beware of the terrible taste and the fact that it may make a sensitive person sick.</li>
    <li> Works in a real quick fix way and does not cost $900.00</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like it didn&#x27;t work for him</li>
    <li> Not only does this have a nasty taste, it did not hold my upper denture in place as well as the daily adhesives.  Also, even though I brush and use mouthwash, after a short time they started to have a smell.  Yes, I removed, rinsed, brushed and poured mouthwash on them.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT GREAT PRODUCT!!! I have used this product now for about 6 years. I reline about every 2 years. I use no paste and can eat anything....EVEN CORN ON THE COB....RAW VEGGIES AND RAW FRUIT!! :-) Just follow directions and taste will go away after few days! It is very soft feeling in my mouth and feels better then ever having the reline done at the dentist and paying the reline fee! I would recommend this product to anyone and everybody.....just give the taste a few days it is well worth it!! :-)</li>
    <li> Greetings.. I have used just about everything for my full lower and &#x27;flipper with 6 teeth upper..I have used the stuff that was discontinued.. This Permasoft is the same substance and principle as the other reliners.. No it doesn&#x27;t last two years.. it shouldn&#x27;t anyway.. and Yes you can use it on both upper and lower at the same time and the same application.. I can think of absolutely no other reason than to sell more product, why you have to use it on only one plate.. in fact you should have plenty left over after using it on both.. IMO get the cheaper stuff.. it&#x27;s practically the same stuff.  I have problems with dentist adjusting and buffing.. so I finally took a finger nail file and buffing pad and filed and buffed to where it felt good.IF you have a few teeth and don&#x27;t want a partial there is a great type of little known partial called a CU-CIL.. just look it up you&#x27;ll be glad you did..</li>
    <li> Father in-law is pleased with them and said it&#x27;s way better than spending over hundreds of dollars at the dentist. Works just as good.</li>
    <li> If your dentures are getting loose and you don&#x27;t want to pay $350 to your dentist, this is the product for you.  It&#x27;s easy and it works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and it lasted approx 5 years!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Perma Soft.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I would refer it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The product was ok and they got it to me with the time limit. What else can I say it worked.</li>
    <li> The first two times I used this product I simply followed the instructions that came in the package and made a mess of my dentures and my mouth! There&#x27;s so much more to know if you want a good fit and really, without a good fit, any reline is a waste of time and money. Fortunately there is a kind dentist who shows the entire process from start to finish in a two part video on YouTube. I followed his instructions and I now have the most comfortable dentures I&#x27;ve ever had in my life, and I&#x27;ve been wearing dentures for 30 years! So before you begin ... [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps (I&#x27;ve used all the adhesives and powders and cushion relines out there, none can hold a candle to this product.)</li>
    <li> it was temporary and not what I though it was</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several reliner products, this is the absolute best!</li>
    <li> This is a liquid plastic (you mix powder and liquid to make the plastic), that goes inside the denture, and then is slowly and gently bitten into place. The excess squeezes out, is trimmed with a sharp knife, and done properly, should help fill in \\&quot;dead\\&quot; spaces under dentures. This is the exact same formula that a dentist uses to \\&quot;soft\\&quot; reline a denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to using this product is to thoroughly remove any and all contaminants on the underside of the denture before beginning. This means peeling out any old flaky liners, getting out all traces of denture adhesive, and then disinfecting the denture in bleach #50% mixture for 5 minutes for dentures that have no metal; or full strength hydrogen peroxide mixture for partial dentures with clasps#. The point is to get the plastic bases CLEAN! Mix the liner exactly as directed, trying to incorporate as few air bubbles as possible. Evenly spread the mixture on the inside of the denture. Dry mouth out with a gauze #this works better in as dry a mouth as possible - too much saliva may cause bubbles in the plastic liner, or roughness#. Place denture in mouth and gently#!# bite into the normal comfortable occlusion. If the bite is wrong, the liner will have to be scraped out and redone. Allow to set. It will not taste so good, and it will really smell initially. Once it is set, remove the denture and then trim excess with a very sharp knife. To round sharp edges, a little piece of fine sandpaper works fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend doing one denture at a time. Start with the one that fits the worst and reline that one first because this way, you are biting against a fairly stable opposing denture. The bite is absolutely critical to get right or the denture will not feel right or comfortable. After stabilizing the worst denture, then do the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liner will get old, begin to crack and harden over time. It will then need to be replaced. Be sure and get out ALL the old liner before relining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If done correctly, this really helps an unstable and unretentive denture become functional again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions please post them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If done correctly, this really helps an unstable and unretentive denture become functional again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions please post them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kone</li>
    <li> If you can get past the taste this stuff works.  I have had it in my dentures now for almost a year and it is still good.  The taste goes away in a few days so hang in there.</li>
    <li> Like many, I found this product while searching for a substitute to Denturite.  Wish I&#x27;d found this ages ago.  Did taste pretty bad, and was kind of yucky while applying/molding, but once it was in and set, it&#x27;s great.  With the other stuff, I also had to use poligrip strips to really get everything to work.  For the first time in years, my teeth fit great, no adhesive needed, even when I play hockey.  I actually did use more than one kit, about one and a half.  I&#x27;ve had it in for a few weeks now and I just love it.  I do wish that you could soak your teeth with cleaner tablets, but for how well it works, I&#x27;ll deal with brushing.  Don&#x27;t know how long it will actually last, company says up to two years, but is going strong for now.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used another product for years and was happy. Went off market and I found this product. It works wonderfully and lasts ten times longer.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Had to reline lower denture plate after contouring/filing--with the aid of my Dremel 7700-1/15 MultiPro. Great product. First trial not so successful. Second trial on cue. ... Can now tend problems with dentures. [Chuckle. ... Chuckle.]</li>
    <li> So I ordered this through the prosoft website and I only gave 4 stars because it in no way lasts for 2 years. However, I&#x27;ve tried the ones in the stores like walmart and had the dentist do a reline also. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allergic to it and have unusual sensitivity to it or what but it smelt like the acrylic ladies put on their nails to have fake long nails. And it tasted like I would imagine that to taste. I was in agony from the burning sensation it gave me. I was in tears for the full 6 minutes and dreaded having to use it again. So I looked elsewhere. I came across permasoft and tried it. I&#x27;m happy to say, not sure what others are talking about, it didn&#x27;t smell anything like the others stuff but I still braced myself for the burning. It never came. Now it had an awful smell and tast but definitely bearable compared to the other stuff. Now it may have lasted 2 months, but that&#x27;s longer than the acrylic smelling burning ones that lasted a couple of weeks. So try it for yourself cause in the end everyone is different and it will have different results for everyone.</li>
    <li> I get better at doing this every time I get a kit. If you read the instructions carefully &amp; don&#x27;t rush it, it works well.</li>
    <li> This was hard and messy  to use and didn&#x27;t fit right when it was done, I won&#x27;t try it again.</li>
    <li> I will Not recommend this product! The chemical odor and taste is terrible! tried putting in baking soda for 1/2 hour still there!</li>
    <li> it does save me money</li>
    <li> Like it as well as cushion grip...</li>
    <li> got this for my brother... he  wants the old stuff back that they stopped making......He doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> i relined my dentures using perma soft. worked great on top denture, but didnt work on the botttom denture.</li>
    <li> I purchased it because it is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t have zink or whatever toxic materials that are dangerous. I haven&#x27;t used it yet and will get back to you if there is any problem. I can&#x27;t really rate it so I gave it 1 star for now and I also can&#x27;t recommend it until I use it.</li>
    <li> I helped my mother with this product, and it took us 3 tries to get it right. I called PermaLab after the 1st try, and they supported us immediately with advice and product replacement. The first time we tried it, my mother&#x27;s bite was a little off, so the dentures squeaked when chewing. The liner came off after soaking it in very hot water, and we tried it again.  The second time, I laid the product on too thick, and it made chewing uncomfortable.  The 3rd time was a charm.  I put less product on the plate, smoothed it out with the provided popsicle stick, followed the directions, and voila, success! We will definitely buy this reliner kit again.</li>
    <li> Easy directions to follow and worked well for my loose dentures.</li>
    <li> read/follow instructing&#x27;s works a advertised.</li>
    <li> New to dentures I used this product for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;However do not follow the directions when they say to take them out after 3min and trim the dentures and then put them in for the last 3min. Put the dentures in for the full six min without moving them. This makes for a perfect fit. After the six min are up the product is still soft enough to trim.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this every time for now on instead of going to my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;DL</li>
    <li> There is nothing soft about this relining kit, nor will it last up to two years. It is so hard that it cut my mouth and has alread started lifting. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant on using this, but since I do not have dental insurance now, and was in need of liners, I thought I would at least give it a try. It has been in for over a month now, and I really do like it. It was easy to do, and the taste was not actually that bad. I did them both at the same time, and that probably made it easier. I am very happy with this. Would definitely do this again!</li>
    <li> likes this really well, however, it is really hard to clean out of plates to renew. This is the second time he has used this.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Follow directions exact ally and you will have a perfect fit every time!!</li>
    <li> this is the best recliner kit on the market. i fixed my teeth for a fraction of what it would have cost at the dentist office. iam well satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> It seems to work ok, but I had a heck of a time getting the denture out of my mouth after it dried.</li>
    <li> The idea is terrific, but the methacrylate compound smells like a chemical factory. I mixed it up, took one whiff, and decided that there was no way I could put this stuff in my mouth. Perhaps my fears are unfounded and it&#x27;s truly nontoxic; if so, the manufacturer needs to make this very clear.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time &amp; works for me.It lasts about 6 month for me.I need it for my lower dentures.</li>
    <li> This one tastes horrible for days, burns your gums pretty badly, and end up hard and brittle.  The ProSoft (by the same people) is a much better product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after SeaBond discontinued Denturite. I love it. It is not much different than the Denturite other than the color is lighter &amp; matches my plate. The other difference, to me, is that it is lighter in weight &amp; more transparent. I took the time to remove all the Denturite liner &amp; started from scratch (dip in &amp; out of hot water as you carve off with a safety blade - be careful). I was a bit worried about the directions instructing me to put them into my mouth so soon, as it still looked a bit runny but I followed the directions times to the letter &amp; to bite down \\&quot;slowly &amp; gently\\&quot; yet firmly into place &amp; I got a great fit. I have found that too much pressure while bitting down for the fit does not work for me. I have to bite down just until I get the bite I want then stop there &amp; hold. I only have the top plate, so I decided to \\&quot;try\\&quot; &amp; split the second application (the two ingredients) to see if I could make a 1/2 batch. I measured carefully &amp; it seems to firm up just perfect. The only CON is that it came with ONE, TINY plastic \\&quot;screw cap\\&quot; to mix in &amp; it was a mess trying to mix it. So I would suggest using a small plastic cup to mix in. I used a to-go restaurant (bleu cheese) cup to mix the 1/2 batch in &amp; that worked great.</li>
    <li> Product works very well. The instructions were clear and it was quite easy, if a bit messy. All in all though, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Easy to use and does a great job. I used to use Cushion Grip until they quit making it. I was horrified! I can&#x27;t use my dentures without it. Then I saw this online and decided to give it a try. I relined my dentures the day it arrived. I&#x27;ve had them in for 2 months now and I can eat so many other things that I couldn&#x27;t before (like steak and apples). Food doesn&#x27;t get under the dentures and cause sore spots because particles don&#x27;t become embedded in the reliner like it did with Cushion Grip. It&#x27;s more expensive initially but cheaper in the long run because it doesn&#x27;t have to be replaced every 2-5 days. There was an annoying chemical smell the first couple of days but that went away. One word of advice: when lining the top denture, cover the entire inside area of the plate with the reliner not just the edge of the bed (don&#x27;t apply like Cushion Grip or Fixodent). Now I&#x27;m scared they will quit making this!</li>
    <li> Leaves some sharp edge; I had to sand. Says on ther box instructions not to used this for anything other than temporary until you can get to the dentist to have them do a realigning liner replacement.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over two years and the product is still fitting well.  The only negative comment I might offer is that, when first put into the mouth after the application of the product, there is a bit of &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; in the gums as the product sets up.  Some people might not like this.  I have a high tollerance for pain so I really cannot tell you how much this might bother you.  It&#x27;s not a terrible sting but it does last for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> The second time was a little better than my first try, but it really doesn&#x27;t last well. &amp;#34;They&amp;#34; say &amp;#34;lasts up to two years,&amp;#34; but two months might be closer to the truth (ok, maybe 4 months). There is a bad taste at first and for that day and maybe one more. I may or may not try another brand for comparison. I use it for a lower denture which is harder to set tight because of the back jaw muscles and the tongue. I had a great lower denture, but it broke; the dentist had retired; and three repairs broke again. I&#x27;ve never been happy now with two replacement lower dentures. That&#x27;s why I tried this and that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re seeing this review.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time now and found it very useful for my dentures. Easy to follow directions and easy mixing of product. Just follow directions and i usually get about 1.5 years of use. Not bad for 30 buvks i would say. Only thing is it does have a bite in taste once starting the forming and smell lasts about a day in close quarters. Tast drops off the second day of real use. Otherwise i like this product over the others. I have others but nothing like this.&lt;br /&gt;2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Great and fast service...have used before and will use again!!</li>
    <li> This is just like what my dentist uses.  Works great!!  Simple to use!  I have used this produce for more three years and will continue to.  It saves me about $300 per reline.</li>
    <li> Did not get a snug fit. Have to find another product that will give a tight. Still need to use denture cream to hold the dentures.</li>
    <li> Used this product last weekend. It mixed verry  easily. Just follow the directions and you will get very good resuls. It has a funny taste for a couple days but the results are worth it. I got a better fit doing this my self than at the dentist. My suggestion is to apply the liner and  don&#x27;t bite down past your comfort zone. Also minimize any movement while the product is setting up. Every time my dentist does this he goes squeezing and pushing around while the liner is setting up which leads to the loose fit and rocking when you bite to one side. So just put it in bite down and hold it there till it sets up and you should be pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in the drug stores in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, it is a great product. Saves a lot of money.</li>
    <li> My extractions were done in March.&#x27;2012, and the dentures were installed the same day.  After repeated adjustments, my doctor suggested &#x27;temporary&#x27; work at a cost of $190 which would give me some comfort and allow me to enjoy eating again.  I was using increasing amounts of denture creme  twice a day and still having pain when chewing.&lt;br /&gt;I was checking the prices on the Creme when I stumbled on PermaSoft here on Amazon, and was intrigued...the reviews had mixed results, but the possibility of getting some comfort at such a low price was very attractive, so I decided to see if the claims were true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thorough cleaning of the dentures, and about 20 minutes per denture later, I was all set, and did NOT need denture creme at all!  They stayed in place almost perfectly!  I say &#x27;almost&#x27; because some items, such as chewy candy did cause them to move.  Normal food, such as fried chicken, steak, pork chops were no longer a problem, and I no longer had to think about what I was going to eat and how long it had been since I put in the denture creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find, when going out for the evening for dinner, I have put a very light application of denture creme on for extra confidence, but most days, I don&#x27;t even think about it any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue I had with the process is that  PermaSoft is packaged with two identically sized vials of compound which are mixed, then applied to the dentures one at a time.  Since my dentures were so loose due to gum shrinkage, the uppers were not snug enough because I could not cover the whole area uniformly...fortunately, I had done them first, and was able to use the surplus from the lowers to fill in the area on the uppers to get things nearly perfect.  I feel that the compound packaging could be a little more generous..The instructions say you can repeat an application without removal of the old, and bonding was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used an exacto knife to trim the excess off as per instructions, and the back side of the blade was very effective for scraping the trimmed area smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Perma Soft, for giving us a product that works, is easily applied, and most important, is affordable! i would order my next kit now, but the stated expiration interval is only one year, so I will wait until I need it before I place my next order.side of the blade was very effective for scraping the trimmed area smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Perma Soft, for giving us a product that works, is easily applied, and most important, is affordable! i would order my next kit now, but the stated expiration interval is only one year, so I will wait until I need it before I place my next order.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 96 year old mother and she was able to do it herself and said it works great</li>
    <li> This product is nasty and impossible to wear without feeling ill. I have tried all of the products currently on the market and they taste so terrible that I have to remove the products.  The only thing I have found is Cushion Grip for weekly applying. However you have to apply a base of one of the hard products to start. Then soften with cushion grip.  You would think someone could come up with something that didn&#x27;t make you ill or taste so bad you had to remove it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother last week. We ordered three reliners and paid for first class shipping. Still haven&#x27;t recieved it! Sure, there are complications that slow any order delivery but that&#x27;s not the upsetting part. The upsetting part is that when I called permalab, I recieved a horrible rep that said she was the only person available to help me (yeah ok). When I became a little upset she had very rudely informed me that SHE was DOING ME A FAVOR by selling reliners so cheap compared to going to a dentist and being charged 300 dollars (Yeah ok). When asked to speak to another rep she then informed me once again that this was a small \\&quot;family company\\&quot; and that she was the only person I could speak with. She wouldn&#x27;t even disclose her name. To top that all off, we paid for first class shipping and she lied and disputed that even though my bill clearly states that I did. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.</li>
    <li> I used this to reline my top dentures then sent them to West Penn Dental where they made me a new upper plate for $169.  Which fits better that the originals new.</li>
    <li> Simply the best, my plate is so comfortable (lower) and it lasts a long time.  Does not chip away like the cheap stuff.  Thanks Perma Labs.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for upper dentures since there is a large open space, not so good for lowers</li>
    <li> This product works well , But not enough to cover 2 denture plates , The same product is available at a local department store for a fifth of the price...</li>
    <li> requires more time than expected.</li>
    <li> Just like it should have.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for six years to temporarily give me better support, works very very good!</li>
    <li> Too soft but comfortable sadly leaves foul taste in you&#x27;re mouth</li>
    <li> This product is stinky when you are using it.  It was a bit hard to get it in the right spots, but once it hardened it has been keeping the false teeth in place much better.&lt;br /&gt;(product bought for family member)</li>
    <li> The first time I tried it it worked for over a year. I only use it for my lower teeth so just used the second portion. I recommend it highly. The only drawback is the taste for a day or two.</li>
    <li> Worked as described. Easy to use. Nice tight fit on the denture. I can&#x27;t rate the longevity because I haven&#x27;t uses it that long.</li>
    <li> It did not fulfill my expectations.  It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s no lining and is quite grainy.  Could&#x27;ve saved my money.  I&#x27;m still using whatever it takes to hold my dentures in.  Thanks for asking.  I was going to forget it.</li>
    <li> Got them on time but I still have to glue my plate in. Was not happy with it done exactly what direction said.</li>
    <li> My dentures were a nightmare from the get-go!  They never fit right, the top teeth are so tiny they look like baby teeth, the bite was wrong, they were uncomfortable -- and not one of my complaints was ever addressed by the dentist who made them.  The bite was so off and eating was such a chore that I often wound up eating grits and scrambled eggs for dinner night after night just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to put in the dentures.  Every time I did put the dentures in, I had to use so much fixative that it was literally sickening!  No matter how many times I complained to my dentist, my words fell on deaf ears.  He&#x27;d look at them and say uh-huh and hmmmm and then stick them right back in my mouth and send me packing.  The dentures have, of course, loosened up over the ensuing two years, and I knew a reline was going to have to be done, but I wasn&#x27;t EVER going back to the dentist who made my dentures in the first place, and I really didn&#x27;t have the money to go anywhere at all.  I decided to give Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit a try because after all -- what did I have to lose?  It was SO easy to do (my daughter helped me, so we were able to do the uppers and lowers at the same time), and for the first time EVER, I was able to get a bite very close to my real bite.  At first when reading the reviews here, I was put off by all the complaints about the taste because I have a highly acute palate, but all the horror stories just don&#x27;t jibe with my experience.  The taste was strong but not horrible when first applying the material and putting the dentures in to get the right fit.  After that, the taste was slightly noticeable the first couple of times I put the dentures in (I take them out every night and often take them out during the day when I&#x27;m in not out in public), but the taste faded quickly, and the dentures actually fit better than they ever have, and I don&#x27;t have to use fixative unless I&#x27;m eating something especially chewy or crunchy.  I can&#x27;t even say what a pleasure itis to be able to slip them in and head out the door -- for the first time in two years, I don&#x27;t have to stand there and put in the fixative, set in the dentures, clean off the ooze around the edges -- YUCK!  I HATE every fixative on the market!!  Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit has certainly rewarded me 10 times over the price I paid for it, and I&#x27;ll NEVER have a dentist reline the dentures for an absurd amount of money -- I can do it myself, thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit eight years ago when our local big box sore stopped carrying Cushion Grip. It worked just fine until my bottom denture broke.  I bought a new kit and used it on the lower denture over the weekend and it is working great!!  I would recommend this product to any of my family or friends!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed that it is not soft.  Developed cankor sores.</li>
    <li> Am new to dentures. I read the reviews. My dentures did not fit properly. Decided to try it. It made a big difference. There were noticeable odor and taste for a short time following. I still need to use adhesive. Also, the epoxy took longer to set than was printed in the instructions. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Stuff burned my mouth, made me gag! Horrible!!!!  Never buy this stuff again!!  Was not easy to spread inmy dentures, did not come out smooth and I still have to use the denture glue</li>
    <li> No problems with this product.  I have used other liners before and they are no better than this one. I will order it again and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my old tenant.  I am assuming he liked it because I never heard any complaint from him.  And he would have let me know.</li>
    <li> It delivered promptly, it served my purpose, it worked well as I expected.  The liquid ran out quickly when powder still left plenty.</li>
    <li> Have used it more than once and it works just like they say. Personally Igive it a little more time to settle than they recommend before setting them in. Gives a better fit with less oozing.</li>
    <li> This is the worst Denture Reliner I ever bought, it does not do the right work, plus its flavor last on your dentures for days, I still feeling that menthol taste. Definitely, I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> once applied, works for several months.  Much better than my dentist does.  Just have to be careful when applying, take your time and do not rush and follow directions</li>
    <li> works as described but it is important that you wrap your top denture or teeth or roof of mouth with something like saranwrap otherwise it will take days to get rid of the taste but it really works as described even bought it twice in case have to use again in the future</li>
    <li> Great product. Had a partial that allowed food to get under it, my dentist did not have a solution for my problem so I tried this product and low and behold it worked much to my delight. I had tried all of the denture adhesive which didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;There is another benefit to the product. It absolutley kills your appetilte, the tast is bad so you don&#x27;t want to eat.  Great dentures OK and loosing weight.</li>
    <li> this product was very easy to use &amp; had great results.  As others had said, the taste was pretty bad but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> After getting my remaining upper teeth pulled and an immediate denture in 10/2008, my dentist did two chairside relines 6 months apart (included in the original cost) but the damn thing never fit right and I went through hell using adhesives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of spending $150.00 for a reline or $1000.00 for a permanent denture when it got too loose even for adhesives, I ordered this product in 03/2010 and did it myself.  I must have got it right the first time because it lasted this long, I could eat almost anything but corn on the cob or raw carrots, and I may have used adhesives twice in over 3 1/2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My denture is still fairly snug after it&#x27;s been in for ten minutes, but the product is starting to discolor and break down, and I even smoke like a chimney!  I misplaced the other half of the kit so now it&#x27;s time for another, and I wouldn&#x27;t be too sure of the shelf life anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that the denture is very clean, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to scuff it up with some sandpaper to get a better bond.  I followed the instructions to the letter, the smell and taste were a bit strong, but it went away in two days without the baking soda soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old dentist retired and I was just at a new dentist last week, he couldn&#x27;t believe I was still wearing the 5 year old immediate and that it fit so well, specially with a DIY reline over three years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I liked it because it comes ready to mix and everything is measured .  be sure you use enough or it will not work.  I did not wait long enough  but what I did not use hardened up  nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use enough  It works and there is not a problem with mixing right  all done for you.  I was impressed once I knew what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ure forms to your gums nicely</li>
    <li> I started using this product after the &amp;#34;dentists&#x27; did a poor job on my lower dentures.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I can &#x27;adjust&#x27; my own, I save a lot of bucks and trips to the office.&lt;br /&gt;Peter</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a few year now and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone whom doesn&#x27;t have the ability to get their dentures re-lined. My husband has had no issues with this product.</li>
    <li> I think the reason it lasts for 2 years is because it gets hard as a rock in a few days, and you could probably put it through a rock crusher and make gravel out of it if you could pry it out of your dentures. Doesn&#x27;t compare to PRO SOFT.</li>
    <li> bought this product almost a year ago and glad I did.If you follow the directions to the tee this stuff does a professional type job and is much much cheaper than a dentist. If your an older member of society get some assistance to make the process easy. Read directions several times over and as you go along!!!This suff will taste terrible and is a draw-back of the process,I used menthol cough drops for a few days cause I didn,t want to go around with-out teeth.You could leave them in cold water(and change it ofen)As you go along You will make adjustments to the denture by using a razor knife(as I did) or by lightly sanding certain areas(I used a small piece of 120grit sand paper)but wait awhile before doing these procedures, your gum line and mouth contures will indicate where these sandings and cuts need to be made just like a dentist would have to do.I now use only a small amount of denture creme(dollar store brand-same as the expensive brand but alot cheaper)just to keep seeds and such out,My teeth are so much tighter now its like a new set.P.S there,s enough to do this twice.</li>
    <li> After paying $500 for a relining of my partial plat,  I said there has to be a better way.  I found this product very easy to use.  There is an after taste which goes away in a few days. I would recomend.  This product did better than what I paid $500 at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Was not completely sold on the idea until I used it. Saved me over $80 and multiple trips to a Denture Center. No more strips or ooey glue/ Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I was searching in vain for Denturite, but it&#x27;s off the market!  Oh No! I read some of the reviews for Perma Soft here on Amazon so I decided to give it a try...Awesome! It works, it was easy! Best to follow the directions exactly, timed exactly, and I got great results! I still would have preferred the Denturite, but this is absolutely the next best thing. You know Denturite goes on eBay for about $50 a box? Forget it! Use this! I think it will last longer than the Denturite would, too!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00158J0EI Perma Soft (2 kits)]]      I&#x27;ve only been wearing lowers about a year and am already on my 2nd pair.  Still, the fit is awful.    I tried several products before discovering Perma Soft.    Perma Soft is the only reline kit I&#x27;ve found that works.  I believe it&#x27;s called \\&quot;soft\\&quot; because it can be removed.  A hard lining becomes part of the denture and can not be removed.  Perma Soft dries to a hard finish.    The perma soft lining does wear down and you have to reline to keep a good fit.  Even with this good reline, I still use denture adhesive but only on the bottoms.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and comfortable. Waiting to see how long it lasts for a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> This is great for dentures.  I used to use products that had to be replaced every week, I have had Perma Soft in for over 2 months and still do not need to replace it.  Sure beats having the dentist reline my dentures.</li>
    <li> Great results, better than (discontinued) DENTURITE. Saved me a bundle on another &#x27;reline&#x27;. Easier to use, less messy but more effective. Highly recommend this as a replacement for DENTURITE users.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and also for my wife&#x27;s sister. It was easy and simple to mix for the both of them. Neither one has had any complaints and are very happy with perma soft. Only thing is,  i know it should be sold for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and used both applications.  It hardens - rock hard - in only a few days and then begins to shrink.  Within 10 days the denture is loose and starts making your gums sore.  Had to buy a commercial over the counter until I could find and buy Acryline.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Product doesn&#x27;t work as well as it says it does, at least to me.</li>
    <li> Not so good..better to go to a real dentist for a quality reline</li>
    <li> What do you expect from a product like this a rambling account of the various services and deeds provided.  In other words not worth the effort to provide a documentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stick to my dentures.</li>
    <li> My denture liner came off several months after I got my set, as my orthodontist had predicted.  I live too far away for regular replacements, and so I tried this.  The liner came off after five days, much to my disappointment because the insert stated that it could last up to two years.  Even so, having this available is worth the hassle for me of mixing and pouring and outlasting that interesting chemical flavor.  The chemical flavor does dissipate, and I only need a little bit for my lower partials to keep them comfortably snug after using most of the product for my uppers.  For me, this is well worth the expense.  It really makes a difference in my eating.  I&#x27;ve decided to keep this in stock just for the convenience--AND it&#x27;s much, much cheaper than visiting my ortho for a product that will come off regardless of whether he does it or the liner comes out of a box.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years,it saves me $$ and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product was great - just what was described and the price was very reasonable.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> While it felt great at first it started coming loose in only three days , a far cry from the two years they claim it lasts. Also you taste it for about a day</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I followed the instructions carefully.  I cleaned off the old lining and then mixes and applied the new lining. Just great... I would encourage anyone else who wonders about purchasing this product to read several of the the reviews because they offer some great advice about mixing and applying. I have to tell you it had been awhile since I re-lined my teeth and it is not easy to get off. I used my dremel tool to help and it was great. Now be advised this is not the re-line the dentist put on my teeth, but the one I put on myself. Be careful read instructions carefully, the reviews carefully. It does taste just a bit icky, but it goes away pretty quickly...</li>
    <li> Used both apps on bottom denture.  Denture still loose.  Trying one more applicarion..  sure hope this tightens loose denture.  Will let you know.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 2 months ago after struggling through my first year with complete upper and lower plates from a mouth full of teeth. I had been using Sea Bond until its discontinuation. Two days ago went to my doctor for a one year follow up, he asked if I needed a temperary reliner replacement and I informed him of applying perma soft. He inspected my dentures commented that it was nice and hard and seemed very adequate, he made some adjustments and suggested I return in 6 months to a year for further dental work. He seemed genuinely impressed with the Perma soft as I am.</li>
    <li> Perma Soft is great!&lt;br /&gt;The seal to my teeth,is far more stronger than I would have expected. It is like having your teeth reworked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a oder, when first applied, but goes completely away after one, or two days. ( I soaked my teeth in baking soda, but the oder did not go away, right away, but is gone in a day or two.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again</li>
    <li> This product was harder once set than what I had been using.  Like a couple of the other reviewers I discovered I needed to pull out the Dremel and do a minor adjustment in a couple of places.  For those who encounter the same situation, in lieu of a Dremel, one can use the rougher side of a regular emery board even though it might take a little longer.  I discovered that even after the recommended soak time, the taste left was rather strong, so I soaked for 1/2 hour in warm water with baking soda added, and soaked my plate overnight for two nights in baking soda and it took that taste and odor out.  I do wish someone would come out with a semi-permanent liner that stayed just a little softer.  With older gums, any sharp edges really bruise gum tissue and it takes longer to heal.  I have found that Ora-jel works wonders to protect tender spots at least long enough to eat.  Would recommend to others as a viable short-term solution for those who need to wait just a little longer to return to get new, better fitting linings or new plates.  I used this product 5 weeks ago, and so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product like this for quite a while now, so I figured I would try it. This product is great. It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts a long time. Not 2 years like it says, but definitely a few months. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a replacement to Denturite.      \\&quot;The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.  However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Look.  They ALREADY aren&#x27;t fitting right.  I did the lowers.  Man am I glad.  It was a cinch... and after a bit of (easy) trimming they fit great!  No creams now!  I suggest you have an Exacto knife for a clean trim... couple of bucks.  Just do it!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t any better than the cheap stuff I have used from Walmart, to me it was a waste of money</li>
    <li> Worthless stuff.  Have nothing good to say about it.  Followed directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and when all said and done i couldn&#x27;t wear my plate!!!  I redid again with same results.  Don&#x27;t waste your monies.  I had to go back to my dentist and paid to have them do it</li>
    <li> I bought my first Permasoft Denture Reliner directly from Ebay for under $20 including shipping cost.  Search for Ebay Seller Permalabs and check out their listed items.    I am completely satified with the product.  Compared to $300 and up at the dentist, this was a great purchase.  The reliner does seem to be quite hard compared to what they say about it being a soft liner.  I used my dremel tool to make necessary adjustments to the tight spots that did create temporary sores on my gums and to reshape any excess run over of the product.  The stong smell and taste does go away after a couple of days.    They say it can last up to 2 years, but mine only lasted about 3 to 4 months before it started to chip away inside my dentures making a very uncomfortable fit when eating.  I am expecting my 2nd kit any day now which was purchased from the same seller on Ebay for the same price as before.  Can&#x27;t wait til it arrives so I can get my dentures feeling like new again.</li>
    <li> works perfectly.  got it for my elderly neighbor whose dentures had become looser and looser over the last couple years till nothing would hold her teeth in. Her dentist wanted over $500 (yes that&#x27;s$500) to reline them which was not an option so we tried this. Took less than half an hour, and a perfect fit!  That was months ago and she hasn&#x27;t stopped smiling since.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product.I followed the instructions when I mixed it.It worked just perfect.I will be reordering at a later date.It is a very good product.I will be using this until I get new dentures.</li>
    <li> Have gotten this before for my husband&#x27;s damaged false teeth. (One of our puppies got a hold of it!).  He really finds it suites his purpose for repairs. So I got him some more to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> Very bad taste  which makes dentures difficult to wear.  Will be checking other products for more pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> I still have to paste my bottom teeth in at least 2 to 3 times a day to keep them in.  I can get about the same product at Wal-Mart for around $5. It did make my dentures a little tighter with this product then it did with the wal-mart brand</li>
    <li> Was really a simple procedure and took care of my problem.  Will see how long it lasts.  After taste did not last long.</li>
    <li> I must say I was Leary about trying this product but it did work for me. A little messy and maybe that was my bad as I may have not let the product set up long enough before putting them in my mouth. But overall my 10 year old dentures that would not stay in my mouth without the help of a LOT of Fixodent worked great. I now only need a very small amount of Fixodent to keep the top denture in snug. They do not fit like new but I really did not expect that. They fit well enough now that I can eat with confidence again and I do not have to deal with the oozing of to much Fixodent like before. Thank You for a good product.. As for the bad taste, it is minimal a goes away within one day. this is a must product for anyone with loose dentures.. I would suggest reading some of the tricks on the other reviews for ideas to make the product work better for you.  I did the freezer for 3 minutes( both the powder and liquid) this made mixing easy,  and the baggy over the denture before I placed in my mouth to set.. these both worked out great..</li>
    <li> Pretty good help with dentures, not totally good.</li>
    <li> My old dentures have new life and fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> I do indeed like Amazon&#x27;s  Perma Soft dentures; however I would prefer Bill Clinton&#x27;s top-care dentures!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how they can get away with calling it Perma Soft as it is anything but soft. It might be okay to reline a loose upper plate, however don&#x27;t use it on a lower plate expecting softness as \\&quot;Perma Soft\\&quot; REALLY hardens.    With all of the plasics in existance such as neoprene, you would think that it would be possible for a \\&quot;true permanent soft\\&quot; cushion kit to be made for lower plates.</li>
    <li> This product was just like taking your dentures to the dental lab and having them professionally lined.  GREAT product.</li>
    <li> Teeth are fitting much better now ,thank you</li>
    <li> Easy to use and good duration.</li>
    <li> Product works well and performs as promoted. It also lasts even longer than indicated.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints with product or speed of delivery, but despite the assurances, getting any service, information, or technical advice after the sale is totally impossible. On calling you speak to a woman whose voice and attitude are intended to make you regret interrupting her day. She advises she doesn&#x27;t know to any question you might ask and tells you you will have to speak to a technician who neither can come on the line or call back as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I want to continue using their product but first must remove the old build up of it. The procedure described in their pamphlet for quickly removing it does absolutely nothing to it. Thus, I&#x27;m screwed. I can&#x27;t remove the stuff, and can&#x27;t reline without doing so.&lt;br /&gt;Without any technical input from them, they are preventing the continued use of their product by a previously satisfied customer that they went out of their way to alienate.&lt;br /&gt;J P Roman</li>
    <li> The product works as indicated; however, the delivery was unusually slow.</li>
    <li> Works well and is a good product.  I&#x27;m well satisified with it and it&#x27;s results.</li>
    <li> These work great, so long as your adjustment/relinement is not severe. My husband and I both have used them, and they stick! Taste nasty for a few minutes, but not something you can&#x27;t handle. Better than giving up your dentures for a day to a denture manufacturer!</li>
    <li> Made the dentures fit much better but the smell and taste of chemical is very harsh and also burns the gums in the fitting process. Hope I can get the smell gone, reminds me of a fume like / nail polish scent to the second power.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I have an immediate upper denture, and I only have 1 month to go until I get implants and a fixed bridge installed. It&#x27;s been 4 months since my extractions, and my gums have shrunk quite a bit, and I was badly in need of a new soft reline. I couldn&#x27;t see paying my dentist for another reline with only 1 month left, so I decided to give this product a try. I was pleasantly surprised. Application was easy, per the instructions. I removed the old liner by running the denture under hot tap water, and working the liner off using a small flat blade screwdriver. There is a little bit of a chemical taste at first, but it dissipates quickly, after a day or 2. I like that the kit contains 2 applications. I plan to keep the denture, in case my fixed bridge ever needs to be removed for repair or maintenance, so it&#x27;s good to know that I have the second application available. I give it a 4 star rating, because I&#x27;m not sure if the liner will actually last 2 years.</li>
    <li> The product worked just it said it would.  I am very satisfied with Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit</li>
    <li> Worked great in my wife&#x27;s dentures.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Works exactly as described. As per other reviewers, strong taste for a few hours then dissipates over the next several days. I followed the manufacturers directions to the letter except I did not bite down firmly, only gently. I still have my temps after two years and I have a lot of space to fill. They now feel like day one again. This product is perfect for me and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. When cured, it is not very soft, but I prefer it that way. It is sand-able to remove any uncomfortable bumps. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> It says it is soft but the product I used turned out hard. It has been on for a month and I don&#x27;t think it will last very long as it is pitting and can be uncomfortable.  I don&#x27;t think this is what the dentists use. I was hoping for a soft reliner  and this isn&#x27;t.  It snugs up the denture somewhat so that part is OK.</li>
    <li> good product and good price. I have relined my dentures for years then all of a sudden the liner kit shot up in price and disappeared,but thanks to Amazon I&#x27;m back in business.</li>
    <li> This is the best I ever used. My plate is so secure.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t found anything better</li>
    <li> This stuff seems it would be toxic to a persons body. Experience with  Reline-it had unplesant taste but it disapated quickly and heldup 2 months and improved fit. I will give this another day or two to see how the fit is however I may not be able to do that because the chemical taste is so bad nothing helps. Mouthwash, water,food, mints, not anything will allow the horrible taste to go away. I believe it will make me sick to my stomach. By this evening if I cannot tell it is better I will have to get it off and I don&#x27;t think I can even stand to look at the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has been no bad painful sting or irritation from it but Oh my gosh the taste is unblievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point one star is all I can do. If I find it better I will rerate it but still the taste is like puting some kind of paint thinner or something in the mouth. UGH!!!!</li>
    <li> 1. The wooden paddle is too wide for consistent mixing in the small container - better to use a plastic soda straw or chopstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I only got one bottle of the clear liquid in the package. Am going to write to perma soft for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Yes, in conclusion, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was in constant pain with my plate rubbing blisters in my mouth before I found this. I was glad it came with 2 sets because being my first time I messed it up so I just scraped it out and did the second one properly. As you have probably read, the taste is atrocious and is rather hard to handle. I poured some vinegar in with my water to soak over night and it all but took the entire taste away. This has taken away any and all need for nasty pastes and powders to hold it in place. It creates a super firm suction that holds noatter what. I was able to eat corn on the cob for the first time in 10 years after I put this in.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that has a plate with no liner.</li>
    <li> It is easy to follow directions.It takes no time to apply. It works and I put less denture cream on my dentures. Sometimes not at all. Depending!! I have two applications in one package. The only problem I had in the beginning that my gums got a little tender at first. But clear up within a few days.</li>
    <li> I ordered a second time after being very satisfied with the first order. The second order arrived and one clear bottle of liquid was broken. I called the 800 number and they immediately sent two additional bottles. Really the post office caused the problem but the perma soft people were very nice. A great product and excellent service is all one can ask. Works great.Nothing available compares.</li>
    <li> easy to use. works as advertised. a nasty, mechanical after taste that quickly dissipates. compared to a trip to the dentist, a wait in their office and a $200 bill this do it at home 20 minute procedure can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I bought this to reline my mom&#x27;s denture without making it necessary to bring her to the dentist&#x27;s office, a trip not easy when you are 94. If you follow the directions carefully, you&#x27;ll wind up with excellent professional results. It has been a week since I relined them and and the reline material appears strong and very sound. I have no doubt this reline will be long lasting. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I did my lower plate first and I thought it was going to be great.  Turned out to be a disaster.  Pain to the max.  Don&#x27;t have it all removed yet, but at least I am back ton where I can use them  if I put poli strips in.</li>
    <li> Way to expensive, I used to use something called Denturite, I bought it in the drugstore and paid under $10.00.  Seems to work the same but at my age I can&#x27;t afford to pay this.</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertized. A waste of money!Go to a dentist and get a reline and be done with it.</li>
    <li> Considering comparison to professional cost for this service,if relativly easy to follow instructions are followed---the results can be very,very good! They were for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this after using DOC Reline-it. This product is far better. I&#x27;m a new denture wearer and I love this product. My dentures fit better now then they did when I got them. It has a slight bad after taste but that went away in a couple hours after a good soak in baking soda and water. Product is easy to clean and now I can eat everything I could eat when I had my real teeth. I will buy this product again when m y next reline is needed. I have had this product installed for a few weeks now and I can still soak my teeth like I did before.</li>
    <li> Repeat customer on this product. I love it !</li>
    <li> Still holding, still working after 2 months.  Great product, saved me a few hundred dollars in dentist bills.</li>
    <li> This product will reline your denture, but it just doesn&#x27;t have staying power!! I needed to change it after only 4 months. Wish a product would last 2 years, but this product isn&#x27;t one of them. If your are in a pinch for money, and the cost of reline is very expensive, for the money, this product will last 1 year, but it will take both applications over a years time. They did lie about the length of time. Disappointing, indeed.</li>
    <li> I love this product it has saved me a lot of money by letting me do what usually runs me anywere from 80 to 100 dollars when I see my Dentist.</li>
    <li> A very nice mix for your dentures...going to order again in awhile</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks like crazy and burns, I will not use it again, better off going to dentist for lining dentures</li>
    <li> Okay product but a bit expensive for what you get... walmart has a like product for considerably less money..  not a good value.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does away with need for dental adhesive.</li>
    <li> Still trying to get it to where there aren&#x27;t any sore spots but I believe that is my fault the product seems to work fine but it dries a little bit harder then what my dentist uses</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted, thank you.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Wouldn&#x27;t matter as the taste is enough to gag a maggot and you&#x27;d want to remove it as fast as possible.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> I give this a high rating because it works as stated. The bad news is it does have a pretty bad taste while it sets up but was well worth the effort. In my case the taste was worst the first few days and lingered for about a week after but now is fine. I did as others suggested and mixed the powder and liquid in a small solo cup that was a bit bigger than the cup that comes with the product but followed the directions as stated on the insert otherwise. Just remember when biting down to set the product you use even pressure and do not bite down too hard to get a good impression. The good news is the product works very well, I have upper and lower plates, had all my teeth pulled about six months ago, started wearing my dentures about four months ago. I used various products the first 3 months with limited results and had a hard time eating. Have had the reline kit installed for a little over a month. I can now wear them with no adhesive at all except when I eat I use just a small amount of Polident powder on the bottom plate, otherwise I just pop them in with no problem at all. The reline is a bit softer than the denture itself so it is a LOT more comfortable and eating is a LOT easier, I had corn on the cob the other day for the first time in many years. My advice is to read all the reviews and research as much as possible, the key is to have the procedure memorized ahead of time. It always helps to have things planned out to get the best results. I am totally pleased and I am glad there were other reviews here to study, so much so that I ordered another kit to have as a backup if needed.</li>
    <li> This product works so well.  I threw my fixodent in the trash.  Mix apply, a quick soak in water and you are like new!  Here is a great tip, the alcohol tastes horrible, so I put my partial quickly after adding the product into saran wrap, then bit down, tiny bit less molding of every nook and cranny of your mouth but still works great for me.</li>
    <li> My husband use many different lines and found this one to work the best so far.  He felt it was easy to mix and stayed in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has had so many problems with his dentures, they were loose even after using cushion grip and denture cream. We read the reviews and questions and answers posted by others here which was very helpful,&lt;br /&gt;He followed the instructions exactly but also took the advice others posted except the one about using plastic wrap, he forgot to do that. Which probably would have helped with the taste. Everything went smoothly except the taste, he said it was horrible, and lasted for a couple of days, It&#x27;s been six months and they still fit tight. He said he would purchase again when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past the taste Perma Soft works great!</li>
    <li> I used this a few days ago and was quite leery about it but it was easy to mix and easy to apply. My dentures fit like new and I saved about $600 to boot. I noticed a strange odor and taste as I was doing this, but they both disappeared in a few minutes. There was absolutely no lingering aftertaste whatsoever. This is a truly remarkable product!</li>
    <li> This is the second time in 3 years that I have gotten your recliners and it has saved me a lot of money that I don&#x27;t have to get new dentures.The reliners can not be found in any drug stores and thank god you have it for people like me. It is good to beable to eat again with out my dentures coming loose and floppy  Than you Amizon</li>
    <li> Excellent product with fast delive</li>
    <li> This product was difficult to work with.  I spent a long time \\&quot;carving\\&quot; it to make my dentures fit properly.  I finally gave up and went to my dentist for relining.  Also, one of the bottles leaked in transit to me.  The company promised to replace it, but I have never received it.</li>
    <li> The taste and odor from this product is unbearable! I would not recommend this under any circumstances! I&#x27;ll go to the dentist for my reline!!</li>
    <li> I had to go to a denture, they fit me with a temps and after a few days it fit very poorly.&lt;br /&gt;Swelling went away etc. I tried powder adhesive which did work, but man messy. I then went to the Seabond pads, that worked well.&lt;br /&gt;After a few more days more changes in my gums and the pads did not work so well any more.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try this product. It was very easy to use, but has an odor kinda like curing fiberglass, and kinda tastes like it too.&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week before the taste and smell were gone. Some have said they gag on it, I had no such problem at all. The trick is do not breath in through your mouth while it sets.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, this little issue is well worth it,,,,, WELL WORTH IT.&lt;br /&gt;My uppers now fit fantastic, now I still have to use a small bit of adhesive but not much, and I can eat anything I want.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product just follow the directions included (kinda hard to them read since the print is pale blue on white but accurate) you will have no problems other than previously mentioned.</li>
    <li> worked wonderfully...it saved the day...</li>
    <li> This product is OK, but I haven&#x27;t yet been able to get it to last 2 years.</li>
    <li> I bought and tryed this because of the reviews I read. I followed the instruction and to start with it burned my gum&#x27;s and after 2 weeks started coming loose, so I done it again and the same results. I would buy it again or recommend it to anyone. Was a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Good product. Better than you find in stores. Delivery was on time. Would use this seller again!!GLAD I was able to finf it on Amazon, my favorite online place to order!!![[ASIN:B00158J0EI Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit--Reline 2 Denture Plates]]</li>
    <li> it wasnt the same permasoft ive been useing ,something is differant or changed ,not as good. dont know what but its just not what im use to from permasoft, only as good now as the cheaper stuff</li>
    <li> The reline kit work very well I was well satisfied</li>
    <li> Is there any way to get rid of the bad taste in the mouth after using perma soft liner,,,,, dianabrooks311@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> Gets the job done at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> have ordered this before but this batch don&#x27;t seem to work as well will probably try something else next time.</li>
    <li> The denture reline kit worked, but only because I took it to my dentist and had him do it for me.  If I had followed the instructions myself, the fill product would have overrun the denture down into my throat, and would have most likely ruined the denture, even if I had managed not to swallow the fill product.  I used it on an upper denture, but I don&#x27;t believe it would have worked any better on a lower denture.</li>
    <li> This was the  first time I have ever tried doing a Reline myself. Needless to say.....I was grossly hesitant! I am a new Widow and am trying to learn how to live poor on one income only and paying $250 to the Dentist just for a reline is no longer realistic. I decided to try Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit on the recommendation of a friend who had used the product themselves.  I did, however along with reading the directions in the kit, go to uTube and watched a few demos then Googled Perma Soft&#x27;s website and viewed their demo and instructions. Permasoft&#x27;s website suggested using petroleum jelly on the teeth and outer gum area which I did. This tibit was not on their insert nor on uTubes demos. The product works great and I have a wonderful reline for a very affordable price! I recommend this product strongly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Perma Soft!</li>
    <li> Excellent I am a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have the money for my denture final fitting which was 1,900.00&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this and it lasts for two years.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions</li>
    <li> Terrible.waste of money</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Goes on easily, the instructions are clear. I would recommend it to my friends. Only one bad thing - nasty tasting, but I imagine that will go away in time. I thought I would have to spend half a day on the job - it took about half an hour.</li>
    <li> It irritated my mouth, and was messy, ran all over my mouth.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t let it set long enough.</li>
    <li> followed the directions and put dentures in. Actually left burns on gums and I salvated so bad burned my lips second degree.</li>
    <li> This product was garbage. The taste was not so terrible but it did nothing. I actually tried it twice thinking that I messed up the first time. The only thing that is messed up is this product.</li>
    <li> this is a life saver. i did not have the money to get my teeth relined. so while i was saving the money up for a reline i used this produce.. iIt worked great.. it to use works well. i glad i found it.</li>
    <li> Key to success is FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER!!!  The 2 rounds of 3 minutes molding to your mouth really suck but worth the great fit afterwards!  Beats giving 5 grand to a dentist!</li>
    <li> This product has worked very good for me. It was very easy yo use and the fit is still good after 4 months</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad who had an unsuccessful reline at his dentist, which only lasted a month or so.  Then I tried to do this product for his denture and it didn&#x27;t last either.  Poor guy, he&#x27;s 89 and his top denture keeps falling down.  What to do, what to do?</li>
    <li> Aside from my lower denture needing relined, I was having an issue with my upper gums receding from my bridge. This left a large gap between my gums and my artificial teeth. It was embarassing and I had to refrain from smiling too big as I did not want anyone to see this gap!&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the relining components, used a small portion in my lower denture and let the remaining amount sit until it was malleable but did not stick to my fingers. I formed it into a thick &#x27;worm&#x27; shape,  pressed it into the gap making sure it wrapped around some of the visible roots of my real teeth. I let it set for the recommended 20 minutes while holding my lip away as a cautionary measure against sticking. I rinsed my mouth with cold water to further set the mixture. I&#x27;m impressed...it looks great and the color really matches my gum tissue.&lt;br /&gt;The next real test is eating. I hope it holds up well.</li>
    <li> I really like  perma soft now my dentures fit more securely</li>
    <li> i bought these and paid more thinking they would last 2 years well they are no different then any others you mix .&lt;br /&gt;my line started breaking away 1 month after i used it.. and i followed directions to the line I have used liners many of times before and know i will never pay more for the same product ..</li>
    <li> I relied heavily on the reviews posted for this product.  I didn&#x27;t expect a lot but felt it was worth a try.  I am astounded!  My dentures fit as well as they did when they were new.  A simple process with great results.  I saved at least $600 by not having to go to the dentist to get them relined.  I am extremely satisfied and am buying another set just in case I can&#x27;t find the product in two years!</li>
    <li> As a two time user I see myself buying some more in the future when I need it. This is the first time that I have tried using half of the kit for a simultaneous reline of my upper and lower plates. It seems to be enough. I now have the left overs to do it again next year. The first time I used it, I felt that I wasted a lot because there was so much excess to trim and clean off. My advice is to try a full installation with half of the kit, and if that doesn&#x27;t do the job well enough, you can always dry the dentures, mix up the other batch, and apply it over  the first installation. I remember the first time I used this ( a year and a half ago) the taste was pretty strong and lasted for a couple of days which felt like forever. Now knowing what to expect, it doesn&#x27;t seem anywhere near as bad.</li>
    <li> It Worked just like it said it would. You Just need to follow the directions. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Tastes terrible until dries. Will recommend to everyone who needs dentures relined.</li>
    <li> Perfect, works great, sets fast but initial odor and taste (which fades quickly) can make you gag</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. WORKES GREAT!</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife. She likes it says it works good and saved me hundreds of bucks for a reline</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Followed the directions - not at all difficult - to get an excellent fit on my upper dentures. I hadn&#x27;t realized how loose they had become until I had the satisfaction of feeling the new security that this liner provided. A real bargain as well.</li>
    <li> In desperation to save my heart health and avoid pain from constant infections I finally had a full mouth removal of my remaining teeth and roots. Extractions had to be made across the border in Mexico because I couldn&#x27;t afford the $7,200 to have it done in the U.S. The lady owner of the Acuna, Mexico, dental clinic lives in Del Rio. She came to to my Del Rio Motel 6 and picked me up in her SUV, took me across to the clinic, and had her Mexican dental lady employee do the work. She later brought me back after having my 5 remaining teeth and 18 roots extraxcted, some of which had to be surgically removed. I was also fitted with a full set of uppers and lowers, all in the same day. Mexican dentists have always been excellent. The lady dentist knew exactly where to inject the novocaine after deadening the penetration areas with a swab so there would be no needle pain. The dental equipment was clean, modern, and surgical masks and gloves were always used. Total cost, including dentures, was only $1,100. I was taken back across the border to my motel with a supply of antibiotics and pain pills. There was virtually no bleeding. They also take credit cards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told to start wearing my plates immediately and to sleep with them in if possible. Well, it wasn&#x27;t possible! (too painful) My gums gradually healed and toughened up, giving me about 60% chewing ability via calloused gumming. I never knew gums could become calloused until I read it in a blog. It&#x27;s been about three months now and I figured it was about time to see if I could reline my acrylic plates. I used Pro Soft gel liners, molding them to my healed gum shapes in hopes I could finally start wearing them. The answer was an emphatic YES! The instructions are OK, but there&#x27;s more a first timer should know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t let complaints about the taste scare you. I&#x27;ve tasted far worse in a dentist&#x27;s office. To me it was something like a mix of strong dental peppermint and how acryllic plastic smellswhen it gets too hot, but not particularly strong or lingering. For me it was completely gone in less than two hours. I did both uppers and lowers at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The instructions tell you to do one plate at a time if you do both uppers and lowers.  I never was one to avoid innovation if I thought it served a purpose. The instructions tell you to mix the goop, put it in one plate, insert the plate, then bite down for three minutes. Someone please tell me how you are supposed to bite down if there are no opposing teeth. I decided to mix, apply, put both plates in my mouth, and have them bite against each other in a natural way. It worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I left both plates in my mouth for four minutes, instead of three, then put them into a dish of cold water, as instructed. After they had \\&quot;cured\\&quot; for 8 or 10 minutes I took them out of the water and with a sharp pen knife trimmed away the excess liner material that had squished out past the plates. When you do this be sure to trim the excess by running the knife so that the liner is sandwiched against the acrylic plate, using the plate as backing so the liner isn&#x27;t pulled away from the acrylic by the knife. Someone suggested using manicure scissors and that sounds even better than a knife. The cured liner will be of the consistency of soft crepe, but not as tough as the crepe on crepe-soled shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Mistakes? Yes I made one in not completely filling the acrylic troughs at the back, resulting in a couple of voids. But they are still very wearable and for the first time comfortable and secure with denture fixative. Today I chewed and swallowed my first soda cracker since having my teeth and roots removed. I confidently look forward to corn chips, hard cookies, and eventually, with practice, maybe even steaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: This stuff is really good, makes my once useless plates wearable, and restores my chewing ability to about 75% of natural teeth. With practice I feel this percentage will improve. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. If you wear both full uppers and lowers I recommend doing them both at the same time. You might benefit from an assistant to mix the goop for one of the plates while you mix goop for the other because mixing this stuff is time critical. You will have about 10 to 20 seconds at optimum consistency to get them into your mouth, adjust, and start biting down so the still pliable lining material can conform to your gum shapes. Be sure to make your bite as close to your normal closed mouth bite as possible, with the upper and lower molar cusps matching and meshing normally as they would with mouth closed and not chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Its been almost a year sense I had to have my teeth removed due to medication .I have tried pretty much everything out there in hopes of  eating a meal without having to stop eating every few bites and rinse and re glue the bottoms.  I will say that it arrived ahead of scheduled. Product was easy to mix , but when I went to try to put it on the denture it ran all over the place my dentures have 2 very short areas on my dentures. but I managed to save some of it, however it did not help my denture to stay in place, I figured I just needed to put more product,  was not sure if I could just add to more to what was  on there so I called customer service at 1.30 pm.  just got a machine which I thought was kinda strange but I left a message and waited for them to call back. I never received a call back until  the next day but by then I had already removed the stuff and used the other container to put on the denture. unfortunately I need more then 1 to make enough for a good grip, what is there does provide more grip then any thing else I have tried, That is why I did the 3 stars, It does have a awful  taste  and is somewhat hard to put in the denture as it will run out in the low spots. But at 30.00 and being on a very tight budget I can not justify buying more in case it does not work well enough. Make sure if you do use it that it is thick enough that it will not run out before you get it in.</li>
    <li> I just received it today and followed the directions (easy as pie) and let me tell ALL of you that if you are in need for a better fit WITHOUT PAIN dentures This WITHOUT A DOUBT is Great (the word great doesn&#x27;t give it justice!). As for the taste many are talking about? Hogwash! Is it the most wonderful taste I&#x27;ve ever experienced?&lt;br /&gt;No. Is it the worst? Absolutely NOT!!! If you NEED painful ill fitting dentures repaired, BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! Bar None!</li>
    <li> They liked it and it came in handy to use. Ordered this product for another person that wanted to try it.</li>
    <li> This is the best denture liner I have ever used. Follow the directions and there should be no problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend.  She had no problems applying it and likes it fine.  Her upper plate was extremely loose but now she can eat about anything.  Would definitely reccommend it.</li>
    <li> They may call this &amp;#34;Perma Soft&amp;#34;; but it is not soft. It dries hard. I removed it a few hours after I applied this product. I ordered Pro Soft next.I  applied it this afternoon.So far, I am pleased with this one. It is comfortable  and was easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I used this product and was careful to read the reviews from others where I gathered good installation tips. Although the process was easy I did not find it actually anything remotely like a re-line process you would expect from the denture studio.  It was very thin and flexible rather than hard and stable. If someone has better experience with this, (in the real world) I would be surprised. As for lasting 2 years I personally can&#x27;t imagine that.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful, if so please check the appropriate box, Thanks.</li>
    <li> My husband tried this after he couldn&#x27;t find any more of the liners he had been using. He likes this product.</li>
    <li> too expensive&lt;br /&gt;too hard&lt;br /&gt;ihad to use both portions to do one denture&lt;br /&gt;very dissatisfied&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy something else from local drug store which turned out to be cheaper and better</li>
    <li> It was way out of date, at least according to the enclosed pamphlet.</li>
    <li> just never set up good. seemed to wear down more everyday and I used the whole pack on one partial. final reordered acryline and one try worked perfect.</li>
    <li> First time using. Pretty good.</li>
    <li> I watched numerous videos on this before I even attempted to try it.  I thought it was great until about 2 weeks later the liner started to come off.  I will try the 2nd application since I only need it for my upper denture.  Hopefully I will have better luck!</li>
    <li> I tried Perma Soft, and I like it. The down side is that during the molding process, it tastes terrible, and the taste lingers. The taste has deminished but is still there therefore giving your food a very different taste.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time, ( Saves Hundreds of $$) No reason to pay huge sums to the Denture company when you can get the same results at home.</li>
    <li> Satisfactory.  Zinc free makes it even more attractive than other similar products.  However, it does not serve the purpose--Mom not happy.  We even tried to help with a second attempt at use and it was not very successful.  Would think twice before reordering.</li>
    <li> perma soft is the answer for those of us without permenant linners</li>
    <li> simply the best.  the taste is not as bad as some have posted. I used this a few months ago and could not be happier with the results. My  10 year old denture fits much better now. I will definitely purchase again when I need it. Just follow the direction and you will be fine. It worked so good I developed a few sore spots on my gums from the tighter fit, just like i did when I first got my denture, but a little benzodent and the sore spots were gone same day.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased. I broke my good set of dentures so I had to drag out my old set. The old set were WAY TO BIG for my gums which had shrunk considerably over the years. I relined the old set of dentures using Perma-soft and they fit GREAT now-even better than the ones I broke!</li>
    <li> I used this for a lower that just refuses to sit still. Apparently it still won&#x27;t. This will definitely improve the hold of a lower but if you&#x27;re looking for it to hold them absolutely still (like an upper) you are likely not going to be satisfied. I&#x27;m just getting used to my lower, so everything seems to be challenging, but I think if your lower doesn&#x27;t fit right, call the dentist/denture specialist you started with and get it resolved.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. Easy to follow instructions. I love the fit. I will  buy this brand again. I love saving money!</li>
    <li> Yes, I bought this in 2009.  My wife and I got our dentures at the same time.  She got hers relined after six months as suggested by the dentist.  They never fit right after.  So I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just as easy to apply as suggested.  Mix, spread, wear, trim.  Yes, the taste is terrible when you do it.  It fades soon enough.  Now, almost four years later, it finally started to bubble up.  So I removed it by using a soft Popsicle stick.  Shouldn&#x27;t have done that. Now the uppers literally fall loose when I talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had a problem with fit. Up until I removed the liner, they fit as well as when the dentures were first fitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m here to order another batch.</li>
    <li> When bone from my hip and rib were placed with the hopes of building forward my facial structure to form dental occlusion where there was none. Due to early extractions all done at the same time allowing no remaining teeth to guide the ones to come and to help the arch to grow instead of shrink, I ended up with a mess I would live with for the rest of my life. The depression,  ignorance on the part of parents who didn&#x27;t think baby teeth were that important [you&#x27;d lose them anyway] . Even the local dentist who came to school that week had some bearing on my situation. He lined up kids in the basement and proceeded to do extractions. I don&#x27;t even recall any numbing taking place. It was complete mayhem as I look back. Eight teeth were removed that day  and four more the next.  I never went to a dentist again until I was in my teens. By then with the war on there was one dentist left to serve the town so only one tooth at the time could be tended to.  When I was 18 I found a dentist who  removed what remained of my uppers and built me a denture that at last made my uppers match my lowers . They were placed in my mouth with orders to not remove them until my visit with him several days later. That was a start. The next installment , if you are really interested, can come later, but I don&#x27;t think you really want to read about it. I deem this product , Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit  to be my personal miracle.</li>
    <li> I like the product,but I don&#x27;t think that it will last up to 2 years.This is a minor issue,would re-reorder again as needed.</li>
    <li> Does Perma Soft work?  I just ate dinner with no problems biting or chewing and NO PAIN for the first time since I&#x27;ve had my dentures! Yes it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had dentures only about 3 months and have never been happy with the fit of the lower plate.  Because of my poor health I have a very hard time getting in to the dentist for relining, so when I saw this product I decided to give it a try.  I first removed the old liner from the lower plate, which is not really necessary as you can apply the Perma Soft liner over the old liner if you like. Following the Perma Soft application instructions I had no problems whatever relining the lower plate.  The plate now fits perfectly with no slippage and, best of all, no pain.  This is indeed a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> instructions not good enough, follow and get poor results, add more time and common sense and get much better results</li>
    <li> Did the job then some. Much better than what the dentist does, without the high cost of a dental bill.  Thanks</li>
    <li> You still need the expert work your dentist does for you, but for a temporary fix you can&#x27;t beat this product. Just follow the easy-to-read instructions and you are back in business with your dentures. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this item yet. I bought it to prepare for the time when I might want a tighter fit.</li>
    <li> The cost of having dentures &#x27;relined&#x27; at your Dentist&#x27;s office is outrageous. You [pay your Dentist&#x27;s office visit, his/hers markup on having the relining done AND you pay for the lab that does the relining. I have done my own, for &#x27;years&#x27;. Only YOU know what is comfortable. You can do your own fine-tuning (shaving the edge with a knife) without making numerous trips to a dentist. I will always do this, as I have always had better results, doing it, myself</li>
    <li> I did not have good luck with this. Not sure if it was me or the product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but my husband has. He used to use Denturite until they quit selling it. When I saw this I thought we could give it a try. He had no problem mixing it and once he got past the taste it molded well. It says it lasts up to 2 yrs but, he doesn&#x27;t think it really will. We&#x27;ll see. I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;m gonna let him do mine or if I&#x27;m gonna go do a reline at the dentist. Probably the dentist for me sense I&#x27;m due for some more dental work on the bottom teeth anyway.</li>
    <li> Does what it claims and works great this is the third time i have ordered it. Recommend it highly. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for several years now, relining my dentures every six to eight months.  The product is durable, and when I follow directions exactly, the result is a very comfortable lined denture.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will. Temporary fix but be careful or you will have bubbles which cause holes.</li>
    <li> It went in well, but it is guaranteed to stay in for two years.  It has been two weeks and it is starting to come out.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially when your gums are still shrinking and once they are done doing that, just apply the reliner again and it lasts for about 2 years. You can&#x27;t beat that for comfort and piece of mind.</li>
    <li> This really lasts two years or even longer. I was checking for my order to get the exact date, but couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. It&#x27;s also a good amount, I just used the second half today and it&#x27;s again perfect. I used some other kit before from the drugstore, but this is much better. This one doesn&#x27;t get bumpy at all. It&#x27;s nice and smooth. I also like that you can work longer with this one. I remember the drugstore brand got hart fast, before it even had time to smooth out. I never got it done from the dentist, but I bet this one gets close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the horrible taste, but putting the dentures in baking soda with a little water helps a bit.</li>
    <li> It made my gums sore.&lt;br /&gt;Does not compare to cushion grip.</li>
    <li> Top notch product! Several dentists thought that my dentures had been relined professionally in-office. Be sure to read review by kone for tips. One more tip: put light coat of vaseline on outside of denture to make it easier to remove squeeze-out. BTW I use a Dremel to remove any high spots on hard acrylic denture base before relining them.</li>
    <li> Terrible did not work at all, immediately came off totally waste of time and money. Permanent soft denture liner kit,&lt;br /&gt;Inferior ptoduct</li>
    <li> Product came within days, works great, although the only problem I had was with the original taste the first couple days. Taste wore off after a couple days and now all is good.</li>
    <li> worst product EVER!!!!!! do not buy! Does not work! This crap will ruin your dentures and your teeth for days!follow the instructions to the T and did not work at all plus you cannot get the taste or chemical burn out of your mouth for days not to mention the smell it leaves in your house!! do not waste your time or money! Go to Walmart and purchase something cheaper it sure as hell can&#x27;t be any worse!!!! I would give this product negative stars if I could. I wish I would have read the recent reviews instead of the older &amp;#34;most helpful&amp;#34; reviews before buying!! buyer beware worst $30 I ever spent</li>
    <li> The only draw back is my breath smells and my mouth tastes like I ate a nail salon.LOL. Any one familiar with acylic nails will recognize the smell. Even if take a few days to fade it is well sorth it. Great fit.Saved me lots of bucks. Good stuff</li>
    <li> Wonderful product ! Have told several friends about it, I&#x27;m sure they will be ordering it also ! Ordered some for a friend</li>
    <li> It gives me the fit I need for my denture without the outrageous cost a dentist charges. It gives me back my smile.</li>
    <li> It was a little gritty, and the chemical taste was so strong,I almost couldn&#x27;t stand it. It felt like my gums were burned, I would not buy this again. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I will never pay a dentist for relines again.</li>
    <li> good enough for what it&#x27;s for. This is for temp and should only be used for such. They don&#x27;t have an online dentist yet.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife who was having trouble with dentures slipping now they don&#x27;t she absolutely loves them she can eat normally and she is loving it  thanks</li>
    <li> This was something my husband had me order for him. Normally he bought the generic Walgreens kits for like $6, which he got two uses out of. He was using a lot at the time because they were new dentures and his gums were still shrinking/healing, so he had to constantly realign to keep them fitting right. He ended up not liking this Perma Soft kit. He said it burned on forming/molding, tasted horrible, and was uncomfortable on his gums. It was only about two weeks before he couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and searched the local Walgreens until he found one that had the store brands in stock.</li>
    <li> Only complaint was the taste but it went away in a few days. I would recomend it to everyone. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> the liner has a very offensiye tasteand odor. It was also dificult to use properly in molding to my gum. Greatly disappointed</li>
    <li> Been using this for years it works great mine lasted 3 years.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work very well for the price you can buy much better a lot cheaper</li>
    <li> Only four stars as I&#x27;ve only had the denture in for five hours, if it stays this way I give it the fifth star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lower full denture is about four years old, and the gums and bone have shrunken back making it ill fitting. A dental reline is expensive, so I have been using a product meant as an adhesive - Cushion Grip thermoplastic adhesive. It conforms to the shape of the gums and is supposed to last about four days. It does that, but one then gets bacterial problems as one doesn&#x27;t take the denture out. I then went to using the Cushion Grip and removing the denture at night, but then one has to use Polygrip or another adhesive when putting it back in as the thermoplastic doesn&#x27;t really set as a \\&quot;reline\\&quot;.Every four days I had to heat the thermoplastic tube and reline the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Perma-Soft worked beautifully, had my dinner tonight without any \\&quot;glue\\&quot; as the suction of the perfect fit held the denture. I expect that won&#x27;t last, I&#x27;ll have to put a bit of Polygrip adhesive on the denture as my gums continue to change shape, but that is no problem. This will not last the two years as advertised, nor will a dentist&#x27;s relining if you are of an age. The reline may last, but the gums will change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on this, even if I hit the lottery and could afford the dentist I&#x27;d stick with this. It gives me the control over my own mouth. If I have clamped down too heavily while setting it I can just do it again. At $25 for each kit of two applications I can redo it 20 times for the price of one dental reline of $250. It is far superior to the thermoplastic, as that doesn&#x27;t set permanently and needs to be redone every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the matter of the taste while setting in the mouth, the instructions dictate two 3 minute sessions to set the shape, then 20 minutes to let it cure. I can stand a bad taste for 3 minutes, in my 77 years I&#x27;ve had a lot more bad tastes in my mouth. A good mouthwash kills the taste as soon as one takes the denture out for its external curing. There was no taste from it once the process was completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best, Jonnture out for its external curing. There was no taste from it once the process was completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best, Jon</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my father and he loved it!! I would defiantly recommend this product for anyone that needs to have thier dentures adjusted. It beets pay $350 at the Dentist.</li>
    <li> I was all ready to order this product and then decided to read all of the reviews.  Overwhelmingly, the people who have used this product seem very pleased with the results, which is very encouraging.  However, I have to say that I&#x27;m just about to the point of being scared off from ordering it (need it desperately for a VERY poorly fitting lower denture that has already undergone at least 4 soft relines by my dentist), number one due to virtually every single review (good ones as well as bad ones) referencing the horrible, nasty taste.  I am VERY sensitive to bad tastes and smells, and am terrified of having vomiting induced by the nasty smell/after-taste (it doesn&#x27;t take much in the way of a malodorous/bad-tasting food, medicine, etc. to cause my stomach to do flip-flops).  Secondly, despite having not had any bottom teeth for many, many years, I am still prone to getting sore spots on my lower gum that sometimes take up to weeks to heal, and I often am forced to have to go without being able to wear my lower denture until the spot heals and have to live on soups and very soft foods in the meantime.  I have read review upon review about how much this product hardens up and appears to help cause sore spots.  Now, I simply don&#x27;t know what to do.  I don&#x27;t have dental insurance, and my dentist keeps pushing for me to get implants, which are financially totally out of the question, and I&#x27;m now retired and on a fixed income and can&#x27;t even afford visits to the dentist for relines any longer.  I feel like I&#x27;m between a rock and a hard place and just don&#x27;t know what the right thing is to do.  I would appreciate any comments that might help me decide definitely one way or the other as to whether or not to order this product and give it a try.  Thank you.[[ASIN:B00158J0EI Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit--Reline 2 Denture Plates]]</li>
    <li> The reline kit works good it stays in for a long time&lt;br /&gt;I use it for the uppers about a year ago and still working</li>
    <li> Item is as says, great price it beat going to the dentist and paying 3 to 4 hundred dollars to have them do what I can do myself. Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this once before and really liked it.  This time I did not like it at all!! Will not use again.</li>
    <li> I have used Perma-Soft Denture Reliner in the past, and it worked for about a year. This time I ordered it again, happy with previous experience. It didn&#x27;t do nearly as well, and it burned my tongue as well. It&#x27;s great if you need a temporary fix, say for 3 months, but cannot replace a proper reline by a good dentist.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know what i did wrong, but i hated it, the taste, the smell, it didn&#x27;t set right, went down the back of my throat made me gag and vomit. never tried the second application due to it being so disgusting..</li>
    <li> beats going to a dentist sets up and hardens just like you wnet in and had them done by a dentist. So has lasted about two years, like the instructions said time to get more and reline again. no more paste after using this stuff.</li>
    <li> Tastes awful for over a month.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years now. Dentist wants over $300 a pop per plate: Highway robbery. This stuff is great! Just follow the easy instructions and save a bundle of money. Takes a total of about 15 minutes from start to finish.</li>
    <li> pretty bad taste. don&#x27;t think I would want to use it again</li>
    <li> I like the Perma Soft Reliner kit for my denture and it is very easy to use and mix up. It saves me a lot of money from going to a dentist to get a relining.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible, especially the taste.  I would like to return one of the kits that I ordered.  Carolyn Henry</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Easy to use and maintain. Will buy again when needed. No bad taste with this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Does not last longer than a week.  I have used Perma Soft before and was totally satisfied with it until now.  Something is different about it - don&#x27;t know exactly but I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> If you cannot afford to have your dentures relined this is the way to go. It does not last for two years, more like six months. So I would advise buying two. The smell and taste is awful but it does work in a pinch.</li>
    <li> worked great for me.  cannot afford the professional dentist prices. of dentures. relining etc. easy directions to follow have had other reliner does not last. this one as easy to use and can tell it is going to be as comfortable and  last much longer, like professional dentures that last for years.  AMEN!!</li>
    <li> My husband spent a lot of money for the dentures he has.  The dentist offered a 1 time soft liner which he had done not to long after getting the dentures new.  For the past 2 years he has been having a real difficult time with the bottom dentures.  He has gone through many tubes of Fixodent and Cushion Grip.  The latter was suppose to last 4 days but not with his.  About a year ago I suggested Perma Soft Denture Reliner but he was skeptical and would not even consider it.  He was afraid of ruining the expensive dentures.  Well a year later he ordered it.  So far he has only done the bottom denture (the top fits fine with the cushion grip) There was one small area that was rubbing on an already tender area.  He bought a fine file and over a 4 days little at a time period got the bottom denture to fit just right. The dentist wanted close to $1000 to reline both.  A low income dental clinic wanted $300.  We are on a very low fixed income sot this product was a real blessing.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and seems to be the best item of this ilk that he can find.  Will purchase more as needed.</li>
    <li> Extractions and Dentures in March 2012.  Cost $9500 after insurance.  I had purchased this product about two months ago but scared to use.  Went to dentist two weeks ago because dentures were very loose couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and using a tube of adhesive a week.  Well, dentist said a reline wouldn&#x27;t work and the best thing would be implants...to the tune of $11,000 out of pocket.  Decided to use the Perma Soft....yes it smelled, yes it tasted awful and even made me gag (did upper and lowers same time) but one hour later my dentures fitting so much better.  I still have to use adhesive but just a little bit dab on the ends...and last all day.  Its only been 4 days but very happy with the product.  If you can just put up with smell and taste for a day you&#x27;ll be loving it.  ...hmmmm $24.95 or $11,000....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 2013 -  It&#x27;s been a month and changing my review to 5 star.  To me its been a life saver.  Don&#x27;t know if it will last 2 years but if only 6 months...still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 2013 -  It&#x27;s now been two months.  And still working great..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 2013 - Well, I think its time to do it again.  Still working but the bottom a little looser than I like.  Hopefully getting whats still on denture plates will come off easily.  But on the whole this has been the best product for denture fitting.  1 year it lasted...that&#x27;s fantastic.  This a 10 star product.</li>
    <li> Similar methacrylate to that used to make dentures. If directions are followed it works extremely well in bringing ill fitting (and uncomfortable) dentures back to a satisfactory functional fit. This method of relining (or any other DIY method) is not a substitute for having new impressions and new dentures made by a dentist or denturist (if legal in your area) if you&#x27;ve had your dentures for some time and they no longer fit correctly. The gums (alveolar ridges) do change over time and the degree of change is dependent upon a number of factors which are outside the scope of this review. However with that said, this product can extend the useful life of dentures and works as claimed by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have been using ,Perma Soft for about 3 years, I once tried a cheaper version, but was to afraid to put it on my denture. Here are some of the secrets that have kept my dentures in my mouth with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the taste.  Yes, it has a terrible taste.  Once I have completed all the steps, I put salt water in my denture tub and let it soak while, about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, removing for next fitting.  If you saw when you were originally getting your dentures.  The dentist using a dremel style tool, to do any adjustments.  I went and purchased a dremel, and sand down a majority of the old batter.  Just don&#x27;t go crazy, use low speed.  I feel the dremel was worth the investment, since I will be doing this for a long time, and it is important to make sure my teeth are fitted comfortably.  You can also make any adjustments as needed, again use low speed.  I use to use a emery board, but it was difficult to get that small uncomfortable spots.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, very quick not messy simply mix sit pour. Perma Soft makes it easy to get a tight fit on your dentures.</li>
    <li> HAS A STRANGE ODOR . WHY DO I HAVE TO USE MORE WORDS THAT I WANT TO  THAT IS WHY IT TOOK ME SO LOMG TO REVIES.</li>
    <li> Did not work well on bottom denture. Seems to be doing ok on the top. Not too sure if it is going to last for 2 years though. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> So far so good i only used for on month but it seem to be doing the job.</li>
    <li> It is a good product.</li>
    <li> I followed instructions, smelled horriable,and kinda burned my mouth,removed the crap from my denture. Now four days later, I&#x27;m still smelling and tasting that chemical. Wish I could turn back the clock, WOULD NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. Really want to know if this is really is FDA approved.</li>
    <li> My dentures are less than 4 years old. I had some problems with the upper not fitting properly. I went to a dentist and they wanted me to purchase a new set of dentures. The price was just over $2,000.00. I told them that I only wanted the upper one replaced, and they said that they needed to fit properly with the lower, therefore needing a new set. I really only wanted the upper re-lined. I am so happy that I found the Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit. The price of less than $30.00 is much better than $2,000. I am so happy, Oh, I think I just said that. Yes, I am so happy with the results. I would recommend this to anyone. Doug, Fort Myers, Florida</li>
    <li> It works; it&#x27;s easy; it&#x27;s affordable. What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m well pleased with this product. It was easy to mix and easy to apply.  Now I have a snug fit. The material is also light weight so I don&#x27;t feel like I have a dinner plate stuck to the roof of my mouth. There is a chemical smell and taste but it is no worse than the stuff the dentist uses. I am glad I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> I recieved this yesterday and it couldn&#x27;t have come too soon.  Mixed it up as soon as I thoroughly read the instruction sheet, applied it and for the first time in 2 months, my teeth don&#x27;t hurt me.  We went out last night and had supper which was scary since I didn&#x27;t have my teeth glued in and I ate just fine.  I only applied it to my bottom plate as that is the one that I have so much trouble with.  It saved me about $60 for a new reline at a low cost dental clinic.  If I can do it right anyone can do it.....</li>
    <li> will purchase again works great</li>
    <li> Excellent product just like the dentists use. I find the instructions very hard to read. i recommend that you go on line and download the videos associated with this product especially how to remove the product once it sets and doesn&#x27;t fit..</li>
    <li> It is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;😊</li>
    <li> Easy to use and last for a long time. Much cheaper then going to a dentist with the same results</li>
    <li> The relining is very comfortable having used this for about 8 weeks .  It will not last me for 2 years unless I store somewhere unused.  It is still better than anything I have found on the market and will, if available, order again when needed.</li>
    <li> I have relined my dentures 3 times now over the last 5+ years.  This product works well if you follow the instructions carefully. I love the money it allows me to save by not having to use a dentist to do the very same thing.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for me.  Thank you</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS....</li>
    <li> This really works well, the taste is somewhat hard to swallow, but it does  last for a long while, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> What can one say bout temporary home relining? It is not lab-based relining. Better than tube goo, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for the life of a denture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this several times, it works very well. Easy to apply, instructions enclosed, long lasting.</li>
    <li> so-so not overly pleased it did help a little bit not what I expected</li>
    <li> thank you .Art hudson</li>
    <li> My husband loved this product before he passed away.</li>
    <li> Relining material did not adhere to bottom denture to  enough to form a secure hold. Container contains more material then required for either a upper or lower denture.Nneed to adjust amounts SO THAT THERE IS LESS WASTE OR SUFFICIENT AMOUNT TO COMPLETE A COMPLETE SET OF DENTURES IN ONE SET.</li>
    <li> Definitely not as easy as described. I followed the instructions to the letter and it did not hold the teeth.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband&#x27;s dentures.  I was afraid to mess up while applying the liner, but it was really easy.  Yes, as others have said, he told me it tasted nasty, but that only lasted for about 24 hours.  He says his dentures fit perfectly again, don&#x27;t move around in his mouth like they did before.</li>
    <li> saved me a hell of a lot of money and easy to do! Dentist is like on the $300 an hour plan and he never rushes</li>
    <li> I tried soaking my dentures for about a week in baking soda and I changed the baking soda at least once per day, but there&#x27;s no getting rid of that awful smell and taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to get it off, though, by soaking my dentures in scalding hot water and peeling the stuff off. After you do that, though, you will still have a very, thin film of the stuff still on your dentures. I finally got rid of every last, little bit of it (at least I think I did) by scraping the rest of it with toothpicks. I probably went through over a dozen of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how good it feels to be rid of that stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been having problems with my dentures fitting properly for a while.  I had been useing a product over the counter until they took it off the shelves.  I am glad that I found this product.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use. Good instructions and it cost less than me going to the dentist to have it done. Yes, I would recommend this product to anyone who has dentures and has to have them relined all the time. The only bad thing is....it leaves a horrible taste in your mouth for about 2 to 3 hours afterwards. Not as bad as the dentists does.</li>
    <li> this liner bubbles up and hardens leaving sharp spots that cut into your gums. Hard to remove once it sets. Will not use my other container of it.</li>
    <li> My dentures are about 10 years old and were made so I could snap them in.  Unfortunately that process never worked and left me with the upper post but no bottom to snap into.  Since day one I have always had to use paste to hold them in and over the years, where we attempted to put in the bottom holder, the denture had worn and I had holes.  I have constantly used temporary filling material to fill the holes and they would only last a couple of days (and that product is relatively expensive).  After reading the reviews, I decided to try this product.  WOW!  Not only are the holes permanently filled, I don&#x27;t have to use any paste at all.  They actually fit better than they ever did - even when I first got them.  The taste wasn&#x27;t that bad - the stuff the dentist uses is as bad or worse.  And after two days I don&#x27;t taste it at all.  While removing some of the old material, I got nervous because the holes became fairly large and I knew if this stuff didn&#x27;t work I would be in big trouble.  I do a lot of public speaking and can&#x27;t afford the time to be without my dentures for work.  I just followed the directions and it worked just as it claimed.  I HIGHLY recommend this product, I can pop my dentures in and out when necessary and they are tough enough to eat anything without fail.</li>
    <li> It was easy to mix and fix to the 2 plates.  It has been about a month and they still seem to be pretty good as far as fit.  I no longer have to use the paste.</li>
    <li> I had multiple extractions done at the same time.  I am a professional who needs to talk, be understood and look professional to the public. This product has saved my ability to work.  I have used it for many years and will continue to use it.  Thank God for this product.  No adverse reactions noted.</li>
    <li> This is the most horrible chemical I have ever put in my mouth. I used this on my wifes upper plate since her gums are shrinking due to liver disease and I may have done her more harm than good.  This stuff should be banned as a health hazard.  I will be looking into this chemical ethyl methacrylate used as the curing agent.  I have some chemical experience and I was appalled at how bad it was to smell, much less taste.</li>
