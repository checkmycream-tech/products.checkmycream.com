      <li>I used leave-in creams for most of that time, but I found love in this tub of gel.  </li>

      <li>and this is hands down the best product out there.</li>
      <li>In conclusion, its amazing, cheap and probably the only thing i will now use on my hair as far as gel, perfect!</li>
      <li>If you have fine, relaxed hair like mine, do not use this product.</li>
      <li>My daughter and myself both used this product and find it light and easy to use and not caking on the hair, a product that we will get again.</li>
      <li>I give this product 4 stars because even though it is amazing, it can be flaky if you use too much.</li>
      <li>(yes, i know its deep conditioner) loved it over sheas, but the smell was too strong</li>
      <li>finally, was able to find something that I love!</li>
      <li>Now before I get yall excited I must say that it depends on the quality/condition your hair is in.</li>
      <li>Smells really clean.  </li>
      <li>I am hispanic &amp; have thick curly hair &amp; it is the best gel i&#x27;ve tried EVER.</li>
      <li>It keeps my edges lain &amp; gives me great hold without the drying effect of other gels that contain alcohol.</li>
      <li>I crunched my hair and it helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>The reasonable price of this product makes it easy to try them all.</li>
      <li>My hair took very well to it in certain places more than others.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok if your natural.</li>
      <li>just, overall thrilled.</li>
      <li>Honestly if you are looking for a great gel, you cannot go wrong with ecostyler.</li>
      <li>I have found it that I have to use this product in conjunction with other curl gel to get more curls at the top of my hair.</li>
      <li>I really love this gel because it really works on natural hair.</li>
      <li>It keeps it very much in place.</li>
      <li>I dont like hard gels so this worked out great for me.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;nice texture&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>Purchased this also with the Olive Oil ECO and love em equally.  </li>
      <li>The next day I will spritz my hair with a water/oil mix and apply a bit more to awaken my curls after I&#x27;ve slept on them.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow</li>
      <li>I bought this hair gel a few weeks ago because i have been hearing a lot of good things about Argan oil.....</li>
      <li>(To me as long as your hair is healthy</li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying to find this gel on foot first.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>REALLY?????</li>
      <li>I really like that it leaves no flakes</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sticking to it; not switching very soon....</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t really flaky like the olive oil ecostyler gel.</li>
      <li>I REALLY LUV THIS GEL, IT&#x27;S</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have much hold</li>
      <li>Product is good but the size was smaller than expected when the jar arrived here in Okinawa.  </li>
      <li>The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
      <li>and it had the exact same ingredients for more than double the price.  </li>
      <li>If you want something cheap, that does an AMAZING job, while being mindful of the care of your hair, you really can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
      <li>I love amazon and it is definitely my go to place to get items cheaper, but this is definitely not one of them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It goes on to wet hair the best, but I have applied to dry hair without trouble.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not flaky. But did not lie my baby hair down</li>
    <li> I love this gel. But save your money and go to your local beauty supply store. This size is only $1.99!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been naturally curly since 2008 and this is hands down the best product out there. I used leave-in creams for most of that time, but I found love in this tub of gel.  I literally want to throw away all my other stuff!!  It is that good.  No flakes, leaves hair nice and shiny and has great hold over multiple days.  It goes on to wet hair the best, but I have applied to dry hair without trouble.  The reasonable price of this product makes it easy to try them all.</li>
    <li> Love this gel in my hair</li>
    <li> Good on 4a/b/c hair, swoop those edges up and it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> I love this product it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch and it made my hair shinny and moist!!</li>
    <li> Smells really clean.  Works to create nice waves and curls in my hair, long-lasting curls.</li>
    <li> I love the original eco styler, but this one holds just as well. This is excellent for defining my natural curl pattern, it doesn&#x27;t flake and it smells good!  You do have to be careful about what you use with this gel to keep white residue from forming in the hair.  The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
    <li> Holds my thick, relaxed hair well, especially the edges and last all day in this Southwestern heat, don&#x27;t need a lot and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or flake or seem-whitish on my black hair</li>
    <li> Honestly if you are looking for a great gel, you cannot go wrong with ecostyler. The olive oil is the best formula though. But they all are really good it doesn&#x27;t matter which one you choose ecostyler just nails it when it comes to hair gel.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair gel.  The picture may be misleading if you do not pay attention to the description.  This is an 8 oz. jar.  The picture is showing the 32 oz I believe.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves product</li>
    <li> A little disappointed</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description close enough and purchased for the size viewable (looks like 16oz bottle container in pic.) The product is great but I felt mislead (my fault b/c I compared photos and not written description)</li>
    <li> Bought this in store &amp; I love it! It keeps my edges lain &amp; gives me great hold without the drying effect of other gels that contain alcohol. It was my 1st tub &amp; I&#x27;m sticking to it; not switching very soon....if ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair gel a few weeks ago because i have been hearing a lot of good things about Argan oil.....worse mistake ever! This gel dried out my hair and made it very hard, which led to it becoming brittle and breaking. It also cause a lot of gunk to cake up in my hair after a few uses. If you have fine, relaxed hair like mine, do not use this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day on my natural hair.  Im not sure what type of hair I have but I can say that its kinky in some areas, wavy, and tight/coily, all at the same time.  I agree with the other reviews that this product will cause your hair to become hard and dry.  But, that is only if you use it alone.  Everytime I apply this gel to my hair I like to add a few drops of castor oil.  When you rub it in your palms, the color of the gel goes from clear to cloudy.  That&#x27;s how I know I have enough.  Together the end result is pretty nice. It defines my curls and they hold well.  I receive compliments on my hair being shiny and soft and a &amp;#34;nice texture&amp;#34;.  (To me as long as your hair is healthy it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;nice texture&amp;#34;).  Sometimes i&#x27;m asked what products do I use and most find it hard to believe that it&#x27;s not a high dollar brand.  The next day I will spritz my hair with a water/oil mix and apply a bit more to awaken my curls after I&#x27;ve slept on them.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, it&#x27;s a great product that doesn&#x27;t cost much ($2.99 for 8 oz. @ local dollar store).  I tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s similar product (not sure of the name but it bragged on not producing &amp;#34;roman noodle-like&amp;#34; curls) and it had the exact same ingredients for more than double the price.  Anyway, this combined with the castor oil (about $2-3 @ dollar store)j works well enough for me.  Give it a try and see.  I&#x27;ve tried Kinky Curly, Miss Jessies, Twister Sister, and, Shea Moisture but I went back to this.  (i&#x27;m still looking too..</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel I&#x27;ve used in a long time. It smells really good, it makes your hair smooth. I really like that it leaves no flakes and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard. The seller shipped it very fast, it was a good shopping experience. No problems, seller was great!</li>
    <li> Nice hold, doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out &amp; great smell.</li>
    <li> Its a nice gel. Depending on your hair type. It Works well in my mother&#x27;s natural hair but leaves my relaxed hair dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> The gel holds well, but if you have dark hair, it will leave flakes once the gel dries and you comb or brush over it. Other than that, it will hold your hair in place.</li>
    <li> This makes my curls pop! I use it for my wash and go, after applying olive or coconut oil to my wet hair,</li>
    <li> Just got minimal flaking the day after us when I went to comb it out. Oiled my scalp and hair, then straightened on a medium setting electric straightening comb. Et Viola!! No problems.</li>
    <li> I dont like hard gels so this worked out great for me.  I like soft gels that dont leave alot of residue, and this one doesnt.</li>
    <li> I love eco styler gel and I fell in love with the argan formula. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like most gels and this product worked well with my hair unfortunately my texture changed and I can&#x27;t do a damn thing with it. But this was my go to gel no alcohol and a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I like this. It has fairly good hold.</li>
    <li> I bought Eco Styler Moroccan Argan Oil Styling Gel about 3 weeks ago after going though the &amp;#34;Big Chop&amp;#34;. My cousin who cut my hair for me from being badly damaged from over processing my hair used this gel to give me some curls. My hair took very well to it in certain places more than others. The top of my hair is very thick so I must had quite a bit of gel to get even the smallest amount of curls. From the back of my hair and the edges, I definitely got defined curls without hardly any hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is light, not flaky and smell amazing. I love the smell. The bottle is 32oz so you get quite a bit of gel that should last you a few months even if you use this on a daily bases which leads me to my next point. I have found it that I have to use this product in conjunction with other curl gel to get more curls at the top of my hair. I am using it on a daily bases because my curls do not last throughout the night, however, since this is large jar, it&#x27;s not really and issue. This also doesn&#x27;t mean this is how other people who use this product have experienced it. Some may find they only need to use it once ever few days. That however has not been my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with this product is it add no shine or moisture to your hair. It is not that my hair is try when I touch it but it does look dry and I do add quite a bit of natural oils such as jojoba, shea, olive, almond, just to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is decent but I will continue to search for other curling activators to give me exactly what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> once I received my package the lid was broken &amp; the gel was all over the inside but I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I noticed it was packed in a bubble wrap in an envelope instead of a box</li>
    <li> Seriously???? REALLY????? finally, was able to find something that I love! So, I love trying new products on my hair, but i aways read reviews on amazon to see what the verdict is first (with any product really, a simple check of reviews at the store, on my phone helps save money, and disappointment!). Ive used shea curl souffl&amp;eacute; and didn&#x27;t like it, did nothing for me. I then went to organics hair mayonnaise as a styler (yes, i know its deep conditioner) loved it over sheas, but the smell was too strong so i have been on the look for something new. I seen a lot of really amazing reviews on this product and was like cool, ill keep my eye out. I seen it today, at my local sallys and thought i have to try it! It came to 5.62 for a 32 oz!!!! Tried it as soon as i got home, and wow. I am so amazed, in love and just, overall thrilled. I am biracial and my hair is very curly and usually, my hair gets frizzy throughout the day, and i often have to spruce my hair to get the curls back. With this, all i did was spritz some water on my hair, add the gel and INSTANT curls, volume, shine all the above! I crunched my hair and it helped tremendously. And i did not even use a lot, (not that it matters since the tub is huge!) If you want something cheap, that does an AMAZING job, while being mindful of the care of your hair, you really can&#x27;t go wrong here. But like all the other reviews, go to the store, its so much cheaper there! In conclusion, its amazing, cheap and probably the only thing i will now use on my hair as far as gel, perfect!</li>
    <li> This gel is phenomenal. I am hispanic &amp; have thick curly hair &amp; it is the best gel i&#x27;ve tried EVER. Doesnt dry me out, holds curl which later softens after hair dries. Just love it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gave 3 stars because this is 8oz for about $8.....i just happened to stroll into a beauty supply and found a 24oz for only $2.99!!!!!!!!!! I love amazon and it is definitely my go to place to get items cheaper, but this is definitely not one of them. I highly recommend trying to find this gel on foot first.</li>
    <li> I bought a 5 pound jar of this gel from a local beauty supply! I love it! It isn&#x27;t really flaky like the olive oil ecostyler gel. This one doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel all crunchy, but soft. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this gel I have kinky frizzy hair and work in humid conditions. It holds my hair for atleast  two days before reapplication. Love this Gel!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product worked really well on my natural, curley, kinky type of hair. It&#x27;s not oily and does not leave any residue.</li>
    <li> Love it  Nice shine, Smell great, less frizz, Good 4 hour hold, Good on all hair types. Great buy Awesome staple</li>
    <li> Good texture, odorless and non sticky, will order again.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice!!!  It seems to dry my hair out, and I do use it sparingly!  I plan to return this to the merchant.</li>
    <li> Purchased this also with the Olive Oil ECO and love em equally.  No build up, no flakes, non sticky.  Nice and refreshing on my hair.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t have the hold I was hoping for so I have to use more than anticipated.  I doubt I will purchase again.  If you don&#x27;t want super definition but more of a loose curl, this would be perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok if your natural.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LUV THIS GEL, IT&#x27;S UNLIKE ANY I&#x27;VE USED...IT WORKS WELL ON MY CURLS, IT&#x27;S  NOT STIFF OR STICKY &amp; IT SMELLS GOOD! I DON&#x27;T USUALLY USE GEL ON MY HAIR SINCE I STOPPED 20+ YRS AGO BUT THIS STUFF IS SOOO MUCH BETTER!</li>
    <li> Excellent product w/o the straight board stiffness.</li>
    <li> I really love this gel because it really works on natural hair. It keeps it very much in place.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product negative stars I would!  I love the eco styler olive oil brand, but Argan oil does not agree at all with my transitioning hair.  It left my hair very dry and brittle with white gunk in it.  It was so bad for me after one use, I had to wash it out.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I use it in conjunction with Long Aid curl activator gel (4:1 ratio of ECO to Long Aid), which makes my hair shine and last for days. If it matters, I have naturally curly hair with a 3c/4a curl pattern.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because the item was already open and damaged when I received it(i got a refund) or if that&#x27;s just how it is. Overall I&#x27;m just trying to get rid of it right now. I&#x27;m trying the other ecostyler gels out but will not purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> It goes on light, not sticky, does not leave hair hard and flaky like other store gels. I will be ordering their other styling gels.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, because it was so cheap, but alas it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for my hair. Whenever I put it on my hair it seems to glide on like it&#x27;ll dry smooth, but once dry it leaves me with dehydrated stiff curls. The hold is good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for the health of my hair. It&#x27;s just way too drying.</li>
    <li> I liked the way it kept my curls but I did not like the  buildup the next day. Still I would recommend this product. The style kept well and it wasn&#x27;t crunchy like I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Product is good but the size was smaller than expected when the jar arrived here in Okinawa.  I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this gel! It is good for any type of hair and the products in it are things used to help grow hair. Like the morrocan argan oil. I ran into this gel by accident and I used for about 3-4 weeks and saw a MAJOR difference in my hair. My hair was healthier and it began to grow faster. Now before I get yall excited I must say that it depends on the quality/condition your hair is in. Mine was breaking off and had a few split ends. I give this product 4 stars because even though it is amazing, it can be flaky if you use too much. For example if you are someone who washes your hair every 2 weeks, then you would have to wash it every other week. But that is for gel in general unless you get an aloe based one which tends to not be as flaky.</li>
    <li> The wife wears her hair naturally and uses this everyday. She calls it her hair crack! Lol.</li>
    <li> was not a great buy it leaves white residue in my hair..I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ll have to try it wit different styles and it doesn&#x27;t have much hold</li>
    <li> I use this for roller sets and Bantu Knot Outs my go to gel. It is hard hold and gives great hold, shine and definition to my African American curly hair,m. Have used for was n go&#x27;s and it is ok but I like more for setting my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter and myself both used this product and find it light and easy to use and not caking on the hair, a product that we will get again.</li>
    <li> Nice. Thicker than the other eco styler gels.</li>
    <li> This hair gel is the only one to use if you want hold without the sticky goop!! Hair stays soft AND styled.</li>
