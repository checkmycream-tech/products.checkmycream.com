<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and it is awesome she  has thick hair and with her old one she had to do about 5-7 lairs but now she only has to do it about 2-4 lairs! this is a great product and I recommend that you get  it!</li>
    <li> Flat iron didn&#x27;t even work, then when we tried returning it it was a huge deal and almost impossible. Deffiently a fake CHI and I recommend not getting this product ever. Also there is no setting to adjust the heat and it doesn&#x27;t even say how hot it is. Ceramic plates are not the way to go, they just ruin your hair. Go with titanium</li>
    <li> Product arrived when they said it would. Product is in good condition, still working well.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this pink Chi for my daughter in April, and used hers for awhile, and I liked it so much, I ordered another one in June!!!</li>
    <li> Just as described with fast deliver.  This was a birthday gift for my daughter.  She loved my Chi flat iron and asked for one as part of her birthday gift.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product by day 3 just as promised and it arrived in perfect condition. I plugged it in and it worked like a charm heating up very fast in less than one minute. It also straightened my hair very well and has also curled it well too. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it kind of catches on my hair every once in a while as I am pulling it down through my hair. I had another chi before this one that I bought and used for about 5 years and it never pulled on my hair. I&#x27;m not sure exactly why it does that on this one but didn&#x27;t do that on my old one. But other than that small problem that does not happen all the time anyways it has been wonderful. I would definatly buy from her again!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved her HOT PINK Chi flatiron - it was also really good price compared to others.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product 2 weeks ago. Still hasnt shipped and after repeated emails I still havent recieved a response from seller on the status of this order, poor customer service. Will not use them again</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and received it very quickly. The item failed after 30 days and I contacted the seller to arrange a return and replacement. 3 months later and I still have not received a refund or a replacement item. Do not order from this seller. Now my emails are unanswered.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift because that&#x27;s what my 12 year old wanted.  If she had this brand named product her world would be right.  The problem; this product was nothing but a brand name.  She has had hair straighteners purchased for 1/4 of the price work just as well and not break after four days like this one did.  Oh I&#x27;m sure I just got unlucky and bought that one with a rare flaw.  Regardless, I&#x27;ll keep buying the less expensive ones because they work the same and last as long as the brand name straightener known in my house as Chi-ep.</li>
    <li> The one I bought was VERY lightweight and the Chi started rubbing off. Unlike my previous Chi purchased from Ulta. I dont know if it was a defective that the seller got or if they were taken. Thankfully the seller is refunding me and I am sending it back. If this is a real Chi, then the Farouk Company sure got this one wrong. I have had the original black chi and a Chi Ultra that was purchased from Ulta a few years ago and they were both solid built and worked great. This one totally fried my hair and didn&#x27;t even straighten it all the way. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this model!</li>
    <li> I bought this item back in July. There is a three month return policy on this item. How convenient that it burnt out five days after the return policy. Do not buy this item unless you want to waste 60.00 dollars!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gf becasue she wanted a pink flat iron from CHI. I found that the product is original CHI it looks great and according to my gf it works great too. But its NOT PINK! as its described on the item title and the pictures. The prodcut is red only if you put under very bright light it looks like very dark pink. Even though the color looks good its NOT PINK</li>
    <li> So... I&#x27;ve wanted a Chi for soo long.. I got one for my birthday in October from my hubby.. We ordered it from Amazon.com. And After about a month it broke. Nothing happened, just went to plug it in one day, and nothing!! I&#x27;ve been trying to return it, and found out it is not genuine!! So they won&#x27;t refund it! Ugh!! I should have known better when it said \\&quot;Pink Dazzle Limited Edition\\&quot; and when I got it, it was as red as red gets!!! :-/  DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!! If you&#x27;ve been dying to have a Chi, spend the $30 more, and get a genuine, good one.. with a warranty!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my GF for her b-day and she loves it!!!  She&#x27;s had it for over 6 months now and no issues. Don&#x27;t smell burning hair coming from the bathroom anymore lol.  GF said her hair is a lot more healthy now that she is using this instead of some other cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> This product from this seller isn&#x27;t reliable. Although the seller sends the item quickly and everything appears to be all fine and good I haven&#x27;t had a good experience. The typical warranty on a chi is one year. I bought mine in May and 5 months later the first one just quit working. I contacted the seller and it was replaced with a new one for the replacement, which was the same pink chi straightener, which I received about a month after the first one quit working due to shipping etc. This one has only lasted four months and the substance that holds in the heated plates leaked out of the side and onto my hair which then burned off. I either have horrible luck or this seller is distributing faulty products. I would recommend that you purchase your straightener at your local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> The basic original chi that first came out will never be topped, i got this one because of it being pink, DAZZLING pink at that. Well when i recieved it, it looks more like Red than anything. The work is puts out works just fine and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Before buying this Chi, I had never spent more than about $25 for a hair straightener. However, my hair is naturally thick and wavy, so cheaper straighteners took forever to straighten my hair the way I wanted it. I had always heard that Chi straighteners were excellent, but they were always more expensive than I imagined myself paying for one. When I found this one online for a little over $50 (as opposed to some that I&#x27;ve seen which were over $100), I decided to give it a try. I LOVE IT! This Chi really straightens my hair MUCH faster and better than the other straighteners I&#x27;ve tried. My hair gets straight, shiny, and silky smooth and stays there for much longer. I really believe that hair straighteners are one of the items in which you get what you pay for, and this one is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I bought this iron. I&#x27;ve owned a flat iron before (different brand) and it never worked as well as my new CHI. This CHI enables to straighten my naturally wavy hair straight, shiny and silky smooth in 5 minutes or less. This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for myself. It was way way worth it!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s CHI broke after 5 months.  The one year guarantee does not apply to internet purchases so buyer beware.  There is a high rate of malfunction judging from the other reviews on this site.  It&#x27;s great when it works but the product is too expensive to replace every 5 or 6 months.[[ASIN:B000M48IEY CHI Pink LE Hairstyling Iron by Farouk - 1\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> I bought this product and used it for 3 weeks.Then I plugged it in the next morning and it would not turn on or get hot. I followed the instructions from Farouk Systems Inc.,the manufacture,.They returned the flat iron to me stating that it was not a \\&quot;GENUNINE\\&quot; CHI FLAT IRON,so in turn ,there is no warranty on the iron.   so if you could issue a return receipt it would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my experience with this vendor and product. The first product I received was not satisfactory, so I contacted the company and they very quickly sent me a new product that works just great. They were extremely responsive and I would definitely buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> The product got to me right on time. it was quick fast and easy. best investment ever!</li>
    <li> When i first bought this chi it worked great. here i am a couple months after  i bought it and it just quits working one day while i&#x27;m straighting my hair.  very upset cuz my last chi lasted 2 years with no problem</li>
    <li> My friend has a Chi so I know what to look for when testing this product. It&#x27;s been heating up a little slow, but it straightens better than my $15 one at walmart, and it doesn&#x27;t pull hair, it&#x27;s very smooth, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed it so far, I&#x27;m just hoping it holds up this well in the future. I love the color too.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about buying this straightener, and I looked forward to using it since I have never paid more than $30 for one. However, when the order arrived, I read the instructions, plugged it in, and began to straighten my hair. Then.....the LED light made a loud popping noise, and I saw sparks coming from the straightener! So I immediately pulled it away from my head. Luckily my hair did not get singed. I turned it off just thinking maybe the LED went out, and the heating element would still work. But NOOOOO, the entire thing was shot! Then I thought it could have been the outlet, so I plugged it in another outlet and it still didn&#x27;t work. I sent it back yesterday (5/13/09), and so far the return has been hassle free. It just disappoints me that the first time I splurge and buy what is supposed to be a good product, I am left with nothing. I&#x27;m wondering if my cheapo $30 straighteners are better?!?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new straightner!!! my old one broke and I couldnt wait to get my new one, and I got here so fast!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product under the influence that I would be getting a fushia aka hot pink flat iron. But when I finally received it, it was clearly candy red. This might not be a big deal for some, but since my favorite color is pink and its so hard to find pink chi irons in stores I was very disappointed. Needless to say....I exchanged it for a  baby pink flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great price for a good product!!  This chi is real cute with the sparkles but also works great!! I have thick, long hair and it does the job for me!!   Also, I must compliment the shipping because I was not expecting to get it for at least a week but I recieved it within a week! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I AM A SOFT NATURALLY CURLY(not nappy) HEADED GIRL AND THIS FLATIRON WORKED WONDERS ON MY HAIR.  MY HAIR USUALLY DOESN&#x27;T GIVE OFF A LOT OF SHINE BUT AFTER USING THIS FLATIRON....I HAD TONS  OF SHINE....I PAIRED IT WITH CHI TRANSFORMATION SILK INFUSION.  I HELPED GIVE OFF A LOT OF SHINE AND ALSO HELPED HYDRATE MY SCALP. LUV, LUV, LUV MY NEW FLATIRON.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my CHI! All of my friends have had ones for years, and I just wasn&#x27;t willing to lay down the big bucks for one. I kept using cheaper versions hoping for the same results, but of course no product delivered. My hair was getting damaged from using products that just weren&#x27;t good enough for my hair. I am so glad that I took the time and money to get a CHI! NO MORE CHEAP OS FOR ME!</li>
    <li> I bought this item about 2 years ago for like $65, and I&#x27;m pretty sure its not an authentic CHI I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else the storage case that it comes with is red, not pink, which i thought was odd. Although it my not be the real thing it worked ok for me for about a year and a half, then it stopped working. The cord short circuits eventually, and I guess its hit or miss on how long it takes to do that. Had I known then that it wasn&#x27;t real I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it, but then again for the price I think I got my money&#x27;s worth for how long it lasted. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it might break sooner for you. Just keep in mind that CHI flat irons run 100-200 dollars normally, so you should be careful when you see them for less on the internet.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy from this seller.  I purchased this item from Amazon/Market Place only to find out that it was NOT an authentic Farouk Systems, Inc. item.  Everything looked and worked fine until December, 09 when I returned it to Farouk for a problem with the heating element under the 1 year warranty.  The iron was returned to me stating \\&quot;Product is not a genuine Farouk Systems, Inc. item.  These items are not authentic Farouk Systems, Inc products and contain the unauthorized representation of a Farouk Systems, Inc. trademark or trade name.  Information regarding authorized distribution of authentic Farouk Systems, Inc. products may found using the locator function on our website at [...]\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately Amazon worked out a satisfactory resolution to the problem which restored my confidence in buying again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Came like the next day when they said it would take 10-15 days and was everything I wanted and thought it would be. I would use this person again. They were awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought a flat iron from Farouk  for my daughter two weeks before Christmas.  She began to use it on December 26th.  January 27th the iron surged with heat, burned my daughter&#x27;s hair (so that she had to cut the fried hair off) then quit working all together.  Farouk said they only guarantee their products for 30 days and too bad! They would not work with me at all to replace, refund or repair the iron. I will NEVER purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described, and received quickly, but the best thing was the price... INCREDIBLE</li>
    <li> When my old flatiron broke, I decided to buy a CHI, because everyone talks about them so much. I picked this one because it was the same size as my old flatiron, and I eagerly awaited its delivery. Well, let me tell you...this is the worst 65 dollars I have ever spent on myself. The iron itself feels light and cheaply made, and there is only one setting: on. You cannot control the temperature of the iron in any way. Beyond that, it takes 3 times as long to straighten my hair with this iron as it did with my old one. I have thick, curly hair, and I expect a 65 dollar ceramic iron to be able to straighten it. The worst part is, if I spend an hour straightening my hair, and making it look sleek, ten minutes later, its curling back up. This iron is in no way worth the money unless you have incredibly fine hair, or are just doing your bangs. It does not heat up enough to properly straighten, and in general is a useless thing in my bathroom now. If you want this quality of iron, go to Target and spend 20 bucks, because that&#x27;s the kind of iron you will get if you buy this one.</li>
    <li> I received my order TWO days earlier than scheduled. I was very pleased with the speedy delivery. I also contacted the seller with a question, and i was met with a very helpful and appreciated response. I would definitely buy from this seller again. I was very happy with my whole experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this after losing my first CHI iron through some buyer on Amazon. I did not like the product at all. The Iron would not heat up at all. I realized the fact it was a fake chi after a few days,...by that time the return window for this particular seller has already closed. The return window was just 7 days. It was a big big waste of money.  I would recommend buying CHI irons directly from the CHI&#x27;s official website. There is not a huge price difference but you get what you are paying for with a 2 years warranty.</li>
    <li> Update: This quit working after 3 months.   I love CHI products and I went away from my basic little CHI 1\\&quot; iron a while back and got a souped-up, digital, 1-1/2\\&quot; CHI model. Well, it stopped holding a temperature after 2 months of use. I learned my lesson and went back to this one and so far, I love it! It straightens well. The \\&quot;pink dazzle\\&quot; color definitely leans more toward red than pink. I don&#x27;t really care but for someone who really wants that pink flat iron, this isn&#x27;t really \\&quot;pink\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Item is perfect! I love my Chi so I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s daughter. She uses almost every day and still in perfect shape. Gets hot in less than 30 seconds, never had any problems. Arrived fast and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> They were very helpful. The first iron did not work properly and they immediately sent me a new one.  It works perfect.</li>
    <li> My product began to not heat up all the way and i tried contacting the seller multiple times and still have yet to hear a response back. I am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Lo que me gusto fue que el producto estuvo en mi casa antes de lo planeado, y es exactamente como me lo describieron, ademas la calidad fue de lo mejor</li>
    <li> It broke within 3 months of use. When my husband took it apart to fix it, it was evident that it was a knock off Chi.</li>
    <li> I had read ll the reviews about the Chi and how great they are but how often they break but decided to order it anyways. After 4 months of using it 2-3 times per week my chi no longer heats up or even turns on.  Because the Chi was ordered through Amazon the Chi warranty does not hold up and the Amazon return policy was only TWO months!!  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!</li>
    <li> I received this item today. I noticed that the box looked cheap and not real. When I looked at it there was no temp settings which made me kind of mad, and then I wanted to know how hot it got but there is no max temp anywhere on the labels or instructions just says \\&quot;caution: hot\\&quot; really?! Then I noticed there was a lot of typo&#x27;s in the instructions. If you&#x27;re gonna do a knock off at least make it look real. I read the reviews and the temperature or heat hasn&#x27;t turned off on me yet like some of the reviews say. I&#x27;m going to plug it in and make sure it doesn&#x27;t turn off or I&#x27;m returning it. When I run it through my hair it snags if I don&#x27;t have my hair perfectly in the middle of the straightener and I have to push to make it fully close on my hair. A good straightener should at least close fully instead of having a gap in between. I originally gave it 3 stars but now that I think about it, the only good thing about it was the fast delivery. Please take everyone&#x27;s advice and do not buy it.</li>
    <li> CHI flat irons are wonderful products.  This one however is not a genuine CHI and is not manufactured by Farouk Systems Inc.  It did not heat up to the same high temperature that CHI&#x27;s are known for and stopped working after several months.  When I returned it to Farouk they informed me it is a fake.  So please be aware that you are not getting a genuine product when you buy this particular item.</li>
    <li> This is a truly great flat iron. I purchased it nearly a year ago, use it at least 3 times a week, and it still works perfectly. It heats up remarkably quickly, which is handy of you want to touch up on your way out the door, and even my thick hair stays incredibly straight all day. I would recommend also purchasing the Chi 44 Iron Guard Thermal Protection Spray to keep hair from getting dry. The only tiny problem I&#x27;ve noted is some squeakiness in the hinges, which began a few months after purchase (really not that big of a deal). As a side note, the color is very shiny and fun, and the case is great for going on trips. Really superb product.    Update 1/7/11: My beloved CHI flat iron just stopped working today. However, I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and a half, so I am very pleased with it&#x27;s duration and performance. HANDS DOWN the best flat iron I have ever owned. I will definitely buy another CHI product to replace it. I will be missing it dearly until the new one comes in the mail.</li>
    <li> gets my naturally curly african american hair straight from root to tip and im very satisfied</li>
    <li> This was a great buy!!! Fast shipping, and I got everything I had expected. It was a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> In December, I purchased two of these flat irons. I was so excited to find them at such a reasonable price that I went ahead and bought one for myself and one for my daughter...you know the old adage, \\&quot;If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is...\\&quot;? Well, that perfectly sums up my experience with these CHI&#x27;s. Within the first few uses, my daughter&#x27;s flat iron just stoppped working. I got mad at her, thinking that it was her fault and that she simply hadn&#x27;t taken good care of it. THEN, about a week later, the CHI I bought for myself stopped working, as well. To make a long story short, I am now using a CHI I bought at Target, which is where I should have bought the others. Buyer, beware!</li>
    <li> It did not work at all!  I plugged it in and it got really hot and then stopped working, never to work again.  I will never buy anything like this again online.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a great flat iron and always heard Chi was the way to go.  So, I ordered this one on Amazon and I absolutly loved it... for about a month.  Then one day it just stopped working.  The indicator light wouldn&#x27;t even come on when I turned it on. No heat, no nothing!  I did some research online and found out it did not have a warranty and it would cost almost as much to fix than to replace.  Needless to say, I ordered a different brand from a website that included a warranty.  I love Amazon and will continue to shop here, but always check for a warranty before purchasing anything you care about getting replaced.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my sister in law.  When i received it, it was in an express mail tyvek envelope without any bubble wrap; nothing.  The box was a little banged up but I assumed that they mailed the product in an appropriate way.  My sister in law later told me that the flat iron worked wonderfully for the first few times &amp; then it began to short out.  I told her I would return the item.  I checked out the seller&#x27;s return policy which stated that the product can only be returned within 10 days.  As the flat iron was a gift, it was much later than 10 days.  The return policy referred me to the manufacturers warranty for returns after 10 days.  First of all, my item did not contain a warranty card.  Secondly, the Farouk warranty clearly states that items purchased on the internet are not eligible for the warranty.  I contacted the seller on Monday, August 2nd, 2010 about my dilemma.  I asked them what should I do since the warranty does not apply.  Additionally, I let them know that I would be willing to take an exchange &amp; pay for the shipping.  As of today, 5 business days later, I have not received any response.  The lack of customer service is absolutely unacceptable!!  DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this! I bought this in October and it&#x27;s already broken. It will not even turn on AT ALL. I take really good care of all my items and it is unacceptable that this isn&#x27;t working any more. Total money down the drain.DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> my old chi broke, so after attempting to use a cheap straightener for a few months i couldnt take it anymore. i bought the same one i had last time. i absolutely love it! u could see the difference on how much healthier my hair looked right away! it heats up fast which is a def plus.</li>
    <li> this product worked for about 6 weeks and then would not turn on. since it&#x27;s over a month old, we cannot return it. will not purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with promptness of the flat iron.  I had broken mine, and I was in desperate need. It took three days.  Laura</li>
    <li> I have had many different straighteners.  I was at my salon, and I could feel a difference in the way it gripped my hair in the one they were using, so i asked which brand.  When i ordered the same brand, i was just hoping that it would have that same different grip.  It was a bit more expensive than the ones I had been using, although this particular one was less than I had seen at discount stores (TJ Maxx, Kmart).  It has a clean, tight grip on your hair.  Previously, hair had gotten caught, ripped, or even slid through without gripping and straightening.  This was a noteable difference, and I will always buy this kind.  My kids beg to borrow mine!  There is no heat adjustment, but I don&#x27;t need it - it&#x27;s either hot enough to work, or not.  I don&#x27;t give five stars easily - I save for superior products.</li>
    <li> I ordered my flat iron and received it in a couple days. I love the flat iron and it was a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago. It shuts off in the middle of straighten my hair. I hit the reset button and it comes on for 4 sec and shuts off again..</li>
    <li> This is my second chi, I was heart broken when my first chi&#x27;s cord had broken so I set out to buy a new one. I saw the price on this one and thought what a great deal! However when comparing this chi to my first chi it falls short. It takes longer than my other one to straighten my hair but other than that its alright.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, GREAT ITEM, JUST WHAT WIFE WANTED, SHOP SEVERAL DIFFERENT SITES BUT FOUND THIS WHAT I WANTED AT THE BEST PRICE ALSO, THANKS, JOB WELL DONE</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the Pink Dazzle. Instead, I got the light pink chi. I contacted the seller, but they were no help. They said they only sell Pink Dazzles. Clearly it wasn&#x27;t a Pink Dazzle. The box was for a completely different model. I ended up just keeping the straightener because it was such a hassle to return it, and I ended up really liking it. It&#x27;s just not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with my purchase I used the CHI IRON for 3days then I plugged it up one morning and it was not working I am very unhappy and I will like another or a refund</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product but It just don&#x27;t reach to hight tempetures it should warm more!</li>
    <li> I had purchased a ceramic by Revelon and it worked ok but I thought this one would be better so I bought it. It worked about the same as the less expensive one. I like the style and case that comes with it but think the price is a bit much for what it is.</li>
    <li> looks good but not really the color as it seems on the internet.  it&#x27;s a lil darker than picture.  doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as the black chi.</li>
    <li> The item was ordered as a birthday gift.  FACTS:  the item suddenly stopped working. The item did not have any CHI markings posted anywhere on the product or bag.  We did not observe the lack of identification until flat iron was presented back to us for return by our daughter. There was no link to the contact the seller of the product (not amazon) from my account page.  I contacted Amazon and will attempt to return the item. We are confident the item is NOT an Original CHI iron as it was advertised.  The pictures DO NOT identify the actual product we received.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have even owned.  It heats up fast and straightens my hair perfectly.  I love this product and use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I ordered the CHI iron after reading the ad. I was looking for a pink CHI flat iron. Product was advertised as \\&quot;pink\\&quot; and included a pink sleeve. Unfortunately when the \\&quot;pink dazzle\\&quot; iron came in the mail the sleeve was missing, and the iron was more of a red color. I contacted the seller but all he wanted to do was refund money for the sleeve. I asked for him to simply send it to me. No such luck.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this on recommendation from a friend .This chi is amazing. I can do my hair so much faster and it feels great! It&#x27;s perfectly straight without being flat. My hair isn&#x27;t fried. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I am now on my second replacement Chi straightner from this company and it has once again quit working.  This is the second Chi I have gone through with this company since May.  They are no longer responding to my emails and I have sent them multiple times asking them to return with a refund... no response!  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!</li>
    <li> I purchased the iron back in April and one day out of the blue it stopped working.  I contacted Ellen and she not only replaced my iron but she refunded me for my return shipment as well.  Ellen promised that she would take care of the iron if anything should happen to it again.  Ellen really knows customer service.  Thanks Ellen!</li>
    <li> Prodcut did not get as hot as it should, and I ended up trying to return the product. My advice is to ensure the product is a &#x27;real&#x27; CHI before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought my chi back in august, and almost exactly 6 months later it just stopped working.  Farouk will not honor the warranty on the chi because amazon is not an authorized dealer.  I love amazon and this is the first time i have ever been dissatisfied with them.  HOWEVER, this is not the first time this particular flat iron bought through amazon has mysteriously stopped working after the purchase.  My sister bought this exact same flat iron through amazon and it stopped working just 2 weeks after she purchased it. luckily, she was able to return it to amazon because the 30 day return policy was not up.  Do not purchase this flat iron. It will break within 6 months</li>
    <li> This is an authentic CHI flat iron. It was just as pictured. BUT, I didn&#x27;t realize that there was not a temperature setting. I have very fine hair and the highest temp that my hair can handle is about 300°. Just an FYI....</li>
    <li> I ordered the Chi pink dazzle iron from this vendor \\&quot;Honestabe404\\&quot;, as he calls himself, and got nothing but a hassle! He claims he supposedly  shipped it out two days after I ordered it. When I tried to check the bogus tracking number he emailed me, it said there was no record of any such item being shipped. I emailed him several times and only after threatening to contact my credit card company and the Better Business Bureau, did he respond! This guy is a total phony and should be kicked off Amazon. Buyer Beware of this lying, untrustworthy excuse of a human being!</li>
    <li> Love my chi. glad I finallybroke down and bought myself one. Will be buying all the women new chi&#x27;s for christmas this year.</li>
    <li> The Farouk CHI ceramic flat hair iron works great, the color is really cool and it was a good deal for the price.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron from this \\&quot;company\\&quot; on 04/03/2010 when I received it 04/09 tried it out plugged it up, it came on and I thought it was fine. I didn&#x27;t actually need to use the flat iron until a few days later went to plug it up, it did come on then immediatly died, contacted the seller to inform them, got a quick response to review the return info. I re-sent the item back 4/15 paid for the shipping myself, I tracked the package it said they got it (4/17), that same day I tracked it 4/20 I sent another email to seller asking when I should be receiving the new one, got no response EVER, pretty much they blew me off and were in desperate need to steal someone&#x27;s $53 bucks. This seller is ghetto probably out to take people&#x27;s money the reviews they have up are from themselves. Had to file a claim.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron.  It straightens hair on the first try, unlike some of the cheap flat irons that are out there.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my original Chi that I had for 9 years and thought I would go with this one, since it&#x27;s pink and my favorite color is pink.  Well, you get what you pay for!  Not only is it a knock off and a poorly made one at that, but I purchased it in May 2011 and I am already having to replace it (February 2012) due to faulty wiring.  The flat iron can not stay hot.  Yes, I use it on a daily basis, but come on, my last Chi made it 9 years!  I would not recommend this product.  Spend the extra money and get the REAL thing!</li>
    <li> This item arrived very quickly and was exactly what I ordered.  My daughter LOVES it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s my 3rd Chi, but every time one breaks, I can&#x27;t live without one!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Chi back in Nov 2011 after the other Chi I had died after several years. I went straight back to Chi because I was so happy with them and im seriously disappointed.  I love the pink but this never seemed to heat up as good as my old Chi and it has now shorted out completey after a mere 8 months of use and i use it maybe every other day as i have thick hair and it doesnt need washed that often.  im really sad and im switching brands.  sorry Chi....you let me down.</li>
    <li> I am really please with this product, and it was an excellent savings over store prices.</li>
    <li> I have been using Chi products for almost 10 years. I can say that I was kinda of worried about the authenticity of this chi but I have now used it from the day I received it with no problems. It works great!! So anyone thinking of buying this I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Im satisfied with the item and how it works so far..a little disatisfied that the picture you have posted is of a pink CHI, the one i was sent is  more redddish...other than that I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This item looks like a completely cheap imitation. I guess I got what I paid for, huh? Even the manual had an off brand name on it, it did not say CHI anywhere on the manual. It looked like someone printed the logo on the product itself. Even the packaging was extremely cheap and poorly printed. I might have not been as offended and actually kept it, if I didn&#x27;t feel like they were trying to pull one over on me. I&#x27;ll buy cheap anything, just don&#x27;t try and cover it in jewels and pass it on as legit. I&#x27;m returning this immediately. Thankfully, it seems extremely stress free to do returns on amazon.</li>
    <li> I recently pruchased a CHI Flatiron after mine broke. It was about $20 less than one on sale on the official CHI website. Of course, when a styling tool that you use every single day breaks, you need it quick! I added the express delivery, had it in 3 days and love, love, love it! That it is in Pink Dazzle, for a Super Price only makes it better - thank you!</li>
    <li> The Farouk CHI that i purchased has been a great product so far. i bought it new from the owner and was new when i received it. it says it has been inspected and is a quality product. no complaints from me!</li>
    <li> I bough this iron for my wife, now two years of using... she is more than happy, and gues what... his husband is more than happy too. It is little expencive compare with something else... but beleave me the result is 100 times different than the cheap one...</li>
    <li> I love this product!!Its worth every penny! It only takes me minutes to straigten my hair instead of an hour.</li>
    <li> This item gets the job done, however, I do not straighten my hair often. It is not compare to the  Chi products i&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about purchasing this because of the price.  So far, I have been happy with the product.  The \\&quot;on\\&quot; light has a fast blink.  Not sure if that is how it&#x27;s supposed to be or not.  A couple of times, it hasn&#x27;t turned on right away, but after I reset and waited a few minutes it eventually did.  I works well on my hair and seems like a good product otherwise.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s way more than I would typically spend on something for my hair, but I tried a friend&#x27;s and loved it and had to get one.  Unfortunately, the one I purchased broke after a month - I didn&#x27;t do anything beyond normal use of the product, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on one day.  The seller apologized for the inconvenience, but wouldn&#x27;t exchange it because I was beyond the 30 days return limit.  I&#x27;m disappointed in this as it&#x27;s an expensive product anyway and then to have it only function for a month is really frustrating.  I&#x27;ll buy another one because I really do like the way my hair looks after using it - but I&#x27;ll get it from someone else.</li>
    <li> Wonderful when you order something and its exactly what you ordered and it comes quick.  Yes I would definitely recommend using this company to order from!  And will order more in the future. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my step daughter in Mexico.  It worked great for less than a month.  Now she says it won&#x27;t turn on at all. I would return it but it&#x27;s a 13 hour drive to Mexico and another 13 hours back.  Then I would have to make the trip again to give her the new item and this just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.  I was expecting it to live longer than twenty days.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase for the price, the only problem was we the CHI got to our house it was not pick but more red that was a little dissappointment. Other than the color the product works great!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! It heats up fast, works so well, and looks great!! It&#x27;s a little more red than I expected (I thought it would be more of a bubble gum pink), but it is still sparkly and adorable!! 5 stars for me!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful pink hair straightner, however, doesn&#x27;t work!! 3 weeks after purchase and the unit won&#x27;t keep a temperature. When I first started using the iron, I could barely hold it, it was so hot! Now, I can wrap my hand around the barrel and not get burned. It takes forever to straighten hair because of the temperature issue. Luckly, I am still within the 30 day Amazon warranty period, so I was able to get a refund. But buyers beware, after this period, your out of luck. Since Amazon is not a verified retailer, the product can not be sent to the manufacturer to be repaired!! After reading poor reviews about CHI&#x27;s durability, I gave up and decided to get a Solia from another retailer.  I was enticed by the pink iron color, but from now on, I will go for function over fashion.</li>
    <li> I bought this chi flat iron about two months ago and two weeks it ago it totally stopped working. Never dropped it or did anything to it. Just didnt work when I went to plug it in. Paid almost 100$ for it and got 20 uses out of it.</li>
    <li> This product is completely horrible. The label wore off in a matter of days. The product still works, but I would not recommend it. I e-mailed the company, and got no response. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I was expected something original, Not an imitation painted with the fingerprints on it , I&#x27;m not happy with my purchase, I used chi for very long time and does not compare with what I had previously , I&#x27;m not happy</li>
    <li> Great products and so easy to use.  Shipped on time and as expected. Would recommend this if you are looking for a good flatiron!</li>
    <li> This product worked well for about 6 weeks then the plates started to get loose and pulling my hair.  Emailed the seller and heard nothing back....now today the in the middle of straightening my hair..the power on it cut out and won&#x27;t turn back on! So frustrating!!!!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Here&#x27;s the thing, I would have given this an excellent rating if the POS thing didn&#x27;t BREAK within four weeks of my purchase!!  It worked so well, really, it made me almost like straightening my unruly hair. But then one day while it was heating up I began to do my makeup and when I turned back the LED light was out. So I tried all the usual things - turning it off and on, unplugging and re-plugging it in, and of course, resetting it - all to no avail. I had to break out my old crappy iron that morning. So I was hoping my husband could fix it but he couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong with it. \\&quot;Something in the wiring\\&quot; was his diagnosis. *Sigh* So now I am using my old one, tormenting my poor hair while I await the new one I bought from a different site (NOT the pink dazzler to be sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps CHI makes crap like this? I don&#x27;t know because I&#x27;ve never had one before, but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a fake. If ALL of our \\&quot;CHI\\&quot; straighteners stopped working in such a short amount of time than something is amiss. I mean, just look at all these reviews! I WISH I&#x27;d read them before buying! Anyone else notice that their bag (the heat resistant carrier bag inside the box) is RED, not pink?! That&#x27;s weird because I looked at another site and theirs is pink. Is this a Chinese knock-off? I don&#x27;t know. Now that my husband opened it I wont be able to return it. That was a stupid mistake I guess, but someone else on here tried to return it under the 1 year warranty but the company (Farouk) sent it back stating that it was fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the case, if you want to pay 50+ dollars for a pretty decent iron that lasts only a month, than buy this. Otherwise, it&#x27;s probably best to spend more to get the real deal.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a Chi iron for quite a while and I love it.  My hair is really hard to straighten and this cuts down the time a lot.  I realize that I will never have perfectly straight hair because of the weather in Arkansas but I do love this product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I was able to snag it at an amazing price as well which pleased me. I usually can only find the chi straightener in the stores for like 100 dollars. It works very well. The only thing I wish it had was the Bilty to shut itself off if I leave it on. I&#x27;ve had other straighteners that had that ability, but other then that I love this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron thinking that I got a good deal on a chi flat iron and when it quit working called chi for repair.  I was told that this flat iron is a fake and to never order online unless it is with them. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!  THEY ARE LIARS SELLING FAKE PRODUCTS!!!</li>
    <li> I finally splurged and bought myself a nice Chi flatiron in the months before my upcoming wedding in 2008.    The first one I purchased was tempermental and refused to turn on but now I realize it had to do with the reset button on the plug.  I returned it got a new one. I love the quality of Chi and my friend who owns a Revlon LOOOOVES using my Chi, she says its luxurious and much easier to straighten her hair with.     My chi worked great until a few weeks ago.      As of last week the ON/OFF switch FELL OFF!!!!  I would think this product would last as long as hair dryers and curling irons do - I have curling irons that are 5+yrs old and still work wonderfully, same for my hair dryers!     My husband was able to toggle the on/off switch to the \\&quot;on\\&quot; side so it SOMETIMES will turn on when I plug it in now.  But periodically it turns off, to which then I need to bang the thing on the side of the door to get the light to come back on.  Super frustrating!!!!!!!!    I&#x27;m adding it to my wish list for Hanukkah but I&#x27;m super pissed that I paid $90 for this and it only lasted TWO years and I only flat iron my hair in the winter time. GRRRRRRR!!!!!    rarely do I write poor reviews, but in this economy, I want bang for my buck!</li>
    <li> I simply love it. It puts my messy hair in order - keeps the volume on top and flattens the frizzy edges.</li>
    <li> First of all the flat hair iron is more red then pink. It only worked for two weeks then stop. very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister because she was going through cheap flat irons like crazy. She really loved the product, esspecially since it was pink but after 2 months of use the light wouldn&#x27;t come on and the flat iron wouldn&#x27;t heat up. Getting it fixed/refunded proved to be very difficult. Things happen, so I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product it just didn&#x27;t really work out for us.</li>
    <li> i loved this product. It works so really well in a very little amount of time. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> After just a few months of regular use the ceramic heater on one side came apart from the handle. Disappointed because I had my precious chi for 3 years before it go lost with luggage on a trip.</li>
    <li> I love this Pink Dazzle Chi...it works really great!! I would totally recommend this product to anyone who needs to/wants to straighten their hair. :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple months ago and it just died on me. So not worth this. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to any one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about a year now. I absolutely love it. My sister had one that I was so jealous of I had to buy my own. Now she&#x27;s jealous because mine is pink! It&#x27;s adorable, fast, effective. What else could you want?</li>
    <li> When I purchased this Chi I had high hopes that it would be better than my 3 inch Remington flat iron, but after using this one for about a month I realized it only took longer and did not give me the results I desired.  My hair is pretty thin too, but still not as good as other Chi&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> this straightner didn&#x27;t get as hot as we expected and didn&#x27;t straigthen our hair well - we currently have chi straigthners and they work better than this new one. so we decided to return it, and so far, the customer service has been great.</li>
    <li> Online the item looked and says pink but when i received it, it is more red than anything. Other than that it has been a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I turned on my flat iron to warm it up and 5 minutes later it died. One word for this product and seller. ....RIDICULOUS. I paid 80 bucks for a piece of crap. I feel robbed.</li>
    <li> I have been hearing about this \\&quot;Chi\\&quot; for ever now. I use a curling iron and have for years. I have always enjoyed it. Not sure why, but I have not been having the best time with my hair in this hot humid Texas weather lately. It justed started to get on my nerves that I broke down and finally got this. I got it pretty fast. I am loving my non-frizzy hair. I was amazed by how straight it was after using it when my hair was washed and toweled dried. I&#x27;m enjoying the compliments as well. I wish I would have broke down sooner. :)</li>
    <li> A professional grade flat iron I can afford. AND it&#x27;s pink. Super awesome. The item arrived quickly, and was/is in perfect condition. I LOVE it! (as a follow up, the iron broke within 6 months. It stopped heating.)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Chi for my daughters birthday and they are so expensive.  I found this on this site, got it in record time and my daughter LOVES it.  She says it is the best straightner she has ever used!!</li>
    <li> There is NOTHING pink about this flat iron. It is fire engine RED.  It works well, it just isn&#x27;t what I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> The bright pink makes the item fun. The Chi name speaks for its quality. Love that it came with it&#x27;s own travel case. The pink was a little more red than I expected.</li>
    <li> Purchased and was happy with it until I went to use it one day and it just did not work at all. No damage had occurred at all and it did not work in any outlet. I was unable to return it to Amazon and contacted the company. You have to send it back and mail them $15 to potentially receive a replacement. This is the message I received.  \\&quot;Thank you for purchasing our products!

    <li> I got my CHI for a good price and i received it when they said i would. I would recommend them to anyone who asked! Thanks!!! :)</li>
    <li> Experienced a problem with this item (did not. Heat up evenly nor consistently)  however merchant was very helpful in providing options.  After two attempts I ended up returning item.  Although item seems to have issues merchant &#x27;s customer service was very good.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product August 1 and received it promptly.  I threw away the box because myasthenia Chi I purchased from a beauty supply store last me eight years.  This one I loved until it died on me before month went by. Husband ordered it for me do it was disappointing for both of us.</li>
    <li> This review is for this particular Chi not all chi&#x27;s. My first Chi lasted over a year and worked fabulous until I dropped it on the floor and I broke into 4 pieces. I thought this looked like the same one. This one has an on off switch instead of a dial to turn the temp up and down. I was disappointed but I usually use it turned all the way up so whatever. After about 6 months one day I turned it on and only one side would heat up. Unfortunately I did not save the box or any of the information. So I threw it in the trash and bought another at a local salon.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. They are worth the extra pennies. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand on my hair. It straightens my hair stick straight and I have curly hair.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. This item originally had a decent review from me because it was delivered on time and my wife was happy. My wife has only used the item 2-3 times. The first time it worked no problem, but the 3rd use (this being within 3 month time frame) it would not stay on. I bought this item trusting it would do me good. I ignored the previous reviews and decided to trust the company. I just thought people were mad for spending the money on something not as good as expected. But the responses were very legit. The iron turned off because it overheats or has some safety mechanism engineered into it. What&#x27;s the point of that right? DO NOT AND I MEAN, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I will return it and not for an exchange. Definitely displeased that ill only receive a partial refund but its ok. The man upstairs has me covered. Again DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!</li>
    <li> The item arrived DOA. It appeared to be (note that I say appeared) a Chinese knock-off which was one of my concerns when I ordered it. As usual, Amazon backs up their sales with one of the best no hassle returns policies and the return was handled professionally with the refund including the original shipping and a return shipping tag.</li>
    <li> The product works great.  It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Can&#x27;t complain much for the price I got it for.  It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I had my previous CHI for 10 years before one day it just wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.. I was heartbroken, but excited to find a pink one on here for an affordable price! They truly are the best flat irons.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Daughter because she said Farouk was a really good brand and this CF1001PD was the best model.  That may be still a true statement but the one sold to me was junk.  Right out of the box it did not work.  After a little research I find, it’s most likely not the real thing.  Don’t purchase this one from Amazon.  Thankfully Amazon will take it back and refund my money.  Not sure why Amazon is still offering this for sale on their web site???</li>
    <li> Love my CHI and am so sad it is broken.  It is fabulous, but it just stopped working after two years... I was hoping for it to last a little longer.  I do travel a lot, so it has been in and out of suit cases; perhaps that is why it stopped working.  It worked perfect and then just one day wouldn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
    <li> My chi nano (the blue one) broke and I was completely devasted! Yes over a straightener! And because I paid over $160 for it! So I bought this pink dazzle one by chi and LOVE it. Personly it is way better than my old one and keeps my hair straighter longer and takes less time to do it!</li>
    <li> I bought a pink Chi, when I got it, it is RED! It works just as well, and for the price, I decided not to be too picky. But it was NOT the color it was described to be for sure.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and have used it three times so far. It makes my hair pin straight and silky smooth in 15 minutes! I love it. Also, it does seem a little redder but you can tell it has pink undertones that sparkle through the reddish/hot pinkish top. I love it!</li>
    <li> I must be lucky...I absolutely love this hair straightener! I was purchasing many cheap hair straighteners (usually about $20) and they didn&#x27;t work very well on my hair. I purchased this in 2010 and it&#x27;s been going strong for over 2 years. It still gets very hot and works great. I use it almost every other day (3-4 times a week).  My hair texture is wavy and thick though. Since the temperature gets so hot and there is only one setting, I would not recommend it to people with thin/easily damaged hair. The only thing I&#x27;m confused about is why they call it \\&quot;pink\\&quot; and it looks pink in most of the pictures on here. Well guess what... it&#x27;s red. For reference, look at the 2nd image down/ the user uploaded images because that&#x27;s what it looks like in real life. I know that is a minor issue but it is confusing if you think you&#x27;re getting a pink straightener and a red one comes in the mail.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great!! I love and use it very often! I would have to say that i swear by it and have recommended it to all of my friends. I just love it so much and if you really take the time to straighten of curl your hair i will guarantee you it will come out decent. No doubt it&#x27;s a good buy. I would try it out if i were you!!</li>
    <li> Got exactly what i asked for. even  though it look smore red than pink im not complaining about it all....</li>
    <li> It works, but its not the real thing, by the end of the month the chi label was coming off.</li>
    <li> Product came with lifetime warranty for five stars. Good product. Works awesome. No temp settings though. But still works good</li>
    <li> This is the classic Farouk Chi, the real thing ... lots of fakes out there so be careful when buying.  The fakes temperature is not regulated and can really fry your hair, I know this from experience.  UGH!  Also... it shipped/arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> My hair is natural, so I do not get perms so my hair is thick and hard to get with sometimes! The first day I received this... I RAN to the bathroom to give it a test drive! I love it, and definitely recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I fried my last one by plugging it into a voltage adapter overseas. That&#x27;s a lesson I will only have to learn once. This flatiron is exactly  as pictured, and was shipped lightning fast. I will always buy a CHI. Thanks</li>
    <li> This broke not long after I bought it.  I was in Las Vegas and couldn&#x27;t believe that  it broke.  Wasn&#x27;t able to use it my entire vacation.</li>
    <li> very crappy girlfriend was just using and in blew out two fuses in my house very very dangerous my suggestion is dont buy</li>
    <li> I bought my chi in september and it broke after 5 months of use.  I have tried to contact the seller and have received no feedback.  I would not reccomend buying anything from this person.  Chi will not warranty anything bought through Amazon anyway.</li>
    <li> Bought this Item in September 2011 stopped working 4 months later. Contacted the company several times with no responds. Very dissapointed!!! Still have manufacture warranty on it but no RESPONDS from the company. I would suggest not to purchase the CHI Flat IRON</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware!  This product stopped working for me after only 3 months!  Upon calling the manufacturer, I discovered that this is NOT a ligitimate Farouk product (NOT a REAL CHI), and therefore is NOT covered under any warranty.  HOWEVER - Amazon was gracious enough to allow me to return the item for a refund.  Kudos to Amazon!</li>
    <li> My wife was given this as a gift. It broke so I called for warranty repair. The Farouk company was very nasty and said it is not under warranty because it was purchased online. How is anyone to know that when they purchase it. That means that any product of theirs that is purchased online comes with NO warranty. For what people pay for this product, I would look somewhere else. It is way too expensive to not have a warranty. The way i was spoken too was terrible. If I ever see anyone in the store looking at a Farouk product I will not hesitate to tell them my experiences with their customer service.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the CHI flat iron.  I bought this for her for Christmas and she uses it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> It came in the mail very quickly and i have had it for quite some time now and it works great heats up very fast and stays hot even after having it for months</li>
    <li> Its not as strong as my other Chi, it gets hot but it could&#x27;ve been better. It gets tha job done.</li>
    <li> Great gift and works perfectly! Daughter loves it and uses it everyday. Looking to buy another for myself in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Wife always wanted a CHI brand straightener.  Picked it up for her birthday and she&#x27;s used it everyday since.  She&#x27;s had nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
    <li> It worked but a few days into it the color started chipping off and it NEVER came in that pink color displayed it&#x27;s a very pale color. IT&#x27;S NOT A REAL CHI!!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter in law and she loves it and it comes with a travel case. The color was sparkle pink we could not find this color in any store. Thank you</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my sister. She went to use it for the first time and it didnt turn on. I let the company know and they sent a replacement right away that does work. She love it!</li>
    <li> I love my Chi! Works great! Gets HOT! Love the storage case it comes in as well! I recommend this product &amp; seller.</li>
    <li> This broke after I had it for only 5 months. Do not get this. It doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
    <li> I got it at a great price, I was borrowing my neighbors for months until I saw this on Amazon and love it perfect! Delivery was right on time!</li>
    <li> I purchased mine May 2012 and it broke this morning. One of the plates started coming off and just shut off. When I called the manufacturer about it, I was told it was a fake CHI...no wonder you can&#x27;t contact the manufacturer after the Amazon.com 30-day return policy...</li>
    <li> Great product. I think this is the best flat iron on the market. I recomend the Chi for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron. It&#x27;s da Bomb!!!! Customer service was unbelievable. I arrived to my house early, and they are super friendly.</li>
    <li> When i recieved this it did not work and also was fake light weight was terrible do not buy a fake purchase</li>
    <li> It is a counterfeit tool.  It is not made by Farouk.  Had less than 2 months and it is dead.</li>
    <li> I received this item brand new still sealed in box with all paperwork. I received it within two days, which I was very happy about. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I like it. But it could work a little better than it does. I was looking for something that got a little hotter but it&#x27;s way better than my old one</li>
    <li> I bought this item over a week ago and it still has not shipped out. I will not recieve it one time and it is very frustrating! I paid for it to arrive on time.</li>
    <li> Got this in February and in September it doesn&#x27;t work anymore! I would advise to buy directly from Chi instead of wasting your money.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for about 4 months!! But then we plugged it in and it did not work at all. I would not recommend this product unless you only need to use it for a couple months before throwing it away and buying a new one.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;After further research, Amazon is not an authorized seller of this product. Therefore, the normal two year warranty that comes with all CHI products is not valid. AKA we&#x27;re completely screwed and are now going to JCPenny to purchase one from them since they are an authorized seller of CHI products. I would recommend you not wasting your time trying this product unless you buy from an authorized dealer.</li>
    <li> Such an amazing deal and has lasted me more than 4 years to far with no problems. Will never pay full price for a chi again!</li>
    <li> This is not a real chi. Everything looks legit but it is not. My teenage step daughters hair was burned an the irons turned black... My chi does not do that!!!</li>
    <li> The iron heats quickly and has performed exactly as I hoped and expected. The case is a great addition and was a blessing when traveling.</li>
    <li> the product was shipped quickly and works well.  it&#x27;s good quality and easy to use.  the case is good for traveling and storage.</li>
    <li> I love my Chi. It works really good. But unfortunately the paint is starting to chip and I have only had it like 3 weeks and don&#x27;t use it everyday. I will be sending it back.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener ever. I have tried other brands and still stick to with the Chi!!! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I only used this flat iron on and off for about a month, and it almost blew up while I was using it.  I heard a loud noise and looked down at it and there was smoke coming from the end of it where the cord it.  I will not be buying anything else from this company.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;CHI\\&quot; flat iron was thrown together. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and now all of a sudden I smell something burning and it&#x27;s the glue on the plates. Apparently, someone glued the plates on there so every time it gets hot they melt off. I didn&#x27;t pay 70$ for a \\&quot;chi\\&quot; that doesn&#x27;t work. I guess that&#x27;s just someone trying to pull something over someone else.</li>
    <li> I love Chi irons! Wish it had a longer cord but this is the traditional Chi. Still love these irons!</li>
    <li> Not pink like it says it is!  But other than that it works great on my hair!  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Do not last long. Bad quality. Waste of money. Pissed. Need a longer warranty. Do not waste your time &amp;&amp; money.</li>
    <li> I CANT EVEN GIVE THIS ONE STAR!!!!!!  WE PURCHASED THE PRODUCT JUNE 7TH, ....AUGUST 25TH, IT HAS STOPPED WORKING!!!!  MY DAUGHTER USED IT 3 TIMES!!!  THERE IS NO WEAR AND NO DAMAGE DONE BY US!!  I GET ON AMAZON TO RETURN THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND THEY WILL NOT REFUND THE TOTAL AMOUT, AND MAKE YOU PAY SHIPPING.  WE PUT OUR FAITH IN THE PRODUCTS THAT AMAZON ADVERTISES ON ITS SITE,THET SHOULD DROP THIS SELLER FROM ITS SITE...TODAY!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! It looks more red than pink, but that&#x27;s not a problem. Takes a little longer to heat up than my older one, but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> delay rapid and I just like it.&lt;br /&gt; it&#x27;s a good one.&lt;br /&gt;Good services.&lt;br /&gt;Je recommande ce produit a tous le monde.</li>
    <li> Bought this Chi iron on July 14, 2012 and 6 months later it quit working. I have a Chi I bought from my local mall 6 years ago and it has out lasted 2 irons bought off Amazon. Sound too good to be true...maybe that&#x27;s because it is? I could have bought a real Chi with the money I&#x27;ve wasted here.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the color pink, so when I found the &amp;#34;pink chi&amp;#34; i was thrilled. I have heard nothing but great things about the chi products. When i received the flat iron, I was a little upset with the color, it is not the pink it looks online; its a little more red. But besides the color, the flat iron works great. I have extremely kinky curls &amp; when I am finished with my hair you would of though I had naturally straight hair. Aslo there is no temperature control on the flat iron. But all in all the product is great.</li>
    <li> The Chi so far has been perfect. I love how fast it heats up how well it straightens my hair and I really love the color. I never owned a Chi until I saw such a good deal on Amazon.com and bought it. I love my chi and my hair now when I use it.</li>
    <li> I like that this was a chi, but it WAS NOT THE ONE I ORDERD!!! THIS SAID SPICIFICLLY PINK DAZZLE!! Why was I shipped a red plain flat iron? The flat iron that was delivered to my door step does not curl my hair, only flips and straightens. Very upset I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering of amazon ever again.</li>
    <li> I do like how quickly this iron heats up and it is able to curl or straighten, however my old one did have a temperature setting to control how hot it was. But the color is awesome, very bright!</li>
    <li> this was a great present fro a great price and the color of the flat iron was so gorgeous! my cousin is going to love it</li>
    <li> I bought this back in August and it already does not work.  Very expensive for a flat iron that only lasts 4 months!!</li>
    <li> I was well pleased with it. Bought one just like it 2 years ago and it just went bad. So I would recommend this site to other .</li>
    <li> The lady I love is gorgeous, this product made her hair look smoking Hott! Best Christmas gift I ever bought!</li>
    <li> I know everyone raves about the Chi, but I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she finds that it does not do a whole lot better than her drug store bought one. As far as Chi&#x27;s go, I got it at a good price. But it stopped working in 6 months, so NOT MONEY WELL SPENT!!</li>
    <li> My wifes old Chi broke and she needed a new one.  She loves it and it works great came with a great cas to put it in after each use.</li>
    <li> It works fine but they were some scatches on the paint like it my have been a used product.  Weeks after I bought it thinking I got a great deal could have bought it at target for same price.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter purchased this with her own money she saved up for it.  Cost was around $130.00.  It broke in less then a year.  I would not reccomend buying this online.  Chi WILL NOT honor the one year warrenty unless it is purchased thru a salon, Target or major store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not had this chi 5 months and it already quit working!  This is the second one I&#x27;ve had that&#x27;s done this!</li>
    <li> I have owned several CHIs that have lasted at least 5 years and this one only lasted 4 months!  I thought it was a great price and ordered it but it has turned out to be a dud.  I am requesting a refund or a new product but haven&#x27;t heard from anyone as of yet.</li>
    <li> Came on time, I was worried about the authenticity however there was no room for concern. I enjoy the product !</li>
    <li> This was my second CHI flat iron and I would have to say that I love it even more than the first. The color is more red than pink, which was a bit disappointing, but I got over that fact as soon as I started using it. This tool works great for straightening and curling my fine and below shoulder length hair, and also leaves it shinny and soft.</li>
    <li> she always uses chi cause the quality is good.  we got this one on sale cause its pink but it works just like any other chi ceramic flat iron</li>
    <li> love my chi perfect for natural curly hair...straightens lovey...also the bag is awesome when you do your hair and you want to take your chi with you</li>
    <li> I was very dissatisfied with my Chi when I first used it. I had used a Chi that was purchased at a name brand store. The one I received did not straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> This is not a real chi. I baught this exact one a few months ago and i hardly ever use it i went to turn it on the other day and wouldnt...i dont what happened or anything i constantly pushed the red reset button the plug still wouldnt turn on. I tried different plug ins didnt work. This is a peice of crap it says mail in $45 to get replaced they do not send you a new one..because this is not a real chi. I thought i was getting a good deal but i got a peice of junk ...i love amazon and i think they shouldnt allow factories to sell false brands....DO NOT BUY THIS....SAVE UR MONEY AND GO BUY IT DIRECTLY FROM A SALON...NOT ANY RETAIL STORES OR WALMART SALONS...</li>
    <li> heats up pretty fast....just love it all around and it gets really hot super fast. nice flat Iron.... works well for me!</li>
    <li> its not pink its more of a red color, but its a great brand just bought for color and was upset that it was red</li>
    <li> She loves it and it has performed well for many months.  Heats up quickly and the color is nice too.</li>
    <li> this was working for several months- then just died one day!  I did not even have it for a year-</li>
    <li> I have to have a CHI since I have naturally curly hair, its the only straightener that really works on it and I love the brand. Sometimes when I plug in the one I got from this seller, I have to wiggle the plug-in box a little which is a little concerning however, It has always worked.  not sure if I will have problems down the road with it...hope not!  other then that, shipping was fast and I love my pink CHI!</li>
    <li> I like the color used to have a black one but it broke n I figured it would work as well as my other one but when its hot I use it then after a while i have to wait a little while for it to get hot again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product at all.  My hair isn&#x27;t very curly our thick and this straightener takes for ever to straighten:&#x27;(</li>
</ol>
