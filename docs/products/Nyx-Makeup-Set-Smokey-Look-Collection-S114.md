<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a gift to a friend and she loved it</li>
    <li> I loved it... Best price and beautiful colors of shades...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I love NYX, but this palette is limited. The colors have decent pigment but the ones I actually like are so small and some are eyeshadows  are grouped together in lines so it&#x27;s hard to just get that one color you need. The lip colors do not have the best pigment, more like tinted lip gloss and the 3 I liked are already gone after 3 uses because I had to use so much to get some color. Also the glitter in the palette is unneeded, I&#x27;ve used it once on a girl who was very out there with her makeup&lt;br /&gt;choices. All in all I&#x27;ve used 1/10th&lt;br /&gt;Of the palette and will only do so.</li>
    <li> I just turned 13 and my mom got me this kit (my first kit) for my birthday and I was excited and I didn&#x27;t know what half the stuff was. It was smaller than I expected, but it has a lot more in it than I thought. It folds up in a little box and it has all the things I could ask for. I loved the glitter. And it said it was comming on June 8th but it came a week early than it was suppost to (June 1) so that was sweet. And if I had the choice to get it again I would definatly get it.</li>
    <li> Great make up. Goes on good and stays on all day!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect to adore this, but I do.  The shadows are very easy to apply and they stay put.  The colors are rich and saturated.  The blushes work great and have great contour colors.  The tiny brushes that it comes with are of course garbage, but you can&#x27;t expect better.  I was a little disappointed with the bottom metallic colors.  They are more like some hardened Vaseline with a little glitter thrown on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the not so perfect issues, I love this product.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love the entire makeup kit nothing has been broken come in really good pacakge. So honestly its worth it.</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged, item just as described the colors are solid and pretty. It is so much to mix and match. Just great</li>
    <li> Ladies it was love at first site I was surprised at how much I liked it, The product package is nice &amp; high gloss looks like a professional make up artist kit... I want MORE! (Haa haa haa)! Dont hesitate to purchase ordered it Friday arrived Tuesday seller has fast service everything was intact nothing was broken; its compact enough for make up vanity or purse!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when my shipments came in today. I was shaking  like a Chihuahua. Out of all the items that came today this was my all time favorite. NYX  is on point with this palette set. All of the colors are beautiful and high high quality. The color palette blew my mind. I have light skin, blonde hair and green eyes. if I didn&#x27;t know any better, I would have thought this was made just for me. The swatches are perfect for any shade and complexion.</li>
    <li> Good quality great for beginners and I use it more so as everyday make up it has great neutrals and the blushes are pretty, not a big fan of the glittery lip pallets but other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This is an awesome pallette to have! It&#x27;s very pigmented, so a little color goes a very long way. The first time I used it, I way overdid my makeup because I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be so pigmented. That being said, it&#x27;s pretty small. It&#x27;s about the size of my hand, but it does fold out to be a little bit bigger. But still, it will last a very long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much at all. And the price is very cheap for what you get,really. I think it&#x27;s a great buy, especially if you love doing smokey eye looks.</li>
    <li> Great product because it has different kind of shades and it also has shimmers and lipsticks</li>
    <li> LOVES IT THIS MAKE up last for hours! Quite amazing.. Im going to order me more! YUP yup yup!! once, this is all gone..</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup and the colors.  This is great for travel and you only need a few things to complete your look.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It has a total look all in one sleek and sturdy box. The matte purples are simply amazing. Although I agree with most all of the criticisms of this box, I love it for what it is.</li>
    <li> Has everything I need for a quick look. The blushes are AWESOME if all used together, the contouring hues worked perfectly with my skin (I&#x27;m medium beige, mixed skin). The lip glosses are as to be expected, not standalone Nyx gloss quality, but they layer very well. The shadows are well pigmented. I would definitely recommend this, especially as this price!</li>
    <li> I am in love w this kit. It&#x27;s compact and fits in my purse for on the go needs. I am new to playing with makeup and the color selection is perfect for beginners of all skin tones</li>
    <li> Great pigmentation but the lip colors aren&#x27;t good</li>
    <li> Nice colors. A good way to sampel for first time NYX coucustomers. . It is a little small but for the money it is a good deal. Love this product!</li>
    <li> The colors was all broken</li>
    <li> The pigments of the eyeshadows are great . The lipglosses and glitter shadows as well as concealer a suck ! In order to get pigment of glosses to show you have to use almost all of the color with a brush .</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend as a Christmas gift and she loves it! I own other products from Nyx and always love their products. They are good quality for the price! She said the palette looks super nice in person and looks like nice quality. This is perfect because it comes with many colors for eyeshadow including glitter color, lip colors, some basic concealer, contour colors, bronzer, and blush. a really great palette for a great price! Also, she said the palette was undamaged when she got it. Sometimes it is a gamble to order eyeshadow online cuz they can come broken, but none of the ones she received were broken at all.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, exactly what it says in the description and came out perfect. I give as a gift to my girlfriend and she loved it. Perfect for day to day. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Well i thought it was a lot bigger, its pretty small. Although my mother loved it, and still uses it now. Its just that the pictures make it look big and enough to make an impression if it&#x27;s a gift.</li>
    <li> Great make up kit, lots of colors, great quality</li>
    <li> This is an awesome kit to try NYX products. I&#x27;ve already discovered a lip color that I love and hope they have it as a single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the smokey purple eye today. The shadows blend perfectly and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a deep color. I&#x27;ll definitely be playing around with this kit a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kit arrived 99.99% intact. One of the purple shadows did sustain a very small bit of damage. A tiny part of the case had broken off and landed in the one of the concealer creams but nothing that won&#x27;t be smoothed over with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All colors seem to be highly pigmented so it really doesn&#x27;t take much at all for the color to show on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to playing with this kit for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I like the lip part but the eyeshadow is really not pigment</li>
    <li> You definitely must buy brushes separately, but the colors are great! The kit is small and a little awkward though.</li>
    <li> I bought this palette for a friend for her birthday. The size is perfect for travel and it has some weight to it, so it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some palettes do. It has a great selection of colors and I think this is a great gift for someone just starting out with makeup and also for the makeup lover.</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with this product. It&#x27;s the perfect size and and very portable and easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I ordered. The colors are beautiful. It&#x27;s exactly what you see on your computer. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> omg this palette is amazing.. totally worth the money.. it has all the colours you need to get a smokey eye look!..</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to jazz up my make up look because I was feeling a little stuck in the same makeup rut, so I began watching make up you tube videos where I learned about highlight/contour, primer, blending sponges, different eyeshadow techniques and after watching many videos I came to amazon and found this kit and I love it. It has all the basic smokey eye color shades in classic charcoals/black, purple and browns my faves are the latter two. I love using the highlight and contour to give bone structure to my cute little AA nose, hollows of my cheek, highlight my forehead etc...I also love the cream glitter which I use on tear duct and inner eye and lid area. There are a ton of lip glosses but I have not ventured into using them just yet...also this kit has a bronzer but again I have milani baked bronzer and have not had a chance to try yet...I love this kit and if you love the smokey eye look you will love also...</li>
    <li> I really love it, it al what I want it &#x27; complete. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> the product came out perfect, the shadows came intact and the pigments are simply wonderful, very complete palette&#x27;m in love with her, lovers of makeup you&#x27;ll love</li>
    <li> I really like this. The size was already given to you, but I still didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but I really like that it&#x27;s not too big, and I can still manage to carry it. The only part that I didn&#x27;t like about was because coloring of the photo was a bit off, so I thought they were going to have a couple of dark blue eye shadows and black ones too. But overall, I think it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I love the colors they&#x27;re really pigmentated &amp; come off nice. I haven&#x27;t used the lip colors because I only wear chapstick. But overall this product is really really nice. It looks super fancy too haha</li>
    <li> I give my wife for gift.. My wifer is very happy.This make up is very good product..Tare care . Good  bye.</li>
    <li> This was one of the gifts my co-worker wanted from her secret Santa list. As soon as she opened her gift she was happy. Now every day she comes in with a different look. Thinking about getting one for myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s has everything. My niece loves her smokey eye set!</li>
    <li> When I first started out, this was my go-to palette because first and foremost, you get a LOT of product for a very small price compared to what you&#x27;d pay at the drug store for even half of the selection here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This box is basically all you need to pull off any look. Finding a shade to do a perfect contour is no problem at all and highlighting is a breeze as well, not to mention the excellent choice of blush shades! Throw in some great lip colors and medium coverage concealers and all you need is some foundation, maybe a primer or whatnot...but, you really can&#x27;t get a better deal for this quality and quantity of makeup. The box is surprisingly small, but when you slide the trays open, it looks much larger and most importantly, with some good brushes, the powders go a long way and you won&#x27;t be running out of any one shade for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I think this was a good deal!</li>
    <li> My makeup came with a personal touch. Nice tissue paper and a  gift bag. Oh.. .the makeup was nice too, would most definitely order again!</li>
    <li> The package arrived before it was supposed to which is always good, and it was in perfect condition BUT in simple terms..this palette sucks. The colors don&#x27;t blend well and look very chalky. It isn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> i was so excited to recieve this package but when i opened it a couple of the eyeshadows were broken..sad....:(</li>
    <li> On time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife I guess she loved it for all the colors that come with it the only problem when we got it the packaging was very messed up and must of the shades were destroyed.</li>
    <li> When my little sister is birthday I sent it to her.&lt;br /&gt;She told me that it is great kit.</li>
    <li> I love nyx make i cant complain. It reached on time within 1 week i got it to Trinidad</li>
    <li> This is the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; eyeshadow make up that I&#x27;ve ever gotten! I definitely love it and I recommend it to anybody that wants to be creative on their eyeshadow make up....!</li>
    <li> 10 hours after unwrapping,  we had every single eyeshadow tested,  with primer and without primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t believe this if I heard it from someone else,  but here&#x27;s the truth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost every shadow was nicely pigmented,  and stayed on for over 6 hours without primer,  and over 9 hours with primer.  All blended very well,  too.  All of them.  I was starting to look for a rogue shade in the group,  anything,  but nope.  No complaints.  Even the glittery ones have their uses (though not so much as eyeshadows if you&#x27;re over 15)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blushers are very nice,  but the contouring shades are even nicer and if you&#x27;re not so practiced with concealing and highlighting,  they do make it obvious about which to use where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subtle eye,  smoky eye,  glittery eye,  bright eye,  girly eye,  Mommy eye (wrinkles not included,  I&#x27;m afraid)... you can do it all.  Really,  you can.  It&#x27;s absolutely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only thing not fully tested were the lip shades - I tested about 5,  and all were subtle and not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all,  this is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a reasonable amount of time and arrived well protected none of the shadows or blushes were broken, very satisified with this item love the shades and will definately be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and wound up keeping it for myself. The colors are great and the little touches of glitter, lip color and concealer add just enough to make this kit great for home or travel.  You will need your own applicators but that is not a big deal. Lightweight and easy to use....you will not regret making this purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to play around with it a whole lot yet, but I love this palette.  The pigments are lovely and fairly true to color.  I think it&#x27;s an amazing price for all that you get in it as well.  Great little palette that is  super convenient for someone who does smokey eyes a lot.</li>
    <li> I love all the options this gives. I have brown eyes and this product works very well with my coloring.</li>
    <li> This makeup kit will last me quite awhile which was my plan. It was bigger than I expected. I love how there are plenty of eyeshadow colors to play around with. Plus the lip gloss isn&#x27;t too bold either. Now I have no clue when I&#x27;ll use the sparkly eyeshadow but I bet I&#x27;ll find use for it at some point. It is worth it. Plus NYX makeup is pretty good.</li>
    <li> It looked larger in the pictures. I probably would have bought a kit at ulta if I’d had cash instead of a gift card.</li>
    <li> Love the quality and reasonable cost of NYX!</li>
    <li> Very coo,l lots of great colors &amp; I love the case it comes in! Easy to use, stays on great.</li>
