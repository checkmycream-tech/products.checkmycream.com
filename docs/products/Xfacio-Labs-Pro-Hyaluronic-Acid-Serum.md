      <li>However, this is my honest opinion and it wasn&#x27;t altered in anyway.</li>
      <li>a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the stuff and really see a beautiful difference in my skin!    </li>
      <li>I understood it was to be a really good skin product and more potent than the two products for XFACIO I was using.  </li>
      <li>, it was a pleasant light scent</li>
      <li>We both are very happy with these products and highly recommend XFACIO LABS to anyone looking to have truly healthy skin and not just a temporary fix.</li>
      <li>I personally think that this is the absolute best hyaluronic acid I have ever experienced!</li>
      <li>Another amazing &amp; precious Anti-Aging wrinkle reducing liquid serum.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love their packaging.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed it is more radiant than before!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>TOP</li>
      <li>I bought all 4 products from XFACIO and absolutely love them.  </li>
      <li>maybe someone else will get a better experience than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>BUT I LOVE this serum.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I do notice a differrence and will be looking to purchase more of your products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have now used 3 of these products and love all of them - will continue using them moving forward.  </li>
      <li>After 5-6 days I was already able to see a difference.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>love that they use a blend of herbal ingredients to help make this formula work on our skin.</li>
      <li>I love the way this feels on my face.</li>
      <li>Love this product ...been using about a week.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products for my neck and nothing has done the job.</li>
      <li>and it was packed safely.</li>
      <li>But, it will be cumulative and will eventually help you look better the more that you use</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>I really love this anti aging serum</li>
      <li>I was very excited about this item but after having (and using it) for this amount of time</li>
      <li>It firms and tones and is very light and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes in a pretty velvet bag, and it&#x27;s a good amount for a serum.  </li>
      <li>When I received I was so excited to try it!  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, too, a mild hint of roses.</li>
      <li>honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  </li>
      <li>It is an awesome serum , I have been using it for a little over a week, my face is so more even in tone and so much more radiant.</li>
      <li>a more dewy texture.&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week for me to notice improvement, but my skin is smooth and my skin tone is even.  </li>
      <li>This hyaluronic acid serum from Xfacio Labs is a clear gel with a distinct vegetal odor dominated by the sharpness of witch hazel and the sweet floral scent of geranium oil, very delightful to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most serums are best if they are kept in the dark in a cool place.</li>
      <li>I also love that it is a Non-Comedogenic formula and is completely Botanical and  perfect for all skin types, which means it will work with sensitive skin like mine.</li>
      <li>It works by keeping the skin hydrated, elastic and youthful looking, while helping to plump fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>When I hear the name acid, I get a little nervous but after reading about Hyaluronic Acid, I realized that was a misnomer and that it is really a marvelous moisturizer.</li>
      <li>, I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this product to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one</li>
      <li>Thanks for your kind customer service.</li>
      <li>The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Another amazing &amp; precious Anti-Aging wrinkle reducing liquid serum. It smooth out my tiny wrinkles with out a facelift surgery.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best Hyaluronic Acid Serum for face ever. Thanks for your kind customer service.</li>
    <li> This worked for me!!  I tried this product because of the great reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me but this one did.  I truly believe what works for some doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. With this product, I literally saw a very noticeable difference over night and a huge difference in just days.  I&#x27;m fast approaching 50 so I&#x27;m not talking about the little crows feet and fine wrinkles that women in their late 30&#x27;s are whining about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the products are very reasonably priced, I always try products in different combinations to see if I can get results by using fewer products because of cost and time!  To save money and time,  in the last few weeks, I have just been using the Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer on my face without the spray toner and vitamin C and I have still seen results. However, keep reading!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products worked so well on my face, that last night I tried them on my forearms.  On one arm I put just the Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer.  The other arm I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer.  Again, I saw a big difference literally over night on both arms but a HUGE difference on the arm where I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid, and moisturizer  After the huge difference I saw this morning on the arm that I used 3 products instead of just 2, I&#x27;m definitely going back to using all 3 of those in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  Some people say save your money and use general witch hazel instead of purchasing a higher priced product which has witch hazel in it.  At some point I will do that comparison and update my post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  With that, keep this in mind....why would I want another bottle of something in my cabinet that doesn&#x27;t work even if it is free?!?!  I&#x27;ve lost countof the number of products I&#x27;ve purchased and thrown away because the products didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one too so that I do not catch myself without it.  As a business woman, kudos to this company for a marketing plan that not only benefits them but truly benefits the customer too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are going to see this similar but basically same post from me on the vitamin C serum and moisturizer cream.  I want my free bottle of all of them because I know they WORK for me!!  No need to recreate the wheel each time!</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a few weeks BUT I LOVE this serum.  I have spent a fortune and then some on products for my face.  I like the clean feeling this leaves with no stinky smell.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought all 4 products from XFACIO and absolutely love them.  I really see the difference in the texture and tone in my face. People are asking me what are you doing you look wonderful !! It is not greasy and no heavy perfume scent. My face feels soft with a nice healthy glow after I use all 4 products together. I use once in the morning before my makeup and than again as my nightly routine.  I have been only using for 2 weeks now can&#x27;t wait to see my improvement after long term use. The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise. I will be buying again. Love It !!</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle of this Serum.  It makes my skin feels so soft and refreshed.  And the customer service is awesome from Xfacio.  I will always have Xfacio products in my skin care collection!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it &amp; I can see that it works.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Wow, this is great stuff. You can feel the moisturizing effects and the power of this serum right from the get go. Very moisturizing indeed. I&#x27;m really impressed with this brand. I have ordered all of their products and each and everyone is terrific. I highly recommend this.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> What a great serum.  I apply it after Xfacio toner both in the morning and night and it just makes my skin glowing and very healthy looking all day.  It revives your tired skin and makes it happy again. What you get for the price is amazing.  I am very impressed and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;m definitely a fan after a couple of weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this item but after having (and using it) for this amount of time I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  I understood it was to be a really good skin product and more potent than the two products for XFACIO I was using.  However, I saw no difference.  I&#x27;m continuing to use it ....maybe to see if there will be some miracle.  It&#x27;s not a bad product but I guess I was expecting too much.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is not the same and maybe someone else will get a better experience than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave them an extra star because their customer service is second to none.</li>
    <li> I personally think that this is the absolute best hyaluronic acid I have ever experienced! I would buy it a lot more often if I could afford it!</li>
    <li> It is an awesome serum , I have been using it for a little over a week, my face is so more even in tone and so much more radiant. The skin becomes velvety and so soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> A couple of months ago, I added this serum to my skin care regimen and boy am I glad I stuck with it! After about four weeks of religiously applying it morning and night each day, a noticeable improvement became obvious. Another couple of weeks and I wouldn’t want to live without it! It smells nice, too, a mild hint of roses. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This hyaluronic acid skin serum left my skin feeling very soft and moisturized.  I hope to do another review when I have used it a little longer.</li>
    <li> An amazing product!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This hyaluronic acid serum from Xfacio Labs is a clear gel with a distinct vegetal odor dominated by the sharpness of witch hazel and the sweet floral scent of geranium oil, very delightful to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also very soothing to the skin and feels wonderful on irritated, flakey, or slightly sunburned areas.  The formula contains almost two dozen beneficial botanical ingredients intended to moisturize and protect the skin and improve its appearance with regular use over time.  The plant-derived hyaluronic acid may even help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner is packaged in what appears to be a black bottle with a safety-sealed black cap and a black label.  The thick glass is actually a deep blue or violet color and protects the contents from the harmful effects of light. Store the bottle in the refrigerator to further protect the contents and increase the refreshing effect when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is presented in a flocked drawstring pouch and would make a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfacio Labs provided a sample for testing and evaluation.</li>
    <li> I have been using the since I purchased this a couple of weeks ago and it is wonderful. After I clean my face and then I put it all over my face and it makes it feel fresh, smooth, firmer and my complexion more radiant. I use it under my daily moisturizer. You don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a short time  and I really like it! I do notice a differrence and will be looking to purchase more of your products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula K</li>
    <li> NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in my mid-40s, I have just begun to venture into trying serums.  My skin has always been on the oily side, which I think has helped protect me from TOO many wrinkles, but still, they are starting to show.  I had heard good things about both hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C, so I was hoping for good results from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum comes in a small, black glass bottle with a dropper-style dispenser.  Although normally I wouldn&#x27;t mind the dropper, I didn&#x27;t like it for this product at all.  This serum is quite thick, and thus I found it difficult to squeeze into the dropper.  Furthermore, every time I put the dropper back into the bottle, excess product spilled over the sides.  Once I did dispense the serum, however, I found it to have a nice consistency.  Although it had a thick, almost gel-like consistency, it felt lightweight on the skin and was both non-oily and non-sticky.  I did find that I had to be careful to apply the product thinly or else it would take quite awhile to dry, but otherwise, I had no issues using this serum under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, although I have been using this serum once or twice a day for over a month now, I have seen NO visible results.  I certainly don&#x27;t expect miracles from a skin care product, but I do expect SOMETHING.  I can&#x27;t report that my skin is smoother, brighter, plumper, softer, or any the effects some others have noticed.  On the plus side, I have not experienced any breakouts or other irritation as a result of using this serum.  I do believe that this product could potentially work well for the right person--perhaps someone with dry skin?  But for me, I was disappointed to have no visible results.</li>
    <li> At age 67 and having spent all of my life in the sun I figured the only thing that would help with the wrinkles would be a face lift which I wasn&#x27;t going to do - no way. I&#x27;ve tried all the face creams and moisturizers on the market. I have boxes of them to prove it and though a few of them helped a little bit none of them did what they promised. This stuff works. After one day I could see a dramatic difference and by day three I was shocked. Instant face lift?? Darn close. My face has dropped 10 to 15 years. I love it.</li>
    <li> Have now used 3 of these products and love all of them - will continue using them moving forward.  Skin feels so soft and it&#x27;s very soothing if you&#x27;ve dry and/or irritated skin.  Also, have super sensitive dry skin and have experienced no skin-related irritation, itch, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be using moving forward.</li>
    <li> great product ! my wife love it ! and wonderful customer service .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> So I was not sure if I could fit this into my casual daily skin routine.  I take care of my skin but I am not into lots of steps.  I love this serum and use it in combination with other Xfacio products.  It firms and tones and is very light and easy to use.  I love the stuff and really see a beautiful difference in my skin!    So here is my update.  Since I wrote the last review I have had to so through a difficult medical issue.  The Chemo I&#x27;ve needed plays havoc on the skin (my second round with cancer) and energy levels.  I realized several weeks in that my skin routine had been reduced to this serum and a moisturizer.  Throughout it all my skin has looked good, really good.  When your hair is falling out and looking \\&quot;normal\\&quot; is a struggle this was a real blessing.  This product works for me even when things get rough! Thanks Xfacio!</li>
    <li> I asked my young son if he thought my skin looked any better lately.  You know how boys are, he said, &amp;#34;Yeah, lately I thought it looked a bit more oily.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d noticed that too - I&#x27;d looked in the mirror in the last few days and thought that my skin looked moist and like the wrinkles looked better, because the skin seemed plumper around them.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a very good thing! My skin is normally just so dry that I was getting these super fine vertical lines all under my eyes.  This has definitely helped my skin have more moisture and a more dewy texture.&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week for me to notice improvement, but my skin is smooth and my skin tone is even.  The vitamin C level is good - I will turn beet red if it is too strong, but I&#x27;ve not had any redness or irritation at all with this.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a pretty velvet bag, and it&#x27;s a good amount for a serum.  It really doesn&#x27;t take that much.  It has a dropper with it and really only a few drops covers my face well.  This bottle should last around 2 months I think at the rate I&#x27;m using it.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and there&#x27;s hardly any missing.  Just used a few drops, then I let it dry, and I follow it with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now, I have used some serums that were better, but they were also much more expensive.  This is NOT the best I&#x27;ve ever used, but it is EXCELLENT in THIS price range.and it has definitely worked for me and I highly recommend it.  I was provided a sample for purposes of review.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it very much.</li>
    <li> The first application stunned me; it was immediate results! I have tried so many products for my neck and nothing has done the job. I decided to try this after reading all the great reviews on Xfacio products. I&#x27;ve ordered three of their products to try, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve received so far. After seeing the results of this one product, I&#x27;m convinced that the other two will be amazing as well. Do not delay, just order it! I am so glad I found this company!</li>
    <li> The Hyaluronic Serum is a very nice thick consistency that absorbs quickly and leaves no chemical scent behind. I try to make sure that the skincare products I use now are not scented as I have sinus issues and scents can really mess with them, so I make this a priority now. I also make it a priority that my serums absorb quickly and leave no shiny or greasy film on my face and this one didn&#x27;t, so that is another plus on it&#x27;s side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that they use a blend of herbal ingredients to help make this formula work on our skin. It contains no alcohols and no parabens. I also love that it is a Non-Comedogenic formula and is completely Botanical and  perfect for all skin types, which means it will work with sensitive skin like mine. It works by keeping the skin hydrated, elastic and youthful looking, while helping to plump fine lines and wrinkles. That in turn diminishes their appearance causing it to look like an instant face lift, which I love. But, it will be cumulative and will eventually help you look better the more that you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle of serum came in this velour bag and that is how I keep it stored. Most serums are best if they are kept in the dark in a cool place. If I am seeing that it might take me awhile to use up a skincare product because I review so many, I store them in the door of my fridge to help them last longer, especially all natural or organic ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I found that the cooler the serum is when putting it on, it acts like an instant line plumper and will make them disappear quicker. I learned that from listening to models who splash ice cold water on their faces right before a shoot. It constricts the blood vessels giving them a smoother and clearer face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Xfacio Labs Serum is packaged in scientifically proven Biophotonic Violet Glass which not only preserves the formula longer than any other, it actually enhances the potency over time. No other brand goes to such length or expense to ensure that you are getting the highest quality product!e that you are getting the highest quality product!</li>
    <li> Just starting using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I am not really impress with this product. I think it&#x27;s okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. As for the seller, he did a awesome job delivering product on time and it was packed safely. I give the Seller a Five Star***** But the product&lt;br /&gt;only a 3 Star ***😞</li>
    <li> Love this product ...been using about a week. I love the way it feels on my skin- a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really love this anti aging serum and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time. It goes on and disappears into my skin without any oily or sticky feeling whatsoever. My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother. I&#x27;ve tried a number of the much more expensive brand name anti aging serums and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product. There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it. I love it!</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy this again.  I have been using for 4 weeks.  After 5-6 days I was already able to see a difference.  My skin tone evened out, redness disappeared, and it virtually erased the frown lines that were beginning to appear between my eyes.  It&#x27;s not irritating, very light.  When I got up this morning, I thought, &amp;#34;I look well rested and serene.&amp;#34;  I was NOT, so I think this is really helping my skin.  And, it&#x27;s replacing a combination of more expensive treatments I was using.</li>
    <li> I am very ill but want my skin at it&#x27;s absolute best. I will be 50 this year and have used skin products since I was a teenager. I change my products when I feel I have gotten all I can expect from it and try something new. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet, it was a pleasant light scent and you don&#x27;t need much to put on your face and neck. Always rub the product lightly on your finger tips and gently work it upwards from your neck to your forehead, don&#x27;t forget your ears and around your neck to behind your ears. That helps to firm and allows the product to be absorbed. Just like other ladies I put any remaining on the backs of my hands and my lips.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now.  I donʻt see a difference in my wrinkles, but the feel of the serum is good.  Itʻs not at all greasy.  I will continue to use it to see if in a few more weeks I see some results.</li>
    <li> During try it can not tell different.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My wrinkles around my mouth are less pronounced and softer!  That was my worry area! I have good genes from my mom but the smile lines really bothered me especially after I lost some weigh and my face got thinner!&lt;br /&gt;I also use a derma roller but my results weren&#x27;t great by itself! Add the serum &amp; I see results after 2 weeks! I like what I see in the mirror! I use the serum and then my derma roller so the serum really sinks into my skin!  It has vitamin C and vitamin E which also nourish your skin and I&#x27;ve noticed it is more radiant than before!&lt;br /&gt;I did get this serum for a special price for my review but I definitely will buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;Also I want to say I am so trying to only use more natural products &amp; when I saw this coupon offer on facebook I jumped on it!&lt;br /&gt;Great decision!</li>
    <li> Love that this serum goes on and absorbs right away. My pores are looking better, smooth and fresh all over. Will be buying this again. Always trying new things but have not had the success that I am now seeing after just a week.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid is my number one favorite facial serum. This one, by Xfacio Labs, came in a very cute black drawstring bag. I absolutely love their packaging. This serum makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I can see such a big difference in my skin since I started using this. I no longer have dark circles, and it has helped even out my skin, giving me a brighter complexion. I love this product so much that I have added it into my daily skin routine. I will be purchasing this as a gift for my mom. I don&#x27;t even have to wrap it because the bag it comes in is perfect to gift. She tried mine and loved it as well. :)&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product in exchange for a review. However, this is my honest opinion and it wasn&#x27;t altered in anyway.</li>
    <li> I like  the way this feels on my face. It doesn&#x27;t cause my face to breakout. Hoping it does all it says! So far so good. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I received this serum when I was supposed to.  I absolutely love it.  I will definately buy this again.  I lives up to the description from the manufacturer</li>
    <li> I like,  I&#x27;m still using thanks.</li>
    <li> I just received my product. I like the feel of the liquid it is not greasy or sticky. Too soon to give a complete review, but time will tell.    As of 10/12/2014 I have been trying to respond to an e-mail sent by Xfacio, but the e-mail has a broken link. No way to respond.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it works!</li>
    <li> HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT LIKE THIS -- SO FAR, LIKE IT VERY MUCH -- DOES NOT MAKE SKIN FEEL GREASY --DEFINITELY THINK IT&#x27;S WORKING LIKE IT SHOULD!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I am using it with a facial machine I have instead of the really expensive product recommended and invert happy with the results I am getting.</li>
    <li> Im 52, bought before the most expensive creams, but this one is REALLY the best one!!</li>
    <li> For Mothers Day, I went through my wife&#x27;s anti aging/wrinkle eliminating miracle product stash with her. We found ingredients in all of the standard off the shelf items which cost plenty of money which were unacceptable for use on human skin. It was surprising what toxic chemicals all of these mainstream companies use. As part of the same research, we made a list of things that we would like to see not used and one of ingredients which are proven to work and non-toxic. XFACIO LABS products met all of the list requirements using ingredients like Matrixyl 3000, Jojoba oil and Retinol. These help skin maintain health from the inside instead of just puffing it up from toxicity. Now that she has been using the XFACIO line, her skin looks healthier and has a glow about it that wasn&#x27;t there before. We both are very happy with these products and highly recommend XFACIO LABS to anyone looking to have truly healthy skin and not just a temporary fix.</li>
    <li> Oh my! Words can&#x27;t even describe the incredible results of this serum! It moisturizes,evens out skin tone, brightens , &amp; just makes your skin glow! I love it that my skin looks so great from the 3 Products I am using from Xfacio! Love it so much I am now using less makeup ! This product gives you Immediate Gratification!  I highly recommend this lovely serum! Now I&#x27;m going to try the Toner! I&#x27;m hooked thanks again Xfacio</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been using this and the High Potency Anti-Aging serum, both morning and night.  I can tell a difference in my skin and it has only been a week!!!! I have used all kinds of expensive moisturizers and this tops them all!  I will definitely be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> Thank you, once again, Mia! Great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of this with the new toner and WOW!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how it works, I just know that after a week, my wrinkles are going the way of the dinosaur...extinct!&lt;br /&gt;My face is filling out and the wrinkles are disappearing. I use all of the Xfacio products, religiously, morning and night and I love the way I look!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Love this and it feels great.  Doing the job I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Use this on my neck and hands and it has helped with overall appearance of fine lines.</li>
    <li> Everyone wants to look younger and we try different things to get the best results. I just got this  Hylauronic Acid Serum from a friend and I am trying it out. I really like the way it feels on my skin, so soft and silky.  I like the packaging and drawstring bag it comes in. This would make a nice gift. I can&#x27;t wait to see my younger looking skin after a few weeks of using this product.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews....most positive but a few so-so.  When I received I was so excited to try it!  I&#x27;ve only had it two days but I feel there is a freshness to my face!  I expect on coming back here with a two week update.</li>
    <li> I did not know what to expect with this product. When I hear the name acid, I get a little nervous but after reading about Hyaluronic Acid, I realized that was a misnomer and that it is really a marvelous moisturizer. Xfacio Labs products have all worked really well for me, and this is no exception. It has a cooling, soothing feel to it and I feel very plumped up and moisturized after using this serum. I have noticed that my fine lines especially around my eyes have diminished substantially. I use this sparingly once or twice a day and I am very pleased with it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my face. Hoping it does all it says! So far so good.</li>
    <li> Just started XFACIO and love the feel of it!  I&#x27;m so excited about this product and can&#x27;t wait to the changes in my face as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is another amazing product from the Xfacio line. Within a few days I noticed a beautiful difference in my skin and hands. It does exactly what it says it will do for your skin. I believe the price is unbelievable fot this amazing product. I will continue to use this product and continue to purchase other products from this line.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; THE &amp;#34; BEST SERUM EVER TRIED ,&lt;br /&gt;OUT OF MANY.&lt;br /&gt;SUGGEST USE YOUR BEST HYDRATION CREAM AFTER APPLYING THE SERUM . TOP&lt;br /&gt;NOTCH !</li>
    <li> I started using this product two months ago and have seen big changes in my skin tone.  I am 45 years old and the mother of 6 children and no surprise my skin was starting to show it. I bought this along with the Vitamin C.  I only use it 1 time a day and can really see and feel a difference.  I can&#x27;t image how good it would work if I could get the second treatment in :)  I am a believer and have reordered including the toner and the anti aging serum.</li>
