      <li>These are great balms for chapped lips and for us who constantly put on &amp;#34;chapstick.&amp;#34; Burt&#x27;s Bees are also less likely to melt in the hot weather.</li>
      <li>Then again I swipe lip balms across my lips multiple times, so it softens relatively quickly.</li>

    <li> The taste is disgusting!!!!  Hate it</li>
    <li> I love the burst bees grapfruit set, I use it with a special lipstick and it taste like fruity pebbles. It smells great too</li>
    <li> Such a smooth texture, not gritty or slimey like some lip balms. A hint of grapefruit but not overpowering. Can&#x27;t beat the natural ingredients either.</li>
    <li> If you like grape fruit, you will love this product.</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes my lip feel much better in dry weather. Always put it in my bag. Highly recommend .</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, very refreshing.</li>
    <li> This formula keeps my lips from getting chapped and heals them if I apply the lip balm after they are already chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a fruity, citrusy (I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a word, but whatever) scent. It isn&#x27;t strong enough to bother me, but it is strong enough to notice. A nice middle ground. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A tasty and great-smelling lip balm from the great people at Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> keeps my lip sort of moisturized but i think it was just a dupe- not the real hurts bee&#x27;s lip balm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a long time chapstick user but finally decided this year to venture into other product lines.  Burt&#x27;s Bees caught my attention immediately since they had such a great spread of lip balm products.  After trying all of them, Pink Grapefruit is definitely my favorite.  It&#x27;s a nice clean smell that wears off nicely.  You won&#x27;t smell it for the rest of the day on your lips.  It spreads cleanly and easily (often better than my chapsticks) and works as I&#x27;d like it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, very pleased with this lip balm and bought lots.</li>
    <li> Great stuff with a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Heals, moisturizes and best of all: Smells and tastes EXACTLY like grapefruit, not fake or chemical-tasting at all. What could be better?</li>
    <li> Not much else I can say about it, really. Only issue with it for me is that it takes a bit for the balm to soften up. Then again I swipe lip balms across my lips multiple times, so it softens relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> Good balm! Feels tingly at first and you have to reapply a bit at first but overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I used to be a regular user of Blistex. I still like them but have been really enjoying most of the flavored Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms. I love pink grapefruit and this balm has the light taste of it. These are great balms for chapped lips and for us who constantly put on &amp;#34;chapstick.&amp;#34; Burt&#x27;s Bees are also less likely to melt in the hot weather.</li>
    <li> yum - for those who don&#x27;t care for minty lip balm, this pink grapefruit flavored balm from Burt&#x27;s Bees is great!</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It moisturizes well. I like how compared to the mint eucalyptus menthol one, this one doesn&#x27;t break apart. The lip balm itself stays relatively solid and doesn&#x27;t mush around and seep out. It does a little but not enough to hate it. The eucalyptus menthol one sucks and does that a lot. I&#x27;m on accurate and this product does a good job of keeping me moist.</li>
