<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Perfect purse/pocket size (lipstick/capstick size). No leakage. Pretty green color. Roller ball works great.</li>
    <li> Pretty color! Nice bottles for essential oil blends. I use these for gifts.</li>
    <li> good. does what I need it to do..</li>
    <li> They work just as expected.</li>
    <li> It only came with four.</li>
    <li> I love these bottles, not only are they a pretty color but the roller tips fit tight and the caps go on smoothly. I really like using them with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Will continue ordering these as my business grows!</li>
    <li> The oil seems to come up heavier than some other bottles that I have used but not to the point where it is a problem.  I&#x27;ve been happy with these and would order again.</li>
    <li> Did have some leakage from the plastic roller.  Otherwise, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Used this for a small mix of essential oils for topical use. Very nice look, no butters or waxes used to deliver the oil makes iPad very light and thin application.</li>
    <li> I ordered these bottles almost a month ago and waited until a few days ago to use them. I was disappointed.  I made some perfume and poured it in one bottle and the roller ball top does not dispense the perfume. I tried repeatedly rolling and pressing down on it, onto a piece of cardboard. It came out slightly that way, but I rubbed my arm until it was red trying that approach on my skin LOL.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I can return them now, it has been too long, my fault for waiting this long to try them. I didn&#x27;t expect to have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;So far 2 tops don&#x27;t work out of the six.</li>
    <li> Roller balls don&#x27;t roll easily.  If there is a trick I would love to know what it is?!!!  I love my essential oils but this is making it difficult to use them in a roller ball bottle!</li>
    <li> Loving the color.  These are just as pictured.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The ball does not roll well. The caps snap in so tightly, making it hard to refill it.</li>
    <li> the rollar ball gets stuck. They dont glide the product on very well</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as thought they would. Also could be I don&#x27;t know how to use properly.</li>
    <li> Within minutes of putting oil in these roll ons the roll on ball fell out spilling my oil! This has happend to 3 out of the 6 I bought so far. Do not buy these roll ons.</li>
    <li> Bottles are as described. Surprisingly fast delivery. Good deal/price. Definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> these get the job done and are a good price.</li>
    <li> A very nice container to use with oil and aromatherapy. Works very well.</li>
    <li> These came very fast and I love the quality of this glass. Thank you! I cannot wait to mix my oils in it.</li>
    <li> I love the size and color of these bottles. I&#x27;m just having problems with the ball. They keep popping out. I actually already lost 1 ball from it falling out. But it&#x27;s a great price for what you&#x27;re getting!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 of these bottles so far &amp; have had no problem with leakage. Even just tossing them into my purse. Nice heavy glass. Will definitely order these again.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged. Perfect little containers.</li>
    <li> Not bad bottles, i wish the rollers were a bit smoother but overall not bad.</li>
    <li> I read lots and lots of reviews about roll on glass bottles before I decided to buy this one.  The bottle is as good as everyone said it was.  It is very easy to get the plastic roller part on and off in order to re-fill the bottle.  The rollers work and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with it rolling properly.  The only reason I marked this a 4 star is that I have not transported this bottle in my purse or other bag so I have no idea if it leaks or not.  I leave my bottles standing upright in my bathroom cupboard or bedside.&lt;br /&gt;Note that the bottle is not made from green glass.  There is an outer green coating that could scratch off.  But for me it serves the purpose of keeping the essential oils from direct light and I&#x27;m assuming this feature will prolong the life of the oils.</li>
    <li> great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Roller ball doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, but have also had other brands that didn&#x27;t work at all, so going to say ok on these.  Still looking for a brand that is consistently good.</li>
    <li> I ordered green ones and purple ones.  The purple were just fine, but one of the green ones had a partially melted or chipped bottom.  It does not sit up straight on a level surface.</li>
    <li> The rollers aren&#x27;t the greatest quality - they get stuck and won&#x27;t roll well, even with oils in them.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s due to using with thicker oils, but occasionally I have to roll the ball with my finger to get it working. Other than that I&#x27;m very pleased. No breaking or leakage thus far.</li>
    <li> wonderful bottles.. lids and rollers fit well - no leaks</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Nicely packaged.  No leaking from the ones I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> great for my perfumes!</li>
    <li> Love these little rollers!</li>
    <li> These glass roller bottles have been great for mixing and sharing essential oils and carrier oils.  The roller fits well in the top of the glass bottle and the lids keeps everything secure and leak-free.  I like the dark color to maintain the integrity of my essential oils and protect them from sunlight.</li>
    <li> Came a day after delivery date. The bottles seem to work well. No leaking yet.</li>
    <li> Ball snaps on tightly to secure no leakage.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my essential oil concoctions! Easy to insert and remove the tops, no leaks, and my friends love them, too. I got some cheap stickers from the Dollar Tree and just secure with tape to make perfect little labels. I use them every single day myself but have given many away to friends and family as well, no complaints so far. (I also have two sets in blue from this seller, which are also lovely.)</li>
    <li> They are what is said however the roller popped out after only using the bottle a bit. OK for the price.</li>
    <li> No surprises here. Product was exactly as described and functions as expected. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would purchase more if/when needed.</li>
    <li> Works great and love the green color.</li>
    <li> The bottles are nice, but once filled, the plastic roller ball doesn&#x27;t move well. It has a tendency to slide across the skin without rolling through the liquid in the bottle.</li>
    <li> The rollers work good. You just have to roll it around to lubricate it after you put oil in.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> I love these green bottles and will use them often.  Great look for aromatherapy products and the finish on them is clear and bright!&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering these again in the near future.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle, doesn&#x27;t leak, arrived neatly packaged.  Very nice!  A tip on putting the rollerball in, if you have trouble: Put the rollerball on the best you can, then screw the cap all the way down.  When you unscrew the cap, the rollerball will be nice and tight in the bottle.</li>
    <li> These are great. I am so happy with them. I love the color and have had no problems with leaking!</li>
    <li> They work great, the rollers are very smooth and do not stick.</li>
    <li> too big i returned them for dram size roll on bottles</li>
    <li> Just like the description. Perfect bottles for oils.</li>
    <li> These work great. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with leaking nor problems with the plastic roller ball. I  will update when the product has been in the bottle longer than a month.</li>
    <li> I wanted to really like these, but the two I&#x27;ve used already the ball falls out. Has caused messes in my purse</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t roll well at all. They are VERY stiff.</li>
    <li> Perfect hight quality glass with easy roller</li>
    <li> Nice price, don&#x27;t leak</li>
    <li> I love the price and the product..</li>
    <li> Kinda expensive. Good bottles tho.</li>
    <li> Great product--haven&#x27;t had any problems with the rollers (getting them out or in) and they arrived very fast!</li>
    <li> I bought these, even though I didn&#x27;t really need any roller bottles at this time, because green is my favorite color.  I love these.</li>
    <li> No leakage.  Great.  Will buy more.</li>
    <li> beautiful and practical : )</li>
    <li> Good product.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Love them!  They work great!</li>
    <li> Bottles I ordered came on time and look nice. I haven&#x27;t filled them yet but I am pleased so far .</li>
    <li> The bottles were as discribed and I am happy with them</li>
    <li> Roll ball doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> Great roll-on bottles. Roller and cap fit tight.</li>
    <li> I purchased to have an easy was to apply essential oil perfume, that I wanted to make. Loving it, no leaks.</li>
    <li> Great quality, thick glass. A nice change from clear bottles :)</li>
    <li> This item works good with my oils. And my clients say works well for them.</li>
    <li> These work fine and are reasonably priced.  The only reason I give four stars is because, after using both, I do prefer a metal rollerball. They still are a good buy, and I probably will buy again to make essential oil blends to share with friends and family.  No leakage at all!</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t work. Very disappointed now that I have filled two of them. Will not be getting these again.</li>
    <li> Love, love these beautiful bottles for my EO roller balls.  Green is a fav, so this was a must. Bottle is perfection; roller ball and cap fit tightly.  Packaging was great and arrived quickly.  I will definitely re-order from this vendor.  The quality is superb.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Gets the job done perfectly! No leaks, no problems!</li>
    <li> Very nice color and works well with oils.</li>
    <li> One of them was not working and they refunded my money for them all.</li>
    <li> I use these for essential oils blends and couldn&#x27;t be happier. They do not leak and look good too. I have other colors and love them all.</li>
