      <li>I absolutely love this eyeliner, Too Faced has become one of my favorite makeup products.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i love this product&lt;</li>
      <li>(not to mention that I LOVE that it&#x27;s cruelty free).</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this since so many of the reviews tout the waterproof/no smudge feature.</li>
      <li>Faced truly is smudge and water proof, but will dissipate by the end of the day (instead of the hour, with most)---which is fine with me.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with the color, compared to the others I was using, the color is a jet black,</li>
      <li>I bought this as a little treat for myself and am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Smooth distribution and will not smudge during the day.</li>
      <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great pigmentation, goes on smooth, stays put all</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and stays all day.  </li>

      <li>It goes on boldly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent eyeliner but does not stay on the waterline for more than 1 hour.</li>
      <li>eyeliner in black, it was all I bought because I was pretty happy with it.  </li>
      <li>A quick black line and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It broke right away</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would really love to see this same formula in a &#x27;twist up&#x27; variation instead of having to sharpen with a sharpener.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I really like them!</li>
      <li>First time I looked in the mirror it was smudged.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many supposedly waterproof and smudge proof eye pencils only to find that they aren&#x27;t, in fact, either.</li>
      <li>I also have some of their eyeshadows and just recently tried out their Better Than Sex Mascara(Amazing).</li>
      <li>I will not use any other kind.</li>
      <li>It gets even more dull, resulting in a more smudgy look, when I prefer cleaner lines.</li>
      <li>It glides on smoothly and has quite the creamy texture so it is important to freeze it in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before sharpening for less likelyhood of breakage.</li>
      <li>so I dont have to push hard to get good application.</li>
      <li>Pigmentation for the black is amazing really vibrant.</li>
      <li>Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Really like how it stays on well, but always have your sharpen with  you when you travel</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to try other \\&quot;waterproof&#x27; eye pencils out there... :)</li>
      <li>Glides on very smooth, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s not enough on the stick for the price</li>
      <li>This liner is very soft and gildes on really well.</li>
      <li>Its fine for my upper lid, but not waterproof enough for my water line.</li>
      <li>Comparing them to the application of the other two, I had to apply the others over and over trying to intensify the color and make it smooth.  </li>
      <li>After the first couple uses when it comes time to sharpen it does not go back to it</li>
      <li>In the morning, if I don&#x27;t remove my makeup I do have more pronounced raccoon eyes than I would with the other two but as long as it stays put the evening before</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just that soft.</li>
      <li>even pretty long on the water/tightline.</li>
      <li>and it was soft and bent.</li>
      <li>The pencil is soft, and thats exactly what I wanted, one tip is the pencil in the color I bought, Perfect&lt;br /&gt;Black, the other is a soft spongy tip to gently daub it once you put the line on, dont use a heavy hand, its so soft it goes on easily, then you can smear it slightly with the other end.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are more expensive but, for me,  they are worth not having to go through the frustration of the application of the other two.  </li>
      <li>And the tip broke right away when I got it, so that seemed like a waste.</li>
      <li>to justify value since you have to sharpen the pencil every other day or so and the actual product breaks off pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I learned that the hard way with my mac liners, Worth the money!</li>
      <li>stumbled on these and was reading the helpful, positive reviews and decided to try them out in black.  </li>
      <li>This one just glides on, and its easy to blend and smudge if you don&#x27;t want a stark black line.  </li>

    <li> I bought this as a little treat for myself and am very happy with it. It glides on smoothly and has quite the creamy texture so it is important to freeze it in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before sharpening for less likelyhood of breakage. I learned that the hard way with my mac liners, Worth the money! Pigmentation for the black is amazing really vibrant. Stays on all day as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner, Too Faced has become one of my favorite makeup products. I have this eyeliner in Perfect Storm and Perfect Peacock and just recently got the Perfect Black Orchid. &amp;#60;3 I also have some of their eyeshadows and just recently tried out their Better Than Sex Mascara(Amazing). Wearing the mascara with this eyeliner makes my eyes look fantastic, I get lots of compliments. &#x3D;] If you haven&#x27;t tried this eyeliner yet I recommend you do.</li>
    <li> Comes off after about an hour of waring it</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great pigmentation, goes on smooth, stays put all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hard to justify value since you have to sharpen the pencil every other day or so and the actual product breaks off pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would really love to see this same formula in a &#x27;twist up&#x27; variation instead of having to sharpen with a sharpener.</li>
    <li> Was so hopeful that it would stay put all day. It doesn&#x27;t. First time I looked in the mirror it was smudged. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star is because I don&#x27;t personally like pencils that I have to sharpen.  Otherwise, this was water and smudge proof.</li>
    <li> Bought for special occasions applies easily, and stays on great. Is very dark and only needs one layer, the only thing I would change is a built in sharpener or something similar.</li>
    <li> Only got to uses before it needs to be sharpened. Also was a humid day and after 8 hours it had smeared. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got this in black, espresso, and brown.  It&#x27;s my favorite; I use it every day.  It goes on smoothly and stays all day.  It goes on boldly so I dont have to push hard to get good application.</li>
    <li> Glides on very smooth, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s not enough on the stick for the price</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner. Really lasts all day.</li>
    <li> this is the BEST eyeliner on the market.&lt;br /&gt;others give me an allergic reaction...this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it</li>
    <li> So ,far this is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve bought. Lasts all day...even pretty long on the water/tightline.</li>
    <li> I  was using the  [[ASIN:B000H3EO3O Revlon ColorStay Eyeliner with SoftFlex, Black 201, 0.01 Ounce (28 g)]] eyeliner in black, it was all I bought because I was pretty happy with it.  In an effort to save some money, I ended up ordering these as well, [[ASIN:B00433VGVW Prestige Mechanical Eye Pencil, Black, 0.01-Ounce (Pack of 3)]].  So I have been using these two interchangeably.  I put on my eyeliner after my eyeshadow and my problem was that the revlon would, I don&#x27;t know, maybe get coated with powder and I had a hard time applying it.  The Prestige one was easier but the color was lighter but I also had problems applying it.  They didn&#x27;t glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled on these and was reading the helpful, positive reviews and decided to try them out in black.  I really like them! I am very happy with the color, compared to the others I was using, the color is a jet black, its dark, intense making the other two look grayish. Comparing them to the application of the other two, I had to apply the others over and over trying to intensify the color and make it smooth.  I was constantly sharpening them trying to see if that would help and it would, a little.  This one just glides on, and its easy to blend and smudge if you don&#x27;t want a stark black line.  This one does smudge more, the others do have more staying power. In the morning, if I don&#x27;t remove my makeup I do have more pronounced raccoon eyes than I would with the other two but as long as it stays put the evening before, I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are more expensive but, for me,  they are worth not having to go through the frustration of the application of the other two.  Its faster and I am happier with the results.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner out there! I will not use any other kind. Smooth distribution and will not smudge during the day.</li>
    <li> i love this product&lt;br /&gt;i love this product&lt;br /&gt;i love this product&lt;br /&gt;i love this product&lt;br /&gt;i love this product&lt;br /&gt;I think this might be the best eyeliner I have ever used - It never moves when I am at work!!! love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many supposedly waterproof and smudge proof eye pencils only to find that they aren&#x27;t, in fact, either. Too Faced truly is smudge and water proof, but will dissipate by the end of the day (instead of the hour, with most)---which is fine with me.  It&#x27;s great, too, that it&#x27;s made without paraban&#x27;s, like most.</li>
    <li> Really like how it stays on well, but always have your sharpen with  you when you travel b/c you&#x27;ll use it at least every other day!</li>
    <li> I love it.  The pencil is soft, and thats exactly what I wanted, one tip is the pencil in the color I bought, Perfect&lt;br /&gt;Black, the other is a soft spongy tip to gently daub it once you put the line on, dont use a heavy hand, its so soft it goes on easily, then you can smear it slightly with the other end.  Great product specially for those times I want a dramatic look when I go out for the evening.</li>
    <li> GREAT product with good quality!!!  :D  My only complaint is that sharpening it is difficult and you waist a lot of the eyeliner while doing it.  AMAZING eye liner and stay ability!!!  (not to mention that I LOVE that it&#x27;s cruelty free).</li>
    <li> This liner is very soft and gildes on really well. Its fine for my upper lid, but not waterproof enough for my water line. I find that it hurts my eyes if i try to wear it on my lower lashes.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this since so many of the reviews tout the waterproof/no smudge feature. Unfortunately that&#x27;s just not the case. This is actually worse than the eyeliner that I was trying to replace (the Lancome waterproof pencil.) Both come off on my upper eyelid, but this one comes off and then is impossible to get off the upper eyelid. Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know of a pencil-type eyeliner that I can use for smokey eyes (so no liquid liners) but won&#x27;t smudge during the day, please leave a comment. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am not sure what ingredient is causing it, but I am having an allergic reaction under my eyes. It&#x27;s a decent eyeliner but does not stay on the waterline for more than 1 hour. It also doesn&#x27;t stay too well under the eye. Though it does stay on the eyelid. I would prefer to get a refund due to the allergic reaction within 2 weeks, but I guess we will see.</li>
    <li> It broke right away it was a waste of my hard earned money I didn&#x27;t send it back cause I didnt save the box</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect shapener for this pencil though. After the first couple uses when it comes time to sharpen it does not go back to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fresh out the box&amp;#34; point. it&#x27;s just that soft. It gets even more dull, resulting in a more smudgy look, when I prefer cleaner lines. Ah....the struggle.</li>
    <li> I like this for my top lid. Goes on great, and stays on all day. I don&#x27;t like it on my undereye. It does not stay on well. And the tip broke right away when I got it, so that seemed like a waste. Apply very lightly, no need to put pressure.</li>
    <li> I just started wearing black eyeliner on the waterline b/c I&#x27;m too lazy to wear mascara when traveling. A quick black line and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I opened the pencil and it was soft and bent. So already I lost some pencil.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on the upper and lower waterline of the eye, and the lower came off almost instantly. The upper stayed on for a couple of hours b4 smearing, which I just touched up - no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to remove with eye makeup remover - it was tough! And my eyes were red and yucky!&lt;br /&gt;So will I continue to use on the upper lid - you bet.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;d like to try other \\&quot;waterproof&#x27; eye pencils out there... :)</li>
