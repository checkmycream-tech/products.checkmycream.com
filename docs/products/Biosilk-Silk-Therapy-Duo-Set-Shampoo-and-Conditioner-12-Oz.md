      <li>Ever have dry or damaged hair, Biosilk is best!</li>
      <li>My hair feels very soft after a wash, and supplemented with a shine serum, my hair feels great after a blow-dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair comes out looking and feeling healthy.  I use these because they go with Biosilk Silk Therapy, which gives my hair much nicer texture, more silky and nicer drape</li>
    <li> Great Product!! Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> Good deal. Excellent product. Really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Love it, my hair dresser uses it also.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product. The bottles don&#x27;t have the different colors and my hair doesn&#x27;t react the same way.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product that you will find in the store.  The bottles that I received have a different design than shown.  It&#x27;s also different from the bottles at your local drugstore.  The bottles are missing the seal that they normally have.  And the product smells similar, but not quite the same.  It&#x27;s shampoo, so I&#x27;ll use it.  But I would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner SO much. If you&#x27;re looking for something a little cheaper with similar results as far as what your hair looks like after it&#x27;s dried, I would recommend trying John Frieda&#x27;s Smooth Start shampoo and conditioner. I alternate between John Frieda and Biosilk every week or so and my hair always feels great and looks healthy. My hair is a combination of being wavy straight and thick to normal, if that helps with anyone&#x27;s decision. You definitely won&#x27;t regret this purchase! And it comes with a free gift! Good luck guys!</li>
    <li> Bio Silk is the best for hair care..I use all the hair care products and this is the best way to get these.  fast,easy and less expensive.</li>
    <li> Was glad to find at such a  great price and Prime shipping!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Fast Shipping. Product exactly what I expected. Thank you</li>
    <li> I first bought this from Target when it was on sale for $3.95 each, when Target was trying to clear it&#x27;s stock. After I ran out, I wanted to buy more but the original price for one bottle is around $9-13. I went online and found this great deal for this amazing duo. My hair is so much healthier (says my hair stylist) and it feels a lot more silkier. A great product!</li>
    <li> where I live, if I want nice hair, I have to pay 25 bucks for each of these items, so it is nice to get both for such a great price. Best hair products on the market</li>
    <li> love the way this smells :)</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product and I love it. Makes my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Shampoo and conditioner are fine, just not going to order online anymore. Thank you for swift delivery. Not much else to say about product.</li>
    <li> Great products. I&#x27;ve used for several years and love the results of both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair feels very soft after a wash, and supplemented with a shine serum, my hair feels great after a blow-dry. That said, I have left a 4 star because the packaging is not good. I have ordered this set twice, and the shampoo cap opening is too small to allow the liquid to flow freely. I always have to remove the cap to pour out the shampoo. In a shower, with wet hands, this is a bit of a difficult thing to do. Also because the conditioner is so creamy and thick, packaging it in a bottle is not ideal. It is too thick to come out of the small opening with the current toggle cap. The conditioner should instead be packaged in an easy to squeeze tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall very good product but the bad packaging is ruining the customer experience. I&#x27;d reconsider buying just owing to the packaging.</li>
    <li> I bought this duo thinking it would smell like the Biosilk lotion I received at a resort in Mexico. Wrong! And I have to use tons of conditioner to get the knots out. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Having bought this product from CVS earlier, I was pretty excited about getting back to it. Turns out that this one is just not the same. Leaves my hair stripped of moisture, fuzzy and weighed down! Am pretty sure that wasn&#x27;t how I felt about the product the first time. Complete waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> My go-to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST SHAMPOO AND COND. EVER MADE!  I love this stuff! and this is the cheapest price I have ever found! was shipped and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and crème rinse are incredible.  For people that have thick, curly hair or have unruly gray hair, this duo is the answer!  My hair has never felt so silky and smooth!  I will recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is perfect for washing weaves... I&#x27;m being honest my friend told me about it and I washed the hair and it came out soft and smelled good. I paid a lot for this hair and I&#x27;m trying to make it last and keep looking amazing and this was the perfect product.</li>
    <li> Not even biosilk. Swears it was direct from manufacturer but yet there&#x27;s dollar store like price tag stuck on the bottle. I&#x27;ve used biosilk for a long time and there is about zero chance this stuff was legit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Biosilk Shampoo and Conditioner for several months now and love them. I get a keratin treatment every few months and this product works great at keeping my hair softer and less frizzy in between treatments. I&#x27;ve tried several different products that are save for keratin treated hair but so far this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well</li>
    <li> I love these products and they are hard to find except in salons.  Salon prices are HIGH.  These items are very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> good shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair feels honestly silky smooth and smells great. I will continue to purchase this regularly.</li>
    <li> This is the same product I&#x27;ve purchased at Target and Ulta.  It works well, leaves my hair soft and not a lot of build up.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these products and has bought them repeatedly ever since.</li>
    <li> There is not much in the bottles either, will NOT be purchasing this again. I hate the feeling of the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived earlier than expected. Wonderful experience for a great value as well.</li>
    <li> It smells fantastic!!  It makes my hair feel soft and silky and shiny!! not much is needed.. a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok..haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference...would not go out of my way to purchase exact same thing.</li>
    <li> Product was deluded (at lot). It was no way near the thick texture of the one we bought from Target.</li>
    <li> Ever have dry or damaged hair, Biosilk is best! It is expensive, but so worth it if nothing else seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Always liked this brand. This is the first time purchase here. Seems genuine. Will consider repurchase.</li>
    <li> I used be a live maniquin with shoulder length hair for a top farouk stylist, and used I only farouk exclusively. Most the time I just used silk therapy shampoo and conditioner, and would always get compliments about how healthy my hair was.  I no longer model for them but will still continue to use farouk because I have not found ANY product that keeps my hair as healthy and good looking as farouk biosilk line.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the positive reviews for this product, unless I somehow got bad batch. This product is very watered down and does not lather easily... In fact, I have found that in order for my hair to actually get clean, I need to use the shampoo twice, otherwise, it remains greasy after a wash. The conditioner is a little better than the shampoo, but for the price, I was incredibly disappointed with the end results. I think I&#x27;ll be going back to Pantene.</li>
    <li> Finally decided to try both the shampoo and conditioner.  Got tired of feeling my hair is dry  after every shower  using the other shampoo products. I should have try these sooner. Love how nice and soft it leaves my hair. If I let it air dry it doesn&#x27;t puff up like before. I also use the silk oil. All three used together are a great combo :)</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the price. It was sealed as Biosilk does with all of their products, so I know it was new and authentic.</li>
    <li> Good scent and makes my hair very soft. Mixed hair relaxed straight.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smells amazing and my hair is very think and silky with it :)</li>
    <li> First time I tried this product it was amazing. It cleaned, tamed the frizzies, and makes my hair feel baby soft. Now not so much. I blame my hair more than the product. My hair is thin, heavily treated, and frizzes easy (more from being fine rather than damaged), also it is prone to get oily quickly the first 2-3 inches but then it is dry from that point onward. Using this product now it seems to not really tame the frizzes as much as it once did and my hair is dull and lifeless, although my hair is still very soft. Finding a great shampoo is extremely difficult for me, so I don&#x27;t want to dissuade people from buying but if your hair is as difficult to tame as mine is this may not be the shampoo/conditioner for you.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great and cleans really well but the conditioner is terrible. It feels like it would work well but it does not mix into hair and does not leave conditioned feel.</li>
    <li> Awesome price!!!! Just a couple of dollars more for the set than just 1 bottle in the stores.</li>
    <li> Too new to judge. As far as the price, they are very expensive. the formula is not filled up to the top of each container</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair care products that I have ever bought. I love it leaves your hair smelling really good.</li>
    <li> I saw this on the TV show Celebrity Apprentice and just had to try it! My daughter is doing my hair today. I hope I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I have a granddaughter with very long, fine hair. This product makes the hair brushing routine much less painful for her.</li>
    <li> Good price for a great product. Hair is literally like silk!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this  shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now very glowing and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it, love it....</li>
    <li> this is a fake product. I had purchased a set before and I was so excited to get another one from Amazon but unfortunately, the product turned out to be fake. It smelled different, felt different and did not have the same effect at all. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> This is a great product  I was introduced to it through my daughter.  I have curly hair which tends to be dry and in humidity as in Florida where I reside, it is the pits.  With Biosilk I can wash my hair and still have controlled, tamed and vibrant looking hair.</li>
    <li> My hair type: Naturally curly, with dark brown permanent dye, I used to relax my hair but stopped almost 5 years ago, I did a brazilian blow out over a year and a half ago, but it&#x27;s mostly washed out of my hair so I&#x27;m pretty much back to my natural texture, I wash&amp;set (dominican style) my hair once or twice a week and flat iron on a rare occasion (try to avoid heat styling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo &amp; Conditioners I&#x27;ve Used before and LOVED: Matrix Smooth and Sleek (in the orange bottle), J of Beverly Hills, Brazilian Blowout, Redken Soft, Redken Smooth Down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of: Pantene ProV, Garnie Fructise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: I felt compelled to write a review because I read so many bad reviews of this product. It was on sale at Rite Aid (buy the shampoo for $14.99 and get conditioner free), and I had previously used the shine serum and loved it so I was shocked to see so many people so disatisfied with the shampoo and conditioner. I bought it anyway, thinking I would use it tonight and return it tomorrow if it was a total disaster. I used it today and my hair looks and feels very smooth and shiny and I don&#x27;t feel like I have a residue left in my hair. Prior to buying this set, I was using a paraben free, color safe shampoo (J of Beverly Hills), pretty pricey but very moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I was tempted to buy it again, but my hair gets &amp;#34;bored&amp;#34; if I use the same products back to back. I never buy the giant sizes in shampoo and conditioners because I need to switch it up every few months. Over all, very pleased with this product. The shampoo didn&#x27;t lather that much on my hair but that&#x27;s not really something I look for in shampoo. I just massaged it into my scalp and rinsed it through the rest of my hair (repeated 2 more times.....I have a lot of thick hair). I used about a quarter sized amount each time I shampoo&#x27;ed. It rinsed clean and did feel slightly moisturizing. I then applied the conditioner - I used about 2 tbsp of conditioner maybe slightly more. It felt pretty silky in my hair immediately. I put a plastic cap on and sat under the hair dryer for 10 minutes and rinsed it out with cold water. I went swimming at the pool 2 days ago and I felt like my hair needed the extra conditioning. I was thinking of doing an egg or mayo hair mask but after using this conditioner, I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed it at all. My hair felt very soft and smooth. I typically do not comb my hair when I have conditioner in. I just rinsed out the conditioner, towel dried and then parted my hair into sections so that I could set in the rollers. The hair was so smooth that it really took no effort to put in the rollers. I would normally detangle each section of hair using a wide tooth comb but the hair was so smooth, I was able to quickly detangle each section with a rat tail comb. I sat under the hair dryer for 40 minutes, let the rollers cool down and then removed them. My hair was completely dry, smooth, shiny and soft, with a lot of body and movement. It also smells very nice, but not at all over powering as I had previously read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - extremely satisfied, I would definitely recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone with my similar hair type.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with these products. It didn&#x27;t make my hair shine and it felt dirty the next day. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a spa day for your hair! But at your own house!</li>
    <li> This set is so great. When I used the Silk Therapy Duo set, I felt my hair seemed like strong and healthy. The smell is nothing special, but that is good.</li>
    <li> Great item! Just as promised. Would reorder from this business again!</li>
    <li> Use it if you color your hair and it is dry.  Use Bio Silk &amp;#34;Silk Therapy&amp;#34; after the conditioner.  You will love the results.</li>
