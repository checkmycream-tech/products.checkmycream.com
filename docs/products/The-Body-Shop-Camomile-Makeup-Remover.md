      <li>it&#x27;s not as nice as the rest of the products in this collection</li>
      <li>I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate the very sensitive skin around my eye; however it doesn&#x27;t do the best job at removing stubborn waterproof mascara, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>

      <li>Very effective, and causes zero irritation to my sensitive eyes.</li>

      <li>Truly gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>Gentle, effective and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
      <li>Non greasy and gentle on  your eyes while removing makeup quickly and effectively.</li>

      <li>Gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting and it works really well.</li>

      <li>In milder, non-dry weather I want a little more thorough cleansing, I simply add a dollop of regular gentle facial cleanser (Cetaphil/Aquanil,  Vanicream Gentle Foaming, CeraVe Foaming, Neutrogena Ultra, etc) and it cleanses well without drying out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve promoted it to &amp;#34;Dry Winter Morning Facial Cleanser,&amp;#34; since it is both gentle and cleansing at the same time.</li>
      <li>Very watered down.  </li>

    <li> I hate oily makeup removers. This one is clean and does a good job. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. The company is also against animal testing and I&#x27;m all for saving critters.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t burn at allll it&#x27;s amazingggg</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover is terrific.  I have very sensitive eyes and it works great and I never have a reaction from it.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup remover! I&#x27;ve used it once before (I bought a small 2oz bottle in case I didn&#x27;t like it) and was pleased with the way the product treated my skin so I bought another. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since high school. I just had my 30th reunion this past summer. Need i say anymore?</li>
    <li> Good eye makeup remover without oily buildup.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate the very sensitive skin around my eye; however it doesn&#x27;t do the best job at removing stubborn waterproof mascara, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this makeup remover for almost 10 years and I haven&#x27;t found anything better. Non greasy and gentle on  your eyes while removing makeup quickly and effectively. Also does not burn your eyes.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful at getting eye makeup off. I highly recommend it. There is no painful eyes after using this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years I hope it never gets discontinued.  Not oily and removes waterproof eye make up with ease!</li>
    <li> wtf, this burns the hell out of my face and can&#x27;t do anything to remove my eye makeup, soooooooo BAD</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this great Body Shop product for YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s THE BEST and so glad I can get it here.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye makeup remover!</li>
    <li> This has become SO much more than just a makeup for me. Now, it is NOT for waterproof mascara. Regular, maybe, but not waterproof. That said, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I swipe the cotton pad across my eyes to remove shadow and under-eye concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve promoted it to &amp;#34;Dry Winter Morning Facial Cleanser,&amp;#34; since it is both gentle and cleansing at the same time. Isimply pour a moderate amount onto a cotton pad and swipe it all over my face, repeating with a second application if necessary, then rinsing with either a wash cloth or just plain splashing water. In milder, non-dry weather I want a little more thorough cleansing, I simply add a dollop of regular gentle facial cleanser (Cetaphil/Aquanil,  Vanicream Gentle Foaming, CeraVe Foaming, Neutrogena Ultra, etc) and it cleanses well without drying out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS, however, pricey. I could say a little goes a long way, but it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s basically water with very mild detergents in it and it pours out like water. I usually use 2 applications. But I imagine nearly ever other makeup remover in the market could be used this way, most of them much cheaper than this one.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this stuff! I have sensitive eyes and have used it for years - LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Very gentle on your skin yet removes all eye makeup residue.</li>
    <li> Very effective, and causes zero irritation to my sensitive eyes. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> The only eye make up remover!  I have used it for years and years. Very gentle.</li>
    <li> Received as described</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be gentle but still stings/burns the sensitive skin around my eyes when I use it everyday. I found it works best when I apply it to wet skin (wash face but don&#x27;t dry). Then it doesn&#x27;t have a chance to sting so bad. It does remove makeup successfully.</li>
    <li> This is my go to eye makeup remover.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Favorite remover for 10+ years!</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove Body Shop waterproof mascara, and it didn&#x27;t work at all. It took off my eye shadow, but I think water would have done that, too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting and it works really well.</li>
    <li> Truly gentle but effective. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am never tempted to try a different brand. That&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it works great. Gentle on the eyes and it cleans makeup off quickly.</li>
    <li> Gentle, effective and doesn&#x27;t sting. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Works great at removing eye makeup and there is a waterproof version of this that I&#x27;ve seen in the store as well. I&#x27;m not in love with the scent - it&#x27;s not as nice as the rest of the products in this collection but it does the trick and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyeballs.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  Didnt seem like it was the original product.  Very watered down.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, ever.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clinique blue eye make up remover for years.  Started using some facial products from The Body Shop and thought I would give this a try.  Love it.  I can leave my contacts in and still use this.</li>
    <li> Love this product for removing eye makeup.  Gentle and does a great job.</li>
