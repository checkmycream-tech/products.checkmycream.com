    <li> love it, why discontinue it</li>
    <li> the consistency was ok.  It smelled good in the bottle, but once I put it on my skin it was so strong and smelled kind of cheap.</li>
    <li> This smells fantastic!!!! Use it after showers and really like the Hempz!! Thank you for a great price too!!! Came really quick to I might add.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t smell strawberry in this, must be the passion fruit. Definite fruity smell, very similar to how a child&#x27;s product.would smell. Ive only used it once and it does leave your hands very soft. I will continue to use to see if it makes an improvement on my dry hands.</li>
    <li> This smells so good I want to eat it. It&#x27;s really moisturizing too. I feel like it absorbs pretty quickly. I will definitely purchase again.  : )</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good product</li>
    <li> different kinda of scent but its ok for my liking</li>
    <li> Wonderful products, fair pricing, excellent delivery time. Package arrived in excellent condition. I give a 5 star rating</li>
    <li> Only reason I give this a 3 is because I personally didn&#x27;t care for the smell. I was hoping for a good strawberry scent but this is drowned out by the passion fruit. I only use Hempz lotion and all of their lines work awesome, they&#x27;re the only lotion I&#x27;d ever recommend! So the lotion itself is great I just didn&#x27;t care for the scent!</li>
    <li> I adore the scent of this moisturizer! Fresh &amp; fruity, and feels like heaven on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. good price but the lid was not on tight and it was leaking in the bag. I purchased a total of 5 bottles and two were leaking.&lt;br /&gt;No harm no foul, i just  cleaned them up.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful and feels really good on my skin</li>
