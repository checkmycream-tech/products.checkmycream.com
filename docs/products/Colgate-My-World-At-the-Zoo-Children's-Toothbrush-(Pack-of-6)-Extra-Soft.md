### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!!</li>
      <li>great price for these and perfect for my 3 kids who have to have color coded everything!</li>
      <li>These are a great buy.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit!</li>
      <li>good deal for a good quality brush.</li>
      <li>Good value and my grandkids liked the animals.</li>
      <li>A bit superlative to LOVE toothbrushes, but I have zero complaints!</li>
      <li>Great toothbrushes for toddlers, a nice size, and easy for my 3yo to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The toothbrushes are OK.  </li>
      <li>The three different colors work great with three kids: each gets their own color.  </li>
      <li>This was a great deal and now I have spares and can replace them frequently without going shopping.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy.</li>
      <li>Excellent tooth brush for little hands and mouths.  </li>
      <li>Great product, kids love it and we are pleased with the purchase, looking for more designs in the near future.</li>
      <li>Never let your Vet put your dog under to clean their teeth.</li>
      <li>I bought these to clean my dogs teeth.</li>
      <li>Good quality, and cheap enough to change out often when they get grubby</li>
      <li>Nice tooth brush for kids of 3 to 5 year old.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>The brush is soft and big, so gets a lot of teeth at once,  not like many other toddler toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>cute kids toothbrushes are hard to find.  </li>
      <li>I bought Petrodex Natural Toothpaste Dog - Peanut - 2.5 oz.</li>
      <li>My 2.5 yr old brushes with it..</li>
      <li>It would be even better to have only green, then there would be no arguing!</li>
      <li>but the handle is as long as an adults and not grip/curve to help your kid hold onto, its straight cut.</li>
      <li>After a few uses it&#x27;s just chock full of teethmarks.</li>
      <li>They are a little to hard for me, but they may be good for some kids.</li>
      <li>The price and quality of this item are just right for this stage--where there is some toothbrush chewing going on, and yet a soft brush with a small head is needed.</li>
      <li>I might be able to persuade my daughter to use the green ones (after she&#x27;s used both the pink ones), but she&#x27;ll refuse the blue ones; I have a baby boy who will use them eventually, but he&#x27;ll have a big stack of blue toothbrushes by the time he&#x27;s 2!  </li>

    <li> Does the job but is not certified by American Dental Association.</li>

    <li> The toothbrushes are OK.  They are a little to hard for me, but they may be good for some kids.</li>
    <li> Too large for small child.</li>
    <li> The three different colors work great with three kids: each gets their own color.  The animal pictures are also a hit.  My two and four year olds use these daily.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  Few used bristle damage</li>
    <li> I am using these toothbrush for my son and its going on well with his brushing. Nice tooth brush for kids of 3 to 5 year old.</li>
    <li> great price for these and perfect for my 3 kids who have to have color coded everything! good deal for a good quality brush.</li>
    <li> These are really hard for my 3.5 year old.  He complains that it hurts his gums, compared with the brush we had used before.  They also don&#x27;t have any padded areas on the head of the toothbrush like others do, which helps to buffer against biting and provides a softer surface when it bumps against gums.  After a few uses it&#x27;s just chock full of teethmarks.</li>
    <li> We use these to brush our dogs&#x27; teeth (two Shelties and one Yorkie). They are well made, they arrived in the packages as shown. I&#x27;ll buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product, kids love it and we are pleased with the purchase, looking for more designs in the near future.</li>
    <li> Good value and my grandkids liked the animals.</li>
    <li> Excellent tooth brush for little hands and mouths.  Good quality, and cheap enough to change out often when they get grubby</li>
    <li> cute kids toothbrushes are hard to find.  This was a great deal and now I have spares and can replace them frequently without going shopping.  2 dolphins, 2 butterflies, and 2 soccer players</li>
    <li> Description for 2yr old.&lt;br /&gt;Brush is too big and hard, currently unable to use.</li>
    <li> I have twins and fancy toothbrushes get expensive. These are a great buy. I don&#x27;t need a race care handle, just something that brushes their teeth!</li>
    <li> A bit superlative to LOVE toothbrushes, but I have zero complaints!</li>
    <li> My 2.5 yr old brushes with it..so it gets 5 stars for that, looses one because it suppose to be for 2+, but the handle is as long as an adults and not grip/curve to help your kid hold onto, its straight cut. The brush is soft and big, so gets a lot of teeth at once,  not like many other toddler toothbrushes. You get 2 of each color just like the picture. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought these to clean my dogs teeth. Perfect fit! I do not like the ones that come with doggy toothpaste, too big. I bought Petrodex Natural Toothpaste Dog - Peanut - 2.5 oz. Works great!! Never let your Vet put your dog under to clean their teeth. It&#x27;s easy.</li>
    <li> The price and quality of this item are just right for this stage--where there is some toothbrush chewing going on, and yet a soft brush with a small head is needed. Also an appealing design that isn&#x27;t over-the-top.</li>
