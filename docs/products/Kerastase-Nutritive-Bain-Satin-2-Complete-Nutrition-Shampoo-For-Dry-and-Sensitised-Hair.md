      <li>Quality ingredients for sure.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Buyer beware\\&quot; may apply to some of the Kerastase products here (phenomenal product line, by the way</li>
      <li>I am in love with this shampoo,it makes my hair shiny and healthy,I recommend it for any one,,thanks</li>
      <li>I used it for a long time and this shampoo is so perfect!</li>
      <li>have been using this shampoo for several years with very good results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo, it does not weigh down or leave a residue.  </li>
      <li>Kerastase products (all that I have used) are worth full price for the amazing results when using a regimen that includes shampoo, conditioner, heat protector - styling product.  </li>
      <li>I have given it as a present.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping, fine packaging.</li>
      <li>I think they fill this great big bottle with bogus shampoo and charge you $68.00.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Our primary reason for buying the 32 oz size through Amazon instead of the more commonly available 8 oz size is strictly economical.  </li>
      <li>Great to get this in the larger size!</li>
      <li>sure worth the money</li>
      <li>I thought  it was fantastic</li>
      <li>First of all I love the Kerastase product line but this shampoo takes the case.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this exact product many times before, online and at retail.  </li>
      <li>but if you value your hair care and you&#x27;re already spending top dollar on a quality product you may as well stretch your dollar and get the large container.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves hair full and manageable and my hair is shinier, softer and fuller</li>
      <li>Anyway, I got home and searched the internet for decent prices on the larger size bottles (because that&#x27;s really the best deal) and found the shampoo here.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more economical to buy the large bottle.  </li>
      <li>More importantly, I discovered that genuine Kerastase products are sold only in authorized salons or via the product line&#x27;s official website.</li>
      <li>Not any more - it&#x27;s soft, shiny and moves!</li>
      <li>My favorite brand and works great for my very thick hair</li>
      <li>Real Kerastase Shampoo leaves the hair smooth and manageable.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.      </li>
      <li>The cost is worth the results.</li>
      <li>I know this is pricey but it costs a lot more when I shop locally</li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my curly hair smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>My hair is still looking good after a few days.</li>
      <li>We have found this to be an excellent shampoo for either fine or coarse, but dry (stiff)</li>
      <li>Great product, it&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
      <li>We have found the 8 oz size but not the 32 oz size available in local stores.</li>
      <li>Now that I have been using it for awhile, I can tell it is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>I like this shampoo because it&#x27;s gentle on my hair.  </li>
      <li>and the smell too is nice but not really strong smelling...</li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands and have always gone back to using Kerastase.</li>
      <li>The price is very competitive compared to what I&#x27;ve seen and after reading many poor reviews here and elsewhere about the product being really thin in consistency or missing a few ounces upon arrival, I am happy to report that this bottle was perfect.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it and the associated conditioner.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the shampoo but would stick with a salon purchase, boooooo.</li>
      <li>fabulous, rich and thick - I have used this shampoo for about 6 years</li>
      <li>I have been using Keratase for a few years and love the results that I see.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help new hair growth.</li>
      <li>In fact other purchases have had the opposite effect - the more you use, the softer your hair gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use any crème rinse if I choose not to...make my dry hair nice and soft and fluffy..  </li>
      <li>Ordering through amazon made it a lot easier to find as it&#x27;s usually only in certain salons.</li>
      <li>I certainly can tell the difference especially if you have been using the product for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but you get a much bigger bang for your buck with the large container.</li>
      <li>It is my conclusion that part of it is real and the other half isn&#x27;t because I sure could tell that it was not holding up.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and find that this is the only product that keeps my hair manageable.</li>
      <li>However with this bottle this time, my head feels itchy and I have developed a hive-like reaction on my chest, the areas my hair can touch, when I take my shower and immediately afterward.</li>
      <li>--I&#x27;ve been using on and off for nearly 10 years).</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, silky, manageable and with plenty of body and non-oily.  </li>
      <li>I have tried every shampoo under the sun, from super expensive to cheap and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey and hard to find but ladies, we are worth it.  </li>

<li> Buying it this way is way cheaper too since my hair is so long and thick that I go through it quickly.</li>

<li> and this is the only shampoo that does not build up on my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
<li> I always buy the large size and it lasts &amp;#34;forever:&amp;#34;  Only a very small amount of product is needed.</li>
<li> /&gt;It cleans well and after just a few minutes after applying, a rinse and blow dry leaves our hair soft with a low gloss</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Kerastase for well over 10yrs and it has been the only shampoo my fine, thin, limp hair does well with.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s about 1/2 as thick as the real thing.  </li>
<li> It lasts a very long time.</li>
<li> I previously purchased the smaller container</li>
<li> , I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to go to a high end salon to purchase it at a ridiculous price for 1/4 the size bottle than what you see here on Amazon.</li>
<li> Expected perfectly.i will do bussiness with again and again</li>
<li> i have bought them in the past not from the same company and</li>
<li> I stopped using it for a while and tried something cheaper, but it was NOT worth it.</li>
<li> I have very thick coarse wavy hair that tends to be dry after shampooing.  </li>
<li> Was it watered down?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Real Kerastase Shampoo leaves the hair smooth and manageable. I used this and my hair was like a scouring pad...dry, horrible. I think they fill this great big bottle with bogus shampoo and charge you $68.00. I do not recommend buying this shampoo online...I don&#x27;t know who the vendor was, but they sold me a fraudulent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go out and buy a new bottle of Kerastase, which is wonderful. Another $38.00 out of my pocket.</li>
    <li> Beware of this product! It&#x27;s about 1/2 as thick as the real thing.  I am returning this to Amazon today.</li>
    <li> I have very thick coarse wavy hair that tends to be dry after shampooing.  This is the best shampoo I have EVER used! The frizzies have relaxed, the waves are soft, the texture is perfect. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Have used Kerastase products for over a year and love how well it helped revive my damaged hair.  The cost is worth the results.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible shampoo!  Well worth the money.      I received this order in record time and was very pleased with all aspects of this purchase as well as with the Seller.  I would definitely purchase from this Seller again in the future.</li>
    <li> Always has been my favorite, the best out there and I have tried many!</li>
    <li> Great product and a great value for the money. I love what it does for my hair.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> fabulous, rich and thick - I have used this shampoo for about 6 years and I swear by it. Makes my hair shine with health.</li>
    <li> This product leaves hair full and manageable and my hair is shinier, softer and fuller&lt;br /&gt; I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> My favorite brand and works great for my very thick hair</li>
    <li> I used it for a long time and this shampoo is so perfect!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo because it&#x27;s gentle on my hair.  I have highlights, I color &amp; straighten my hair.  It&#x27;s more economical to buy the large bottle.  Just a thought....if you straighten your hair, don&#x27;t use any product w/ formaldehyde.</li>
    <li> The product was great but i was disappointed that the dispenser was not included.  i have bought them in the past not from the same company and the dispenser came with it.  I would have liked to have been informed that it didn&#x27;t include the dispenser thats all</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my curly hair smooth and soft. I love it. I stopped using it for a while and tried something cheaper, but it was NOT worth it. This works like a miracle on my hair, esp, in the humid DC summers. Great product.</li>
    <li> My hair and I love this shampoo, everyone in our family enjoys it. I have given it as a present.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping, fine packaging.</li>
    <li> When I received the shampoo, I did not doubt the product. Now that I have been using it for awhile, I can tell it is not the real thing. It is my conclusion that part of it is real and the other half isn&#x27;t because I sure could tell that it was not holding up. Here going on vacation with my shampoo to make sure that my hair looks good, so dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally bought my Kerastase from one of the salon and used it.  My hair is still looking good after a few days. I certainly can tell the difference especially if you have been using the product for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon and they gave me a return label as soon as I complained.  I told them I am trying to reach the company who sold me the product and I cannot find any way to send them an email. They said, not to worry, they will take stand by me and they will give my money back.</li>
    <li> Terrible product&lt;br /&gt;it is not authentic</li>
    <li> Have used Kerastase for years, was NOT kerastase. Watered down so bad it would barely lather!!!!</li>
    <li> this is the best shampoo I have ever used...... just wish they carried it a little closer to home....a friend gave me a bottle years ago and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it until I went on line and ordered it... it&#x27;s not cheap but sure worth the money and I don&#x27;t have to use any crème rinse if I choose not to...make my dry hair nice and soft and fluffy..  LOVE IT! and the smell too is nice but not really strong smelling... don&#x27;t like lots of perfumes...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this exact product many times before, online and at retail.  The shampoo I received appears to be defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It suds - which isn&#x27;t typical for shampoos in this price range, nor has my previous purchases of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it dries out my hair, which hasn&#x27;t happened with previous purchases either.  In fact other purchases have had the opposite effect - the more you use, the softer your hair gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed, will not order this again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great to get this in the larger size!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo, it does not weigh down or leave a residue.  Larger size bottle is a great value!</li>
    <li> A wonderful product.  It&#x27;s pricey and hard to find but ladies, we are worth it.  Especially for those who are menopausal who need skin, hair and nails TLC!</li>
    <li> Im extremely happy with the  product it was more than  what was. Expected perfectly.i will do bussiness with again and again</li>
    <li> This was shipped to me and I never even ordered it. Now I can&#x27;t even return it. Not very pleased at all</li>
    <li> I am in love with this shampoo,it makes my hair shiny and healthy,I recommend it for any one,,thanks kerastase&lt;br /&gt;You are the best as u have ever been...</li>
    <li> First of all I love the Kerastase product line but this shampoo takes the case. It leaves my hair soft, silky, manageable and with plenty of body and non-oily.  I previously purchased the smaller container but you get a much bigger bang for your buck with the large container. I know it may seem like a lot of money but if you value your hair care and you&#x27;re already spending top dollar on a quality product you may as well stretch your dollar and get the large container.  It lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. I have really thick, temperamental hair and this is the only shampoo that does not build up on my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Buying it this way is way cheaper too since my hair is so long and thick that I go through it quickly. I have tried every shampoo under the sun, from super expensive to cheap and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for me.</li>
    <li> Kerastase products (all that I have used) are worth full price for the amazing results when using a regimen that includes shampoo, conditioner, heat protector - styling product.  My hair is colored and before Kerastase was dry and dull from the processing and heat styling.  Not any more - it&#x27;s soft, shiny and moves!</li>
    <li> My only product line for my hair.  Quality ingredients for sure.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Buyer beware\\&quot; may apply to some of the Kerastase products here (phenomenal product line, by the way--I&#x27;ve been using on and off for nearly 10 years). Away from home, I was going to buy from this seller (btw, that would be...??) until I noticed that the back image appears to have Chinese or Japanese writing. HUH???  Also, product safety seal missing from opening in another image (hmmm...). More importantly, I discovered that genuine Kerastase products are sold only in authorized salons or via the product line&#x27;s official website. Given some reviewers also questioned the authenticity of the product, no thanks--at least for this seller (again, is...?)</li>
    <li> We have found this to be an excellent shampoo for either fine or coarse, but dry (stiff) hair.&lt;br /&gt;We have been using this shampoo for several years with very good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well and after just a few minutes after applying, a rinse and blow dry leaves our hair soft with a low gloss shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our primary reason for buying the 32 oz size through Amazon instead of the more commonly available 8 oz size is strictly economical.  We have found the 8 oz size but not the 32 oz size available in local stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  I always buy the large size and it lasts &amp;#34;forever:&amp;#34;  Only a very small amount of product is needed. I have colored hair and this helps maintain good hair quality.  I highly recommend it and the associated conditioner.</li>
    <li> It cleans hair perfectly without damaging it. Your hair becomes softer and stronger in time. It doesn&#x27;t help new hair growth.</li>
    <li> Again the shampoo is wonderful, doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way, which is good.  Great product, it&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I thought  it was fantastic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kerastase for years.  The formula was completely different. I used to pump twice and it created a thick foam, enough to thoroughly wash my shoulder-length, THICK hair. This time, I pumped 4, 5, even SIX times and still, the shampoo never foamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has Kerastase changed their world-famous formula? Did I get a bad bottle? Was it watered down? I dont know. But I DO know this was not the Kerastase I have used for over 15 years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for years and love it. I have tried many different brands and have always gone back to using Kerastase. I have very curly hair and find that this is the only product that keeps my hair manageable. Very few salons in my area sell this, however it costs 2x the amount I paid on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Keratase for a few years and love the results that I see. It reduces frizz and adds silkiness to my hair. Ordering through amazon made it a lot easier to find as it&#x27;s usually only in certain salons. I usually alternate days that I use this shampoo just so I can make it last longer.</li>
    <li> I shampoo my hair daily and this is the best shampoo for me. I have never colored my hair so there may be a better one for those that do. I know this is pricey but it costs a lot more when I shop locally and they never carry this size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if whether or not this is the real deal. I&#x27;ve used Kerastase for well over 10yrs and it has been the only shampoo my fine, thin, limp hair does well with. However with this bottle this time, my head feels itchy and I have developed a hive-like reaction on my chest, the areas my hair can touch, when I take my shower and immediately afterward. The red spots look like tiny zits and never seem to go away even with the help of cortizone.. I stopped using the shampoo for the course of 3 weeks and my rash went away but my hair didn&#x27;t do well with the cheaper shampoo. I love Kerastase, I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to go to a high end salon to purchase it at a ridiculous price for 1/4 the size bottle than what you see here on Amazon. Highly recommend the shampoo but would stick with a salon purchase, boooooo.</li>
    <li> I only used this brand at a friend&#x27;s house that had the smaller bottles in his guest bathroom...oi...talk about a pampered guest! Anyway, I got home and searched the internet for decent prices on the larger size bottles (because that&#x27;s really the best deal) and found the shampoo here.  The price is very competitive compared to what I&#x27;ve seen and after reading many poor reviews here and elsewhere about the product being really thin in consistency or missing a few ounces upon arrival, I am happy to report that this bottle was perfect. Enjoy!</li>
