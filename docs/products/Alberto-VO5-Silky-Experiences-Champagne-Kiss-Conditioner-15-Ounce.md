      <li>It is a good value</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;The Detangler&amp;#34; conditioner and Garnier Fructis &amp;#34;Sleek and Shine&amp;#34; are slightly better, but this is a great value.</li>
      <li>my hair is natural and it does a perfect job.</li>

      <li>I love this one.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I love about VO5</li>
      <li>I love this, I sometimes mix flavors of conditioner to spice up my showers.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would have more smell, though.</li>
      <li>Smells really good, really smells like Champagne and Strawberries... love the scent.</li>
      <li>Cheap and easy to co wash for the CG method.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good conditioner, makes my hair soft and easy to detangle.  </li>
      <li>if you can give me any direction to get what i really wanted, that would be nice.</li>
      <li>I stumbled across this conditioner while I was looking for something cheap that I wouldn&#x27;t mind rinsing out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s what you expect for cheap VO5 conditioner, works for my needs.</li>
      <li>Cheap and smell</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I would fall in love with this scent, I almost want to consume it.</li>
      <li>The smell was even better in the shower and it instantly provided &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so I was able to detangle with ease.</li>
      <li>While this conditioner is really affordable (read cheap) it doesn&#x27;t quite give my hair the moisture and conditioning it needs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the most deep conditioning and it&#x27;s kinda watery</li>
      <li>So while the sealing effect can hide some damage and splits, it just perpetuates it and creates more damage from dryness in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product, though inexpensive, has a light fragrance, and it works as good as the expensive products.</li>
      <li>I was very tempted to leave it on my hair but decided not to.</li>
      <li>and I really like this one in particular.</li>
      <li>but it is a cheap conditioner good enough for everyday if you have no specific concerns.  </li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price as $3 for a 15 oz conditioner is a steal where I live.</li>
      <li>This line and Suave Naturals conditioners are nearly identical at a VERY reduced price!</li>
      <li>I have to use more product than the more expensive stuff</li>
      <li>is that they offer a decent product at a price everyone can afford.</li>
      <li>I do Conditioner Only (CO) washing, which means I massage conditioner into my scalp and through the length of my hair to get my head clean without removing all the natural goodness of oils from my scalp to prevent itchiness.</li>
      <li>QUATS are what clean your hair without stripping the color and all moisture from your scalp and hair shafts, and this has them in high amounts with all the other required ingredients to keep the cleaning properties high while maintaining moisture.</li>
      <li>You can even use a tiny amount of this as a leave-in conditioner, but caring for the ends with a deep conditioner is still important.</li>
      <li>While using it, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>So far I am still on the fence with this idea.</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft.</li>
      <li>This conditioner leaves my hair feeling as soft as a baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>We have THREE girls (4,6,9 years old)</li>
      <li>I massage the water into my scalp, separate my hair in two down the center, apply a copious amount of conditioner to my scalp while massaging it in, then more down the length of my hair before rinsing it out.</li>

    <li> I bought the shampoo and the conditioner of this and found that it had a great smell but it wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this conditioner while I was looking for something cheap that I wouldn&#x27;t mind rinsing out. I did the sniff test on a few of them in the store and this one stood out to me so I bought it. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price as $3 for a 15 oz conditioner is a steal where I live. While using it, I was pleasantly surprised. The smell was even better in the shower and it instantly provided &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so I was able to detangle with ease. I was very tempted to leave it on my hair but decided not to. I got a bit carried away and used about 10 of the 15 oz. I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing from a store in my area.</li>
    <li> I have been a life longer user of Alberto V05 I trust them with my hair care and have never been disappointed.  This conditioner leaves my hair feeling as soft as a baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> cheap and lot of healthy vitamin also give moisture to my hair which tend to get dryveasily nice and just a dollar</li>
    <li> Hi!  i&#x27;ve would have preferred vo5 silky experiences lavender smoothing shampoo and conditioner, but I couldn&#x27;t find it.  if you can give me any direction to get what i really wanted, that would be nice.</li>
    <li> I love this it smells good and it makes my hair soft.  I have to use more product than the more expensive stuff but, still it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> i wanted a cheapie conditoner for cowashes. my hair is natural and it does a perfect job. i also uses to detangle my hair too and its a great conditioner. cannot beat the price for this.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive hair conditioner. Seemed to help impart some extra moisture to my hair. I had started using conditioners in place of shampoos to see if it makes a difference in breakage. So far I am still on the fence with this idea.</li>
    <li> excellent inexpensive cowash</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet, bought so had on hand when previous shampoo runs out.  Very pleasant aroma and since I have used the brand before, I know I will like it.</li>
    <li> We have THREE girls (4,6,9 years old) so lots of hair.  Tangly and dirty with marker.  This conditioner definitely does the trick.  Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;The Detangler&amp;#34; conditioner and Garnier Fructis &amp;#34;Sleek and Shine&amp;#34; are slightly better, but this is a great value.</li>
    <li> This product has no body at all and is not a very good conditioner.  I use it for pre-treatment when I swim to keep my hair a bit protected but even for that it is not that good.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I am going to use this, but the scent has an alcohol smell to it -- (duh champagne).  I will not purchase this one again.  Just wanted to see what it was like.</li>
    <li> To those complaining that this conditioner is \\&quot;runny\\&quot; or \\&quot;watery\\&quot; that is because it is not a silicone conditioner. In most cases this means it&#x27;s better for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though everyone&#x27;s hair is different, use of silicone products often causes build up and it can also seal moisture OUT of hair. So while the sealing effect can hide some damage and splits, it just perpetuates it and creates more damage from dryness in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I prefer to use non-silicone products and I really like this one in particular. It doesn&#x27;t have the gag inducing scent of the strawberries VO5 conditioner. The scent of this product is lighter and less offensive to my nose. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a heavy moisturizer, but that isn&#x27;t what I am looking for from it. After using this I use either coconut oil or neem oil (or both) to add extra moisture to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about VO5 is that they offer a decent product at a price everyone can afford. I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> While this conditioner is really affordable (read cheap) it doesn&#x27;t quite give my hair the moisture and conditioning it needs. It has a ton of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; which helps it guide through my thick afro-textured hair but I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what you expect for cheap VO5 conditioner, works for my needs. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I would fall in love with this scent, I almost want to consume it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the most deep conditioning and it&#x27;s kinda watery but it is a cheap conditioner good enough for everyday if you have no specific concerns.  Smells really good, really smells like Champagne and Strawberries... love the scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good conditioner, makes my hair soft and easy to detangle.  Great for a cowash and price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Cheap and easy to co wash for the CG method.  Works great and you cannot beat the price.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this one. Cheap and smell sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;I get this 2 for $1.5. Good deal.</li>
    <li> I like suave shampoo and conditioner because it gets my hair clean and it smells good, too.  It is a good value</li>
    <li> thought it was shampoo. But I&#x27;m using it and liking it. I was hoping it would have more smell, though.</li>
    <li> I do Conditioner Only (CO) washing, which means I massage conditioner into my scalp and through the length of my hair to get my head clean without removing all the natural goodness of oils from my scalp to prevent itchiness. I massage the water into my scalp, separate my hair in two down the center, apply a copious amount of conditioner to my scalp while massaging it in, then more down the length of my hair before rinsing it out. Imagine running your fingers through your hair as you&#x27;re rinsing... this happens every time I use this product! I CO wash my hair maybe twice a week with dry shampooing between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Familiar with WEN? This line and Suave Naturals conditioners are nearly identical at a VERY reduced price! QUATS are what clean your hair without stripping the color and all moisture from your scalp and hair shafts, and this has them in high amounts with all the other required ingredients to keep the cleaning properties high while maintaining moisture. Champagne Kiss smells great and has all the slip and glide in the world! I love this, I sometimes mix flavors of conditioner to spice up my showers. You can even use a tiny amount of this as a leave-in conditioner, but caring for the ends with a deep conditioner is still important.</li>
