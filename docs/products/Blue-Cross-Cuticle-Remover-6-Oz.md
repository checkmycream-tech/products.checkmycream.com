<li> Don&#x27;t use more than twice in a row or the same day as this can be caustic.  </li>
<li> I am not a &amp;#34;girly girl&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t polish my nails nor grow them long.</li>
<li> I have thicks cuticles and they overgrow, dry out and crack.  </li>
<li> This small bottle will last me a long time because I only use three or four drops on each nail.  </li>
<li> I poured out down the toilet</li>
<li> You dab a little drop on the cuticle and push back, and obviously remove any hanging dead skin.</li>
<li> Be careful using.  </li>
<li> It may seem a little watery especially if you are used to using the thicker gel-like products but you only need a small amount and the advantage is that this doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on the nail bed as some other cuticle removers/eliminators will.</li>
<li> No more of that since using this product several times a week!</li>
<li> I actually used it and a small file to buff my cuticles down a little bit and buff off any excess on the nail bed and it worked like a charm.</li>
<li> Thin liquid and can leave sensitive skin burning.</li>
<li> I will agree with some of the other reviews that I wish it was a little thicker consistency, but not a show stopper.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s a little watery</li>
<li> Unless you (or your client) has overly excessive dry skin/cuticle that grows up the nail bed and is hard as a rock, this product should do the trick.</li>
<li> so I transferred to small bottle with a dropper.</li>
<li> I was hesitant to purchase this after reading some of the negative reviews</li>
<li> Have a towel underneath though because this stuff isn&#x27;t thick at all.</li>
<li> Im not going to buy any other brand and and pay those ridiculous prices anymore!!</li>
<li> I was concerned about the thin consistence of this cuticle remover.  </li>
<li> No more cutting cuticles!</li>
<li> it was useless.</li>
<li> Yes it is a very thin liquid, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.  </li>
<li> Very thin but seems to work well.</li>
<li> Fairly disappointing.</li>
<li> It is a liquid, and I was expecting a cream.  :-(</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the worst.</li>
<li> This was awful.</li>

    <li> I will say up front I am not a &amp;#34;girly girl&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t polish my nails nor grow them long. I purchased this because I like the reviews and I wanted something that was easy, quick and effective. This Cuticle Remover Rocks!!!!  I will agree with some of the other reviews that I wish it was a little thicker consistency, but not a show stopper.  I will keep this in stock for sure.  It does exactly what it says, I work it into the cuticle and wash it off and I am done.</li>
    <li> effective, but you might have to reapply because it dries up quickly</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazing. Im not going to buy any other brand and and pay those ridiculous prices anymore!! Love it</li>
    <li> Works great but too fluid so I transferred to small bottle with a dropper.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. I love it. I&#x27;m trying to get better about caring for my nails &amp; this product helps me do that tremendously.</li>
    <li> This works great, shipping took longer than expexted but I am still happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This was awful. It was in watery liquid form not a creamy form to apply on the nails. I poured out down the toilet it was useless. Don&#x27;t by this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does it&#x27;s job and the size is perfect. It will last a while.</li>
    <li> Great product, lots for the money and my cuticles have never looked better.  I have thicks cuticles and they overgrow, dry out and crack.  No more of that since using this product several times a week!</li>
    <li> Not much to say it works really well and is very affordable will last along time use it maybe once a month</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - I push back my cuticles with Q-tips and Blue Coss Cuticle Remover and it works very well.  Don&#x27;t use more than twice in a row or the same day as this can be caustic.  I got over zealous using multiple times in one day and wound up with chemical burns around a couple nails - ouch!  Operator error...</li>
    <li> I use to purchase this at FW Woolworth and have missed it dearly as it does wonders on my nails. When I use this on my cuticles, my nails grow twice as fast without it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this after reading some of the negative reviews but I&#x27;m glad I did!  Yes it is a very thin liquid, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.  I applied this to my cuticles, waited 2 minutes, and the cuticles just melted away. I felt no burning, itching or stinging. My cuticles were fairly thick, so I was very surprised that it worked so quickly!  This bottle will last FOREVER! (you literally only need a  drop or two for each nail.)</li>
    <li> I was concerned about the thin consistence of this cuticle remover.  Once I tried using it, my concerns vanished into pleasant surprise.  The cuticle came right off, no pushing or scraping.  This small bottle will last me a long time because I only use three or four drops on each nail.  Love the dispenser cap.

I&#x27;d recommend this Blue Cross Cuticle Remover to anybody who wants to easily remove the cuticle without all the pain of pushing, etc.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my school used it but it&#x27;s a little watery there are better ones out there</li>
    <li> Not what I had hoped for</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well. I&#x27;ve always been a CND user but this stuff is a lot lighter and perfect when you&#x27;re doing a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; manicure for instance when you&#x27;re doing a gel or shellac manicure. You dab a little drop on the cuticle and push back, and obviously remove any hanging dead skin. It may seem a little watery especially if you are used to using the thicker gel-like products but you only need a small amount and the advantage is that this doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on the nail bed as some other cuticle removers/eliminators will. CND has alpha hydroxy acid also which has to be rinsed off before polishing where this product doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemical that requires rinsing but still as effective. Unless you (or your client) has overly excessive dry skin/cuticle that grows up the nail bed and is hard as a rock, this product should do the trick. Give it a try, the price is reasonable enough.</li>
    <li> This is the best cuticle remover hands down, however, research how to use this for perfect results. First time I used it, I researched beforehand, had fantastic results.</li>
    <li> The product works.  It is a liquid, and I was expecting a cream.  :-(</li>
    <li> easy to use took care of my cuticles and  then some</li>
    <li> Love it, I dont need to do anything and all the cuticle is removed.</li>
    <li> perfect for removing all those ugly cuticles! thank you amazon :-)</li>
    <li> It works really well!!! Iwas kind of skeptical because of the consistency of the product but its great and reading other ppls reviews really helped me decide whether I should or should not buy the product</li>
    <li> As described. Quality product.</li>
    <li> Not as great as the reviews led me to expect. Fairly disappointing.</li>
    <li> One of my biggest pet peeves is getting a manicure and ending up with tons of hangnails after. It&#x27;s the worst. I decided to give this stuff a try and I LOVE it. I have a gel kit and do my nails fairly regularly, and this stuff is such a dream. It dissolves the extra bit of cuticles stuck to your nails and the edges without any fuss, and allows you to easily push up the cuticle and create a nice clean edge. No more cutting cuticles! I actually used it and a small file to buff my cuticles down a little bit and buff off any excess on the nail bed and it worked like a charm. Have a towel underneath though because this stuff isn&#x27;t thick at all. It&#x27;s pure liquid so it will drip off of your hands. I have fairly sensitive skin too and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works great!</li>
    <li> Really works. Don&#x27;t have to do much pushing of the cuticle, this softens it in like 2 seconds</li>
    <li> Best cuticle remover for DIY.</li>
    <li> Very thin but seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely.  Works great!  Would recommend.  Definitely making this my #1 cuticle remover.</li>
    <li> Excellent cuticle remove just don&#x27;t leave it on for too long...</li>
    <li> Be careful using.  Thin liquid and can leave sensitive skin burning.</li>
    <li> I agree with the positive feedback. I was hesitant to order because it is very runny; but this remover is Fantastic and does the best job without having to do a lot pushing. This will be a permanent remover in my stock from now on!</li>
    <li> This did no remove my cuticles at all.</li>
    <li> As s professional this is a number one must for pedicure and manicurist. .... it uses very little and is liquid form so easy to rinse off and not a need in nipping alot.</li>
