### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great item.</li>
      <li>this is a great idea and it fits well.  </li>
      <li>These are a good type of wig caps and they work well with every wig I have used it with.</li>
      <li>Good as see in the picture.</li>
      <li>This was a great buy since it came with more than I needed for my cosplay.</li>
      <li>Pin the hairnet to your own hair to hold it in place, put the wig on and then lift sections of wig hair up and use bobby pins underneath to hold it to the hairnet.  </li>
      <li>These are ok, nothing fancy</li>
      <li>They fit nicely.</li>
      <li>Can i say more?</li>
      <li>and I was impressed at how well it held and kept her hair in the net.</li>
      <li>but overall it is a great item.</li>
      <li>Everything is then secure for the day.  </li>
      <li>Bobby pin friendly.</li>
      <li>If you are really in a bind, you can even use material from your underpants, make sure it&#x27;s breathable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They really held our hair in place, and they were comfortable.</li>
      <li>I like them very much.</li>
      <li>It is hot and I can&#x27;t pin it to my hair or pin the wig to it.  </li>
      <li>Does the job that it is suppose dot but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the opening on top.</li>
      <li>It gets hot and eventually ripped</li>
      <li>The other reviewers were helpful and I&#x27;m glad I listened to them and bought these!</li>
      <li>Other than that, I would have liked it.</li>
      <li>this type works real well with my hair</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>The elastics don&#x27;t wear out too fast either.</li>
      <li>very affordable, what i needed</li>
      <li>im glad i got these because i lost my other one and</li>
      <li>This wig cap did a great job of holding my hair, which is long and thick in place</li>
      <li>Obviously, you can&#x27;t wear it right over your eyebrows as the picture indicates.  </li>
      <li>I wear this for those quick times I need to wash my hair but don&#x27;t have time to dry it before I pop on my wig.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that sometimes it would roll up under my wig and end up in a little wad on top of my head underneath the wig.  </li>
      <li>They slide a little when putting the wig on but other then that i love them.</li>
      <li>Of course because of the netting it will snack on the combs if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
      <li>The item arrived as promised, but was only my head for about ten minutes before it slid up, completely coming off my head</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have an issue with it keeping my real hair laying down.</li>
      <li>and really they don&#x27;t hold the hair down enough for me.</li>

<li> These are snoods, not full caps.</li>

<li> Band was so tight it gave me a head ache</li>
<li> it slips off a little</li>
<li> and I have a small head.</li>
<li> ouch, band is too thin and hurts my head.</li>
<li> I also have an all-nylon (like a stocking) &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; and hate it.  </li>

    <li> The item arrived as promised, but was only my head for about ten minutes before it slid up, completely coming off my head</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear my wig without this.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that sometimes it would roll up under my wig and end up in a little wad on top of my head underneath the wig.  Obviously, you can&#x27;t wear it right over your eyebrows as the picture indicates.  No wig is worn that low.  The answer for all problems is bobby pins.  Pin the hairnet to your own hair to hold it in place, put the wig on and then lift sections of wig hair up and use bobby pins underneath to hold it to the hairnet.  Everything is then secure for the day.  Your wig won&#x27;t move around a lot.  I still have some problems with my wig tending to &amp;#34;ride up&amp;#34; on the back of my head.  I also have an all-nylon (like a stocking) &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; and hate it.  It is hot and I can&#x27;t pin it to my hair or pin the wig to it.  It makes everything double-slippery and my wig is all over the place.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy since it came with more than I needed for my cosplay. Bobby pin friendly.</li>
    <li> These are ok, nothing fancy and really they don&#x27;t hold the hair down enough for me. I have only worn it once but I will give it another shot.</li>
    <li> this is a great idea and it fits well.  it slips off a little but overall it is a great item.</li>
    <li> These are a good type of wig caps and they work well with every wig I have used it with. The elastics don&#x27;t wear out too fast either.</li>
    <li> ouch, band is too thin and hurts my head.</li>
    <li> Can i say more? I thought that i was going to use it apply my sew in weave on and it slid off constantly.  I was very disappointed, luckily that it did not cost much.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Good as see in the picture.</li>
    <li> Your scalp can breath and the cap stays put.</li>
    <li> I used this under a wig I wore to keep fleas off of my bald head. It gets hot and eventually ripped so I had to use a woman&#x27;s pantyhose. If you are really in a bind, you can even use material from your underpants, make sure it&#x27;s breathable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styrofoam Wig Head</li>
    <li> These are snoods, not full caps.</li>
    <li> They slide a little when putting the wig on but other then that i love them. They fit nicely.</li>
    <li> im glad i got these because i lost my other one and this type works real well with my hair</li>
    <li> These worked for myself and my daughter under our Halloween wigs. They really held our hair in place, and they were comfortable. The other reviewers were helpful and I&#x27;m glad I listened to them and bought these!</li>
    <li> I needed a wig cap for my Halloween costume to hide my hair. This wig cap did a great job of holding my hair, which is long and thick in place and I will definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured. This cap opens on both ends. It is not a full wig cap.</li>
    <li> very affordable, what i needed</li>
    <li> I wear this for those quick times I need to wash my hair but don&#x27;t have time to dry it before I pop on my wig. It does everything it&#x27;s meant to do. Of course because of the netting it will snack on the combs if you&#x27;re not careful. It doesn&#x27;t squeeze your brain until you have a headache either. I don&#x27;t have long hair obviously so I don&#x27;t have an issue with it keeping my real hair laying down. Women with longer locks may have to braid or pin their hair down to keep it from sliding.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long thick hair and I was impressed at how well it held and kept her hair in the net. She never had to adjust it or fix it. Great item.</li>
    <li> Band was so tight it gave me a head ache and I have a small head. Other than that, I would have liked it.</li>
    <li> I like them very much. Does the job that it is suppose dot but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the opening on top.</li>
