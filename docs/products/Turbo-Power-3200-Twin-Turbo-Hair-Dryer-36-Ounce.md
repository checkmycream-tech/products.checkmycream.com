### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best blow dryer ever.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a hairstylist, and Twinturbo 3200 is one of the best blow dryer out of all brands,</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>It worked great for about 9 months.</li>
      <li>Amazing blow dryer with lots of power and heat!</li>
      <li>So I borrowed my friends T3 for a while, and it was good</li>
      <li>good stuff.</li>
      <li>I loved it</li>
      <li>great hair dryer, dries hair very quick!</li>
      <li>Was recommended by my hair stylist and I love it!</li>
      <li>and they love it as well.</li>
      <li>Love the product, love how my hair feels</li>
      <li>My hair feels and just looks better.  </li>
      <li>All the features that made TwinTurbo better than most have disappeared like a Roth fund managed by GS.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this blow dryer.</li>
      <li>Now i know this hair dryer says its light weight</li>
      <li>i enjoy working it.</li>
      <li>The T3 i felt it was just a bit more powerful</li>
      <li>The hair dryer has a number of settings and will allow you to have very cool air or very hot air.  </li>
      <li>if anybody likes to get fast and quality style, this is the perfect product, it&#x27;s powerful and last longer.....</li>
      <li>After 9 months, the hot air wouldn&#x27;t stay hot after 5 minutes of being on; it turns to warm air.</li>
      <li>and they tell me it is truly amazing, just keep in mind that this is a professional dryer, and if used without caution, it may burn some ones hair, because it is that powerful!</li>
      <li>I must say this has been my favorite blow dryer I have really curly hair</li>
      <li>Came in quick..</li>
      <li>When you go to high end salons in NYC, this is the blow dryer most salons use.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because I wanted a hair dryer that would blow very hot air.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very hot</li>
      <li>I received my new twin turbo and I am pleased with the wright , power and   Attachments</li>
      <li>Well I decided that I needed a new hair dryer since I have been using a Revlon one for many years now.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>They are worth every penny you spend on them.  </li>
      <li>Twinturbo by far is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It has 2 heat settings and it is quite powerful.  </li>
      <li>Gets super hot</li>
      <li>excellent for thick long hair , it just take me 15 min to dryhair , my hair now shiny and looks more stylist</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have used many different blowdryer brands over the years.  </li>
      <li>This dryer is a vast improvement over the many other dryers I own.  </li>
      <li>I was using The Chi deep brilliance dryer for my Dominican blowouts which was good but this twin turbo cuts my blowouts to half the time and gets far more straighter with just the blow dryer.</li>
      <li>Also, the diffuser falls off very often while the hair dryer is on.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to spend to much time on one piece of hair every time I do my hair</li>
      <li>Her hair is straight and she loves this product.</li>
      <li>thanks much 😍</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend it.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it and hope it lasts a very long time.</li>
      <li>, so sure don&#x27;t want to try to hold the other model like this one, if it is even heavier.  </li>
      <li>When I called back, they not only sent me another one, but two more.  </li>
      <li>once it&#x27;s dry and love the durability of the actual piece.  </li>
      <li>I am a hairdresser and use this on every hair type from crazy curly, Afro hair to flat silky fine hair and haven&#x27;t found anything better!!</li>
      <li>3200, despite the very loud sound, doesn&#x27;t move much air as to be referred to as professional dryer; this doesn&#x27;t come close to my Elchim 3800 or other brands I&#x27;ve used in my salon.</li>
      <li>It does a very professional job and was recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
      <li>The Hot side does not work properly for day 1.</li>
      <li>The vendor sent me the European voltage model at first and almost didn&#x27;t take it back at first.  </li>
      <li>Basically you need to be super careful and not rush when using this dryer or your hair will be ruined.</li>
      <li>This dryer has plenty of air flow but not adquate heat for a professional level Hair Dryer.  </li>
      <li>This is the same hair dryer my hair stylist uses in Dominican Republic, living my hair which is very curly and dry&lt;</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I had the second one, because the first one pooped out after only a year and a half.  </li>

<li> I highly recommend this blow dryer, I use it in the salon, and it gets my clients in and out in half the time.</li>
<li> and i dont even haveeee to use a flat iron.  </li>
<li> It is quite powerful and gets my long hair dry in less time than other dryers I have had in the past.  </li>

<li> my daughters have very long hair</li>
<li> Takes me about 15 minutes to blow dry and style my hair.  </li>
<li> I have curly hair that absorbs water and, even though my hair is short, it usually takes a long time to dry one strand.  </li>
<li> Absolutely no complaints about it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s lightweight and has a lot of power and since I have a lot of hair it takes a lot less time to dry my hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s still too soon to see if I&#x27;ll have to purchase another hairdryer in a year from now, as I have done in the past with lesser quality products but from what my hairdresser says, he&#x27;s had his forever</li>
<li> By that time some of the other hair gets frizzy.  </li>
<li> It works so well, and gets the job done in half the time.</li>
<li> Which has been a year and a half to two years.  </li>
<li> I hope that this second one last longer, as it is an expensive blow dryer.  </li>
<li> It is a little heavy</li>
<li> I have been using the Twinturbo 3200 everyday for 11 months.</li>
<li> I have long, thick, curly, frizzy hair, and this product is the cure all!  </li>
<li> Always had conair drugstore driers in the past.  </li>
<li> I am not pleased with the fact that the of the blowdryer does not have a guard like the chi or the elchim</li>
<li> My previous hair dryer was a SuperSolano that I used everyday for 6 YEARS before it failed.</li>
<li> I have thick curly hair and needs a hair dryer that can handle that in a jiffy ... found what I was looking for.</li>
<li> I mean it dried my hair dont get me wrong</li>
<li> in -law who has long hair and was frustrated with the drying time.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s quite startling.</li>
<li> Just flat-out disappointed in this model.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with it.</li>
<li> Worst of all, I chose this 3200 Twinturbo because the description refered to it as \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot;.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been a hairstylist for over 12 years.  I have used many different blowdryer brands over the years.  Twinturbo by far is my favorite.  This is the third Twinturbo blowdryer that I have owned. I use them until they don&#x27;t work anymore.  Which has been a year and a half to two years.  They are worth every penny you spend on them.  Amazon is the cheapest I have found them.</li>
    <li> Bought the tun turbo to replace my elchim blowdryer that in had for years. Purchased the twin turbo based on the reviews and that it is lighter weight then the elchim with the same power. I received my new twin turbo and I am pleased with the wright , power and   Attachments I am not pleased with the fact that the of the blowdryer does not have a guard like the chi or the elchim have that protects your hair from being sucked into the motor. Ouch and it burns your hair. Basically you need to be super careful and not rush when using this dryer or your hair will be ruined.</li>
    <li> The vendor sent me the European voltage model at first and almost didn&#x27;t take it back at first.  When I called back, they not only sent me another one, but two more.  Fortunately, I had the second one, because the first one pooped out after only a year and a half.  I hope that this second one last longer, as it is an expensive blow dryer.  It does a very professional job and was recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
    <li> excellent for thick long hair , it just take me 15 min to dryhair , my hair now shiny and looks more stylist</li>
    <li> Came in quick.. Amazing blow dryer with lots of power and heat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist, and Twinturbo 3200 is one of the best blow dryer out of all brands, if anybody likes to get fast and quality style, this is the perfect product, it&#x27;s powerful and last longer..... I loved it</li>
    <li> The Hot side does not work properly for day 1.</li>
    <li> This dryer has plenty of air flow but not adquate heat for a professional level Hair Dryer.  Worst of all, I chose this 3200 Twinturbo because the description refered to it as \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot;.  My shoulders ache after using it, so sure don&#x27;t want to try to hold the other model like this one, if it is even heavier.  Just flat-out disappointed in this model.</li>
    <li> All the features that made TwinTurbo better than most have disappeared like a Roth fund managed by GS.  There must be a city in China called Italy because the the lack of build quality this brand is cursed with makes you wonder--see pics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3200, despite the very loud sound, doesn&#x27;t move much air as to be referred to as professional dryer; this doesn&#x27;t come close to my Elchim 3800 or other brands I&#x27;ve used in my salon.</li>
    <li> Well I decided that I needed a new hair dryer since I have been using a Revlon one for many years now.  i did alot of research before deciding on the Twin Turbo.  So I borrowed my friends T3 for a while, and it was good but nothingggg compared to the Twin Turbo.  I felt that the T3 was allll name and no product.  I mean it dried my hair dont get me wrong but Twin Turbo did wonders for my hair.  The T3 i felt it was just a bit more powerful then my Revlon and the Twin Turbo got ALOT hotter than the T3.  It used to take me an hour to straighten my hair, now 20 minutes and i dont even haveeee to use a flat iron.  Now i know this hair dryer says its light weight well when i picked it up i thought otherwise buttt just use it because when u angle the dryer to your hair the weight goes to the tip of the dryer and it feels a bit lighter.  It has 2 heat settings and it is quite powerful.  My hair feels and just looks better.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> great hair dryer, dries hair very quick! my daughters have very long hair and they love it as well. it is the same model the pros use.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a life saver!  I have long, thick, curly, frizzy hair, and this product is the cure all!  Takes me about 15 minutes to blow dry and style my hair.  My hair dresser recommended this product,and she was spot on! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> When you go to high end salons in NYC, this is the blow dryer most salons use.  Absolutely no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my hair stylist and I love it! I have thick curly hair and needs a hair dryer that can handle that in a jiffy ... found what I was looking for. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer ever. Gets super hot I was using The Chi deep brilliance dryer for my Dominican blowouts which was good but this twin turbo cuts my blowouts to half the time and gets far more straighter with just the blow dryer. You&#x27;ve got my vote.</li>
    <li> It was like pulling teeth to make the decision to finally spend the money on this hairdryer.  I haven&#x27;t regretted yet!  Love the product, love how my hair feels once it&#x27;s dry and love the durability of the actual piece.  It&#x27;s still too soon to see if I&#x27;ll have to purchase another hairdryer in a year from now, as I have done in the past with lesser quality products but from what my hairdresser says, he&#x27;s had his forever so I&#x27;m hoping I will too.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great i enjoy working it. thanks much 😍</li>
    <li> Present for Wife.  She loves it.  Always had conair drugstore driers in the past.  The Twin Turbo blows them away.  ( pun intended)  good stuff.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer has a number of settings and will allow you to have very cool air or very hot air.  It is quite powerful and gets my long hair dry in less time than other dryers I have had in the past.  It is a little heavy and I definitely would not refer to it as compact - it&#x27;s about the same size as a standard dryer you might get at a drug store and it&#x27;s heavier as well.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it and hope it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and has a lot of power and since I have a lot of hair it takes a lot less time to dry my hair.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair blower cause I lost the back of my other blow dryer I must say this has been my favorite blow dryer I have really curly hair and this blow dryer does the job it&#x27;s very hot so I don&#x27;t have to spend to much time on one piece of hair every time I do my hair I feel like I just came out the salon</li>
    <li> Love it. Salon results and lasts for years.</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended that I buy this dryer.  I have curly hair that absorbs water and, even though my hair is short, it usually takes a long time to dry one strand.  By that time some of the other hair gets frizzy.  This dryer is a vast improvement over the many other dryers I own.  I also bought it for my daughter-in -law who has long hair and was frustrated with the drying time. Her hair is straight and she loves this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this blow dryer. It works so well, and gets the job done in half the time. I highly recommend this blow dryer, I use it in the salon, and it gets my clients in and out in half the time.</li>
    <li> I bought two of this because my sisters, enrolled in a beauty salon school, and they tell me it is truly amazing, just keep in mind that this is a professional dryer, and if used without caution, it may burn some ones hair, because it is that powerful!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Twinturbo 3200 everyday for 11 months. I bought it because I wanted a hair dryer that would blow very hot air. It worked great for about 9 months. After 9 months, the hot air wouldn&#x27;t stay hot after 5 minutes of being on; it turns to warm air. Also, the diffuser falls off very often while the hair dryer is on. It&#x27;s quite startling. My previous hair dryer was a SuperSolano that I used everyday for 6 YEARS before it failed. I do not recommend the Pibbs Twinturbo!! I am very disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> This is the same hair dryer my hair stylist uses in Dominican Republic, living my hair which is very curly and dry&lt;br /&gt;smooth and shiny.I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this dryer after years of using the 2600 model and couldn&#x27;t be happier! I am a hairdresser and use this on every hair type from crazy curly, Afro hair to flat silky fine hair and haven&#x27;t found anything better!!</li>
