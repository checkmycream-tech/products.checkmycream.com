    <li> Yes it&#x27;s always been great soap for me I LOVE it, the price seems to increase exponentially though...should have bought more a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne for many years and have tried all kinds of treatments (proactive, precriotions, antibiotics, name it). This great soap that as helped keep my acne under control and lighten scars.I&#x27;ve tried other African Black soaps that are very drying, this one is not. It has a nice scent as well.</li>
    <li> Great soap it has helped clear up my granddaughters eczema</li>
    <li> Great for my skin.  I can tell the difference now that I ahev started using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nubian Heritage shea butter soaps for a few years now - originally purchased them in the workers co-op (Rainbow Grocery)  here in San Francisco, but due to the price differential I&#x27;ve been purchasing them here on Amazon for the last year or so.  The African Black  is my favorite - I use the soap to lather my face to shave with (thick, luxurious foam) as well as bath with.  The chunks of oatmeal make a great, quasi-abrasive surface with which to wash your body, while the gentle shea butters hydrate and maintain your skin.  Couple this with one of their lotions after your bath and your skin will be very happy.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. It leaves my skin supple and smooth. It is organic and contains nothing that I would consider toxic. It&#x27;s one of the best soaps I&#x27;ve ever used. Up also love the neem oil soap and the honey and black seed soap. All of this company&#x27;s products are amazing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap!!  It cleans my skin better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  This is an amazing deal.  One bar is $6 in the store.  I have given two away to friends.  I want everyone I know to try this soap, that how much I like it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have very sensitive, dry skin. This soap solved the dry skin issue and I had no negative reactions after use. I will definitely continue to order.</li>
    <li> So I just purchased this soap about a week ago . And first I couldn&#x27;t really see a difference but then I began using it twice a day once in the morning and once at night . Over the course of the next week I had extremely bad eczema on my arms and a little on my chest . Arms are clearer and softer than ever and my chest is clearing up . For me using this soap with coconut oil is doing wonders for me . Completely in love with it and will be ordering my next bar very soon .</li>
    <li> I love this soap!! I used to use olay, but my skin was getting too dry and itchy. I also have sensitive skin and ever since I used this soap, I&#x27;ve seen how much healthier my skin looks. I also love it for shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> I found this while looking for another product. It provides moderate relief with a fair duration (a few hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to see if they have it in lotion form.</li>
    <li> At first when we took it out of the packaging there was a very strong greenish floral smell which dissipated after awhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a soap person because I thought it was too drying. However, I heard about the environmental and ecological damage those little beads in bodywash can do, so I started thinking about switching to soap. I started noticing little red bumps on my chest and arms, so I wanted something to help treat that. I did some research and came across African Black Soap. I tried one bar and loved it. I use it on my face and body. It&#x27;s great at removing makeup without too much drying and it helped clear up my body skin issues. I buy in bulk because I never want to run out!</li>
    <li> Black soap is the only soap that works on my skin. There isn&#x27;t any irritating chemicals and it feels smooth afterwards. It got rid of many of my pimples also. I have eczema so it&#x27;s great for my skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live with out it. Once you try it , you are hooked</li>
    <li> This soap is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. I&#x27;ve already seen a difference in my skin. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Love it for my eczema</li>
    <li> Awesome soap for cleansing.</li>
    <li> I like nice soaps....this is good stuff</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my mother in law and send it for her to Haiti.. She loved it, she had acne, dark spots all over her face but because of this soap her face is now clear and smooth.. She loves it!! And now she wants me to send her more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this soap befor,and now it&#x27;s my favorite.It rinses off well and smells great.I even wash my hail with this soap.I will reorder!</li>
    <li> This african black soap makes my skin very soft. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over 15 years and i love it! Works wonders on dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliate. Smells wonderful .I Would not use anything but this and I am not African. Try it you will see.</li>
    <li> This nubian soap is the best you can tell the difference from the first use me and my husband both liked it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I always buy this soap, but for some reason this purchase wasn&#x27;t the same.  The soap does not have the same strong (or light) scent I fell in love with.  I began using this soap mainly because of the scent. I waited to write the review until I used at least 2 bars to determine if it was the bar or the lot.  I believe it is the lot that is defective.  The 4 stars is because the fragrance in the soap is almost non existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased from this supplier because the price was great.  But at the sacrifice of the the scent, not sure if I will purchase from this suppler again.  I will make that determination after my next purchase from my normal suppler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am very persnickety about what I put on my skin. The soap cleans well and my skin feels great after I use it. It does not dry my skin.</li>
    <li> yup yup, good black soap for troubled faces. been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Love this product and always give it away to my family members.</li>
    <li> Helped my daughters skin.</li>
    <li> This product cleared up my face as well as my daughters. Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Great for a black woman with oily skin. Really works.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, my skin felt itchy after the shower but, not any more. I guess my skin adapt to it now. This soap clean the body very well.</li>
    <li> First bought this soap from a recommendation from a friend for washing my face.  Now I just use this soap for my entire body when I shower. It&#x27;s smooth and gentle and won&#x27;t dry your skin like commercial soaps with harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> Very good soap.  Especially use it for my face daily to get rid of razor bumps and after leaving the barber shop.  I am a young black male and recommend this soap</li>
