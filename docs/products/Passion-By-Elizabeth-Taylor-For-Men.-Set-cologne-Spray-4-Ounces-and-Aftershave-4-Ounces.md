    <li> I have tried to contact Amazon.com about one bottle being broken when it was delivered. It was just placed on the front porch.&lt;br /&gt;and because of the liquid seeping out of the package and wetting the cardboard and the strong smell the driver had to know it was&lt;br /&gt;broken. He overlooked all the signs and left it. The method of reporting damage is not easy to complete. I do not have much hope for there being any resolution for this problem.</li>
    <li> Good price for this product. Hard to find in retail stores. The wife is very happy with the fragrance and that makes me feel good.</li>
    <li> My favorite, at a great price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love passion for women and thought I would try this for my hus band....Not Disapponited, smells great!!!!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend was surprised and delighted to receive the cologne gift. The scent was even better than he remembered it.</li>
    <li> Very good price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Love it best cologne for the price!!!</li>
    <li> shipping was fast,item arrived on time,had it before,so had to buy the box set this time,works for me,it is musky with vanilla tones,love it</li>
    <li> I ordered two packages of this cologne and after shave.  I got one okay, the other damaged with the after shave broken and all over the packing.  I called their customer service and they sent a third set immediately.  Guess what that one arrived all broken again the after shave all through out the package.  I called and again the customer service was fantastic.  They this time credited me the price of one of the sets, plus some of the shipping cost.  I advised them that their package was miss handled by UPS as both boxes had damage.  I do not know how they could of packed it more secure than they had.  In summary great product, great company, great customer service, but terrible job of delivery by UPS!</li>
    <li> Was a great deal for the money. I usually have a hard time finding a set with cologne &amp; aftershave together!!</li>
    <li> The cologne and after-shave is fantastic.  I never fail to get complements from the women I meet that get close enough to smell me.  &amp;#34;You smell good&amp;#34;, they say.  Still doesn&#x27;t guarantee I&#x27;ll get a date but at least the ladies don&#x27;t hold their nose and step backward and away from me.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for over 30 years. Shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Smells great. Not to strong</li>
    <li> Perfect, thanks so much!  I bought this for my husband for years until it was no longer available in stores.  I bought other stuff over the years, but never really liked any of it as much.  So, I finally did an Amazon search and was thrilled to find it just in time for our 21st Anniversary.  Now he smells like himself again, which might actually be more of a gift to me, thanks so much!</li>
    <li> This was a real good buy and I have received many good comments about it. Will purchase it again when I need cologne.</li>
    <li> I love to smell this cologne on my husband.  Yes, I would recommend it to someone else.  It has a very sexy smell.</li>
    <li> Started using Passion for Men several years ago,  but I was unable to find it locally, unless I went to a &amp;#34;high-dollar&amp;#34; shopping mall and paid top dollar for it.  It has a nice scent, but is not too strong, and it lasts all day.  I will continue to order it through Amazon as long as I can.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this cologne  for men. I will be ordering more  from this seller all year. I got the Passion Cologne within days from ordering. Love it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Old School!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. Combo pack was offered at a great price.</li>
    <li> I must say this fragrance is a gem. I use to get all the top fragrances back in my 20&#x27;s(99-10) however I started to think why spend so much money on the latest designers and smell like the masses. I&#x27;m sure what smelled good back then(80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s) sure smells good now. Passion is one of those fragrance it smells very masculine yet very powerfully soft(you only smell it when someone is in your space) it doesnt leave a trail either and it last all day. What does it smell like? Well it definitely has it&#x27;s own unique smell. It a classy, sophisticated, polished &amp; upgraded version of Burberry Brit.</li>
    <li> My favorite at a great price</li>
    <li> My husband loves this, it smells wonderful on him.  I would buy it again for him.</li>
    <li> One of the best, Been using it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Thrilled to find my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne at such a great price.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> I love Passion for women and really like this one for men. So does my husband.</li>
    <li> CAME ON TIME AND I REALLY LIKE IT</li>
    <li> Like this set, you get 2 nice sized bottles and the price was great! My husband will love it ! Yeah  Amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my husband and he loves it and so do I.  I have been searching for other colognes that are as great a deal as this one was.</li>
    <li> My husband  gets many complements</li>
    <li> I gave &amp;#34;PASSION&amp;#34; By ELIZABETH TAYLOR FOR MEN a five star rating because I really like it myself, and used to by it in the store when it was available. Now I order it on line because I get more compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it than I ever have gotten with other colognes and after shave lotions, even the more VERY expensive ones.</li>
    <li> To shower and shave and do some passion for man after shave, It feels good to put on with no burning and it also give me a clean  feeling of good smells and I get complimented on the on the fragrance as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect scent for me.</li>
    <li> The women go crazy every time I wear this stuff.</li>
    <li> This was a great bargain, and it has the best smell of any men&#x27;s fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t burn your nose like some, but is still a manly fragrance without being overpowering.  My hubby loves it, too!!</li>
    <li> My girl friend loves this. I think it smells great. The price is reasonable. What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> excellent,have been using a long time</li>
    <li> came in descent time and my dad loves his gift!</li>
    <li> Excellent, this and Obssession are my favorites</li>
    <li> Great product for price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Perfect smell for me. Works well with my body chemistry and do not need a lot of it. Good price ad I didn&#x27;t have to spend the $6 in gas to go to the nearest store that still sells it. Said money and most importantly, time.</li>
