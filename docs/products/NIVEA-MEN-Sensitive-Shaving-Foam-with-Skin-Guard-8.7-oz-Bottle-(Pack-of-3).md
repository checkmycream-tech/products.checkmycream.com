    <li> Best shaving cream ever made an actual cream and it&#x27;s awesome so much for your money $7 for three of these these things cost at least 7 bucks each in Dwayne Reade  and cannot find it</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave. The push-button is very easy to operate, unlike the Nivea Gel can.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Creamy and pleasant scent.  Softens the skin and avoids razor burns and nicks.  Both women and men in my family use it.</li>
    <li> The foam is thick and smooth.  Good.</li>
    <li> Foams up well,  great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Good deal/value and a good product.  Using this for head shaving and it is a solid shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I got the Nivea Shaving Gel along with the Nivea Men Shaving Cream.  Both are good but I would say that the gel is better.  I like the thicker feel to the gel as it holds onto the skin nicely and feels great when shaving.  The Nivea Shaving Cream is just too thin so the blade doesn&#x27;t glide through facial hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent on both is very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this stuff and I have sensitive skin. That should be testimony enough for you. Works for me!</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this product. I received it for a great price through Ashley Hart&#x27;s coupon site.</li>
    <li> great shave. One of the best shaving creams I have used. And i use it to shave my head and face.</li>
    <li> Even those this is marketed for guys, I am a woman and I use Nivea shaving foam because it is AWESOME. This stuff is super thick and creamy. It leaves my skin moisturized and I have not had any skin breakouts or other problems using it to shave. It has a light fragrance that is guy-like but it doesn&#x27;t really linger so that&#x27;s good. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> This product is soft on the skin and has a great scent to it; not to strong of perfumy.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try foam instead of gel, so I picked this up.  I really like that you don&#x27;t have to lather it up like gel, just spread it on and you&#x27;re in business.  I don&#x27;t get razor burn or really any ingrown hairs with this.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> Seriously, what&#x27;s the deal with making me use bargain basement old man foam, grocery stores?  I used to use Gillette Series shaving foam until I couldn&#x27;t find it on store shelves ([[ASIN:B000052YIN Gillette Series Sensitive Skin Shave Foam 9 Oz (Pack of 6)]] is available on Amazon).  Then, I grabbed a can of Nivea foam and fell in love.  Trouble is, it&#x27;s hard to come by.  The shaving cream magnates are demanding men use gel and forcing us into the dark corners of the internet to secure the foam our whiskers and razors long for.  It has to be some crazy conspiracy.  I can&#x27;t be the only one who hates change... and shaving gel.  This three pack has me set up for a bit and I pray to all that is good and holy that it continues to be offered on Amazon.  Smells great, long-lasting, foamy goodness in a can.</li>
    <li> The absolute best shaving cream I have ever used, period! Amazon is also the best price anywhere.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Use to gel to foam products.</li>
    <li> This foam is very gentle on your skin.  My husband has sensitive skin and often gets razor burn.  Not with this shave foam!</li>
    <li> I like this product a great deal.  In fact, it is my favorite brand of shaving cream. My only complaint is the enormous cost of shipping compared to the actual price of the product. I committed to buy the product before I realized how much it would cost me to get it.</li>
    <li> Helped with my husbands rosacea. Good if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Works great! Long lasting Masculine fragrance. I have to shave daily and this product seems to prevent razor burn effectively.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years and love it.  I have VERY sensitive skin and a really thick, coarse beard... a lovely combo for shaving, I&#x27;ll tell ya.  This stuff rocks - I never get razor burn, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh.  The scent is not overpowering - very neutral smelling I&#x27;d say.  They recently changed the dispenser so that it comes out of the can as a lather (the old dispenser released a gel that you would work into a lather).  The lather is a perfect consistency and spreads really smoothly.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> For those people that don&#x27;t like shaving with gels, this is a great alternative.  It gives you more comfort than a cheaper shaving cream.  It does have a slight fragance that I could do without, but not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I love their gel shave cream and I accidentally order this one but was still very satisfied with this product as well</li>
    <li> Foam continues to come out of the container slowly after each use. Kind of annoying and waste of foam. It would dry up by next morning. Not a big deal. Even Gillette foam has the same issue</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaving foam and make sure you note that it is FOAM because I didn&#x27;t notice this.  He noticed and likes it much more than the gel because the electric shaver deals with it much better.  I love how it smells and it has done wonder for his skin.</li>
    <li> great price  smooth skin a+</li>
