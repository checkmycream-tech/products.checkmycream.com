      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>Which in turn would break me out more.</li>
      <li>it isnt oily &amp;  it has a nice mild fragrance that doesnt linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has very fresh scent and nice light texture.  </li>
      <li>Very rich yet extremely easy to wear.</li>
      <li>In fact, everything goes on much more smoothly and stays that way.</li>
      <li>I find that it has a rather sweet cucumber scent, which I love.  </li>
      <li>Packaging: nicely boxed and in a beautiful, heavy, frosted glass jar.  </li>
      <li>It is light and therefore doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy or oily and easy to apply make up afterwards.</li>
      <li>well its huge.</li>
      <li>and it is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>This cream is light and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for a light moisturizer to use at night and this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This was so light, hydrating, and calming to the skin.</li>
      <li>It is so light but provides tons of moisture.  </li>
      <li>Just a slight very pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an investment but totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Instead it moisturizes quite nicely and my skin looks better the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Super light.</li>
      <li>Light scent, good for daily use.</li>
      <li>The very high cost of a face cream, for my age, will continue to buy。1 more word</li>
      <li>nothing seems to help my skin, i got this as a sample from Sephora and am now about to buy the full product.</li>
      <li>Not bad per se, and doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; to me.</li>
      <li>I got no breakouts, it hydrated skin well and it has a fresh clean smell.</li>
      <li>Fresh, clean scent...</li>
      <li>The scent fades quickly and it rubs in well.</li>
      <li>It covers quickly and then dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>It does disappear rather quickly, though and does not linger on your face, like some creams&#x27; scents do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the face cream; it leaves my skin moist, dewey yet not sticky or oily; things that I look for in a facial moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>First the scent is very mild and dissipates right after I put it on &amp; is not offensive to me.</li>
      <li>using any kind of cleanser or wash , my face will get very dry , but this cream resolves that very quickly.</li>
      <li>Many of them either cause me to break out or leave my skin feeling greasy as I have combination skin but mostly on the dry side.</li>
      <li>Great product, a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>fresh.</li>
      <li>I use Fresh Umbrian Clay Face</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy off the scent though -</li>
      <li>Also I rarely wear make up, but when I do I never had a problem with this product while applying makeup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a mature woman and have tried so many moisturizers.</li>
      <li>But it does hydrate really well and makes foundation application very easy (I use Bare Minerals).</li>
      <li>I am able to use several products in conjunction with this with no problems.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Fresh products are very hit or miss with me.</li>
      <li>I really love pure simplicity facial cream</li>
      <li>- i&#x27;m really surprised, but I guess i can see how some may have a more sensitive sense of smell?</li>
      <li>My skin is free of irritation, it&#x27;s not dry, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate any preexisting imperfections.</li>
      <li>I notice it even more - no dry taut feeling, still soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very earthy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t know about the whole \\&quot;Youth preserve\\&quot; thing.  </li>
      <li>and SPF was just too much for my skin</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It really moisturizes without feeling greasy - either on my hands or on my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my cousin a while ago. She noticed letters chipping off bottles when she received it. Recently, I bought her the exact same brand from an actual store. She immediately noticed the difference and said the old one (this one) I have given her was a fake item.</li>
    <li> I always hesitate to purchase a moisture cream unless I can actually feel the weight of it. This product is amazing in texture. It does not feel heavy and greasy on your face. Very rich yet extremely easy to wear. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Seller is perfect.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for.  I really love pure simplicity facial cream and it is no longer available.  I have been looking for something comparable.  This was not it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It is so light but provides tons of moisture.  I don&#x27;t have time to always go to the mall, so ordering through this company with free shipping is awesome.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial cream for about 6 months. I have oily, sensitive skin and am in my late 20&#x27;s. I happened upon this product through a beauty subscription box. I had been looking for a light moisturizer to use at night and this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;I have expression lines on my forehead. However, this problem is difficult to treat because my forehead is prone to breaking out. I can&#x27;t just use any moisturizer I like to try to prevent these lines from turning into deep wrinkles. Thankfully, this cream doesn&#x27;t break me out at all. Instead it moisturizes quite nicely and my skin looks better the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder about the long term effects. I have noticed that my lines look worse if I miss a day or two of application. Who knows if it&#x27;s just plumping my skin. I like the effect so I&#x27;ll stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, I don&#x27;t smell pickles but it it is cucumber heavy so keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the face cream; it leaves my skin moist, dewey yet not sticky or oily; things that I look for in a facial moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not crazy off the scent though - it smell&#x27;s &#x27;grassy&#x27; &#x27;like hay&#x27; to me.  I will probably try a different product because to me a pleasing scent is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> BEWARE IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES TO FRAGRANCE, THIS STUFF WILL MAKE YOUR EYES RUN AND YOU WILL SNEEZE CONSTANTLY! NOT GOOD!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and the cream I had been using for years I can&#x27;t get any longer. So I took a chance with this one and it is great!It moisturizers and makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> A very good face lotion.</li>
    <li> This product has a soothing feeling, and feels good on your face. No greasy feeling like with some moisturizers. Just a slight very pleasant fragrance. I will buy it again. I have sensitive skin, and I have had not reactions to this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am new to a face care regime and am therefore experimenting with different creams based on the needs of my skin and the particular season. I bought this cream on a whim. It was showcased in Sephora with a couple other recommendations but it caught my eye. It was more than I wanted to spend but I figured you also get what you pay for with beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with a lot things said here. It&#x27;s very moisturizing. For example, my dry area is at the base of my nose and has been a problem for awhile. This cream makes me forget it was ever an issue. It is light and therefore doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy or oily and easy to apply make up afterwards. The smell is an acquired smell. However, it doesn&#x27;t last so the scent can be overlooked in my opinion and if you like it, even better! Personally, I&#x27;m undecided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably keep this product in mind as I experiment with others and may end up returning to it.</li>
    <li> I received a deluxe sized sample of this product through a beauty box subscription service.  I&#x27;m never a happy camper when I get lotions and creams, because I almost never like them.  This one impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Thick, quality formula....a little goes a long way. I expect the small jar I received to last quite a long time.  Fresh, clean scent...I read another review that described it as \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;...I find that it has a rather sweet cucumber scent, which I love.  It goes on beautifully and absorbs without leaving your skin feeling greasy.  I am able to use several products in conjunction with this with no problems.  Packaging: nicely boxed and in a beautiful, heavy, frosted glass jar.  It just looks \\&quot;fancy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Well...there&#x27;s no getting around this. It&#x27;s expensive, and there are lower end lotions that may not feel as nice going on, but likely accomplish the same thing.  I also don&#x27;t know about the whole \\&quot;Youth preserve\\&quot; thing.  I am going to err on the side of caution and say that this probably is not a miracle in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If money is no object, I really do love this face cream.  Clinique Dramatically different moisturizing lotion is my standby, but as far as softness of skin I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference since using this product daily for the last week.  The little jar I received is likely to last me a while, but I anticipate buying another when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this FACE CREAM!!!</li>
    <li> As a woman with oily, sensitive, and acne-prone skin, this has been a life-changer. I apply it immediately after cleansing and rub it in for ~45 seconds. It has a cucumber-y, aloe-ish smell. It less earthy smelling than it is succulent-smelling. The scent fades quickly and it rubs in well. I usually wait no less than 30 minutes before applying primer to apply makeup, and have had zero issues. In fact, everything goes on much more smoothly and stays that way. My skin is free of irritation, it&#x27;s not dry, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate any preexisting imperfections. It&#x27;s fabulous! Definitely try a sample so you can see it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good face cream for years and have never found a good one. This one is really great. It really moisturizes without feeling greasy - either on my hands or on my face. It smells awesome - like cucumbers! I don&#x27;t feel like I have to keep putting more on. I don&#x27;t care about all the anti-aging stuff. All I care about is how it feels on my face and how long it lasts. I can put it on at night and my face still feels moisturized in the morning.</li>
    <li> Light scent, good for daily use.</li>
    <li> Fresh moisturizer moisturizes without feeling heavy; lovely cucumber fragrance note</li>
    <li> I tried this product for 3 days (maybe 4, cant remember) BUT It worked! And for me to say that...well its huge. nothing seems to help my skin, i got this as a sample from Sephora and am now about to buy the full product. My skin combo is oily, yet dry? also flakey at times and i am acne prone...I have been using normal ivory bar soap (cleared up acne) then i was trying this new product to see if it would help with the dryness...This product left my skin hydrated, feeling clean, my skin didnt feel tight but it felt firm (if that makes sense)...PERSONALLY...I loved the earthy smell, it makes it seem like they use let crap in it!. I used to use all MAC makeup moisturizers but they left my skin feeling oily, so now i am switching!. ALSO this was big for me, when i used other products at night I would wake up with my face looking and feeling oily in the morning... This product felt the same, clean. fresh. and non oily! It&#x27;s an investment but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great face cream.  I don&#x27;t believe I would be without it in my beauty essentials.  Great product, a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she swears by it. Nice fragrance. Very effective. Her skin really looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mature woman and have tried so many moisturizers. Many of them either cause me to break out or leave my skin feeling greasy as I have combination skin but mostly on the dry side. I&#x27;ve been really pleased with this moisturizer. First the scent is very mild and dissipates right after I put it on &amp; is not offensive to me. Since having allergies, I&#x27;m really sensitive to smells so I&#x27;m happy with this compared to alot of products. Secondly, alittle goes a long way and only a small amt is needed; smooths out nicely and absorbed well without leaving my face greasy but still enough moisture for my skin without break outs. I have also tried it with my serums of choice and it works really well with them, though the ingredients of this cream is impressive on it&#x27;s own. I use am &amp; pm but because I&#x27;m on the dry side and live in a desert climate, at night I add a drop of Argan Oil with it. the combination works great.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer, my face sems to have an instant glow when I use it. It is a little heavy for humid summer days, so I am just using at night currently. Perfect for everyday use in  fall and winter, doesnt take alot either so will last a long time. I read a few reviews that stated the smell was bad, and it is a unique smell; however I think it is \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; :) and I have a stronger sensitivity to smells.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 40s and received this as a sample from Sephora. I&#x27;ve tried it for 3 days and while the performance is excellent, I can&#x27;t get beyond the smell. It&#x27;s very earthy. It does disappear rather quickly, though and does not linger on your face, like some creams&#x27; scents do. This cream goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel hydrated but not greasy, even in the dead of winter. If it were better smelling, I&#x27;d give it 4 or 5 stars. I would say if you can get a sample, give it a try.</li>
    <li> It works good. But smells like pickles!!!</li>
    <li> I love this. I have combination  / oily skin and had a person tell me how to use this with the mud mask.I have adult painful acne ;( and needed something that would be kind to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I use and How (Thought I would pass on the knowledge and hope it helps like it has me):&lt;br /&gt;- Morning:&lt;br /&gt;1. Soy Cleanser in morning&lt;br /&gt;2. Rose Hydrating Location - smells nice and light. Dry and then makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Night:&lt;br /&gt;1. I use Fresh Umbrian Clay Face Treatment Purifying Mask 3.4 oz with this soy cleanser. It takes off all my makeup and does not hurt my skin. So I just you a small drop of both, combine, and then add to my face.&lt;br /&gt;2. I use the Toner which is great to make sure all makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;3. Then the Youth Hydrating Cream - it is nice and thick. Does not smell or breakout my skin. Makes my face feel great and not oily. Best product as I have tried many products for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you can use for any type of face. I just love this stuff. I hope it helps you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With acne I thought I had to use harsh cleansers, etc.. which actually made it worse. Then I found this product and it healed my skin. My skin would work overtime trying to fix it self from the products I used. Which in turn would break me out more. Trust me when I say I had tried everything - products that cost over a hundred to product that only cost 3 dollars. This was so light, hydrating, and calming to the skin.</li>
    <li> it is not very good ,i think it is just normal .and the taste is not very good.my skin didn&#x27;t change after use it.it had no good</li>
    <li> This cream is light and not greasy.  It covers quickly and then dries quickly.  I don&#x27;t know if it is going to preserve my face but it works for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this cream - hydrating, leaves my skin dewy (but not greasy!) for hours.  Now the weather is changing and getting colder I notice it even more - no dry taut feeling, still soft. The cream is not too strongly scented, which is also nice.  Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UDATE - i didnt realize when i wrote my review that other folks had complained about the scent - i&#x27;m really surprised, but I guess i can see how some may have a more sensitive sense of smell? So since I&#x27;m one of those people who alternates 2 creams every couple months, i thought i&#x27;d recommend my other fave which is unscented - Dr Denese day cream is wonderful and has no scent (at least not that i can detect!) Her whole line is great, the antioxidant serum is also wonderful but is very lightly scented so maybe get a sample before buying?</li>
    <li> The very high cost of a face cream, for my age, will continue to buy。1 more word requiredmore word required</li>
    <li> I got this face cream from my sister as a gift and I am very pleased with this product.  This has very fresh scent and nice light texture.  It leaves my skin very soft.  I just wish it is less expensive.</li>
    <li> I tried this product at Sephora and ended up buying the jar. It does smell wierd. Not bad per se, and doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; to me. It honestly smells like a combo of pickles and mayonnaise. No kidding. But it does hydrate really well and makes foundation application very easy (I use Bare Minerals).</li>
    <li> Fresh products are very hit or miss with me. The moisturizer is a definite fail. The lotus scent is mild but weird. Also, the product doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the skin. I applied this to my face and attempted to put on foundation half an hour later, and the moisturizer kept flaking/peeling off. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this outright at Sephora on a whim. Of course I tend to walk straight into British products whether it be face care or music, style, you name it. I needed a new face cream, cause Origins in the green tub and SPF was just too much for my skin and and I couldn&#x27;t use it day and night. So I got this home and tried it and immediately loved the feel of it. Super light. I got no breakouts, it hydrated skin well and it has a fresh clean smell. You only need a dime size portion for your whole face, so I have no idea how the lady above went through it so fast. Also I rarely wear make up, but when I do I never had a problem with this product while applying makeup. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and it&#x27;s not even half way gone. The only thing I would like to see different is a price reduction. If you like this product, try the Grapefruit eau de toilette too--me lovesss!!!  Hope that helps.</li>
    <li> so far this is the only face cream/lotion that i have enjoyed. it isnt oily &amp;  it has a nice mild fragrance that doesnt linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after using any kind of cleanser or wash , my face will get very dry , but this cream resolves that very quickly. it keeps my skin soft even during the harsh windy winter season. it is pricey for such a small jar, but its worth it for the results.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have very dry, irritated skin and this product works wonders for that. My only problem is that it&#x27;s quite expensive for the amount you get. I am already 3/4 of the way down and have only had it a week. Granted I use it twice a day, still wish it was double the size for the price. But again, amazing product!! I will still continue to purchase it as my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
