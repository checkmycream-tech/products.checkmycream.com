### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>very good.</li>
      <li>IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>This stuff did work great as a moisturizer, but not to well on scaring or stretch marks.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing and wonderful.</li>
      <li>This was a repeat purchase of an excellent product , I&#x27;ve found it works well to smooth my aging skin.</li>
      <li>and I can see the difference, really good product.</li>
      <li>However, I will be happy to not need it much longer, but has worked wonderfully for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure his cream is great, but at $100 a jar, I couldn&#x27;t afford to find out.</li>
      <li>I love this cream!</li>
      <li>This particular seller is excellent (Haba).</li>
      <li>I now buy 2 jars at a time for $42.80, as this is the best price I have found so far.</li>
      <li>a must for anybody who wants great skin</li>
      <li>i will have to wait some weeks to see more visible effects.</li>
      <li>it really work good on my skin.</li>
      <li>I am acne free because of Elicina.  </li>
      <li>It is worth the risk :)</li>
      <li>Yes it does, for newer and smaller scars it works best but for bigger older scars, it won&#x27;t work that great.</li>
      <li>Shipping: Fairly quick,</li>
      <li>Elicina cream is different -- it not only moisturizes, but also seems to clean and tone the skin -- it is remarkable!</li>
      <li>I first heard about snail extract for the skin in a Dr. Sears newsletter --</li>
      <li>Know you skin type first</li>
      <li>When I go to my out-patient physical therapy, many comment on the progress of my incision healing nearly invisibly - I just show them this product.</li>
      <li>I had a full gastric bypass laproscopically, with one of the five incisions large enough to remove my gall bladder and a five centimeter stone.</li>
      <li>My hands feel very soft.</li>
      <li>I have now used about five jars of Elicina, some purchased directly from the plant store front in Santiago, where I lived for five years.</li>
      <li>For the price I could have bought a decent facial moisturizer though</li>
      <li>Only a small amount is needed and well worth the price!</li>

<li> I figure that I am saving money in the long run since I am no longer experimenting, buying different face creams that I have to toss after two weeks because they don&#x27;t work for my skin.  </li>
<li> /&gt;ANd you only need a lil to go all around your face neck, chest and other scars.&lt;br /&gt;These come with specific instructions for every skin type.</li>
<li> It is a little more expensive, but you are definitely getting what you pay for.</li>
<li> I went on Amazon to see if I could find something comparable for less money.</li>
<li> My skin is very thin and dry, but also prone to breakouts.</li>

    <li> I love this cream! It has worked miracles for me.</li>
    <li> very good. i have just started to use the product may be i will have to wait some weeks to see more visible effects. overall satisfactory</li>
    <li> Works: Yes it does, for newer and smaller scars it works best but for bigger older scars, it won&#x27;t work that great. It will take time for bigger &amp; older scars to start diminishing but YES is works never the less.  Shipping: Fairly quick, prioty mail mayne!  Conclusion: TIME &amp; PATIENCE IS A BIG FACTOR</li>
    <li> This stuff did work great as a moisturizer, but not to well on scaring or stretch marks. For the price I could have bought a decent facial moisturizer though</li>
    <li> I have been using the cram on my hands and neck; I definitely see some improvement.  My hands feel very soft.</li>
    <li> I first heard about snail extract for the skin in a Dr. Sears newsletter -- I&#x27;m sure his cream is great, but at $100 a jar, I couldn&#x27;t afford to find out. I went on Amazon to see if I could find something comparable for less money. I am now on my fourth jar of this cream and it has become an essential part of my skin care regimen. My skin is very thin and dry, but also prone to breakouts. If I do find a cream that protects and moisturizes my skin sufficiently, inevitably, I will begin breaking out within a couple of weeks after I start using it. Elicina cream is different -- it not only moisturizes, but also seems to clean and tone the skin -- it is remarkable! No breakouts! I now buy 2 jars at a time for $42.80, as this is the best price I have found so far. It is a little more expensive, but you are definitely getting what you pay for. I figure that I am saving money in the long run since I am no longer experimenting, buying different face creams that I have to toss after two weeks because they don&#x27;t work for my skin.  If you&#x27;re not sure, buy just one jar at first -- It is worth the risk :)</li>
    <li> I feel like i look younger. Acne scars are fading👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but this cream does seem to work almost miraculously on skin problems. This particular seller is excellent (Haba).</li>
    <li> I am acne free because of Elicina.  Only a small amount is needed and well worth the price!</li>
    <li> a must for anybody who wants great skin</li>
    <li> I have now used about five jars of Elicina, some purchased directly from the plant store front in Santiago, where I lived for five years. This stuff is amazing and wonderful. I had a full gastric bypass laproscopically, with one of the five incisions large enough to remove my gall bladder and a five centimeter stone. On my physicians advice, I began to use Elicina on the incisions after about three weeks from surgery. After about three months, the incisions are essentially invisible. You can see the dimples where two of them were, but the surface epidermis shows almost no evidence of scarring. I just had a total knee replacement nine weeks ago, and have been using my fifth (and about to use sixth and seventh jars) to achieve the same results. When I go to my out-patient physical therapy, many comment on the progress of my incision healing nearly invisibly - I just show them this product. However, I will be happy to not need it much longer, but has worked wonderfully for me.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to be in everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet, male or female!&lt;br /&gt;ANd you only need a lil to go all around your face neck, chest and other scars.&lt;br /&gt;These come with specific instructions for every skin type. Know you skin type first</li>
    <li> I like this cream it really work good on my skin. Sometimes I stop using it and I can see the difference, really good product.</li>
    <li> IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT. I WILL KEEP USING IT AND I INDRODUCED IT TO MY FRIENDS. THE BENEFITS ARE OBVIOUS</li>
    <li> This was a repeat purchase of an excellent product , I&#x27;ve found it works well to smooth my aging skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Cream for about two years I am in my 60s so I feel as though it does help my skin and my wrinkles</li>
