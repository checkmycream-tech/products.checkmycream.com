      <li>I love my Caruso curling set.</li>
      <li>I love the Caruso hair system to curl hair.</li>
      <li>All in all, I still haven&#x27;t found a better way to set my hair, so I&#x27;m sticking with this</li>
      <li>If they had a larger barrel curler it would be the best system on the market</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want that many.</li>
      <li>I ordered these since I needed more rollers.</li>
      <li>I have very straight &amp; fine hair, so these curlers work great with the Caruso rollers.</li>
      <li>I have an old molecular set, and really just needed the rollers, and I&#x27;m very happy with it, and would order again</li>
      <li>They r easy and hold the curl well.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and the foam grabs easy.</li>
      <li>The rollers are excellent; the only problem I have is getting the right size.....</li>
      <li>I know this is  a great product and that my hair will look even better next time, because it will be freshly washed and airdried before I set it!</li>
      <li>The covers don&#x27;t stay on for me either since I have fine hair...</li>
      <li>I love the product but found I like the large rollers better than the medium.</li>
      <li>Same great curlers that had lasted me for years.  </li>
      <li>The curls stay longer and they are constantly getting comments on how great their hair looks.</li>
      <li>Curling my hair is quick and easy.</li>
      <li>These are identical to the original rollers.  </li>
      <li>Originally, I bought these to add to the curlers I already have.</li>
      <li>the most fantsatic roller for long hair and quick and easy to do when u in a hurry gives the most beautiful curl which last all day</li>
      <li>These rollers are nothing really special.</li>
      <li>Good curl, easy on dry and frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>This system and these large rollers make pretty nice curls once you get the feel of using it/them.  </li>
      <li>these rollers for people on the go with medium length hair such as my own.</li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>Now, I want to buy more to replace my old curlers.</li>
      <li>so I could get the right ones.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll  have to order the curlers again and hope they send the right shields.</li>
      <li>I have very straight, un-permed shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is very straight.</li>
      <li>These are a good size for body with a little curl.</li>
      <li>I love these rollers already had some but wanted extra.</li>
      <li>/&gt;By the way, be sure you check the outside of the roller covers you use when ordering replacements.</li>
      <li>I wish they had been described better with their actual sizes.</li>
      <li>Bought the extra rollers but discovered that they gave me so many that I really didn&#x27;t need to buy the extras!</li>
      <li>Be aware the sizes are not what they use to be.  </li>
      <li>Just exactly what the explanation said.</li>
      <li>When I wrapped the curler then put the shield on the whole unit just slips right out of my hair.</li>
      <li>great bouncy curls but not a large enough curler.  </li>
      <li>I love the long curls and how shiny it is.</li>
      <li>I loved these hot rollers enough to order a second set and new steam unit hen the first one died after 6 years.</li>
      <li>If you use them after washing your hair, make sure it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
      <li>The ones listed as large 20 years ago are now jumbo size.</li>
      <li>I use the large rollers for my hair.</li>
      <li>I wanted what they call the Large</li>
      <li>I just needed a few more in this large size, and was pleased to discover that Amazon carries the individual sizes.</li>
      <li>in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return these but the seller (not Amazon) required me to pay the shipping which was nearly as much as the product, so I&#x27;m stuck with them and had to order &amp;#34;mediums.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So fast, so simple,a pleasure to use.  </li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t really curl.  </li>
      <li>Really loves the product.</li>
      <li>My hair is long (mid-back), fine, straight, and layered.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY other electric roller sets, and they just didn&#x27;t work!</li>
      <li>I tried it with an older shield I had from before and locked my hair with the curler in place.</li>
      <li>My girls used them in high school and still using them today.  </li>
      <li>did look great for about an hour, but fell flat shortly after so not worth all the time it took to put it up.</li>
      <li>My hair has never felt so soft after being curled!!</li>
      <li>Only takes 5 minutes and is so much healthier for your hair than a curling iron!!</li>
      <li>my hair goes flat rather quickly so doesn&#x27;t hold all day.</li>
      <li>Caruso products are much gentler on the hair since they use steam (rather than direct heat) to curl hair.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I am a huge fan of this product.</li>
      <li>I have had my steamer for years but was in need of some new curlers.  </li>
      <li>My regular hot rollers wouldn&#x27;t curl my hair anymore.</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair &amp; it&#x27;s always been hard to hold a curl.</li>
      <li>I have super soft hair and this is the only way I can get those big curls and keep them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ordered wrong size, and sent them back. If I needed this size it would have been perfect.Love the color. No more.</li>
    <li> Leaves a line in your hair and it didn&#x27;t really curl.  I am unimpressed.  I am glad that they weren&#x27;t expensive!</li>
    <li> I have been using Caruso Steam Rollers for over ten years.  They will not damage your hair.  The foam wears out over time, so they need to be replaced.  I have been very pleased with the rollers.</li>
    <li> I love the product but found I like the large rollers better than the medium. I ordered 12 large rollers and they came with jumbo shields and they are too big and fall out so I can&#x27;t use them. I wish they had a costumer service site so I could get the right ones. Otherwise this is the best hair curling system I have used and I am 74 y/o. My regular hot rollers wouldn&#x27;t curl my hair anymore. After tossing and turning all night I wake up with the curls still in place. I guess I&#x27;ll  have to order the curlers again and hope they send the right shields.</li>
    <li> I use this system every day.  I hope that they never never delete this product. Caruso Hair curling  system.  I have used this product for years. I recom-mend this for every one.</li>
    <li> I have an old molecular set, and really just needed the rollers, and I&#x27;m very happy with it, and would order again</li>
    <li> These rollers are nothing really special. I have thin, fine hair. The hair must be pefectly dry, and having some product (dry) in it to give it \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; helps. It is a very lengthly process because the hair has to dry completely and sometimes one needs a hair dryerto help it dry. When you spend the extra time the curl does last a little longer.</li>
    <li> I have used steam rollers for years and now both my daughters love this product.  The curls stay longer and they are constantly getting comments on how great their hair looks.</li>
    <li> takes too long to dry</li>
    <li> I love my Caruso curling set. I am glad I got the extra curlers since I have really thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love the Caruso hair system to curl hair. I bought extra curlers because I have thick hair. I bought the Caruso system to replace my old because. my old curlers were all falling apart.</li>
    <li> I like the Caruso Steam Rollers.  However, the  roller is made of sponge and my hair rolls too tight with it?  I would like to have a &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; curl but, it seems that it comes out too curly for what I want.</li>
    <li> THE END CIRCLE KEEPS COMING OFF AND THEY DON&#x27;T SNAP TIGHT</li>
    <li> I bought these for extras.  The Caruso is the only way I can get a curl in my waist length hair that will last longer than 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> the most fantsatic roller for long hair and quick and easy to do when u in a hurry gives the most beautiful curl which last all day</li>
    <li> Bought the extra rollers but discovered that they gave me so many that I really didn&#x27;t need to buy the extras! So I will pack them away until I wear out the ones that came with it but I give them a five star, they work great!</li>
    <li> love my caruso rollers</li>
    <li> My hair is very straight. When I wrapped the curler then put the shield on the whole unit just slips right out of my hair. I tried it with an older shield I had from before and locked my hair with the curler in place. Would have liked the shields to be a bit more secure. But I am glad I found the rollers.</li>
    <li> Love Love these rollers!  Best curlers there is!  We have used them for atleast 10 years.  My girls used them in high school and still using them today.  Just used them for my youngest wedding.  She was beautiful!</li>
    <li> Doubled my oreder.  I didn&#x27;t want that many.</li>
    <li> I hate the whole notion of roller setting my hair,so when I found out that this system recommends setting the hair while dry, I was intrigued.     What pushed me over the edge, was seeing this video review on youtube;  [...]    I tried the rollers on wash day (BEFORE) I washed my hair,just to see how it would turn out. I was shocked to see that even on hair that hadn&#x27;t been washed in 3 days, it still came out FAB-TASTIC!!  I went on and shampooed the curls out, then deep conditioned my hair like I normally would. I know this is  a great product and that my hair will look even better next time, because it will be freshly washed and airdried before I set it! What a brilliant product this is!!!     Here is a link to my results once the rollers were removed (I had them in for 45 minutes).  [...]</li>
    <li> Good curl, easy on dry and frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered the large and the jumbo rollers, unfortunately, these rollers were the same identical size. I wish they had been described better with their actual sizes.</li>
    <li> I have owned my Caruso Steam roller for years and finally had to replace the rollers.  Curling my hair is quick and easy. .... believe me, you don&#x27;t want to leave the curlers in for any length of time or your hair will be way too curly....I would recommend the set to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Caruso Steam Rollers for over 20 years. I switched from the hard plastic type, after I found they ripped my hair out. I have very straight, un-permed shoulder length hair. I like to have curl in my hair, even when I wear it up, which I call my \\&quot;palm tree affair\\&quot;, or wear it down, depending on the occasion. I play a lot of golf, and so I am outside, and find that the curl will stand up to the foggy weather.  I use the large rollers for my hair. I recently replaced the rollers, as the foam has deteriorated. My only complaint is that the new foam rollers don&#x27;t grab the hair strands and hold them. Possibly, because my hair is thinning. Other than that, I am a huge fan of this product. I have two sets; One for home, and the other I keep in my travel bag. I would recommend this product to anyone that has long hair and wants curls that will last!</li>
    <li> They work wonders! My hair has never felt so soft after being curled!! I work with a lot of hair products and this is by far one of my go tos. Might take a beginner some time to figure out but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Be aware the sizes are not what they use to be.  The ones listed as large 20 years ago are now jumbo size.</li>
    <li> So fast, so simple,a pleasure to use.  Have used curlers since I was a kid with the electric set. This is terrific.  I mainly use it when I haven&#x27;t washed my hair so it doesn&#x27;t look as flat.  If you use them after washing your hair, make sure it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
    <li> I had owned one before, but the heating element went out.  So happy to find one on Amazon.com!  Great product.</li>
    <li> Where I absolutely hate to curl my hair this way these seem to work pretty well. They are easy to use and the foam grabs easy. I know the foam will wear out over tim,e but I don&#x27;t use these as much as my flat iron.</li>
    <li> This system and these large rollers make pretty nice curls once you get the feel of using it/them.  These large rollers work quite well, but would have given the actual product itself 5 stars except the small and petite rollers are a little troublesome heating up so I&#x27;ve had to push them down with a comb to get them hot enough to use.  I would recommend this product/these rollers for people on the go with medium length hair such as my own.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, came on time and a good price</li>
    <li> Been using these for years.  Haven&#x27;t found anything better for body that lasts.</li>
    <li> great bouncy curls but not a large enough curler.  If they had a larger barrel curler it would be the best system on the market</li>
    <li> Originally, I bought these to add to the curlers I already have. Now, I want to buy more to replace my old curlers. Great product, delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> I have very straight &amp; fine hair, so these curlers work great with the Caruso rollers. These are a good size for body with a little curl.</li>
    <li> Best Curling system I have EVER had</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great price and I&#x27;m super happy to have them to be able to create the curl affect I wanted to create on my hair</li>
    <li> The rollers are excellent; the only problem I have is getting the right size.....I always have to send them back.  Suggestion:  you might equate size to the size of coins: dime, nickle, quarter, half dollar and silver dollar.</li>
    <li> I ordered these since I needed more rollers. My daughters and I have uber thick hair and what came with the Caruso is not enough to use in our hair. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work as expected and are perfection!</li>
    <li> I have super soft hair and this is the only way I can get those big curls and keep them. They last all day and depending on the weather they may still be presentable the next morning. It is taking me a little while to get the length of time to steam the roller and how tightly to wrap my hair, but it&#x27;s getting better. I&#x27;m definitely getting faster at the whole process. I receive lots of compliments everytime I use these rollers.</li>
    <li> have been using Caruso curls for 20 years.  I miss the ones that used salt... they made the best curl.</li>
    <li> I have had my original steam rollers for 15 years and was desperately needing new ones.  These are identical to the original rollers.  I am so happy to find a replacement after all these years.  They work perfectly.</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely course and curly hair.  She was wanting curlers and I had owned and still have Caruso curlers.  I ordered her a set with extra curlers (extremely long hair).  She loves them and uses them all the time. Great product.</li>
    <li> I recommend this item. My daughter loves them!!</li>
    <li> I loved these hot rollers enough to order a second set and new steam unit hen the first one died after 6 years.</li>
    <li> Really loves the product. I use it for party hair and found it very easy to use. I have long hair. It usually takes me 30-45 minutes.</li>
    <li> Caruso steam rollers are a Godsend for frizzy hair. However they need to be replaced once a year because the sponge roller begins to break down and crumble.</li>
    <li> According to the Caruso set I bought, the Jumbos are the same as these: the foam is about 1.5&amp;#34; in diameter. I wanted what they call the Large which is about 1 1/8&amp;#34; in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return these but the seller (not Amazon) required me to pay the shipping which was nearly as much as the product, so I&#x27;m stuck with them and had to order &amp;#34;mediums.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you check before ordering on the actual dimensions of the rollers.</li>
    <li> I have had my steamer for years but was in need of some new curlers.  Same great curlers that had lasted me for years.  Would buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what the explanation said.</li>
    <li> I have used these rollers/steamer for many years .... absolutely LOVE the results!!  Only takes 5 minutes and is so much healthier for your hair than a curling iron!!</li>
    <li> Rollers were as expected.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and am happy I could find replacements in the size I need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY other electric roller sets, and they just didn&#x27;t work! These rollers are perfect, and my hair comes out looking good! The only complaint I have is with the unit the rollers go on. It usually only lasts a few months without going out. The Caruso company was really great about replacing units with bad motors, but I do remember receiving a replacement that was also no good. All in all, I still haven&#x27;t found a better way to set my hair, so I&#x27;m sticking with this product.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, be sure you check the outside of the roller covers you use when ordering replacements. The size is written on the back of each roller cover. Sometimes the pictures are ambiguous, and it&#x27;s easy to order the wrong size.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with my purchases</li>
    <li> Caruso products are much gentler on the hair since they use steam (rather than direct heat) to curl hair.  I have used them for years and appreciate the fact that my hair remains undamaged from nearly daily use.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers with much anticipation and could not believe how long you have to wait for your hair to dry from the steam. I should have stuck to the regular hot rollers I have used in the past. A big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers already had some but wanted extra.</li>
    <li> very good , was lost for a while, but they reshippede</li>
    <li> my hair goes flat rather quickly so doesn&#x27;t hold all day. I have straight fine hair &amp; it&#x27;s always been hard to hold a curl. The covers don&#x27;t stay on for me either since I have fine hair... The few times I took the time to use these my hair did look great for about an hour, but fell flat shortly after so not worth all the time it took to put it up.</li>
    <li> I like Caruso steamer but I have to say the actual steam itself has changed over the years.  The curls don&#x27;t stay in like they used to unless you use a product on your hair.  I personally don&#x27;t like using products like hair spray or volumizer on my hair.</li>
    <li> I recently had extensions put in and I worried about overheating the bonds. I saw these and thought I would give them a try. My hair is to my waist and I worried about the time it would take with having to heat one roller at a time. I was done in fifteen minutes! My hair was gorgeous!!! I love the long curls and how shiny it is. Best part is no damage to the bonds. I would recommend these to everyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for additional curlers for my steamer. These are a great value and were received promptly. I needed to replace the set I had from 10 years ago. These are my go to size. My hair is long (mid-back), fine, straight, and layered. These steam curlers do NOT damage your hair and maybe even improve the texture.</li>
    <li> My Caruso steam roller set came with a variety of sizes, some of which I don&#x27;t use on my long hair.  I just needed a few more in this large size, and was pleased to discover that Amazon carries the individual sizes.</li>
    <li> Have used Caruso. For over 20 years. They r easy and hold the curl well.</li>
    <li> These rollers actually tame my frizz while being easy to use. They are also very easy to get out of your hair.</li>
