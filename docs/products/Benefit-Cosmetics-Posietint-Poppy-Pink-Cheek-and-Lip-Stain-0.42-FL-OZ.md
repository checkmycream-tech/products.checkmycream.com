### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.  </li>
      <li>I have bought this item from Benefit for years and it is a great product.</li>
      <li>The benetint is great for winter.</li>
      <li>This was amazing!</li>
      <li>It gives you the most wonderful &#x27;</li>
      <li>but I am fair skinned and worried I&#x27;d look like a clown.  </li>
      <li>It gives that hint of a blush, like just after a good run.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous color and quality.</li>
      <li>I didnt wear lipgloss for 2 weeks after purchasing this, its that good.  </li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Give you a nice flush to your cheeks.</li>
      <li>i really liked this product</li>
      <li>The authentic Posietint is gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Maybe this is better for cheeks, but that&#x27;s just not my bag.</li>
      <li>some days i add more for a pop of color.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than benetint.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the sexy, sophisticated type this is probably way to cute, go for Benetint instead.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a liquid and</li>
      <li>The color is perfect for my skin (red hair, face that doesn&#x27;t tan with some freckles) and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>maybelline works better.</li>
      <li>Again, maybe it&#x27;s better for cheeks...</li>
      <li>For me the color stayed on perfectly all day and all night long.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m fine with that since it looks so lovely.</li>
      <li>Benetint was fine, but</li>
      <li>It also has a great staying power (it will last a hole   day of walking in the sun) and its easy to apply.</li>
      <li>really enjoy using this product</li>
      <li>but i has lasted me a good   month, and i will surely buy the big bottle.</li>
      <li>the picture posted is the original one</li>
      <li>It also lasts significantly longer than powder blushes.</li>
      <li>It has a thicker consistency as compared to the original Bene-Tint, which I like because it seems to &#x27;cling&#x27; to the brush.</li>
      <li>Innocent and pretty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been hearing lots of good things about Benetint, but my main worry is that the color might be too intense.</li>
      <li>The pink color is very lovely, I&#x27;d recommend this to girls going for a cute look.</li>
      <li>I used to be a NARS Orgasm fanatic until I tried this delightful product.  </li>
      <li>I originally thought liquid blush would be a bit tricky to apply, given that I almost always mess up powder blush, but it&#x27;s surprisingly fool-proof and super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>it adds a nice light pink glow to the cheeks.</li>
      <li>It gives me just the right amount of rosey cheek look without looking like I overdid it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now</li>
      <li>It does work ok as a cheek stain, but it does not react right away with your skin so its easy to put way to much on and have two blotchy red circles.</li>
      <li>It actually works better and I prefer it over Benetint.  </li>
      <li>I first encountered Posie Tint while walking through Macy&#x27;s when a Benefit consultant stopped me to try the tint.  </li>
      <li>It has a lovely pink that  you can layer to make brighter or more natural.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ve got an instant lovely blush.     </li>
      <li>first  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve use a Benefit product.</li>
      <li>;).</li>
      <li>I might have been better off with the red color</li>
      <li>It really did add just the right amount of color without overpowering my face or being as noticable as blush powder.  </li>
      <li>the lips absorb it and the natural color stays on lips, love it for going out au natural</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first, especially after seeing how bright pink the liquid was on the brush, but decided I would humor the lady and give it a chance.  </li>
      <li>I Really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it as much as I hoped I would.</li>
      <li>was very  cheap.no  </li>
      <li>I like this product as much as I like benetint.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m happier with the real stuff that I purchased from Benefit.</li>
      <li>Its an ok product, not really lip stain material.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after she put it on me</li>
      <li>By the way, the product seems costly ($28) but the bottle lasted me nearly 6 months so it was well worth</li>
      <li>It does stain the cheeks which looks more natural than regular blusher.  </li>
      <li>So i have very oily skin, and most days i dont wear makeup because it just slides down my face   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian with fair skin, I have a sweet-romantic dress style, and I usually wear very light if any makeup, so I&#x27;m really looking for a subtle, natural, but cute blush.</li>
      <li>Thereare better stains, like tarte, this is simplt not worth the effort.</li>
      <li>was just outside on a cool fall day&#x27; color</li>
      <li>A fresh light pink that makes you look young and flushed.</li>
      <li>I use it mainly on my lips</li>
      <li>I use a bit less than the recommended amount (2 strokes instead of 3 as recommended), and it really gives me a totally natural healthy color that looks like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>but as I perused the mall and saw my cheeks in the store mirrors, WOW!, what a difference the tint made to my face!  </li>
      <li>The colour looks light pink</li>
      <li>If after 10-15 minutes you aren&#x27;t satisfied with the color, apply another few drops.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work so well on my lips though, mainly because I already like my natural lip color a lot and</li>
      <li>I bought Poisietint first on Ebay for only $10 to try it out.</li>
      <li>The color is a hot pink, in the tube it looks light, but it changes colors on your skin and becomes a sheer hot pink.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t typically use it on my lips, but when I do, I cover it with a clear lip gloss and it can make my lips feel (but not look) kind of dry.  </li>
      <li>The colour looks natural and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m completely hooked.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it is a stain makes it look natural (if you want)  </li>
      <li>The color is coral and texture is thick and not a thin like original.</li>
      <li>I think this will be better in the summer when I have a little bit of a tan (I&#x27;m pretty pale).</li>
      <li>Posie tint is much more subtle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to bet that it&#x27;ll stay the same color as long as I don&#x27;t wash my face.     </li>
      <li>You only need to use a small amount and it blends easily.</li>
      <li>It gives a subtle glow and is easy to use as a highlighter.</li>
      <li>It has such a natural effect on the lips, you will ghardly ever remember you put it on, it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
      <li>It is thicker in consistency than benetint, somewhat like nail polish, but really presents you with a pink tone on your cheeks and lips.</li>
      <li>I like Posietint since it gives you a natural pink color as if you naturally look like you&#x27;re blushing.  </li>
      <li>The color didn&#x27;t even last half as long as most of my other stains.</li>
      <li>It looks like a thin nail polish going on but when it dries, it&#x27;s a perfect subtle pink, covers well, doesn&#x27;t stain in blotches, and lasts long.  </li>

<li> but doesnt last too long on the lips..</li>
<li> The only draw back is you are left with a pink finger.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if the sellers on Amazon are selling the real stuff or not, but I wanted to write a review to help others recognize the difference between the fake version and the real version.</li>
<li> and she&#x27;s right, the real stuff is a real pink, the fake stuff is coral.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m amazed how long it lasts - 4 -6 hours, maybe longer.</li>
<li> though I did like the final pink hue, I didn&#x27;t like the goopy texture while applying.</li>
<li> Posietint is everything I expected.     </li>
<li> I went to a store looking for the Benetint actually and got the small pack  that brings both of them.</li>
<li> The ONLY advantage that powder blush has over Posietint is that if you&#x27;re wearing a thick player of foundation/concealer Posietint might just take off a chunk of it when you work it with your finger, since it is a liquid after all.</li>
<li> purchase  is  big  failure.</li>

    <li> I used to be a NARS Orgasm fanatic until I tried this delightful product.  The color is perfect for my skin (red hair, face that doesn&#x27;t tan with some freckles) and lasts all day.  It gives you the most wonderful &#x27;was just outside on a cool fall day&#x27; color and I&#x27;m completely hooked.  I wear this over mineral powder and they work well together.  I don&#x27;t typically use it on my lips, but when I do, I cover it with a clear lip gloss and it can make my lips feel (but not look) kind of dry.  Sorry, NARS but I&#x27;ve found a new blush.</li>
    <li> It looked dirty inside and outside cover When I opened it. I suspected it is an used one  . I feel so bad...</li>
    <li> I first encountered Posie Tint while walking through Macy&#x27;s when a Benefit consultant stopped me to try the tint.  I was hesitant at first, especially after seeing how bright pink the liquid was on the brush, but decided I would humor the lady and give it a chance.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after she put it on me but as I perused the mall and saw my cheeks in the store mirrors, WOW!, what a difference the tint made to my face!  It really did add just the right amount of color without overpowering my face or being as noticable as blush powder.  I highly recommend this product and trust me, a little goes a loooooooong way.  Keep in mind that it takes some time (several minutes) to notice the tint so apply sparingly at the onset.  If after 10-15 minutes you aren&#x27;t satisfied with the color, apply another few drops.  By the way, the product seems costly ($28) but the bottle lasted me nearly 6 months so it was well worth it (I use it EVERY day).</li>
    <li> I got tired of the original benetint, that it being very red, so I tried this. A fresh light pink that makes you look young and flushed. It is thicker in consistency than benetint, somewhat like nail polish, but really presents you with a pink tone on your cheeks and lips. Innocent and pretty. I like it better than benetint.</li>
    <li> I Really like this product.  It gives a subtle glow and is easy to use as a highlighter. You only need to use a small amount and it blends easily.</li>
    <li> it adds a nice light pink glow to the cheeks. lasts all day. but doesnt last too long on the lips.. i wouldnt reccomend as a lip  stain. maybelline works better. like the glow for cheeks but probably wouldnt spend the cash on it again unless it was half the price.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve use a Benefit product. I&#x27;ve been hearing lots of good things about Benetint, but my main worry is that the color might be too intense. I&#x27;m Asian with fair skin, I have a sweet-romantic dress style, and I usually wear very light if any makeup, so I&#x27;m really looking for a subtle, natural, but cute blush. Posietint is everything I expected.     I use a bit less than the recommended amount (2 strokes instead of 3 as recommended), and it really gives me a totally natural healthy color that looks like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup. I&#x27;m wearing it right now and I&#x27;ll probably never go out without it again. Yes, it&#x27;s an addiction like its poppy origin ;). The pink color is very lovely, I&#x27;d recommend this to girls going for a cute look. If you&#x27;re the sexy, sophisticated type this is probably way to cute, go for Benetint instead. It doesn&#x27;t work so well on my lips though, mainly because I already like my natural lip color a lot and the tint made it a bit too red.    It also lasts significantly longer than powder blushes. For me the color stayed on perfectly all day and all night long. I&#x27;m willing to bet that it&#x27;ll stay the same color as long as I don&#x27;t wash my face.     I originally thought liquid blush would be a bit tricky to apply, given that I almost always mess up powder blush, but it&#x27;s surprisingly fool-proof and super easy to apply. Just dab a few strokes and spread with a finger and you&#x27;ve got an instant lovely blush.     The ONLY advantage that powder blush has over Posietint is that if you&#x27;re wearing a thick player of foundation/concealer Posietint might just take off a chunk of it when you work it with your finger, since it is a liquid after all. It did take off a little bit of my foundation but I&#x27;m fine with that since it looks so lovely.</li>
    <li> So i have very oily skin, and most days i dont wear makeup because it just slides down my face   and so does the blush. I went to a store looking for the Benetint actually and got the small pack  that brings both of them. Benetint was fine, but this.... This was amazing! It has a lovely pink that  you can layer to make brighter or more natural. It also has a great staying power (it will last a hole   day of walking in the sun) and its easy to apply. I have the small bottle but i has lasted me a good   month, and i will surely buy the big bottle.</li>
    <li> I like this product as much as I like benetint. I think this will be better in the summer when I have a little bit of a tan (I&#x27;m pretty pale). The benetint is great for winter.</li>
    <li> So im a big fan of lig gloss, but some days i want a break, but i still want color.  So i came to Amazon.  This stuff is awesome.  I use it mainly on my lips but i do use a little on my cheeks.  I love it!  The fact that it is a stain makes it look natural (if you want)  some days i add more for a pop of color.  Then there is the fact you can put this on, eat breakfast, drink coffe and still be set.  Or for schmoozing why leave stains on everyones face when you meet and greet,  use this instead and no need to wipe off cheeks. I didnt wear lipgloss for 2 weeks after purchasing this, its that good.  The only draw back is you are left with a pink finger.</li>
    <li> I have bought this item from Benefit for years and it is a great product. But THIS IS A KNOCK OFF! The color, texture, bottle are different though the packaging is the same.The color is coral and texture is thick and not a thin like original. Would not put this stuff on my face-anything could be in it.</li>
    <li> The colour looks light pink but it&#x27;s actually flattering for Asian skin tones, both for the lips and the cheeks. It gives that hint of a blush, like just after a good run. It has a thicker consistency as compared to the original Bene-Tint, which I like because it seems to &#x27;cling&#x27; to the brush. The colour looks natural and lasts for hours. Unlike lipstick, it doesn&#x27;t stick on your glass when you want to take a drink. To darken the shade, just add a dab of lip gloss.</li>
    <li> i really liked this product&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy using this product&lt;br /&gt;and also want to buy it again after finishing using this one. ^^</li>
    <li> The color is a hot pink, in the tube it looks light, but it changes colors on your skin and becomes a sheer hot pink. Its an ok product, not really lip stain material. It does work ok as a cheek stain, but it does not react right away with your skin so its easy to put way to much on and have two blotchy red circles. Thereare better stains, like tarte, this is simplt not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color and quality.</li>
    <li> I saw an ad for cheek stain and then searched Amazon to find this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for month&#x27;s now and have mixed feelings.  It does stain the cheeks which looks more natural than regular blusher.  The downside is that once it is put on it is almost impossible to adjust the results without washing your face.  In my case it is too subtle of a color.  I might have been better off with the red color but I am fair skinned and worried I&#x27;d look like a clown.  I&#x27;m going back to traditional blusher.</li>
    <li> It has such a natural effect on the lips, you will ghardly ever remember you put it on, it&#x27;s not sticky. It&#x27;s more like a liquid and the lips absorb it and the natural color stays on lips, love it for going out au natural</li>
    <li> Love this product! Give you a nice flush to your cheeks. And i sometimes use my powder blush over it and it helps last longer throughout the day.</li>
    <li> bought from &amp;#34;benefit cosmetics posietint&amp;#34; and they delivered a fake one! the picture posted is the original one but what they delivered is the fake one. the flower logo of the fake one is at the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not a trusted seller!</li>
    <li> I have medium to darker skin so I thought this product wouldn&#x27;t work.  It actually works better and I prefer it over Benetint.  It gives me just the right amount of rosey cheek look without looking like I overdid it.  I like Posietint since it gives you a natural pink color as if you naturally look like you&#x27;re blushing.  With Benetint, I had a tendency to overdo it so it looked like I was trying out as a Circus clown for Ringling Bros....and it stained my fingers like I dipped them in cherry Kool Aid.  Posie tint is much more subtle.  I don&#x27;t wear eye shadow so I also use Posie tint on my eyes (I&#x27;ve tried using them on my lips, but it doesn&#x27;t show which is o.k. because I need lipstick as a moisturizer).</li>
    <li> I  am  disappointed  at  this  positint.  It  was roughiy  made. It  was imitation.&lt;br /&gt;The  flower  print  was  rudeness,texture is different from  original.&lt;br /&gt;It  was very  cheap.no  wonder.&lt;br /&gt;My  Amazone  first  purchase  is  big  failure.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as much as I hoped I would.</li>
    <li> I bought Posietint for my lips only, so maybe that&#x27;s why I felt so disappointed. Maybe this is better for cheeks, but that&#x27;s just not my bag. So I used this on my lips and though I did like the final pink hue, I didn&#x27;t like the goopy texture while applying. It felt like a thick, glue-like gloss that I was applying with a nail polish brush onto my lips. The color didn&#x27;t even last half as long as most of my other stains. Kinda weird and not worthy of $30+ in my book. Again, maybe it&#x27;s better for cheeks...</li>
    <li> The authentic Posietint is gorgeous. It looks like a thin nail polish going on but when it dries, it&#x27;s a perfect subtle pink, covers well, doesn&#x27;t stain in blotches, and lasts long.  I&#x27;m amazed how long it lasts - 4 -6 hours, maybe longer. I bought Poisietint first on Ebay for only $10 to try it out. I didn&#x27;t know that version was fake until I read a review here that said the fake version is a coral color. Then I bought it from Benefit and she&#x27;s right, the real stuff is a real pink, the fake stuff is coral. I will say though, that once dried, the fake stuff was a decent color, but it stained in blotches. There were parts of my lips that just wouldn&#x27;t take to the fake stain. So I&#x27;m happier with the real stuff that I purchased from Benefit. I don&#x27;t know if the sellers on Amazon are selling the real stuff or not, but I wanted to write a review to help others recognize the difference between the fake version and the real version.</li>
