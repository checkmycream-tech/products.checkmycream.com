      <li>Very light scent</li>

      <li>this is first time to bought it for hubby and he liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>The scent starts to fade around 2 hours which is not a bad thing because others will still be able to smell it when they are around you or you walk pass them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times now and I love the smell and the price.  The only problem is the bottles tend to leak a little at the top around the base of the nosal.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne at a fragrance store and it cost me well over 50 dollars for this cologne. This is a great price for a great cologne, the smell does start to wear down to you after about 1 hour of so but other people can still smell it so you don&#x27;t have to listen to the people ranting about how the smell goes away to fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne about a year ago. I got it from a kiosk at the mall and the first time I smelled it I knew I had to have it haha. It smells amazing! I get compliments all the time on how good I smell from everyone and even guys ask me what cologne i&#x27;m wearing. That&#x27;s a question you will get asked frequently with this cologne. The girls I&#x27;ve dated all loved this cologne. The scent starts to fade around 2 hours which is not a bad thing because others will still be able to smell it when they are around you or you walk pass them. The scent however does not completely fade within hours it lingers around. I keep this cologne in my car out of all the others that I have :] just expect all the compliments you will get this bottle. You will thank me later for writing this amazing review haha great gift for the holidays.</li>
    <li> It was not really what I thought but ok.</li>
    <li> I went to a mall and at one of the kiosks they showed me this cologne.  I thought it smelled very good and reminded me of something I had smelled before. They wanted $80 for it and then offered it to me for $40 if I bought two colognes  since business was slow. I turned it down and looked online and saw it here for this lower price. I thought I would give it a shot. This cologne actually smells similar to Tommy Hilfiger \\&quot;tommy\\&quot; cologne not exactly but similar. However it does not last but maybe an hour at most on the skin. I got a piece of paper and sprayed it on as some colognes dont last that long on my skin like they do on paper. Same thing it really did not last that long maybe an hour. The lady at the kiosk said that it was oil based and would last much longer than other designer colognes and it was a big hit in PARIS....Lies, lies, lies it was all lies. On the back of the box the first ingredient is alcohol.....This cologne smells very good for the first 10-20 min and then starts to fade away very fast... I am sure glad I bought it here for $21 than to be suckered into buying it at the mall for $80 or $40...I think I will give this to my son...stay away from this cheap basically knock off cologne. Its not even worth $20. I give it 1 star because it does smell very good at first and that is the only reason it gets any stars at all........hope this helps you when trying to buy this cologne. Stay away from all these colognes that are not designer colognes save your cash and buy something worthy...</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves the smell!</li>
    <li> This was over $60 in mall and I found it here and ordered.  It is awesome and smells inbelievable.  I will order again and again.</li>
    <li> Great item, could last little longer but overall can&#x27;t beat price</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with the product! Fantastic price, great smell, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Defiantly met my expectations. Typically you find this product in the mall kiosks for $40-80!!! Also thrilled it came in on time. Great packaging as well. Two thumbs up and 5 stars!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in a nice bottle. The packaging is wonderful, the bottle is presented very well. Now for the fragrance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s OK. It starts cloying-sweet and a strong whiff of alcohol. Initially I thought, whoopse, this is another bottle to get rid of. The base note is a touch of cedar, synthetic floral, and amber. It is very synthetic. I asked my wife if she likes it and she says, &amp;#34;Yeah... it&#x27;s nice... but it&#x27;s, what do you call it - cloying? It&#x27;s pretty sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried Karen Low X-Change and found it nauseatingly cloying. It appears to span the line. They are all somewhere on the spectrum of &amp;#34;sweet to sickeningly sweet&amp;#34;. This entire line is a huge hot mess of cheap synthetic ambergris-based fragrances that all have varying degrees of vanilla, cotton candy and bubble gum. This one is more tolerable than X-Change but clearly demonstrates the brand&#x27;s commitment to disgustingly sweet accords. It&#x27;s cheap, higher quality than the dollar store fragrances, and cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Blanc avoids being offensively sweet, which is what earned it a second star, but I cannot recommend it.  I would also advise avoiding Karen Low altogether, at least for men. The same effect can be achieved by pouring artificially flavored maple syrup from Food Lion into a vaporizer with some grain alcohol. Shake hard, spray on. It&#x27;s also sticky and grossly sweet. This one is a notch above that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will revise this review if I discover that any other fragrances from this designer are better than the two I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I both love this products. The scent is so delicious. Whenever he wears it I just love the smell so much, I could follow him anywhere.</li>
    <li> Probably the best value when buying cologne. Smells very good, lasts a pretty long time, get compliments on it daily, and it was extremely affordable..would def. recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its a fake,this cologne cost 100 bucks at a real retail store,c&#x27;mon it&#x27;s not 18 dollars for nothing! Two days after I got this package the paint started coming off the bottle! True story!! Go to a store and buy the real thing it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, a few times. Its smells great, a little bit of cigar, and bergamot smell.Although it says it is prime, it is not 2 day shipping, this came after about a wk. So it is still free delivery just not 2 days</li>
    <li> This perfume was actually really hard to find for me, but sooo worth it. i cant help but melt evrytime my boyfriend wears it; its an enticing perfume that invites you to get closer. Absolutely adore and would buy it again :)</li>
    <li> I broke down and asked a young man what fragrance he was wearing and this was it. It smelled awesome on him but I guess everyone&#x27;s body scent mixes differently with fragrances. Haven&#x27;t had any compliments on it although I still like it.</li>
    <li> This cologne is amazing. I am a guy in college and everyday I have girls and even guys telling me that I smell amazing.. It does last a long time on my skin. I have had it last a whole day from class to class with people still telling me that I smell great. If you want a cologne that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and delivers on so many levels. This is the one.</li>
    <li> Great product. The scent is not overpowering at all and you keep a hint of it all day. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> I smelled this cologne on someone and thought it would be perfect for my guy. This cologne makes you pause it smells DELICIOUS. My guy smells so YUMMY when he wears this. It is not an overwhelming smell. Just right.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I love this cologne! It is very pleasant and is awesome for daily wear, but it has just one drawback, it&#x27;s too soft and after a while you wouldn&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s presence.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied and it came in earlier then expected.</li>
    <li> Meant may expectations.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Had been looking for it everywhere after purchasing it in Florida. Amazon was the only other place I could find it.</li>
    <li> It smells really good takes about 5 sprays to keep it on all day but its great for the price. I love it the woman love it :) works for me and im soo picky on my smells</li>
    <li> I bought this for a 27yr old friend. It&#x27;s not a over powering fragrance. Casual, romantic, it smells very sexy. I love to cuddle when he wears it. Similar to LaCoste White Blanc.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Clean. non citrus. musky. masculine. Every woman/man loves it. Last all day. Only 2 squirts needed. Doesn&#x27;t smell feminine.</li>
    <li> Great cologne! If you want to get chicks and ladies all over you... make sure you Invest in this cologne!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it everywhere we go people always ask what is if that he has on. Very light scent</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Buy 4 at a time. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and my wife enjoys it as well.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last near as long as a higher end cologne.  Perfect for the office and freshen up between locations when commuting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through my far share on colognes through the years, But this one has everyone ( men &amp; women) asking what I&#x27;m wearing !&lt;br /&gt;only draw back is that fades to the wearer after a few hours but some still notice it</li>
    <li> got this for my fiance for his birthday, he wears it all the time and we both love it. smells expensve, so great for the price :) thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;Totally was received as described.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The Totally Shipping was fast and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this fragrance I love. Lasts longer than 8 hours and is always imbued with your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like strong fragrances or aroma is shocking as he passed other fibula.&lt;br /&gt;There will always be someone asking for that fraganacia ..&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Purchase</li>
    <li> Compliments, Compliments, Compliments. People love how this cologne smells. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price. On my second one!! Another women in my office ordered it for her significant other.</li>
    <li> Ordered this on a Sunday and received it the very next day and it made my grandson&#x27;s day!</li>
    <li> My new guy wears this and I absolutely love it! I noticed it right away when we first started going out. He recently ran out and I came on Amazon to get more. Lovely, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviewers shared that they felt the scent did not last long. I have to respectfully disagree; I can still smell it on him when he has been wearing it all day and I see him in the evening.</li>
    <li> My husband wears this and I love the smell on him. It&#x27;s not over powering its a light smell that makes me want to hug him more and more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through my far share on colognes through the years, But this one has everyone ( men &amp; women) asking what I&#x27;m wearing !&lt;br /&gt;only draw back is that fades to the wearer after a few hours but some still notice it</li>
    <li> this is first time to bought it for hubby and he liked it a lot. bought this for my hubby for Christmas gift and he loved it! will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I came across this cologne by accident a few years ago at a mall in NC.. I was looking for Kenneth Cole &amp;#34;Reaction&amp;#34; and came across this in a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; cologne store and they tried to charge me $65.00 but I talked them down to $40.00.. After some researching, I realized I more than over payed at the knock off&amp;#34; store but it was worth it because I get more compliments on this $17.00 cologne than cologne I have paid almost $100.00 for.. IT SMELLS AMAZING and no matter how much I put on, its never &amp;#34;over powering&amp;#34;.. I will continue to order this cologne and would recommend it to anyone!! Side note- This cologne is light and is pretty much similar to Kenneth Cole&#x27;s &amp;#34;Reaction&amp;#34; (if you have previously owned that)</li>
    <li> This cologne is incredible.  I have been trying to find it for a while now.  I found it at the mall for way more expensive.  I plan on ordering alot more of this.  GREAT FIND!!!!</li>
    <li> Pure Blanc by Karen Low is a very enticing scent. It last for hours as it is an oil base men&#x27;s cologne and you would spend 5X to get anything close from a major retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is sometimes it seems as though the bottles when they arrive are not full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still one of the best values on the market today.</li>
    <li> For the price this is about as good as it gets. Whenever I run out, I just come back here and order more. I haven&#x27;t found something that I like better. My girlfriend loves it and I get complimented a lot for smelling good so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then you found the right product.</li>
