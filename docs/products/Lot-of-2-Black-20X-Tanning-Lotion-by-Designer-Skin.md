<li> That just has to do with your genetics, what tanning bed you use, how long you tan and how often you tan.</li>
<li> Would recommend to anyone needing a good base tan.</li>
<li> It gives a deep, dark, chocolate tan.</li>
<li> The only drawback that I had personally is that since I have a little bit oilier skin than average, I feel it leaves my skin a bit greasier than I would like.  </li>
<li> Lotion is very thick &amp; indulgent, though, and unless you have oily skin, I wouldn&#x27;t stress too much about that point.  </li>
<li> The scent is citrus &amp; just like the other reviewers said, it does not leave the after-tan smell on your skin.  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t notice a difference in how dark you get.</li>
<li> I had previously been using Secret Rapture by Designer Skin which gave me a really, really good base tan.  </li>
<li> It was a waste of money and will not buy again.</li>
<li> It does not give that \\&quot;fake</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing from this Vendor!</li>
<li> Used this on recommendation of a friend to correct a bad start to a tan.  </li>

    <li> Expected great results and it didn&#x27;t deliver.  It was a waste of money and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the shipping, and the product. I got just what I ordered in a timely manor. I would for sure do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> I expected more out of this product than what it produced, more of a brozen effect was what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product and great seller!  Received product earlier than expected and very pleased with the product... You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing from this Vendor!</li>
    <li> OMG I LOVE THIS STUFF!! It defo lives up to the promises set forth by Designer Skin. It works fast and amazing! The smell I really don&#x27;t care for, but I will ignore that for the amazing results I&#x27;ve gotten already! A-Z Wholesale thank you so much for making this product more affordable! I will buy this product again from this seller!!</li>
    <li> THE ABSOLUTE BEST ON THE MARKET THAT I HAVE FOUND. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRICE AS COMPARED TO THE TANNING SALON PRICES (OVER $50 EACH).</li>
    <li> I have tanned for years and my skin always dries out from the tanning bed. This lotion prevents this from happening.  This is the best lotion that I have ever used.  The Designer Skin is a good line of tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> After searching for this lotion, I was amazed to find in so inexpensive.  Thanks for helping me save money.</li>
    <li> My order was delivered promptly! The product has a great smell and makes your skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin very soft, and doesn&#x27;t smell like most other indoor tanning products.  Also helps maintain your tan longer.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with Black 20X. It does not give that \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; appearance like most tanning lotions that contain bronzers do. It gives a deep, dark, chocolate tan. It does not fade or rub off on your clothing. I would definitely buy this product again and I highly recommend it to tanners that want to reach their maximum tan.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells good and makes my skin feel very soft but I have been using it for a while and am not getting tanned. With so many bronzers I would think I would BE getting pretty dark. I am used lotions with only 3x the bronzers and they worked sooo much better</li>
    <li> Awesome product and works great.  Way to $$$ to buy at a salon this was an great find and everything worked out perfect in the purchase!!  A+++++</li>
    <li> All of Designer Skin products are great.  The new emulsifiers in this lotion make your skin feel soft and the bronzers do a great job.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is featured at my gym and has been sold out for weeks at $89.99 a bottle!!! I only paid 1/3 the price on Amazon! I have noticed that I stay tan/browner longer. It also smells really good, reminds me of green tea or something fresh like that. It also has an awesome silky texture, and is not greasy. I have had great results with the product and I would definitely get another bottle!</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on silky smooth and smells great! It goes on so smoothly in fact that its hard to tell exactly where you have put it and where you havent. I got 2 bottles, one for me and one for my husband. He loves it! I like it. Its worth the money if bought through Amazon or some other online store. Wouldnt pay the price they ask for it in the tanning salons.</li>
    <li> My roommate &amp; I went in on the 2 pack &amp; it was a pretty good deal.  I have noticed that my tan has gotten deeper &amp; darker since I started using it.  I had previously been using Secret Rapture by Designer Skin which gave me a really, really good base tan.  This lotion brought me over the plateau, which is what I wanted it to do.  The scent is citrus &amp; just like the other reviewers said, it does not leave the after-tan smell on your skin.  The only drawback that I had personally is that since I have a little bit oilier skin than average, I feel it leaves my skin a bit greasier than I would like.  Lotion is very thick &amp; indulgent, though, and unless you have oily skin, I wouldn&#x27;t stress too much about that point.  All in all, a great product for me.</li>
    <li> Just buy the cheapest lotion you can. You won&#x27;t notice a difference in how dark you get. That just has to do with your genetics, what tanning bed you use, how long you tan and how often you tan. I have lots of tanning experience as well as many close friends in the field.</li>
    <li> I am not an easy tanner. I am able to get a GREAT golden tan with Black. I have been using it for 3 years and will continue to do so. It also helps my skin to stay soft.</li>
    <li> Used this on recommendation of a friend to correct a bad start to a tan.  Was using Ed Hardey and this seemed to smooth out the unevenness of it.  Would recommend to anyone needing a good base tan.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion product i&#x27;ve purchased so far.  It smells the best, doesn&#x27;t have nearly an oily residue as others and i&#x27;ve been getting tanner with this product than others in the lower level beds.  Good buy - this will definitely be my new tanning staple.</li>
