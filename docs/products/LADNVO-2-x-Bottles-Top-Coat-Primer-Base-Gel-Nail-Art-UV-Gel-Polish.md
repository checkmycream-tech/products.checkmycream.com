### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product for the price.</li>
      <li>the is the best nail top coat tat</li>
      <li>These do not work good at all</li>
      <li>its ok</li>
      <li>and then I used rubbing alcohol to remove the gummy layer on top.  </li>
      <li>Some gel top coats require alcohol on a cotton ball to remove to stickyness, so after about 2 or 3 mins under the light you are suppose to rub the alcohol on your nails.</li>
      <li>and then I used the UV light for 2 minutes for each coat.  </li>
      <li>nothing special..</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>That being said, I got these in the mail, and with high hopes, I popped in a movie for the kids (my own 2 and the 2 and 7 year old that I also watch during the day)</li>
      <li>peels right off after drying</li>
      <li>Does not peel easy and leaves a nice thick cost on the nails.</li>
      <li>It would have been better to spend a little more money on something that actually works like it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I purchased this because I am a stay at home Mom of 6 year old twins, and that means that I don&#x27;t have much time to do my nails, and when I do them, I would like the polish to last more than a day or two...  </li>
      <li>but the topcoat isn&#x27;t very shiny.</li>
      <li>Two nails came out OK, and the other 8 ranged from some mild smearing to the entire shebang coming off when I wiped it...  </li>
      <li>The polish dried, my nails are very strong, and so far the polish has been on for about a week with no cracking or lifting.  </li>
      <li>Never dried with UV lamp and without.</li>
      <li>Works well on all gels I have tried doesn&#x27;t work very well over regular nail polish</li>
      <li>The base coat is the best one</li>
      <li>It was half full and was oil.  </li>
      <li>So, in summary, takes a bit longer than some of the other polishes out there, but if you have patience it will work and for the price I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Basic and decent for price.</li>
      <li>I had previously used the Sally Hanson Sensationail system with good results, but the cost of their replacement base and top coats made me want to search for a cheaper alternative.  </li>
      <li>I could lay down a fairly good base and the second coat covers just fine...  </li>

<li> I could lay down a fairly good base and the second coat covers just fine...  </li>

<li> doesnt dry have to wait an hour to use my hands</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry at all........</li>
<li> Does not ever seem to dry!</li>
<li> Not very Shiney but works</li>
<li> Hopefully I will be able to return it. :-(</li>
<li> The gel nail peeled off in less than a day.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
<li> Having done this before, I put on some primer, base coat, two coats of polish and the topcoat, ( with a minute under the uv light after each coat)</li>
<li> It was a waste of money!</li>
<li> This time, I made sure that I used VERY THIN coats of the base and topcoats (which is tricky because they are quite thick)</li>
<li> I also noticed that putting on the first coat of polish is difficult, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to the base coat, but going over it a few times</li>
<li> PLEASE, don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff!!</li>
<li> So, I was disappointed to say the least.  </li>
<li> Do not buy it, is terrible.....</li>
<li> The worst purchase ever.  </li>

    <li> Do not buy it, is terrible..... It doesn&#x27;t dry at all........</li>

After the kids went to bed for the night I decided to give it another try...

    <li> I have 3 different gel lights and after starting over again each time and using the lights for as long as 4 MINUTES, it still will not  set up. After 4 minutes it was still sticky with an oily like sheen on them. PLEASE, don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff!!</li>

    <li> doesnt work...peels right off after drying</li>
    <li> Basic and decent for price. The base coat is the best one but the topcoat isn&#x27;t very shiny.</li>
