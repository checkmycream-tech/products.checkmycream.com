      <li>And best of all?  </li>
      <li>this product worked great!</li>
      <li>Gorgeous, deliciously shiney, silvery highlights.  </li>
      <li>This cap works great.  </li>
      <li>Great product and service</li>
      <li>My confidence level was elevated and I bravely went where I had never been before - -&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
      <li>Truly an amazing product!</li>
      <li>the bathroom to highlight my own hair!  </li>
      <li>These are really good one.</li>
      <li>I love this cap!  </li>
      <li>I used to frost my own hair</li>
      <li>WELL, I WENT OUT ON MY OWN AND FOUND THIS ONE,</li>
      <li>Nice idea if it had more than one size.</li>
      <li>Great cap- tight fit and excellent quality.</li>
      <li>Once trimmed, it is no longer able to curl up at the edge to protect drips, etc.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up after more use, hopefully the seal will not be affected.  </li>
      <li>the more its used it conforms more to your skull.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way cheaper than the salon, I also get my Kaleidocolors-neutral at Sally&#x27;s- perfectly toned streaks on my medium to dark brown hair, and not too many of them.</li>
      <li>THE CAP IS FINE.</li>
      <li>The cap was HUGE on me</li>
      <li>NOTHING AVAILABLE.  </li>
      <li>Overall a good stuff worth buying.</li>
      <li>MUCH EASIER TO GET ON AND OFF THAN THE PLASTIC ONES, EASY TO RINSE,</li>
      <li>I have a large head, but I thought the cap would stretch to fit.  </li>
      <li>you have that rare disease where you cannot feel pain</li>
      <li>AND I KEPT ASKING THEM FOR A LARGER MORE COMFORTABLE CAP</li>
      <li>I did not find it useful.  </li>
      <li>my hair still broke off right in the part and</li>
      <li>Since I high light my hair by myself.  </li>
      <li>Ahhhhhhh.........the perfect pale yellow color as per a review by another reviewer.  </li>
      <li>(so much for returning it!)</li>
      <li>On my second use it worked even better because the holes were already poked through during the first use.  </li>
      <li>It is more difficult to pull the hair through the cap, but it is SO worth it to have that good seal.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used it, so</li>
      <li>I must add that the reviews and instructions left by other buyers are great.  </li>
      <li>While it may have taken me considerably longer to get hairs through the cap, the overall result of streaking was far superior than anything I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a tie-on cap, and I&#x27;ve been streaking my hair for 40 years.  </li>
      <li>However, I do think this would work really well on a normal-sized head.</li>
      <li>Worked really well.  </li>
      <li>However, on the up side, the tightness of the cap prevents colorant from bleeding though, it really is self-healing, and I like that the cap is so form-fitting.  </li>
      <li>This is much much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>It makes it much easier.</li>
      <li>This cap works really well.  </li>
      <li>It can be a bit difficult to pull the hair through, but I managed fine on my own (though it did help to straighten my hair first).  </li>
      <li>and I had to trim down four inches just to be able to see what I was doing.  </li>
      <li>made my at home high lights a breeze.</li>
      <li>The tightness of the cap makes doing normal stuff with your head easier than the tie-on caps when waiting for your colorant to do its thing.  </li>
      <li>so even if I only get 3 or 4 uses, it is still worth it.  </li>
      <li>I had NO bleach bleed back through the holes, I was even able to wash my highlighted pieces and condition them, when I took the cap off the rest of my hair was completely dry.  </li>
      <li>I do my highlighting myself which is kind of tricky, but the cap had little bumps to guide where the holes go, so I could pull through all over my head without assistance,(usually my daughters 6 and 10, have to do the back of my head)</li>
      <li>They are long lasting, at first they are a bit large but we cut away the excess and</li>
      <li>I have a high tolerance for pain but enough was enough.  </li>
      <li>I had no trouble pulling the hair back through afterward, but I think that&#x27;s because I used plenty of conditioner.  </li>
      <li>You can color your hair all the way to the root as well, but if you are bleaching and retouching your hair once a month be careful and gentle when you pull the cap off because it will cause breakage</li>
      <li>The cap is pricey (especially when shipping is added on) for a one-shot deal, and it may take a little getting used to, however if you consistently streak or tip your hair, this reusable cap should be part of your beauty arsenal.  </li>

<li> It comes with a crochet hook, we use the small one and a larger one occasionally.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Things that remind me of using this cap: wet tongues on frozen metal, bandaids superglued to hair, stepping on a tack barefoot.</li>
<li> She advised that in order to get silvery highlights/color, the hair must be bleached to a pale yellow color or the toner/color would not result in the desired outcome.  </li>
<li> Arrived and as expected!</li>
<li> probably other places I just can&#x27;t see.  </li>
<li> A \\&quot;4\\&quot;,  OTHER THAN THAT</li>
<li> i am planning to cut it down to size&#x27;  </li>
<li> and if you don&#x27;t mind ripping half your hair out in the process, I say go for it, knock yourself out, this is the cap for you...</li>
<li> I had previously used the \\&quot;wands\\&quot;</li>
<li> Feel for the slightly indented perforations, insert the hook at an angle so as not to impale your head, and after you penetrate the cap&#x27;s membrane give a slight twist and pull upward.</li>
<li> This cap does what it says by sealing tightly so your color or bleach doesn&#x27;t bleed through.</li>
<li> The cap hugs your head so tight that it hurts.  </li>
<li> I tried to cut it in a few strategic places so it wouldn&#x27;t be too tight</li>
<li> It is made of heavy duty plastic and existing holes self seal</li>
<li> Feeling that the salon prices are outrageous for coloring services, I decided, like many other women, to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the favorable reviews, I selected this product for my developer.  </li>
<li> Too small for my head....</li>
<li> $16 per cap is ridiculous.</li>
<li> \\&quot;SORRY</li>
<li> The wholes are difficult to poke out.</li>
<li> It was so uncomfortable that I removed the cap and did not even highlight my hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s extremely difficult to pull your hair through the cap.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> $16 per cap is ridiculous. I bought mine at a beauty supply store for somewhere in the range of $6 to $7 pet. It comes with what looks like a darning hook. It is metal. Feel for the slightly indented perforations, insert the hook at an angle so as not to impale your head, and after you penetrate the cap&#x27;s membrane give a slight twist and pull upward. Continue the process until you have covered all surfaces you want to. Then follow the instructions on your highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;I like this cap. It is made of heavy duty plastic and existing holes self seal so unless you rip a honking big hole in this cap, the developer bleach won&#x27;t leech into unwanted places.&lt;br /&gt;After use, I wash it with shampoo and rinse it thoroughly and air dry until the next time I need it</li>
    <li> this product worked great! made my at home high lights a breeze. i hope it works as well on the 2nd use...cant wait!</li>
    <li> This cap did everything it said it would, and then some.  I do my highlighting myself which is kind of tricky, but the cap had little bumps to guide where the holes go, so I could pull through all over my head without assistance,(usually my daughters 6 and 10, have to do the back of my head) I had NO bleach bleed back through the holes, I was even able to wash my highlighted pieces and condition them, when I took the cap off the rest of my hair was completely dry.  It is more difficult to pull the hair through the cap, but it is SO worth it to have that good seal.  This is the first time I have used it, so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up after more use, hopefully the seal will not be affected.  I only paid $7 for it at \\&quot;Sally&#x27;s\\&quot; so even if I only get 3 or 4 uses, it is still worth it.  It&#x27;s way cheaper than the salon, I also get my Kaleidocolors-neutral at Sally&#x27;s- perfectly toned streaks on my medium to dark brown hair, and not too many of them. I like my brown hair with highlights, I don&#x27;t want to be blonde all over, which is what happens to me at the salon after four or five visits with the foil technique. I love this cap!  Truly an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I SUFFERED FOR YEARS AT MY SALOON AND I KEPT ASKING THEM FOR A LARGER MORE COMFORTABLE CAP, THEY WOULD ALWAYS SAY \\&quot;SORRY THERES NOTHING AVAILABLE.  WELL, I WENT OUT ON MY OWN AND FOUND THIS ONE, MUCH EASIER TO GET ON AND OFF THAN THE PLASTIC ONES, EASY TO RINSE,CAN BE REUSED AS LONG AS AFTER RINSING AND DRYING YOU MUST POWDER THE CAP INTERIOR. THE ONLY DRAWBACK WAS BECAUSE OF THE SILICONE MATERIAL IT IS MADE OF, IT HUGS THE HEAD TIGHTER, THUS GIVING YOU A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING, KIND OF LIKE A BALLOON  WRAPPED ON YOUR HEAD, FOR THIS REASON I GIVE IT A \\&quot;4\\&quot;,  OTHER THAN THAT THE CAP IS FINE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERS!</li>
    <li> These are really good one. Even my wife can handle these. I use them at home my self. Overall a good stuff worth buying.</li>
    <li> I used to frost my own hair but now I have health issues so I bring them to the beauty shop for them to frost my hair.  They are long lasting, at first they are a bit large but we cut away the excess and the more its used it conforms more to your skull.  It comes with a crochet hook, we use the small one and a larger one occasionally.  It said they were almost out so I bought them all, they will probably last longer than me</li>
    <li> Ughhh!  I would give this five stars...if I were a masochist.  Imagine you have been stranded on a deserted island without a brush for six months.  Now imagine handing a toddler a comb and asking them to get the knots out.  Voila, you have the Magicap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that remind me of using this cap: wet tongues on frozen metal, bandaids superglued to hair, stepping on a tack barefoot. Guantánamo Bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have that rare disease where you cannot feel pain and if you don&#x27;t mind ripping half your hair out in the process, I say go for it, knock yourself out, this is the cap for you...</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Delivery prompt.</li>
    <li> This cap works great.  It can be a bit difficult to pull the hair through, but I managed fine on my own (though it did help to straighten my hair first).  After you highlight, you can rinse and condition your the highlighted hair, and the rest stays perfectly dry!  I had no trouble pulling the hair back through afterward, but I think that&#x27;s because I used plenty of conditioner.  Worked really well.  I had previously used the \\&quot;wands\\&quot; that come with over the counter highlight kits - and those were a disaster, leaking color all over the place.  This is much much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: you need to have some talcum powder on hand to re-use the cap and keep it from getting sticky.</li>
    <li> Feeling that the salon prices are outrageous for coloring services, I decided, like many other women, to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the favorable reviews, I selected this product for my developer.  I must add that the reviews and instructions left by other buyers are great.  My confidence level was elevated and I bravely went where I had never been before - -&lt;br /&gt;to the bathroom to highlight my own hair!  I used this developer in combination with the Clairol BW2 Powder Lightener and after pulling my hair through the Magicap Tipping Cap, I applied the developer and lightener, waited the suggested amount of time, rinsed, and peeked at the results.........Ahhhhhhh.........the perfect pale yellow color as per a review by another reviewer.  (THANK YOU!!!)  She advised that in order to get silvery highlights/color, the hair must be bleached to a pale yellow color or the toner/color would not result in the desired outcome.  I then applied WELLA Color Charm - T14 Silver Lady and MY developer, waited, rinsed and..............PERFECT!!!  Gorgeous, deliciously shiney, silvery highlights.  And best of all?  I know now that I can do it myself without reservation.  Plus, I got the &amp;#34;Hubby Seal of Approval.&amp;#34;  He kept repeating, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe you did this by yourself.&amp;#34;  Actually, I didn&#x27;t - - my&lt;br /&gt;Amazon buddies were with me every step of the way!!!</li>
    <li> I could not keep it on for very long, so I had to go back to the looser shower-cap styles.  Nice idea if it had more than one size.</li>
    <li> The cap was HUGE on me and I had to trim down four inches just to be able to see what I was doing.  Once trimmed, it is no longer able to curl up at the edge to protect drips, etc.  The holes are hard to punch through and difficult to see (I have since color marked the holes I like to use) and it is much more tedious and takes much longer to thread through the hair than with a tie-on cap, nor is it terribly easy to get the hair back in or adjust if you&#x27;ve grabbed too big a hank of hair.  However, on the up side, the tightness of the cap prevents colorant from bleeding though, it really is self-healing, and I like that the cap is so form-fitting.  The tightness of the cap makes doing normal stuff with your head easier than the tie-on caps when waiting for your colorant to do its thing.  While it may have taken me considerably longer to get hairs through the cap, the overall result of streaking was far superior than anything I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a tie-on cap, and I&#x27;ve been streaking my hair for 40 years.  The cap is pricey (especially when shipping is added on) for a one-shot deal, and it may take a little getting used to, however if you consistently streak or tip your hair, this reusable cap should be part of your beauty arsenal.  UPDATE:  CAP RIPPED ALL THE WAY TO THE CROWN TAKING IT OFF AFTER THIRD USE.  NOW A USELESS WASTE OF GOOD MONEY.</li>
    <li> Great cap- tight fit and excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Arrived and as expected!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and strong, but uncomfortable to use for us non-professionals.</li>
    <li> This cap works really well.  No bleeding, and its reusable.  On my second use it worked even better because the holes were already poked through during the first use.  I would recommend poking the holes in prior to using the cap.  It makes it much easier.</li>
    <li> Junk.... Too small for my head.... The wholes are difficult to poke out.</li>
    <li> This cap does what it says by sealing tightly so your color or bleach doesn&#x27;t bleed through. You can reuse it over and over. The problem I had was my hair is longer and even after putting powder in the cap and using slicking oil my hair still broke off right in the part and probably other places I just can&#x27;t see.  You can color your hair all the way to the root as well, but if you are bleaching and retouching your hair once a month be careful and gentle when you pull the cap off because it will cause breakage</li>
    <li> the cap was way to big for myself and I couldn&#x27;t see what I was doing.  Since I high light my hair by myself.  i am planning to cut it down to size&#x27;  It went way below my eyes.</li>
    <li> I did not find it useful.  Highlighting may be a two person job.</li>
    <li> I bought the Magicap based on the Amazon.com overall product rating and reviews.  Mistake! The cap hugs your head so tight that it hurts.  It&#x27;s extremely difficult to pull your hair through the cap.  It was so uncomfortable that I removed the cap and did not even highlight my hair.  When I removed the cap, the holes where I pulled my hair through gripped my hair and it pulled my hair out.  I have a high tolerance for pain but enough was enough.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> I have a large head, but I thought the cap would stretch to fit.  It stretches, but not a lot.  I tried to cut it in a few strategic places so it wouldn&#x27;t be too tight (so much for returning it!), but that didn&#x27;t work.  However, I do think this would work really well on a normal-sized head.</li>
