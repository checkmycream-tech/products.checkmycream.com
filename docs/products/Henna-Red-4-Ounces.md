      <li>Another amazing thing henna does, is over time it thickens each hair strand.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair amazing color.</li>
      <li>Nice product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Instead of the warm water I used ½ lemon juice and ½ warm chamomile tea</li>
      <li>some tea is nice.</li>
      <li>As a dye, this stuff is very strong, so BEWARE of ORANGE.  </li>
      <li>The dye and your hair afterward smells very strongly of herbal tea.  </li>
      <li>I emailed Light Mountain to clarify the purity of their product and this is the response I got (good news for those that fret about these issues like me):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for writing about your concerns.  </li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair with natural highlights and the henna died everything perfectly.</li>
      <li>Instead I got super bright orange hair.</li>
      <li>After a week of washing it, it is now more of an auburn color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I happen to love the smell of henna</li>
      <li>That is why the more you use it, the deeper and richer</li>
      <li>i went to sooo many hair stylists asking for a NOT ORANGE,</li>

      <li>I just tried it and it worked fine.</li>
      <li>and I have had many many compliments on the new do and the lovely rich color of my hair.</li>
      <li>Light Mountain takes these issues</li>
      <li>This color is by far superior to the box with the fox.</li>
      <li>Once you find the right color and mix, you might really love it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t try it for the first time a day before you have an important event to attend!  </li>
      <li>No chemical dye has ever left my hair color looking so nice!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this Henna many times and the results are consistent.</li>
      <li>We insist on each container load having a \\&quot;clean</li>
      <li>I cant say enough good about this henna.</li>
      <li>Makes  my hair feel and look healthy and strong, after years of damaging it with chemical hair dyes and straighteners, now my hair is so soft and shiny</li>
      <li>I was pregnant.  </li>
      <li>Good news is my curls are back and my hair quality is amazing, but I personally can never use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Really lovely and natural looking!</li>
      <li>The henna died my hair an amazing red.</li>
      <li>fresh grated ginger</li>
      <li>I bought this stuff to return some of my gray hairs to a reddish color, to blend in better with the rest of my naturally curly, coppery-red hair.  </li>
      <li>Did make it a bit softer but my hair is really healthy and soft anyways.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, I&#x27;ll most definitely be buying it again because I accidentally found my new favorite hair color.</li>
      <li>Looks great and covers all the grey hairs and makes you hair feel soft.</li>
      <li>I used to do it myself and that can be challenging because of the mess and making sure the henna&#x27;s well incorporated into all of my hair.</li>
      <li>The actual hair color results are a nice, rich auburn (I have naturally curly, light-medium brown hair).</li>
      <li>First some facts about henna:</li>
      <li>I felt like i spelled it out for them exactly what i wanted but over and over</li>
      <li>This was my first time using henna on my hair</li>
      <li>this item is exactly what i wanted.</li>
      <li>:) Everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently to henna, so it takes some patience in getting used to.</li>
      <li>it looks like my color instead of chemical colrs which only sit on top of the hair</li>
      <li>I love not only the color</li>
      <li>I covered it with a plastic bag &amp; waited exactly 45 minutes, warming it</li>
      <li>I tested this stuff (the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; color) on a lock of hair first.  </li>
      <li>Okay so, I used this product a total of 4 times over a 8 month period (once every 2 months).</li>
      <li>I was impulsive back then and am sure I just didn&#x27;t read all the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Once my first rinse was done, I washed my hair with baking soda and rinsed it out, then conditioned it and rinsed that out as well.  </li>
      <li>I have used Lush Henna in the past and it was much more effective.</li>
      <li>It makes my already red hair more intense.</li>
      <li>Yes, the paste is a bit messy, but cleanup is easy and it gave great coverage (and I have super thick hair).</li>
      <li>when I dyed it, it was kind of a mess without my condition.</li>
      <li>I read that the color eventually gets darker, so I didn&#x27;t freak out too much.</li>
      <li>The color was better than I expected.</li>
      <li>It also smells \\&quot;muddy\\&quot; and leafy, but I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with it.</li>
      <li>I have used Light Mountain Henna (Red) for years.</li>
      <li>My whole head was blazing, pumpkiny orange.  </li>
      <li>Secondly, I REALLY like that it does not smell like chemicals</li>
      <li>BUT all this could be my fault because each time I dyed my hair, I dyed the whole thing, not just the roots</li>
      <li>It hates me so much, in fact that it refuses to be touched by anything that resembles hair dye from the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; store.  </li>
      <li>Now, I look like a wannabe fake-orange redhead, instead of a real redhead with some gray hair.  </li>
      <li>to speed things up with the rinse out, use warm water for a few minutes to get majority out THEN shampoo.</li>
      <li>I ended up loving the \\&quot;orange\\&quot; color I got because it somehow brings out my eye color and makes it pop, but if you&#x27;re buying this hoping for a dark red, expect it to be more orange than red.</li>
      <li>I like this brand better than any other semi-permanent dye I have tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought other henna that lasts a lot longer and is more vibrant</li>
      <li>We ship only in full container loads so that our goods are always&lt;br /&gt;sealed</li>
      <li>After all, she&#x27;s set up to manage a mess and her sink can better handle the rinsing out process.</li>
      <li>, I have used the red and also the medium brown and loved both, getting lots of compliments, I add vinegar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and yogurt, rinsing it out is not easy, it takes long, I use a cheap conditioner to wash it out over and over until water is clear.</li>
      <li>For me, having my hair smell like a cup of green tea is much better than a perfume or chemical smell.</li>
      <li>It made my usually brown hair a nice shiny, red/brown with natural highlights.</li>
      <li>The color lasts a really long time, so this product is definitely made well:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair before or treated it chemically with anything, so it&#x27;s just normal hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is healthy, and I get compliments everyday .</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product, but if you&#x27;re a first-time dyer, realize there is likely to be a learning curve the first few times you use it.  </li>
      <li>The next day, after the allergy test, I mixed the dye powder with some boiling water, let it set for 30 minutes, and applied it to my entire head while it was still warm.  </li>
      <li>New Review:</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s so fun to be a redhead again!), but also the way it conditions my fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the powder with hot water in a plastic bowl and let it sit for an hour before applying.</li>
      <li>Skip that completely and use the cheetah!</li>
      <li>not only will they help alleviate the henna smell, certain ones will kill scalp fungus, (itchy scalp, scalp pimples, dandruff etc)stimulate new hair growth, and condition skin</li>
      <li>I am really paranoid about using henna since the whole ordeal of heavy metals and toxins showing up in certain brands.</li>
      <li>n look brassy.. you can see the diff so clearly</li>
      <li>This definitely leaves your hair VERY shiny and glossy, so as far as conditioning, it works.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But, after a year of using red henna, my hair has an intense cherry cola color to it.</li>
      <li>It is also why your natural color is still there, underneath.  </li>
      <li>The color fades so naturally that you can go a while without coloring again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love it and I tried putting in my hair myself and it was easy.  Always had a beautician do but this time I wanted to save money.  Also, I only need to use half a box so I got 2 uses out of 1 box.  Looks great and covers all the grey hairs and makes you hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> I love this henna and want to offer some tips to people using it that seem to have bad experiences. First some facts about henna: It doesn&#x27;t remove natural color then deposit another like other hair dye products. The red in henna bonds to the keratin in your hair without removing your natural color. So, think of a sponge. Henna goes into the holes and cracks and fills them up with translucent red color. That is why the more you use it, the deeper and richer the color will be. It is also why your natural color is still there, underneath.  For instance, my hair is very close to black, naturally. It is really dark brown. But, after a year of using red henna, my hair has an intense cherry cola color to it. Even though I use this red color, it still is dark. Just red too. :) Everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently to henna, so it takes some patience in getting used to. Another amazing thing henna does, is over time it thickens each hair strand. Im not kidding. My ponytail used to measure 1 and 1/2 inches around. Now after using henna for a year, my ends have thickened, and my pony tail is 2 and 1/2 inches around. I believe it is due to a combination of factors, including regular henna use. ( I also use sesame oil on my hair once a week overnight, and have switched to Natures Gate shampoos and conditioners)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To actually use the henna, I mix it with coffee, paprika, nutmeg, and egg, a little apple cider vinegar, and ginger.  It smells DIVINE. I mix it up and let it sit for an hour to four hours, then add a little secret to keep it from dripping.... Xanthan gum! You can buy it in little packets at stores, like you might find yeast in. It is a \\&quot;binder,\\&quot; so, when you add it to the henna mix, it makes it so it all sticks together and you will not have ANY drips, no matter how long you keep the mix on your head. I promise. Without xanthan gum, I always get drippies about 2-3 hours after applying my henna. With xanthan gum, I can wear it all day or all night, and have no issues whatsoever. So, try it!  I usually add about 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways. I cant say enough good about this henna. If you are a person who has had bad experiences with it, don&#x27;t give up. Keep at it. Once you find the right color and mix, you might really love it. I do!</li>
    <li> when you see green powder, it&#x27;s hard not to be skeptical... BUT the color is without a doubt the most beautiful color you can get. i use the red, fox box, and I was shocked at how easy it was to get the color i&#x27;d been wanting for YEARS. i went to sooo many hair stylists asking for a NOT ORANGE, natural looking auburn red color. I felt like i spelled it out for them exactly what i wanted but over and over i never got what i want. it always came out that purplish dark red fake color that everyone has. I used this once and I could have cried i was so happy.&lt;br /&gt;couple cons though-&lt;br /&gt;application is messy. I put towels down but i did accidentally step on some of the clumps. my feet were spotty red.&lt;br /&gt;takes a while to rinse out. to speed things up with the rinse out, use warm water for a few minutes to get majority out THEN shampoo. someone mentioned having to shampoo 4-5 times... i am assuming she didnt rinse first or that would have been unnecessary. As for the smell that was also mentioned as a con- put some essential oils in there. some tea is nice. I happen to love the smell of henna but if you are not fond of it, try one of my mentioned tips. not only will they help alleviate the henna smell, certain ones will kill scalp fungus, (itchy scalp, scalp pimples, dandruff etc)stimulate new hair growth, and condition skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI-I wrote this review before i used the box with the cheetah. the auburn color. This color is by far superior to the box with the fox. the cheetah isnt as fire red as the fox which i prefer. It&#x27;s the same color BUT sometimes if you are not careful the fox box color will leave a slight orange tint that washes out after a couple showers. Skip that completely and use the cheetah!</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous to use this as I had a bad experience with Henna as a teen.  I was impulsive back then and am sure I just didn&#x27;t read all the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;This turned my dark brown hair into a pure medium auburn.  I have wanted this hair color since I was in 3rd grade! No chemical dye has ever left my hair color looking so nice!  I started dying my hair when I was a teenager, with chemical dye, but finally stopped last year when I found out I was pregnant.  I now that I am nursing, I am very careful what goes on and in my body.  I thought my dying my hair days were over because I did not want my daughter to imitate me and use chemicals someday on herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this with the henna (and let set for one hour before application):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the warm water I used ½ lemon juice and ½ warm chamomile tea&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. nutmeg&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. fresh grated ginger&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. Allspice&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. paprika&lt;br /&gt;2 tbsp. yogurt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the henna sit on my hair for 1 ½ hours, then rinsed it out.  Once my first rinse was done, I washed my hair with baking soda and rinsed it out, then conditioned it and rinsed that out as well.  I used the baking soda and conditioner steps twice in a row.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps henna is harder to use than the conventional way to dye hair, but it is worth the time and effort considering it is not hurting you or others when you use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought other henna that lasts a lot longer and is more vibrant but I do like the color of this and the price is great.</li>
    <li> been using for 20 years love it... natural... always get compliments on my hair..  it looks like my color instead of chemical colrs which only sit on top of the hair n look brassy.. you can see the diff so clearly</li>
    <li> I have used Light Mountain Henna (Red) for years. My hair is healthy, and I get compliments everyday . Also a great way to grow in your natural color</li>
    <li> New Review: 2016 I have adapted to using this red shade of henna.  Firstly, it only takes about 20 minutes for this dye to work on my hair.  If I rinse it out at the right time, the weird orange color does not develop, and instead it turns out a nice coppery red.  I am now very happy with it and plan to keep using it indefinitely.  Secondly, I REALLY like that it does not smell like chemicals and it doesn&#x27;t set off my asthma or allergies.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good product, but if you&#x27;re a first-time dyer, realize there is likely to be a learning curve the first few times you use it.  I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough: the color WILL come out differently depending on the time you leave it on and the temperature!  You have to figure out what works for you.  Don&#x27;t try it for the first time a day before you have an important event to attend!  Old Review: Beware of orange I bought this stuff to return some of my gray hairs to a reddish color, to blend in better with the rest of my naturally curly, coppery-red hair.  I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair before or treated it chemically with anything, so it&#x27;s just normal hair.  I tested this stuff (the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; color) on a lock of hair first.  After a single hour, it seemed to be redder than my natural color.  The next day, after the allergy test, I mixed the dye powder with some boiling water, let it set for 30 minutes, and applied it to my entire head while it was still warm.  I covered it with a plastic bag &amp; waited exactly 45 minutes, warming it every 5 -8 minutes with my hair dryer.  When I rinsed it out, my hair was orange.  My whole head was blazing, pumpkiny orange.  Sooo fake looking.  Now, I look like a wannabe fake-orange redhead, instead of a real redhead with some gray hair.  Even three weeks later, it&#x27;s still blaze orange, and now you can see my roots, too.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fade over time, for a natural look&amp;#34;.  It looks like halloween hair dye.  Those reviewers who say to leave this stuff on for 3 to 4 hours have got to be insane.  Using their information, I thought 45 minutes would be enough to tint my hair without going overboard.  Boy was that wrong.  I&#x27;m going to try again, using the &amp;#34;auburn&amp;#34; color and only leaving it on for 10 minutes or so, to try to get the blended look I was hoping for.  As a dye, this stuff is very strong, so BEWARE of ORANGE.  P.S.  The dye and your hair afterward smells very strongly of herbal tea.  I have asthma, so chemical smells can make me very sick.  For me, having my hair smell like a cup of green tea is much better than a perfume or chemical smell.</li>
    <li> this is perfect. this item is exactly what i wanted. i am a very satisfied customer. will likely shop here again</li>
    <li> This henna dye works great, and it&#x27;s all natural. It gives my hair amazing color. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Hard to fine Henna in stores now.  I just tried it and it worked fine. Never used this brand before.</li>
    <li> Really lovely and natural looking!</li>
    <li> Okay so, I used this product a total of 4 times over a 8 month period (once every 2 months). The actual hair color results are a nice, rich auburn (I have naturally curly, light-medium brown hair). The color fades so naturally that you can go a while without coloring again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, the quality of my hair was horrible by the end of the 4th use. My hair had taken on a straw-like feel/appearance, my curls were looser, and the ends of my hair were breaking off in about 1\\&quot; pieces despite my endless attempt to moisturize my hair with every mask, oil, and cream conditioner on the market. BUT all this could be my fault because each time I dyed my hair, I dyed the whole thing, not just the roots (so those who do the same, be wary). I also naturally have dry, curly hair, and to apply the product, they ask that you shampoo it and not condition your hair, so when I dyed it, it was kind of a mess without my condition. Despite whose fault it was, I ended up having to cut off all my hair. Good news is my curls are back and my hair quality is amazing, but I personally can never use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add this as well. I am really paranoid about using henna since the whole ordeal of heavy metals and toxins showing up in certain brands. I emailed Light Mountain to clarify the purity of their product and this is the response I got (good news for those that fret about these issues like me):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for writing about your concerns.  Light Mountain takes these issues&lt;br /&gt;very seriously and we have many years of experience to control the&lt;br /&gt;botanicals we buy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facts are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. We have been doing this brand since the 1980&#x27;s and have a lot of&lt;br /&gt;experience in terms of doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. We work only with 100% certified organic botanicals, certified under&lt;br /&gt;the USDA program.  This means the growing, milling, packing, shipping are all&lt;br /&gt;CONTROLLED based on procedures that have been approved to ensure the&lt;br /&gt;botanicals don&#x27;t become contaminated in any way.  They are inspected by&lt;br /&gt;agencies on a regular basis who renew the organic certification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Even before we had organic certification on the herbs (which we have&lt;br /&gt;had now for years) we insisted on every single batch being tested for heavy&lt;br /&gt;metals and pesticide residues etc. Even after we started with organic&lt;br /&gt;certified herbs we continued to insist on this additional testing.  While&lt;br /&gt;the organic certification should make it irrelevant, we felt it was a good&lt;br /&gt;quality control step that should be maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. We insist on each container load having a \\&quot;clean out\\&quot; certification to&lt;br /&gt;ensure that nothing from prior products shipped in the container could in&lt;br /&gt;any way contaminate the goods. This is part of the organic certification&lt;br /&gt;control procedure we follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. We ship only in full container loads so that our goods are always&lt;br /&gt;sealed at the time of packing and unsealed when they reach us and there is no&lt;br /&gt;other potential contaminant present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let us know if we may be of further service.</li>
    <li> I wanted red hair without all the damage from chemicals. My hair is naturally a ashy dark brown, which I then highlighted blond, and then covered with semi-permanent \\&quot;burgundy\\&quot; hair dye. Needless to say, my fine hair was a bit fried. I bought this from my local grocery store, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the powder with hot water in a plastic bowl and let it sit for an hour before applying. I&#x27;m not sure what I did wrong, but it would not stick to my hair, and just felt like I was piling on mud and trying to make it stick. My bathroom was a mess. I would definitely recommend having someone help you with it. Also, apply Vaseline to your skin before starting. Once I was done, I put on the plastic cap, and left it for 2 hours, occasionally using a blow dryer to make it hot. It took a lot of conditioner to wash it out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I was done, I blow-dried my hair. I was hoping to get a dark, burgundy color. Instead I got super bright orange hair. I read that the color eventually gets darker, so I didn&#x27;t freak out too much. The next day my hair was a dark orange. After a week of washing it, it is now more of an auburn color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is a bit of a mixed review. I ended up loving the \\&quot;orange\\&quot; color I got because it somehow brings out my eye color and makes it pop, but if you&#x27;re buying this hoping for a dark red, expect it to be more orange than red. It was very hard to apply, and because I hate wearing gloves, my fingers are still stained from the application. It also smells \\&quot;muddy\\&quot; and leafy, but I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with it. This definitely leaves your hair VERY shiny and glossy, so as far as conditioning, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it 3 stars because it is messy, and more orange than red. HOWEVER, I&#x27;ll most definitely be buying it again because I accidentally found my new favorite hair color.</li>
    <li> The color was better than I expected. Thank you for a quality product. The&lt;br /&gt;closest to natural I have seen in a long time.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have a scalp that hates me.  It hates me so much, in fact that it refuses to be touched by anything that resembles hair dye from the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; store.  It immediately makes me break out in hives; regardless of the brand, the ingredients, etc.  HOWEVER, when I found henna (yeah, I know, I&#x27;m slow to the party) I found a miracle!  It may take a while, and this color may look like green mud and smell terrible, but my hair is stunning red when I&#x27;m done (I am a natural darker brunette) and my scalp is happy!  The color lasts a really long time, so this product is definitely made well:)</li>
    <li> Makes  my hair feel and look healthy and strong, after years of damaging it with chemical hair dyes and straighteners, now my hair is so soft and shiny, I have used the red and also the medium brown and loved both, getting lots of compliments, I add vinegar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and yogurt, rinsing it out is not easy, it takes long, I use a cheap conditioner to wash it out over and over until water is clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Henna many times and the results are consistent. I love not only the color (it&#x27;s so fun to be a redhead again!), but also the way it conditions my fine, thin hair. I used to do it myself and that can be challenging because of the mess and making sure the henna&#x27;s well incorporated into all of my hair. So now, I take it to the woman who cuts my hair and have her do it. After all, she&#x27;s set up to manage a mess and her sink can better handle the rinsing out process. I had her do it a week ago and I have had many many compliments on the new do and the lovely rich color of my hair. Go for it!</li>
    <li> It makes my already red hair more intense. The staining doesn&#x27;t fade, and everyone obsesses over my hair color. Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, however, is one to get used to. I sleep with it on overnight, and have been using the product for a few years, so I am used to it.</li>
    <li> The henna died my hair an amazing red. I have medium brown hair with natural highlights and the henna died everything perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t look fake. This was my first time using henna on my hair and I can&#x27;t wait until I do it again. The only negative to this is that it is messy but I expected that. Now that I have tried it out, I know how to improve application for next time.</li>
    <li> This henna is great! It looks like an expensive dye job, but without the price. It made my usually brown hair a nice shiny, red/brown with natural highlights. Yes, the paste is a bit messy, but cleanup is easy and it gave great coverage (and I have super thick hair). On top of that, it smells good! I like this brand better than any other semi-permanent dye I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have used Lush Henna in the past and it was much more effective. I left it on for longer than the prescribed time and barely a hint of red. Did make it a bit softer but my hair is really healthy and soft anyways. I might try it again just to see.</li>
