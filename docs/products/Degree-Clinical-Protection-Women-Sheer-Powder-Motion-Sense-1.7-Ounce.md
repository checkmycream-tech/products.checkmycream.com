      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>but it worked great.</li>
      <li>Degree Clinical Protection is a great product.  </li>
      <li>I have found to be very effective at controlling odor and perspiration.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
      <li>On the contrary, 14 hours in I still smelled good.</li>
      <li>a good product,</li>
      <li>I was very pleased when that did not happen.  </li>
      <li>I was beyond impressed, plus it helped me smell fresh all day.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love the smell!</li>
      <li>(I do this at night and again in the morning, just to be safe!).  </li>
      <li>Even on a hot and humid day it holds up wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>Nothing compares the effectiveness of Drysol, but it is nice to have something that is not itchy.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a pleasant baby powder scent and it is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply, with no sticky residue and a pleasant powdery scent.</li>
      <li>This product is my new best friend.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I think it made me sweat more.</li>
      <li>The directions do tell you to use it at night before bed, but I find it&#x27;s most effective to use it in the evening after a shower and again in the morning before work.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this antiperspirant/deodorant for about a week now, and can honestly say that it works better than every non-clinical deodorant/antiperspirant that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>For me I apply right after I shower in the morning and get great results.</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful, fresh and clean scent, it&#x27;s not overly fragrant or too potent, and it excels at odor and wetness</li>
      <li>However, it does work well even in the strong, summer heat!</li>
      <li>The price was good on Amazon and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I prefer fresher, more unisex fragrances.</li>
      <li>I did not get the 24 hour motion sense which works better for me.</li>
      <li>This product may have greater utility in winter months, so I will save it for a time when the temperature drops to under 60 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product has not been working for me, I have turned to Arm &amp; Hammer ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Deodorants, for the most part, seem to be way over-hyped.</li>
      <li>only deodorant i ever use it is the greatest</li>
      <li>Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder smells great and works just as good.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite deoderant.  </li>
      <li>The cream pushes up through middlin-size holes on top of the dispenser.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent deodorant, especially for the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; ones.</li>
      <li>All of them recommend applying before bed time, but I have never been able to accept that.</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands of clinical strength deodorant and antiperspirant and I feel that Degree Clinical Protection is one of the better ones.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Degree for many, many years.</li>
      <li>Love the smell</li>
      <li>The one &amp;#34;bad&#x27; thing I would have to say about it is that sometimes not all of the wholes at the top will work.</li>
      <li>This one however, works wonderfully and keeps me dry.  </li>
      <li>It fades some though the day but still too strong (if you like the baby powder scent you&#x27;ll love this).  </li>
      <li>So I was very happy when after wearing this Degree Clinical protection for several days I had no problems and still smell as fresh when I go to bed as I did in the morning!</li>
      <li>They give you beautiful underarms, total odor protection, lovely scents,soft skin, and can increase your productivity by 98%.</li>
      <li>I also put 1-click&#x27;s worth on in the morning as well because I&#x27;m kind of paranoid.</li>
      <li>(baby powder is one of my favorite clean smelling scents) and it applies smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Much cheaper, and much more effective.</li>
      <li>This line seems highly scented, but it is a good thing.</li>
      <li>product applied smoothly and does not have an overly strong scent.</li>
      <li>I used it out hiking daily in the woods in 90 degree heat and I am happy to report it stopped all sweat and odor.</li>
      <li>it is important to have protection that can keep up with the demands of my body and Degree Clinical Protection</li>
      <li>I have used many different types of Clinical Strength deodorants with good results, my favourite being [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>/&gt;And, although I know that this is how many deodorant/antiperspirants are dispensing their product, I don&#x27;t really like the top with the holes.</li>
      <li>This scent, Sheer Powder, is pleasant and not overly strong.</li>
      <li>Originally when I started using this type of anti-perspirant deodorant I was almost turned off from continuing to buy it because of the price, but it won me over by the way it works.</li>
      <li>deodorant stood up to my very most stressful and busy day of the year.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  like you smell it more as you start to sweat or get hot -</li>
      <li>The smell is too sweet to remain fresh all day -- I&#x27;d recommend this one, the Powder Fresh, or the Sexy Intrigue, which is also light and powdery).</li>
      <li>I get whiffs of it all day and although it smells really clean, I don&#x27;t like smelling like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It keeps me fresh and dry and I love the pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>only caveat is that I have not found a good way to get this out of clothes if it gets on them.</li>
      <li>It actually works fairly well for me in summer.  </li>
      <li>Motion Sense seems to really be true.</li>
      <li>After a couple of hours I noticed the fragrance had not faded and was just as strong as when I first applied the deodorant.  </li>
      <li>This is seriously the BEST stuff ever!!!</li>
      <li>You do have to make sure you put it on at night, if not, you&#x27;ll most likely be sweating.</li>
      <li>I have to say I love the other scent a lot more!</li>
      <li>Dries quickly.</li>
      <li>click the product up to get an adequate amount of it to apply.  </li>
      <li>For example, the smell of clean laundry would be just about right for me.</li>
      <li>I have allergies to many perfumes and the normal reaction to a fragrance</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good one, although I&#x27;m not clear how \\&quot;clinical\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I am very picky about my deodorant and it took me a long time to find one I am happy with.</li>
      <li>Expense, but WORTH it.</li>
      <li>B001FB5HK6 Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant for Women, Power Gel, Flower Fresh, 2.25 oz (63 g)</li>
      <li>I have always liked Degree Deodorant products buy their Clinical Protection line is just yards above the rest of their stuff.</li>
      <li>The directions indicate to apply two clicks worth of product to each underarm nightly</li>
      <li>The 2-pack was economical and means I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out any time soon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, overall, it offers great protection but you have to like the powder scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used many different types of Clinical Strength deodorants with good results, my favourite being [[ASIN:B001ECQ516 Degree Clinical Protection, Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Active  Clean, 1.7Ounce Stick (Pack of 2)]].  After using the Active Clean scent in 80+ degree heat weed eating without any perspiration and odours I decided to stick with Degree brand and give this scent a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Active Clean scent, this Sheer Powder version has a very strong baby powder scent that didn&#x27;t fade after applying.  I have allergies to many perfumes and the normal reaction to a fragrance I&#x27;m allergic to is a severe headache.  After applying the Degree Sheer Powder I developed a headache that continued to get worse.  After a couple of hours I noticed the fragrance had not faded and was just as strong as when I first applied the deodorant.  By that time my headache was very bad and getting worse so I had to take a shower and scrub my underarms to remove all traces of the deodorant.  Once I did this my headache began to ease up so there is something in the fragrance of this that I&#x27;m definitely allergic to.</li>
    <li> I am pretty picky about my deodorants, I tend to only buy the gel kinds and only from Secret. I had a girlfriend tell me how much she likes Degree so I gave them a try awhile back but did not like it (it was just their standard deodorant). I don&#x27;t have an out of the ordinary odor problem but it left me feeling wet by the end of the day. So I was very happy when after wearing this Degree Clinical protection for several days I had no problems and still smell as fresh when I go to bed as I did in the morning! Even on a hot and humid day it holds up wonderfully. I think I am going to have to put my days of the gel deodorants behind me!</li>
    <li> Degree can be a hit or miss product. Sometimes it says there&#x27;s no staining, but it&#x27;s not true; other times, the scent of the product is just unbearably strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sheer Powder Motion Sense, though, is a clear winner. The scent is just nice, not overpowering, and if you&#x27;re anything less than an Olympic sweater, this will keep you dry as a bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice job, and just in time for 90+ degree days!</li>
    <li> This product is my new best friend.  It reduces my excessive perspiration and has a nice clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be aware that the product must sit on your skin awhile before it will work.  The directions say to apply before you go to bed at night, but I don&#x27;t like doing that because it can get on the sheets and sometimes in my eyes.  I apply the product in the morning and wait about an hour before I do anything strenuous.  If I apply and then immediately start exercising, it doesn&#x27;t reduce the sweating one bit.  But if I apply and wait an hour or two then my perspiration is reduced by about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a good product, but you need to apply before bed time to get the best results.</li>
    <li> This product does what it is supposed to do. It keeps me fresh and dry and I love the pleasant scent. It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing or irritate my skin. This is a great product that I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this deodorant. It&#x27;s a good one, although I&#x27;m not clear how \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting the deo on at night, as is recommended, and that didn&#x27;t work for me. For one thing, I&#x27;m not good with changing a lifelong morning habit. I would feel all day that I missed something. And then at night I would forget to put it on. The few times I did put it on at night, I felt nervous the next morning about getting stinky. Turns out I didn&#x27;t get stinky...but I did get a little damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I apply it in the morning, there are no subsequent problems with stink or dampness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Of the three deos I tested this week, Sheer Powder is my least favorite scent. To my mind, it smells old fashioned and a bit cloying. I prefer fresher, more unisex fragrances. For example, the smell of clean laundry would be just about right for me. I mention this because if you do like a more feminine scent and my idea of a good smell sounds wrong in your mind, this is probably the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: This is a cream, and not a solid stick. The cream pushes up through middlin-size holes on top of the dispenser. It goes on clean, not tacky, chalky, or wet. I prefer this texture to the normal stick. It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on me or my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it takes a longer time than expected to push the cream up from the tube on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: I use it in the morning to keep things dryer and make my life less confusing. I don&#x27;t think I will pay more for this than a regular deodorant, but it feels luxurious to use this, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably worth trying a &#x27;clinical&#x27; deodorant once, to see if there is a big improvement for you.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, regular antiperspirants stopped working for me.  I would buy a new brand and it would work fine for 2 or 3 weeks, but after my body became used to it, I would start smelling and sweating regardless of how often I applied it.  I work a desk job with absolutely no physical activity, but I would still be stinky by mid-day.  Even reapplying several times a day did not help me.  The first time I saw clinical antiperspirant in a local store, I was quite skeptical.  After all, who in their right mind would pay that much for antiperspirant?  However a couple of weeks later when my latest antiperspirant stopped working, I decided to bite the bullet and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully expected it to stop working after 2 or 3 weeks...just like all of the predecessors did.  I was very pleased when that did not happen.  To date, I have been using Degree Clinical for about a year, and it still works very well for me.  I do not even follow the directions that recommend using it at night.  I simply put it on in the morning after I shower.  I typically use one \\&quot;click\\&quot; per arm pit, and I am smell and sweat free for the entire day.  This product is not quite a gel, and not quite a solid.  The best description I can give it is that it is a cream.  It is not slimy or sticky when it is applied, and dries almost immediately.  The only thing that I do not like about it is the higher cost.  However, it is worth the money since it works very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that all of the clinical strength deodorants seems to work well, regardless of the brand name.  I have bought Degree, Dove, Secret, and Suave, and I really cannot tell a difference.  So, I typically buy whichever is on sale, as long as I like the fragrance.  This scent, Sheer Powder, is pleasant and not overly strong.</li>
    <li> This screams baby powder scent. It fades some though the day but still too strong (if you like the baby powder scent you&#x27;ll love this).  As I write this I have it sitting next to me with the lid on and the smell is overpowering  -- please do note that I prefer non-scented body care product so that is a big bias on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the \\&quot;clinical Protection\\&quot; items from Degree I have found to be very effective at controlling odor and perspiration.  I also find that it helps with skin irritation that I get from damp pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to use a scented Degree clinical protection I prefer the \\&quot;active clean\\&quot; ([[ASIN:B00CHJUJTO Degree Clinical Protection, Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Active  Clean, 1.7 Ounce Stick]]) scent which is very mild in the first place and by far less stinky than this \\&quot;powder\\&quot; scent.</li>
    <li> The Motion Sense line of deodorant from degree works really well. There is no wetness and no odor. With a lot of other deodorants, even if they are \\&quot;antiperspirant and deodorant,\\&quot; they will still leave you with either some wetness or some odor. This one really does protect against both. This line seems highly scented, but it is a good thing. It&#x27;s  like you smell it more as you start to sweat or get hot - so the product name Motion Sense seems to really be true. I have tried other scents of this line and they have worked well also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no skin irritation, even when used right after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this line of deodorants. They work really well and I love that the scents last and sort of revive themselves as you are more active. There is no chance of any body odor and it keeps your underarms dry.</li>
    <li> Years ago, I never really was a big Degree deodorant fan. I never thought the fragrances were that great, I always thought it felt a bit on the powdery side, and they just didn&#x27;t jive with me as much as other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not anymore! This deodorant is great. It has a wonderful, fresh and clean scent, it&#x27;s not overly fragrant or too potent, and it excels at odor and wetness protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never really have an issue with deodorant irritating my skin, so I can&#x27;t really speak to it decreasing irritation more than any other brand, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cause any issues for me. It didn&#x27;t feel too drying or powdery, either. Sometimes I have a problem with deodorants that do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent deodorant, especially for the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; ones. I always use those, because I seem to perspire quite a bit. This is a great one! I&#x27;d definitely recommend it! Degree has really come around to making quality deodorants for women.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Degree Deodorant products buy their Clinical Protection line is just yards above the rest of their stuff. It was 92 degrees today in New Jersey and humidity was through the roof. But I was completely dry and smelling sweet!  It definitely lasted all day too, there was no reapplying needed. This is a great product. The price may be slightly higher than your average deodorant, but it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Degree for many, many years. It seems to be the best protection for me. This version was no exception and kept me dry and clean smelling all day on hot, humid and active days. This is what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Degree so I was happy that this version held up as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wasn&#x27;t sold on was the baby powder scent. I get whiffs of it all day and although it smells really clean, I don&#x27;t like smelling like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, although I know that this is how many deodorant/antiperspirants are dispensing their product, I don&#x27;t really like the top with the holes. You have to turn the bottom over and over to get enough product to use on each arm. My old Degree was a stick version so you only had to turn the bottom when it got too low on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go on white and disappears very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, it offers great protection but you have to like the powder scent.</li>
    <li> As a compulsive tester of many types of deodorants I was interested to try Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder. I really like it. Love the smell (baby powder is one of my favorite clean smelling scents) and it applies smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions say to use at night. I used it only in the morning. No problems. I smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> I would be almost certain that this product has the same ingredients as Degree Clinical Protection - Active Clean minus the scent, but I find I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;Sheer Powder\\&quot; variety as well. I feel like its consistency is a bit more liquid which makes it feel less dry than the other scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still seems to control odor well and lasts an extended period of time compared to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorants. I would rank it above standard issue sticks, but if you are looking for a nice, dry clinical protection product, get another variety of degree.</li>
    <li> Degree antiperspirant keeps me dry and the more I sweat the more Sheer Powder scent I can detect. Also it doesn&#x27;t stain my clthes when i put them on (after applying antiperspirant). Dries quickly.</li>
    <li> It actually took me awhile to get use to this type of deodorant since I already have a staple deodorant that I have been using for years, But I really grew to like this and I absolutely love the smell! What I&#x27;m not to fond of is the dispenser. The deodorant itself dispenses out of a bunch of tiny holes and you have to twist it quite a few times just for it to come out. Besides that, It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do which is to provide me with long lasting freshness.</li>
    <li> I am not a big sweater but I do sweat a lot under my arms. This deodorant absolutely stopped all of my sweating. It&#x27;s just amazing! The price on Amazon is also great with the subscribe snd save discount. So stop shopping around and get this product.</li>
    <li> I used a prescription and it was applied at night, using regular deodorant/antiperspirant during the day and it completely stopped the sweating.  This product is similar and can compete with the prescription.  The directions do tell you to use it at night before bed, but I find it&#x27;s most effective to use it in the evening after a shower and again in the morning before work.  It works well, smells good, and I never smell like BO even after a strenuous workout or long day at work (and I did with other products).  I recommend it 100% and use the Amazon subscription so I never run out.</li>
    <li> keep me fresh the whole day long.</li>
    <li> Degree Clinical Protection is a great product.  I bought the wrong scent of degree.  The Powder Motion Sense is a little overpowering for me.</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot under my arms, and after years of wearing only black to avoid earning a nickname like Pit Stains, I decided to give clinical antiperspirants a try. I first tried Secret, which was better than regular deodorant but didn&#x27;t prevent sweating well enough for the cost. Degree had better reviews from users on Amazon and other sites, though, so I decided to give it a try -- and boy, am I glad I did. The sweat-prevention of Degree Clinical Strength is awesome -- even after an hour-long cardio workout I&#x27;m still pretty dry -- and the Sheer Powder scent remains fresh and light all day long; the Secret started to smell rancid when I sweated (and actually, I&#x27;d say the same about the Active Clean variety from Degree, too. The smell is too sweet to remain fresh all day -- I&#x27;d recommend this one, the Powder Fresh, or the Sexy Intrigue, which is also light and powdery). I also find that this stuff doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes nearly as much as other brands; between it staying on better and preventing sweat to begin with, the underarms of my shirts have been staying a lot nicer for a lot longer than they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re also living in fear of earning a nickname like Pit Stains, I&#x27;d definitely recommend that you give Degree a try.</li>
    <li> This product works great if used both morning and night.  However, using a different deodorant during the day produced not so stellar results.  Hence, the 4 stars.  But, works WONDERFUL when used morning and night.</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well.  I have tried numerous deodorants and they have failed me.  This one however, works wonderfully and keeps me dry.  I can even skip a day and will still be dry! The price was good on Amazon and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Degree for a decade and used the clinical protection for maybe 3 years. I don&#x27;t know why, but Degree works better than any other brand of deodorant I have ever used. I moved to a new state this year and couldn&#x27;t find Degree Clinical Protection in any pharmacy or grocery here, so I was grateful to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used another fragrance for years, but decided to order the sheer powder this time, as I haven&#x27;t used powder-scented deodorant in a long time. I wanted something fresh-smelling and not perfumey. This fits the bill. The scent is not very strong at all, but it smells very fresh and clean. It keeps me dryer and suppresses body odor. Also, it doesn&#x27;t irritate freshly-shaved armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just the best. The 2-pack was economical and means I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out any time soon.</li>
    <li> only deodorant i ever use it is the greatest</li>
    <li> Great product! Used it for my wedding.</li>
    <li> I switched from regular Degree deodorant to Clinical Protection because I felt like the one I was using just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. Clinical Protection lasts all day and has yet to fail me.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about my deodorant and it took me a long time to find one I am happy with. I use [[ASIN:B001FB5HK6 Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant for Women, Power Gel, Flower Fresh, 2.25 oz (63 g) (Pack of 6)]]. It is the only one that seems to work. It goes on clear and I never sweat. It also smells great! However, there are a few shirts of mine it does stain and my underarms are a different shade than the rest of my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this after trying the Active Clean scent. I have to say I love the other scent a lot more! However, the other one I noticed does not go on clear and does leave white marks if putting on a shirt quickly after. However, this one goes on clear but the one thing I can not get over with this one is the scent. It smells like baby powder and to me that is not refreshing. Perhaps because I associated baby powder with something to cover up another odor. It works, love that it goes on clear, but I can&#x27;t stand the scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to go back to my Mitchum deodorant after trying two scents of these and now can&#x27;t. I thought it was the best but I am now going to be buying the Active Clean scent made by Degree. It works so well that I can get over the white marks. Plus, I would rather have white marks than walking around and smelling bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this scent is not there for me. I can&#x27;t tolerate it.</li>
    <li> In the summer, ever since I was a kid, I always sweat very badly. Bad enough where my mom ended up taking me to the doctor to see if he could give me something to help ease the problem. Back then, I could sweat through 4 shirts at a time and I always had terrible stains under my arms. After growing out of it, I still sweat badly in heat so when I tried degree clinical strength, I wanted to see if it could help me more than the prescription I was given as a child. The degree clinical strength worked so well that I didn&#x27;t even need an undershirt for protection. I was beyond impressed, plus it helped me smell fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Ordered degree clinical protection with 24 hour motion sense and i recieved a different product. I did not get the 24 hour motion sense which works better for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this antiperspirant/deodorant for about a week now, and can honestly say that it works better than every non-clinical deodorant/antiperspirant that I&#x27;ve tried.  The powder fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming, I&#x27;ve not had any issues with white marks on my clothing, and it certainly has been controlling my underarm perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because of the way the product dispenses.  The directions indicate to apply two clicks worth of product to each underarm nightly (I do this at night and again in the morning, just to be safe!).  However, it usually does not dispense from all the application slots on each click, making it difficult to judge how many times you should /actually/ click the product up to get an adequate amount of it to apply.  It&#x27;s not a major annoyance, but with as expensive as this is, it&#x27;d defintely be preferable to have it dispense properly instead of having to &amp;#34;guesstimate&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> Clinical strength deodorants tend to be too strong for me, except for the Secret version.  Degree Motion sense is another exception.  It works and you do not really need a lot of it.  One click delivers a very thin layer of deodorant that really lasts for more than 12 hours.  It does not cause irritation, dullness, or darkening of the skin.  Price is also pretty good since as I said you do not really need to use a lot of product to get maximum protection even after a 5K run.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with skin irritation (the product advertises that it is proven not to cause irritation), so I can&#x27;t comment on that. However, it does work well even in the strong, summer heat!</li>
    <li> Sweating is not something a woman wants to talk about, but it&#x27;s a part of life. Unfortunately for some of us, it&#x27;s a bigger part than we would like it to be. I&#x27;ve been using several brands of \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; anti-perspirant deodorants for the last 3-4 years and all of them protect me better than the average solid. This is the first time I have tried out [[ASIN:B001ECQ53E Degree Clinical Protection, Women Sheer Powder, Motion Sense]] and I have to say that the scent is one I really like.  Additionally it seems to works as well as the other brands I normally use. One thing I don&#x27;t follow are the instructions. All of them recommend applying before bed time, but I have never been able to accept that. For me I apply right after I shower in the morning and get great results. Originally when I started using this type of anti-perspirant deodorant I was almost turned off from continuing to buy it because of the price, but it won me over by the way it works. Now I can&#x27;t imagine not using it, so the price is no longer a factor.</li>
    <li> I have this deodorant on Subscribe &amp; Save and never even think about changing. It&#x27;s actually rather nice to have found a product that really works so you can stop trying a new brand or a new type every other week. I&#x27;ve tried countless of deodorants and this is the only that&#x27;s worked for me. I&#x27;ve even the tried the Dove and Secret Clinical Protection deodorants, but those haven&#x27;t worked for me. You do have to make sure you put it on at night, if not, you&#x27;ll most likely be sweating. I also put 1-click&#x27;s worth on in the morning as well because I&#x27;m kind of paranoid. The one &amp;#34;bad&#x27; thing I would have to say about it is that sometimes not all of the wholes at the top will work. So you&#x27;ll be turning the little wheel and the deodorant will only come out of say 4 of the like 10 holes. It&#x27;s just a minor inconvenience because it makes it hard to tell how much you should be putting on. It is expensive and certainly doesn&#x27;t last very long (quantity wise), but if you have serious sweating issues, I suggest giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve used other scents of Degree Clinical which worked better. Honestly, I think it made me sweat more. I would actually get sweaty where this was applied within a few minutes of doing nothing. The smell is really weird also. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I really hated it. To the point where I will only use it if I&#x27;m going to be home alone all day, because I&#x27;m worried other people will smell it, and it&#x27;s rank. I think maybe the whole \\&quot;Motion Sense\\&quot; idea is the problem. I didn&#x27;t notice any increase in effectiveness, or any smell release tied with motion. I&#x27;ve had much better luck just buying a regular guys deodorant. Much cheaper, and much more effective.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my Friend,  Degree Clinical is the only deodorant that I have found  not to irritate your underskin.  It works great.  Expense, but WORTH it.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the BEST stuff ever!!! I have had sweating problems for years. Nothing I have ever tried has worked for me. I usually only wear black because I would get such big sweat stains under my arms. I bought this product 7 days ago and have been dry ever since. I have been able to wear shirts that I was never able to wear before. This product has truly changed my life!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deoderant.  It goes on like creamy powder and give me the best protection, I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have tried several \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; protection types of deodorants. I love the Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with motion sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant stood up to my very most stressful and busy day of the year. I was not sweaty or smelly at all. On the contrary, 14 hours in I still smelled good. I was a little skeptical about the motion sense but it worked great. Some powder scents are a little unpleasnat as the wear on but this one stays fresh and clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat is that I have not found a good way to get this out of clothes if it gets on them.</li>
    <li> Best buy for this antiperspirant!</li>
    <li> After ruining numerous white tops to excessive perspiration, I tried the prescription Drysol. While effective in targeting my perspiration issue, I found the burning and itching that accompanied the product to be enough of a reason to try to identify another option, so I was willing to try Degree Clinical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product applied smoothly and does not have an overly strong scent. I experienced no itching or burning.  When I first started using the product it was summer in Ohio.  It has been hot and I have found Degree Clinical to be fairly useless at combating excessive perspiration. This product may have greater utility in winter months, so I will save it for a time when the temperature drops to under 60 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product has not been working for me, I have turned to Arm &amp; Hammer ([[ASIN:B001E76840 Arm &amp; Hammer Ultra Max Advanced Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Invisible Solid, Unscented, Packaging May Vary, 2.6 oz (73.7 g) (Pack of 6)]]).  It actually works fairly well for me in summer.  Nothing compares the effectiveness of Drysol, but it is nice to have something that is not itchy.</li>
    <li> Despite trying the on-sale deodorant from time to time, I always come back to Degree as no other brand even seems to come close to its protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; product I have tried. The first was another brand, and I was not impressed. Conversely, after a few weeks of daily use of the&lt;br /&gt;Degree clinical protection, I can say I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. I used it out hiking daily in the woods in 90 degree heat and I am happy to report it stopped all sweat and odor. It worked just as well for daily use around the house, garden or at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply, with no sticky residue and a pleasant powdery scent. I will definitely be purchasing this item again if the price is right.</li>
    <li> Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder smells great and works just as good. Most clinical strength applies very wet to me and it usually takes a while to dry but this brand goes on easy without being too wet and dries easily. I love that you don&#x27;t need to use too much and this will last throughout the day for me without ever having to reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to sweat a lot and to me it is important to have protection that can keep up with the demands of my body and Degree Clinical Protection is perfect for me. I use a little in the morning and I&#x27;m set for the rest of the day even through the night and that&#x27;s just what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Degree Clinical Protection and a little goes a long way and that saves you time and money. I will continue using this because it&#x27;s perfect for my body&#x27;s needs.</li>
    <li> Deodorants, for the most part, seem to be way over-hyped. They give you beautiful underarms, total odor protection, lovely scents,soft skin, and can increase your productivity by 98%. Except for that last part, that&#x27;s what the ads claim. So I was happily surprised by the degree of protection I got from Degree (I know...corny). The scent is pleasant and I tested the product on a day that I was going to be doing some heavy labor in the garden (building a patio). It actually worked. Well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: for 24-hour protection, you are supposed to use the product twice a day, in the morning and at bedtime. Using a deodorant or antiperspirant to protect me in my sleep seems a little silly to me, and I actually don&#x27;t NEED 24-hour protection.</li>
    <li> Those who seek natural products will want to avoid Degree Clinical Protection because it contains Aluminum based products. There are some researchers who are concerned that aluminum based personal care products are linked to cancer (especially deodorants as they are used near the breast lymph nodes) as well as to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the package, the ingredients in Degree Clinical Protection Women Sheer Powder includes Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex as well as Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Paraffin, Microcrystalline Wax, Fragrance, Silica, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Hydrated Silica, Maltodextrin, Gelatin Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Cellulose Gum, BHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I switched to mineral based deodorants including [[ASIN:B000S83JR0 Thai Deodorants Thai Natural Crystal Deodorant Push-Up Stick 2.125 oz]] and [[ASIN:B0014ZPZX2 Thai Deodorant Stone Thai Crystal Mist Deodorant Pump -- 8 fl oz]]. I have been far happier using the mineral based personal care products.  My husband and my brother have now switched to Thai Crystal, too, as they are made for both men and women.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of clinical strength deodorant and antiperspirant and I feel that Degree Clinical Protection is one of the better ones.  It goes on clear and does not leave white stains on clothes.  The fragrance is a pleasant baby powder scent and it is not too strong.  I have not had any problems with odor or wetness all day while using this product.  I really like this product and would not hesitate to purchase and use it again.</li>
    <li> I work out daily, and use regular degree often, so like my other review I can&#x27;t say that this is any different because it seems to work the same.  I&#x27;m not sure if it warrants the high price tag.  Maybe I&#x27;m not a good test subject, but to me it didn&#x27;t seem to be any better then the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; version - which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy if you think you need and extra boost, but if you&#x27;re like me and the regular is getting the job done - save your $</li>
