<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Rapid de,livery ,good price. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am a satisfied purchaser of this product. So when deciding what to get my college age son for his birthday, I purchased Vera Wang for him. Upon receipt of his gift he said he was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Good price and good service</li>
    <li> hard to find in stores and much more affordable.</li>
    <li> This stuff just smells fantastic. Most women love the smell and will tell you so. :)  Always keep stock of it.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, and so does everyone who smells me wearing it!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and received very quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband  really likes this calogne..I also think it smells really nice. The only thing that he doesn&#x27;t like  about it is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly clean and fresh oriental-style fragrance, with strong tobacco and sandalwood overtures followed by hints of leather and some green leaves. As a fan of oriental-style fragrances, this is an excellent example of what one should be: clean and to the point. The aroma is relatively simple, with the tobacco and sandalwood overshadowing the other elements at first, and thus falls well short of the brilliance of more famous orientals, such as [[ASIN:B000XE2DXU Ysl By Yves Saint Laurent For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray Concentrate 3.4 Oz]]. What the scent lacks in complexity is however made up for in versatility and crispness. The aroma is warm and inviting but not overbearing, with projection limited to a few feet. Longevity is good but not excellent, lasting from morning through mid-afternoon, but essentially gone by the early evening. The scent is thus simple and subtle enough for work, as it gives a professional and well put-together aroma and does not distract. It has also proven to be quite versatile at casual affairs, drawing compliments from ladies and gents, but is not powerful enough to stand out in more intense club-like environments, for which I would recommend a more powerful oriental fragrance, such as [[ASIN:B000C1Z5WU Xeryus Rouge for Men by Givenchy 3.3oz 100ml EDT Spray]]. Overall this is a good example of an oriental scent, as while neither its complexity nor its longevity are excellent, it does everything well and makes a well-rounded package suitable for many occasions.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product 8 days before Christmas and the expected arrival dates were the 21st to the 28th of December with standard shipping as my chosen method of delivery, so I was not sure it would arrive on time, but it came in only 5 days. As far as the product, it it was gift for someone who told me that it was one of his favorites and was hard to find. In the one retail store I found it it is almost double the cost, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it offered here and at such a great price. I am very pleased with my purchase as was the person I got it for.</li>
    <li> I have used Vera Wang&#x27;s Eau De Toilette for men for about 5 years and to tell you the truth people still stop me and ask me what is it that I am wearing . I love it because its not overpowering and yet rich enough to catch attention. So men Buy this if you want women stopping you![[ASIN:B000E7WHDM Vera Wang By Vera Wang For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces]]</li>
    <li> I was informed at Sephora that this cologne was discontinued but wanted more!  I found it on Amazon.  The price here was the best...even better than Fragrance.net with coupons.  I got two bottles for the price of one compared to the original price of this cologne.  I am so happy I found it!</li>
    <li> great, will reorder when it will be gone!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. Everytime he wears it, it drives me wild. Men if you like to smell good you can&#x27;t go wrong with Vera Wang for men!</li>
    <li> Excellent bottle reproduction unfortunately the scent is far from origunal which I have. I have returned have returned receipt &amp; have not received refund as of yet.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful fragrance for the guy in your life.I love it and i&#x27;m sure he will to for Christmas.. great gift idea.</li>
    <li> Many compliments about the smell...a must have</li>
    <li> This is one of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve ever tried, not only am I very pleased by its scent but I also keep getting compliments from everyone around me, highly recommended</li>
    <li> My husband loves this perfume and couldn&#x27;t find in stores any more. It last longer and the fragrance is awesome</li>
    <li> My husband had a sample of this fragrance and he loved it. I love all of the Vera Wang scents for women. This product smells wonderful and just like her products for women worth every penny and will last a long time. The size of the bottle versus the small amount necessary to smell fantastic all day makes this a definite winner. I could not find this product on any other site and I was so surprised and happy to see the price and size of the bottle. My husband was thrilled to get his hands on it.[[ASIN:B0043U3M9E Vera Wang by Vera Wang for Men 2 Piece Set Includes: 3.4 oz Eau de Toilette Spray + 3.4 oz After Shave Pour (Glass Bottle)]]</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bf. I loved it because it&#x27;s so light it mixes with his natural scent and makes him smell delicious. Love that it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this calogne for years and love it. This one was great at a great price! Well but it again when I run out. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is extremely hard to find at any store.  This is one of my favorite fragrances and have used it for years.  Amazon provided me with a link to find Vera Wang and the product is exactly like the ones I would purchase at Macy&#x27;s.  I will continue to purchase this product through Amazon, no hassle, delivered to my house with great price.  It is a win for me and would highly recommend this product to men who want to smell great.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a while.  I get a lot of compliments from women and it lasts long.  Great cologne.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
    <li> This is a staple in my husbands smell wardrobe. He has been wearing it for several years now and always gets compliments from men and women alike.</li>
    <li> Smell delicious on my husband soft and clean besides that last all day long</li>
    <li> Cologne is incredible, women have complimented my cologne and have even had me stop by so they could sniff me lol, only issue is that it&#x27;s water based, so it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> My wife loves this on me!!</li>
    <li> I have used this Vera Wang product for several years. Hopefully, it will stay on the market for many more years. No longer carried by our local Dillard&#x27;s .</li>
    <li> This is the best men&#x27;s cologne - a little sweet, no musky or soap smell.  I am glad it was so easy to get via Amazon at this price.  This size will last two years.</li>
    <li> I was only aware of the small bottle size, so when I received the product, I was surprised by the size of the bottle!</li>
    <li> Forget my opinion...I get a &amp;#34;Oh my you smell good&amp;#34; response when I hug ladies. And that&#x27;s always nice to hear! My wife seems to like this fragrance over most of the other fragrances that I have worn over the years. I had worn Bijan for many years, but switched to Vera Wang about 6 years ago.</li>
    <li> The is my favorite cologne.  I have used it for several years.  It is not overpowering and a good scent&lt;br /&gt;that stays with me.  When I found this on line it said A SAMPLER.  It was cheaper than the regular bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It is the same size and all-excellent deal.</li>
    <li> This cologne is difficult for me to find in retail stores. I like its subtle fragrance. Excellent experience finding and ordering it online.</li>
    <li> I love Vera Wang cologne, it goes on strong/light but looses it strength unless you&#x27;re in real close proximity……I still Love it!!!!! It&#x27;s a very masculine refreshing scent….very clean…..</li>
    <li> awesome scent! super fast shipment! thanks</li>
    <li> I love this cologne, so crisp and clean. Arrived earlier than expected. Thanks! Great Father&#x27;s day or birthday gift. :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. It smells quite manly however is not a scent you&#x27;d expect to find on your grandparents. Ver sexy fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this brand plus the fair pricing.</li>
    <li> Great scent that isn&#x27;t too sweet but not too woodsy either! Some are turned off by the fact that it&#x27;s made by the famous womens bridal designer, but in reality, she knows how to make a man smell amazing! I love this scent and have been wearing it for three years. First time to buy it from amazon and the process was a breeze with fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a subtle--which is nice--scent that does not overwhelm. If you are the &amp;#34;let me let you know I&#x27;m in the area bay rum&amp;#34; type, you should look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Fragrances for men tend to turn me off : too brash, too woodsy, too much like room deodorants. When I smell a cologne I want to think of the man - not the cologne. Vera Wang for Men has something spicy about it. There are wood and tobacco notes. But it&#x27;s all so well blended, so balanced that it just makes you want to bury your face in your man&#x27;s neck when he wears it.</li>
    <li> Last A Very Longtime And Smells Great!!!</li>
    <li> i miss the smell so such,i used to have a bottle of 1.7oz but i broke it,so i buy it again and lager</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  On time delivery.</li>
    <li> I love the price. And recommended to be able to give people a good smell.</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments.It lasts a long time and It smells really great</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for years - smells so good!  The only cologne he uses.  Nice manly scent.  Highly recommended - get&#x27;s lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. I get a lot of compliments from the ladies because they say that men&#x27;s cologne normally is too strong but this one is perfect. It&#x27;s the only one that I wear now.</li>
    <li> By Vera Wang for my uncle for his birthday gift every year. Last all day can&#x27;t go wrong with Vera Wang</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain on this bad boy.</li>
    <li> Received a very quick you can&#x27;t go wrong  wearing get the ladies loved it. The smell stays with you. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift and was greatly appreciated since you cannot buy this in the department stores anymore!</li>
    <li> My husband loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Great colonge at great price, Can&#x27;t beat Amazon purchases.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and service, Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a one of a kind High Class Cologne I will always have some of this in stock, It is very smooth and Airy the Aroma just makes you feel as if you are a High Caliber type of guy.</li>
    <li> the smell  goes away  in 10 minutes it has to be a fake fragrance  would never buy cologne on line again</li>
    <li> Smells good on my husband as always!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  Smells very nice and he loved it.  It has a very nice smell and I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> smell is awesome, boyfriend loved it as a gift. got to my house in record timing. definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> Experience is the most valuable asset. I bought this brand name &#x27;cause of Wang&#x27;s fame. A total overrated product. My recommendation: stick to the classics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bacevedo</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for years. I LOVE the scent. I wish it would last a little longer though.</li>
    <li> Leathery,powdery,floral,woody smell! Very nice! 100% Authentic !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very strong(a good thing) but it DOES project nicely. Depending on where you spray it will be the deciding factor on its staying power and longevity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mature masculine smell IMO a nicer &amp;#34;Obsession&amp;#34; smell lighter with more leather!</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance. But the longevity is very poor. The drydown is better than the top notes. Recommended for daytime.</li>
    <li> This is one of my Favorite colognes.  It&#x27;s not to strong or spicy.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  Spray a little for a short time of a lil more for a longer time of scent.  I have been told, that the scent is still on me long into the day.  Great price on amazon.</li>
    <li> Of course, personal preference is involved in the selection of any cologne.  However, this cologne has a great smell.  I&#x27;m constantly asked what cologne am I wearing - definitely my favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDSON</li>
    <li> Great cologne.  Better than expected.  Female co-workers love it.  Not overpowering!</li>
    <li> I really like this item and it smells real good. This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this item online but it won&#x27;t be the last time. My wife really like the way Vera Wang smell too. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne and I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I origally bought this cologne for my husband in a smaller size to see if I liked it and it smelled so good that I bought him the 3.4 ounce bottle.  He loves it and so do I.</li>
    <li> i put n this perfume everyday before work but i don&#x27;t think it has a long lasting smell cause i have never been complimented or even noticed by it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Vera Wang for a while. It&#x27;s a wonderful cologne. Nice bottle too. Sure you can find many reviews with better description of the smell, but I&#x27;ll do my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a mixed scent. Modern without losing the woodier nod to scents that were more popular from the 50&#x27;s to the 90&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a wonderful mix. Can hit pretty strong, lasts a long time (4-6hrs) on my skin.</li>
    <li> My ex-girlfriend bought this for me back in 2004.  I finally ran out by using it sparingly until 2013....I needed more and got more, still happy.</li>
    <li> Had it before and always received it compliments whenever I had it on. Still have the same effect. Extra Hugs and a definite chick magnet.</li>
    <li> Know nothing about Vera Wang the fashion designer. But, for sure Vera Wang the perfume designer knows a bunch about olfactory senses. Amazing cologne for men !</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described. Shipped quickly undamaged.</li>
    <li> Since the first time I smelled the scent I had to know what it was, since then I have not stopped purchasing it when I run out!</li>
    <li> The order arrived on time and I am very satisfied with my product</li>
    <li> During my live I was enjoying different censes and I always know that Vera Wang was for women, it was a surprise to try this cologne thru Amazon and it doesn&#x27;t come along the box presentation is first class if you are thinking like a present and in addition you have an after shave balm and a liquid soap. All this at a very convenient price in few words excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Quique</li>
    <li> Smells great! I can&#x27;t recommend this one enough.</li>
    <li> Awesome gift for Christmas. I really like this scent.  It is a great price point. I don&#x27;t typically like male calogne; but this was a very nice surprise.</li>
    <li> I gave as gift and it was intact and on time!</li>
    <li> Ahhh! Best cologne for men! My husband has been wearing it since 2007 (he is 33) and gets at least one compliment a day! It is masculine, sexy, and not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is calming, smoothe, woody, and slightly sweet. He sometimes wears Givenchy Pi ---Vera Wang is much more woody and less soft than that.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and wonderful fragrance!</li>
    <li> overpriced, but hard to find in store</li>
    <li> received timely bought this for my father he loves it.  I think it is very classy and makes a profound statement.</li>
    <li> Bought this cologne for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He had it before and really liked it (so did I).  It has a very clean, fresh smell.  Not musky like many mens colognes.</li>
    <li> I am always skeptical buying these types of things online but its the real deal. I always get compliments on this one and recommend highly</li>
