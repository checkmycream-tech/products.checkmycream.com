<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looks like it definitely softened my wrinkles..........at my age, 73  I can only wish they would disappear! lol</li>
    <li> I have use this product for 3 weeks. This serums is not sticky . It&#x27;s makes my face feel fresh and relaxed. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the serum.  Eye lines are less noticeable after using only a few days.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my girlfriend to try out as part of her skin care line of products.  She left it at my house &amp; traveled on business last week.  For the past week, I faithfully did her nightly ritual of applying the retinal serum on my freshly washed face, every evening.  I put a little on under my eyes, above &amp; around my cheek bone area towards my temple.  I must admit, I&#x27;m starting to get why women do this stuff.  The serum feels good, smooth &amp; cool to my skin when I put it on.  When I shower in the morning, my face feels really smooth in the area that I had applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We grilled with family &amp;  friends this holiday weekend, and I couldn&#x27;t help but grin at all the comments everyone was making about how fresh, well rested, and happy my appearance seemed to come off to everyone.  With those kind of comments after one week, I can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s going to happen after a month.  I may just lose those smile lines (crow feet) on the outside of my eyes. I hate to admit it, but I&#x27;m going to order a bottle for myself!</li>
    <li> I started using the Sublime Beauty products awhile ago.  I&#x27;m using several of them and wanted to use them one at a time so I could tell which product was making each change.  I recently reviewed the Collagen serum because it really did improve my eyes and skin; like a mini facelift!  I then added the Retinol Serum.  I had tried a retinol cream about a year ago and it was pretty harsh on my skin.  When I first started using this I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because my skin felt really soft and not irritated at all, but, after several days, I started noticing changes.  I was surprised at how quickly it began to improve the quality of my skin.  I&#x27;ve had a few spots and bumps that hadn&#x27;t gone away, and they are now significantly less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess when we look at our skin every day, the changes are gradual, but I hadn&#x27;t noticed how dull my skin had become, even using other products to clean, exfoliate and moisturize.  I think what I like most about the change I&#x27;m seeing from the Retinol Serum is my skin is brighter and softer and smoother after only a few weeks.  This is what I think of when I think of a product as anti-aging.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Vitamin C which I have heard is so good for our skin, or from the retinol, but something&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful retinol serum. Not all are created equally. I&#x27;ve tried several and this one has by far worked the best on my skin. I also love the convenient pump that gives me just the right amount for around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and wonderful service with great follow up. Full 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 weeks, but I am already seeing a difference in skin tone texture.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum. I love how my face feels after application. I have a spotty complexion and my skin tone has evened out. It is visibly clearer and more even. I recommend this product for women who are older and need a little extra help with skin tone.</li>
    <li> I love the way it applies. I just started using it but am already feeling the results.</li>
    <li> Again I love these pumps on the sublime beauty brand!  It smells nice and I have noticed a big difference around my eyes.  Thank you for great products that I will be sure to continue to use.</li>
    <li> Really like the Sublime Beauty products, including this one.  I&#x27;ve been using the night cream, day cream and not the serum so hopefully will see great results in another month or so.  I do love the way they make my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I bought this retinol serum because I needed something to help heal the dry damaged skin on my face. I have a swimming pool and lay out and swim at least an hour on every sunny day. Over time, my skin has become dry and sun damaged. This product has really helped to improve the skin around my eyes. At first, I used it only 3 times a week, but now I am using it every day. I love how much better my eyes look. I feel that this retinol serum has been gentle on my skin, too. This product is exactly what I needed to improve my damaged skin problem. I am so pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I spent many summers in Texas in the pool without sunscreen on as a kid, because we didn&#x27;t know better back then.  I&#x27;ve had so many bad sunburns on my nose and shoulders, I still hurt when I think about it.  A few years ago I started taking better care of my skin, but didn&#x27;t invest in quality products, so my skin was okay but dull, uneven in tone, and with somewhat enlarged pores.  Earlier this year, two friends of mine started seeing a dermotologist and hormone specialist, and spent lots of money on all kinds of expensive products.  Their skin now looks really nice and smooth and soft, so I asked what they were doing.  They recommended I first try a Retinol product, so I purchased this one because I couldn&#x27;t afford the one they used, and the price for this was reasonable.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and there is definitely a real difference in my skin tone and texture.  It&#x27;s much smoother and softer, and the old sunburn blotches have evened out.  It is also gentle on my skin which is good because I was afraid I&#x27;d be walking around with a red face, but I didn&#x27;t.  The seller also provided a pamphlet with helpful information, so I didn&#x27;t feel like I was just \\&quot;winging\\&quot; it, instead, I learned a lot and it was very helpful.  I just ordered one of their moisturizers and am looking forward to trying it out.  I feel much more confident about my appearance since using this product and I&#x27;m very happy the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using this product morning and night and have seen a great difference in the evenness and brightness of my skin. Also, there is no irritation at all which is wonderful. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin tone.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of Retinol products out there.  I&#x27;m getting excellent results with this 1% Retinol Serum with Vitamin C from Sublime Beauty.  I have been using it for about 4 weeks now.  The used it just 3 times a week the first 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 5 times a week since.  I spread a light layer of serum over my entire face twice a week, and concentrate on my problem areas the other days.  I do get a little flaking but I expect that.  It means the skins cells are turning over and sloughing off.  This is a good thing.  My skin is not irritated or red.  I just make sure to moisturize well the next day and wear sunscreen EVERY day.  My smile lines have really improved and the same with the lines below my eyes above the cheekbone area.  My skin is smoother and healthier looking too.  This serum is fragrance free and spreads easily.  So a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m loving what I see.  I received this product to test in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> The Retinol Serum with Vitamin C is a great product for controlling my acne.  It has a gentle exfoliating effect that gets rid of dead and damaged skin cells so my blemishes heal much quicker.  It shrinks my pores and gives me a more youthful look without irritating my sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t notice my crowsfeet and smile lines as much.  I use it about 3 days a week in combination with other Sublime Beauty Serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ordering I was emailed a 6 page report on the benefits of a retinol serum.  I  knew it was good for lines and wrinkles, but I also learned other things.  It stimulates cell turnover, boosts collegen production, helps treat acne, evens skin tone, stimulates blood cells, and benefits several skin disorders.  Though I received this product in exchange for an honest review, I will definitely keep it in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Love! Helps moisturize my extremely dry skin at night and I think that&#x27;s helping the finer wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I use this before I put on the Face Whisperer Night Cream, and it seems these two products are a dream team.  My skin feels refreshed and nourished when I wake in the morning.  Definitely going to become a consistent regiment for me now!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. it is lightweight &amp; non greasy. absorbs nicely. non scented. i use it mainly to help reduce my pore size &amp; it works great!  my pores are not as clogged up. have used this product for about 6 months. have gotten compliments for having a great complection</li>
    <li> Very nice serum, quick absorb, smooth skin, the only thing is the bottle size is big, but the amount is only 0.5 OZ compare to 1OZ other brand product.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t do well with any retinol products as they irritate my sensitive skin but this product and I got along real well. I didn&#x27;t get the redness and burning that I normally experience. I am looking forward to continual use of the Retinol Serum by Sublime Beauty.</li>
    <li> USED 2 BOTTLES AN SEE NO DIFFERENCE WITH MY FACE SKIN&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY&lt;br /&gt;BOOTS LOTION ROCKS AND PUTS THIS TO SHAME</li>
    <li> Sublime Beauty really has some amazing products!! I&#x27;ve tried several of their products when I was fortunate enough to get in on a promotional price. In my opinion,this Retinol serum is by far, the best on the market.My skin is already more firm to the touch,and much smoother. It goes on very silky and has a pleasant smell. It really makes your skin regenerate quickly. I followed the instructions and only used it every other day for the first week. By doing this, I avoided any peeling and flaking that can occur if you introduce this onto your skin too quickly. My pores appear to have shrunk and they are cleaner. My skin also has a bit of a glow to it! I haven&#x27;t had that in years, as I just turned 40 a month ago.  If you are looking to try a retinol cream, this is the one to choose, you will not be disappointed! Thank you for reading my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This is the third time i have purchased this. they are high quality too.&lt;br /&gt;Love them!</li>
    <li> I am a 50 yr. old man who likes to look good.I tried the retinol serum a few months ago and love it.I had a little problem on my second order and Kathy was very helpful,thanks,I am a customer 4 life...</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product - trying something else and well decide going forward.</li>
    <li> I had tried some anti-wrinkle serum a few months ago from another company and it worked well for my face. I thought i&#x27;d try this retinol serum from Sublime Beauty to see how they compare.&lt;br /&gt;The serum bottle was inside a very cute mesh bag, i squeeze about a blueberry sized amount and massage it in to the back of each hand.&lt;br /&gt;A blueberry sized amount is also sufficient to cover my forearms.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs well, not greasy, not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;My friend and her kids even joined in and we all tried it out on our hands , faces and arms.&lt;br /&gt;If you are highly sensitive to fragrances and scents, i would recommend you use this for your hands and arms and try&lt;br /&gt;Sublime Beauty&#x27;s other product, perhaps the one with hyaluronic acid for your face instead if you find the scent in this serum to be too strong for for face.</li>
    <li> All of the Sublime beauty products are wonderful.  I plan on continuing to use them all, I would recommend them to anyone who wants beautiful skin, soft and wrinkle free...</li>
    <li> It has really helped with tone and texture of my skin. It is a necessary staple of skin care and I Will reorder it again .</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin.  I&#x27;ve been trying different product but haven&#x27;t seen any good result.  This product didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin as well.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I have never bought stuff like this before. I can&#x27;t even explain what made me try it. But I&#x27;m really glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and my skin feels so much smoother and softer, and I think it really has made my skin look younger. I&#x27;m not obsessed about this kind of stuff, I&#x27;m a Vermont girl and I just want to enjoy my life... but I like to feel good about my looks too. Somehow I love wearing my boots and torn sweater, but I still want to look good doing it. I really like this secret little bottle of -- well, whatever it is -- self-care. Thanks, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised to discover that after 4 weeks of using this product my skin does in fact look better, softer and the wrinkles around my eyes aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable. This cream was easily absorbed. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it makes my face very smooth and has helped to fade dark spots.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use serums because I have always found them to leave a sticky residue on my skin.  However I received a small sample of this serum as a gift.  I gave it a try and noticed immediately that it wasn&#x27;t sticky nor did it leave any kind of residue on my skin.  I use a tiny bit of serum around my eyes and mouth, let it \\&quot;soak in\\&quot; and apply the Face Whisperer Day Cream.  That&#x27;s it, my daily routine.  I&#x27;ve used these products now for over a month. I am over 60 and the years certainly show on my face.  These products do eliminate the finer lines and seem to soften the deeper lines. Nothing is going to totally erase the signs of aging, other than risky surgery, which I am not about to subject myself to.  I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and in answer to a previous comment, I just want to make it clear, I am not affiliated with the makers of Sublime Beauty, I HAVE purchased these products from Amazon.  My reviews are always truthful and express my own opinions.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product enough to know results. So far the cream feels good on ones face,  Use it at night</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and did not have any problems at all with this retinol serum.  I noticed that my skin feels tight and toned immediately after application, and after using for a couple of weeks there is a definite improvement in my skin.  It is softer and smoother and also looks brighter.  I have used all of the top name brands, and this is right up there with the best of them.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so far 4 bottles and have not seen any effect.!!! I would not recommend it.!!! save your money!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me wonder who is retinol at once not 10% but 1%. this itself should give occasion to think about this seller. See please the answers of questions.&lt;br /&gt;I feel ashed!!! These positive reviews seems to be fake.</li>
    <li> Noticed some initial drying and found out this is perfectly normal for the retinol treatments.  Now the skin on my neck and face seems to be smoother.  Will reorder and see if my skin continues to improve.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but it only lasted a week and is way to expensive for that and saw no results in that time of course. I have dry aging skin and it took a lot to cover and just didnt last-</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I always have taken care of my skin, so I didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference using this. I would not spend the money on this again. I think I could fine something else for less money to work as good. Shipping was on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I want to first say that I am 49 years old, normal/dry and sensitive skin.  I have now used the following products by Sublime Beauty for a little over a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen Serum&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic serum&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Face Whisperer® Neck &amp; Decollete&lt;br /&gt;Nourishing cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Serum&lt;br /&gt; Face Whisperer® Day Cream with Argireline&lt;br /&gt; Face Whisperer® Night Cream with Matrixyl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that the results have been nothing short of wonderful.  My skin is smoother and laugh lines less defined.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t take away lines and wrinkles completely, but my wrinkles under my eyes are less noticeable.  Another biggie for me is that my neck looks younger.  I have tried many lines and this is the first one that I have been pleased with every product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 year old and finally decided to do some research in order to provide better skin care for my face. I&#x27;ve read a lot of doctor&#x27;s reports and found Sublime Beauty line. I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I started using Sublime Beauty product a couple of weeks ago. I can tell that Retinol Serum is definitely working. It&#x27;s like a mini facelift! I&#x27;m using it every day and it&#x27;s non-irritating and very gentle. And it feels good! I also received a few samples of Collagen Peptide Serum and Face Whisperer Night Cream as a gift ... and I LOVED IT!! So far this 3 products are my favorite! I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and you will be too!</li>
    <li> Bought the retinol serum and collagen serum.  Have been using both products for a few months now and see no difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since Christmas and can already notice a difference in the lines that had started under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a couple of weeks with some other sublime beauty products and I can really tell a difference in my complexion. Blackheads clearing up and wrinkles seem to be fading. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and have already seen some good things.  Usually at this time of year I have a drab pallor to my skin without my tan.  Now with the serum and cream, I notice a cleaner, glowing skin and look forward to all the good results promised by using it longer.  Can&#x27;t say enough about Sublime Beauty cusomer service too.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this for me, not my wife. I figured, why not I&#x27;ve got wrinkles as well. What&#x27;s the big deal putting on some cream once or twice I day, I&#x27;m man enough to do it. The cream feels nice going on, not oily, not messy but just right. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Retinol and that&#x27;s why I ordered this product. I think it&#x27;s helping somewhat, although we all see ourselves differently than how others see us. Is it really helping, who knows, but even with these wrinkles, how much better looking can a guy like me get? When the ladies start chasing me and my wife asks me to discontinue use of the product for good, then I&#x27;ll know for sure.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago because a friend recommended it to me. I am so glad that she told me about it because in this short time I can truly feel and see a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny as I write this review I keep thinking of the old commercial that said \\&quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Home Without It\\&quot; because I will not go without this ever again.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and hope you do as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love retinol and this product has other natural ingredients that make my fine lines and wrinkles just disappear. I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect this serum to erase any fine lines.  I don&#x27;t have any. Mine are all deep wrinkles. After all I will never see age 69 again.&lt;br /&gt;So, why did I buy it? Because, fine lines aren&#x27;t the only thing it is good for.It was not advertised this way, but I have used a similar lotion before, and found it to be wonderful for my skin in general. Like the ad says, it is a renewal process. I chose this one from Sublime Beauty because of all the extra vitamins. And Im so glad I did.  It is much better than the one I had before, and actually a couple dollars less.&lt;br /&gt;As far as my results, my skin feels so much better. It is supple, soft, and has a nice healthy glow. No more of that grayish look I was getting. I love it.  You will,too.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I noticed that my skin was more radiant.  I plan to buy another and keep using it.  Some dark, sun spots did lessen in the month that I used the product. Recommend giving it a shot.</li>
    <li> Great product! Would recommend all of these products. Better than other high end products. I was able to get information on all the products in this line.</li>
    <li> Skin products with retinol are the best you can get for fighting fine lines and wrinkling. But they are more expensive or need a prescription.  This serum is economical but is probably equal I&#x27;m quality as far as I can tell on my skin to Oil of a Olay treatment products which are similarly priced. A matter of preference.</li>
    <li> Good product and will suggest my friend to buy it!!</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time.  It was packaged securely; however, I can&#x27;t really evaluate the serum, since I have used it only for a few days.  It is pleasant with a nice texture, is easily absorbed.</li>
    <li> LOVING this product!  it&#x27;s really good stuff!  my skin looks amazing!</li>
    <li> Returned this product because it doesn&#x27;t reveal the possible side effects, one of which was peeling skin.  Gross!  This product is suppose to help your skin, not make it worse.</li>
    <li> It seems nowadays manufacturer&#x27;s use pump bottles that are not very user friendly.  What i mean by that, it is not very easy to pump out a very small amount, and you end up with too much on your finger.&lt;br /&gt;At the cost of some products this is a frustrating feature on the pump type bottles.</li>
    <li> Sublime makes the best skincare products! I was so excited to try this product and give my opinion on it because I love every product I have ever tried by Sublime and this one is no exception.  My dermatologist told me that I should definitely be using a retinol serum because it helps reduce my fine lines and wrinkles AND helps with skin renewal.  I&#x27;m not getting any younger but my skin doesn&#x27;t have to show my age!  That is why I love these products!  This one in particular has really helped with my large pores and helped soften out some rough areas that I have around my chin area.  It is helping with the fine lines around my eyes and some other rough areas I have from acne scarring.  The retinol offers the exfoliation that I need without being harsh.  The Vitamin C helps repair any damage that I have.  I really like the way the serum feels on my skin.  It isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave any icky residue.  I love skincare products and honestly, this is a must have!  If you are searching for a retinol serum, this is the best of the best.  Sublime makes top quality products and I highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> I use this about every othernight and I love it, I make sure to use a good moisturizer over the top.</li>
    <li> Fine lines have disappeared, skin feels and looks smoother. I will be reordering this product. It&#x27;s nice to smile and not see as many lines. Great product.</li>
    <li> She doesn&#x27;t say much...she just stands in front of the mirror applying this stuff. After days of witnessing this ritual I had to see what was causing her to walk out of the bathroom looking like an angel... One night after she fell asleep, I had to sneak into her side of the bathroom to see what it was. Voilá!! This bottle struck me as something new and special. So I did what guys do... I read the label... Then I proceeded to apply some myself... Before my finger reached my face \\&quot;the angel\\&quot; walked up behind me, took the bottle from my hands and said: \\&quot;Get your own!!\\&quot; So I did... can&#x27;t wait to see my \\&quot;aura\\&quot; start to show  :-)  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Retinol Serum for a couple months now and absolutely LOVE it! I can definitely see a difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> i received a few samples of Sublime Beauty&#x27;s Retinol Serum to try and really was amazed at the results. i&#x27;m 43, Asian and haven&#x27;t taken very good care of my skin when i was younger. i have a lot of sun spots and uneven skin due to sun exposure but ever since using the Retiniol Serum, my skin has improved dramatically. i&#x27;m impressed with how gentle the product is on the skin while still doing its job. even with a lot of previous skin damage, this product really helped me turn it around and give me a more glowing and younger looking skin. i&#x27;m looking forward to trying out their other products as well!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, goes on silky and leaves my skin feeling smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and already see the fine lines are less noticeable.  The best anti-wrinkle serum I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The Retinol serum is very light and doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry out and peel as a lot of other Retinol products do. It seems to have helped with my wrinkles and slightly lightened my dark spots. The only problem I have is with the pump on the bottle. It&#x27;s not very smooth and pumps out a lot more than I need.</li>
    <li> Delivery was very quick.  I have used Retinol for years, but thought I&#x27;d try this because it has twice as much Retinol as most other retinol products.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Also, Kathy Heshelow went above and beyond checking on delivery of my order to find out if it was delivered on time . . . and it was.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Awesome Retinol serum!! How cool is that to find a great night cream that contains 1% Retinal and vital Vitamin C at 5%. My skin feels so refreshed after using it for the first time!! . I cant wait to see how it looks after a week of its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like having your skin feel like a newborn baby!!! That&#x27;s happened a after every use of this great serum. The packaging nice and the products are one of a kind!!!&lt;br /&gt;Retinol rejuvenates the skin. This vitamin A derivative helps skin produce collagen, a natural component of the dermis that gives skin its youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol gives skin an overall healthier appearance. Retinol can help reduce discoloration, fine lines, wrinkles and skin texture. Plus, it can improve skin tone and color for generally younger-looking, even skin.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol stimulates cell turnover. Exfoliating is essential for youthful-looking, healthy skin. By removing dead skin cells, new, healthier cells are able to come through. Your complexion also looks smoother and products are able to sink deep into the skin. This way, your skin can effectively absorb potent ingredients. With a pile of dead skin cells on your face, products have a tough time penetrating this top layer and can&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol addresses acne. While retinol works to reduce telltale signs of aging, it also treats \\&quot;acne-ridden skin,\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is less irritating than retinoids. Also a vitamin A derivative, retinoids are only available by prescription from your dermatologist. Though they&#x27;re more potent than their over-the-counter counterparts, retinoids are also more irritating to the skin with potential side effects like peeling and redness. Retinol is gentler because it gradually converts to retinoic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I love this line!  While I don&#x27;t notice a huge improvement, it&#x27;s a good adjunct to my regimen.</li>
    <li> I have heard a lot about retinol, but haven&#x27;t use it before. I can only say....it lives up to its name......my skin feels smoother, skin tone is more even, firmer, with increased elasticity. I always applied moisturizer after the retinol serum and didn&#x27;t experience any problems or dryness when started using the serum at night, will continue diligently using the serum every night, and I&#x27;m a firm believer my skin aperiane will improve even more.</li>
    <li> I was given a couple of sample pots and I really love this serum. My skin feels so soft and smooth and definitely has a lovely glow now. My little crows feet around my eyes look fainter too. Some retinol creams I&#x27;ve tried have made my skin feel like it was burning after I applied it but this one didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I will most definitely be a regular customer of Sublime from now on.</li>
    <li> Reduce some fine winkles around the eyes, but on the deeper wrinkles have not seen much improvement. Goes on smoothly and leaves you face feeling silky. I will purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using this product. My skin feels must softer, a silky feel. I have not been using this for very long but feel that there is a noticable improvement to my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This serum is really nice and has made a big difference in my skin.  Wrinkles seem to be non-existent now and just soaks and absorbs everywhere I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the Face Whisperer Neck and Decollete cream too.  They are fabulous products!!</li>
    <li> Everything that Sublime puts out there.  I buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent serum that does what it says it does.  My goal is to have everything Sublime makes because I can trust it.  My skin looks radiant and people are starting to notice and ask me questions.  Thanks Sublime.  Keep up the great work and change nothing. Waiting for new products to come out so I can try.</li>
