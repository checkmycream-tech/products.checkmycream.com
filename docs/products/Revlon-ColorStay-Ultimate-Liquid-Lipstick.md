### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best color yet!  </li>
      <li>I think it works best with a even medium admit, if you like just a touch of  lipstick</li>
      <li>Great product and excellent service.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Love the color and especially love the fact that when I brush my teeth before bed it is still staining my lips.  </li>
      <li>I love this Revlon Colorstay product the best.  </li>
      <li>Color is way too bright.  </li>
      <li>I loved the color and the ease of application.  </li>
      <li>Good color.  </li>
      <li>I am a brunette with fair skin.</li>
      <li>Really nice color.  </li>
      <li>Nice neutral color.  </li>
      <li>The color is the same as shown, the coral is the best coral out there, been using this  lipstick for years, it lasts more than 12 hours, I use lip liner color stay lip liner and then put this on, use the top to line also to get a great lip shape.</li>
      <li>This might be better for someone very fair or that wants just a hint of color; it is a dad bit light for me.</li>
      <li>so I am glad I found a resource to order it.</li>
      <li>I like to put a gloss on top of it.</li>
      <li>love this lipstick thank you</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I need to layer it with a more nude shade.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but I did have to say that it stayed on longer than most lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m blonde with fair skin and this color just brightens up my face!  </li>
      <li>Goes on easy, stays all day.  </li>
      <li>Also I find it so easy to use easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>but I think a gloss would make a huge difference.</li>
      <li>It is one tube that colors the lips and best of all really does last all day and night !</li>
      <li>I originally started wearing it because my son didn&#x27;t want a mommy kiss because he doesn&#x27;t like lipstick on him.  </li>
      <li>I would have liked it better if it had stayed on as long as Revlon&#x27;s lip stain</li>
      <li>I always have liked  ColorStay UIltimate lipstick since discovering it years ago because it is the only kind I have found that actually stays on practically all day.</li>
      <li>One thing is it&#x27;s a bit sticky right after you put it on but don&#x27;t let that deter you - it dries and then it lasts all day through meals, etc.  </li>
      <li>It dries out on me right away</li>
      <li>Stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out - and I love the color!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice coral that&#x27;s not too orange or too pink.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Love the extra moisture in winter.</li>
      <li>I get the long lasting, great color, I don&#x27;t have to keep putting lip stick on</li>
      <li>Stays on forever but very drying.</li>
      <li>Thanks for offering this color, 060.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>and I really like it better than any other.  </li>
      <li>Have layered with other colors and used when I just want a hint of peachy, light color.</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t find this product any different than any other lip stain, I do love this color.</li>
      <li>The colors are deep and pretty</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it because it lasts long!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin too and this product works.</li>
      <li>, IT IS NOT LIKE OTHER LONG LASTING, IT&#x27;S BETTER</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who likes this color and wants a long lasting lip gloss!</li>
      <li>It really lasts all day long even through meals!</li>
      <li>Cause while setting the hot will mess with it.</li>
      <li>Feels a little sticky when first applied, but that soon dries and goes away.  </li>

<li> Feels a little sticky when first applied, but that soon dries and goes away.  </li>
<li> Long lasting.</li>
<li> Give time to dry, wait at least 30 minutes before you drink something hot..</li>
<li> Your lips may get a tad dry, but it is a trade off with long lasting lipstick!</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t rub off on things and lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> And you don&#x27;t have to do a two step application like other long lasting lip glosses.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried the other renditions of Colorstay lipsticks and this is the only one that truly does what it says and without drying my lips.  </li>
<li> Stays on for a LONG time!  </li>
<li> I like that because liquid lipsticks usually dry matte.</li>
<li> and I end up borrowing gloss from one of my other sticks.  </li>
<li> It is hard to find locally</li>
<li> Not as dark as i thought</li>
<li> Hands down</li>
<li> It has a slight gloss/shimmer finish after it dries.</li>
<li> I will also dab a little on my cheeks instead of blush.  </li>
<li> This item is very hard to find locally.  </li>
<li> Clumpy and dried out.  </li>
<li> Not loving it.  </li>
<li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t have a really weird taste like others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
<li> Not able to use ..... ordered two colors and both were horrible.  </li>

    <li> Stays on all day, but leaves a residue you&#x27;ll need to remove with cleaning cream.</li>
    <li> I loved the color and the ease of application.  I would have liked it better if it had stayed on as long as Revlon&#x27;s lip stain but I did have to say that it stayed on longer than most lipsticks.</li>

    <li> While I don&#x27;t find this product any different than any other lip stain, I do love this color. It&#x27;s a nice coral that&#x27;s not too orange or too pink. Have placed on automatic delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Doesn&#x27;t rub off on things and lasts a long time.  I originally started wearing it because my son didn&#x27;t want a mommy kiss because he doesn&#x27;t like lipstick on him.  After this dries, it doesn&#x27;t rub off.  One of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lip color for some time and I really like it better than any other.  I don&#x27;t need gloss and it stays put.  I will also dab a little on my cheeks instead of blush.  It really lasts all day long even through meals!</li>

    <li> I use this every day.  I&#x27;m blonde with fair skin and this color just brightens up my face!  Without it I look like a ghost!  Also I find it so easy to use easy to apply.  One thing is it&#x27;s a bit sticky right after you put it on but don&#x27;t let that deter you - it dries and then it lasts all day through meals, etc.  And you don&#x27;t have to do a two step application like other long lasting lip glosses.

    <li> Not as dark as i thought but i still like it.</li>
    <li> Love the color and especially love the fact that when I brush my teeth before bed it is still staining my lips.  Feels a little sticky when first applied, but that soon dries and goes away.  I like to put a gloss on top of it.</li>
    <li> Clumpy and dried out.  Not able to use ..... ordered two colors and both were horrible.  Revlon will not replace.</li>
    <li> Stays on forever but very drying.</li>
    <li> I always have liked  ColorStay UIltimate lipstick since discovering it years ago because it is the only kind I have found that actually stays on practically all day.</li>
    <li> Long lasting. After it dries it&#x27;s a bit sticky on your lips but it&#x27;s worth it because it lasts long! It has a slight gloss/shimmer finish after it dries. I like that because liquid lipsticks usually dry matte. You also get alot of product for the cost.</li>
    <li> Color is way too bright.  I need to layer it with a more nude shade.</li>
    <li> Stays on for a LONG time!  Nice neutral color.  Your lips may get a tad dry, but it is a trade off with long lasting lipstick!</li>
    <li> Stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out - and I love the color!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  This item is very hard to find locally.  Thanks for offering this color, 060.[[ASIN:B000RPKX5A Revlon Colorstay Overtime Sheer Lipcolor - Sheer Blush, 1 Ea]]</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent service. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this lipstick. I put in on in the morning before work and when I get home it is still on! It is hard to find locally so I am glad I found a resource to order it.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT THAT THEY SENT WAS OPENED AND USED!!! THE PACKAGE WAS SMEARED.  I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW THEY HAD THE NERVE TO SEND IT OUT.</li>
    <li> Good color.  Stays on!</li>
    <li> This is the only lipstick I use now.  It lasts during a meal and I get lots of comments on the colors and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t fade during a meal.</li>
    <li> Really nice color.  Love the extra moisture in winter.</li>
    <li> The color is the same as shown, the coral is the best coral out there, been using this  lipstick for years, it lasts more than 12 hours, I use lip liner color stay lip liner and then put this on, use the top to line also to get a great lip shape. Give time to dry, wait at least 30 minutes before you drink something hot.. Cause while setting the hot will mess with it. I get the long lasting, great color, I don&#x27;t have to keep putting lip stick on that&#x27;s a plus. I think it works best with a even medium admit, if you like just a touch of  lipstick this is not for you, it starts out sticky but Dru&#x27;s and sets with a shine, I truly won&#x27;t wear anything else, IT IS NOT LIKE OTHER LONG LASTING, IT&#x27;S BETTER</li>
    <li> Best color yet!  I am a brunette with fair skin.</li>
