      <li>Smells amazing and makes my hair feel soft and detangled.</li>
      <li>I have a ton of fine hair, so it gets really tangled and dries out easily.</li>

      <li>Best of all, I love the ethics of this company and am slowly replacing all my products with BWC or similar companies...</li>
      <li>works well, smells fresh</li>
      <li>Ive tried a few kinds of vegan conditioners and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for responsible cruelty-free products, and this qualifies, plus it works better than all the silicone-laden hair products in the drugstores that just look good for a few hours.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves a soft fragrance after your hair has dried.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair clean and very silky soft.</li>
      <li>Using the combo of the shampoo and conditioner for 3 days in a row and my scalp stopped burning/itching and my hair is SUPER soft.  </li>
      <li>texture it creates is very flyaway.</li>
      <li>very badly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>product as described, fast delivery</li>
      <li>I am trying to add in more products with rosemary as it is suppose to help with premature grays, only down side is smell is a bit strong for me.</li>
      <li>have used other cruelty-free conditioners that I like better;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe it works better for other hair textures.  </li>
      <li>It only needs a small amount for shoulder length hair to get great results</li>
      <li>As long as i brush my hair well before getting in the shower i have smooth detangled locks when i get out.</li>
      <li>I am used to buying high end products like Aveda and Paul Mitchell but</li>
      <li>BWC honestly does work as well if not better!</li>
      <li>My 20 year old daughter had just moved in with me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to finally find a vegan cruelty free product that doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like crap.</li>
      <li>(note: my hair type is natural african american 3c to 4a)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this brand and the other scent as well.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve found that other vegan shampoo/conditioner brands make my hair feel rough and dry, but this makes my hair feel wonderfully soft and smells terrific.</li>
<li> Her hair is long.</li>
<li> i got dry scalp</li>
<li> I like to go 3 days between washings and now I have to use alot of dry shampoo if I want to wait 3 days.</li>
<li> other day she was in the shower</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but rosemary is a strong oil alone and the tea does lessen the smell out of the bottle.</li>
<li> And when I say long, I mean to her knees long!</li>
<li> Very thick, but not heavy or greasy.  </li>
<li> however,&lt;br /&gt;I have also used other conditioners that I like much less.</li>
<li> I shopped around and found it for half the price on another site.</li>
<li> I said, don&#x27;t you mean MY conditioner?</li>
<li> It does dissipate well though when you add your styling products, but I am always one for either unscented or really faint smells.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive here on Amazon....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I looked around for over a month for great vegan/vegetarian-friendly hair products. I also wanted it to be affordable, natural, and great to my hair. After using this product for months now, my hair is healthier and softer than it&#x27;s ever been. I recommend BWC to anyone looking for an affordable, vegan, great-smelling hair product. :-) Beauty Without Cruelty is also on PETA&#x27;s list of no-animal-testing/no-animal-ingredients skin and hair care products. Love that. :-)</li>
    <li> This is great conditioner.  It smells great and leaves a soft fragrance after your hair has dried.  My hair feels great after using this product.  Cruelty free, vegan, and wonderful!</li>
    <li> Stearic acid is a toxic product, despite what the FDA states. So is Magnesium Stearate which this doe not contain. FYI. Check your supplements, this crud is many things. Sigh. Don&#x27;t kill the messenger.</li>
    <li> As much as I love what the company is trying to do, my hair is like straw, with one wash, if I use this.  I have curly hair, and this shampoo dries it out very badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture it creates is very flyaway. It also doesn&#x27;t leave hair clean--it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s coated with something crunchy.  (So I don&#x27;t think a conditioner would help much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works better for other hair textures.  The two stars are for good intent.</li>
    <li> I am a true product junkie and own a lot of conditioners. This one does well for me (note: my hair type is natural african american 3c to 4a) I am trying to add in more products with rosemary as it is suppose to help with premature grays, only down side is smell is a bit strong for me. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but rosemary is a strong oil alone and the tea does lessen the smell out of the bottle. It does dissipate well though when you add your styling products, but I am always one for either unscented or really faint smells. It has a good consistency not too think or runny.

    <li> Love that these products are cruelty free!</li>
    <li> A very good product which I use religiously and with the Shampoo as well. Keeps my hair clean and very silky soft. Highly recommend this brand and the other scent as well. The shampoo is great also. Smells great!</li>
    <li> Bought this on another site but wanted to put a review here.  This is the BEST organic, cruelty free shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands.  I bought the shampoo and the conditioner hoping to ease an itchy scalp.  I knew that tea tree oil helps the itchies and that rosemary is good for the scalp and hair.  Using the combo of the shampoo and conditioner for 3 days in a row and my scalp stopped burning/itching and my hair is SUPER soft.  No frizzies in the North Carolina Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great.  It only needs a small amount for shoulder length hair to get great results so a 16 ounce bottle lasts a good, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all it&#x27;s cruelty free!!  It&#x27;s expensive here on Amazon....I shopped around and found it for half the price on another site.</li>
    <li> i got dry scalp so anything i buy helps this stuff is good</li>

    <li> Love this product. Works great &amp; smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Ive tried a few kinds of vegan conditioners and this is by far the best. I have a ton of fine hair, so it gets really tangled and dries out easily. As long as i brush my hair well before getting in the shower i have smooth detangled locks when i get out. Keep it up bwc!</li>
    <li> I bought this because i wanted to clean my home of all chemicals. My 20 year old daughter had just moved in with me. She had all her fancy shampoos and conditioners but tried this and never went back. Her hair is long. And when I say long, I mean to her knees long! (My hair is mid-back length)&lt;br /&gt;The other day she was in the shower and she said, Mom, I am almost out of conditioner! I said, don&#x27;t you mean MY conditioner? She said, yeah, can you order more?? lol&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and your hair feels healthier and softer every day you used it. My only complaint is that when I use the shampoo every day, my hair gets oily really fast. I like to go 3 days between washings and now I have to use alot of dry shampoo if I want to wait 3 days.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for a year now and won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, smells fresh and I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free an consist of natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> Accompanied with Rosemary Mint Tea Tree BWC Shampoo it keeps my hair clean and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair conditioner.  I would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other cruelty-free conditioners that I like better; however,&lt;br /&gt;I have also used other conditioners that I like much less.</li>
