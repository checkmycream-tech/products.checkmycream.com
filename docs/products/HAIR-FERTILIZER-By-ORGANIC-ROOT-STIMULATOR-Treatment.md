<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am just now using this product for the first time. Will come back after a few weeks for review.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes my hair feel; soft, smooth and very moisturized. My hair is relaxed, colored, and bleach, so it&#x27;s difficult to retain moisture. With this product, it looks healthy and feels great.</li>
    <li> I wanted to really like this product but when i put it in my air and washed it off, my hair just felt really oily and gross. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m applying it wrong or leaving it in for too long (like 20 minutes) but I guess ill give it another try.</li>
    <li> The name itself is very attractive. Not the fertilizer part. Well, that brings images of plant manure and what not. But believe me, &#x60;this fertilizer&#x27; smells good and has a cream colored mayonnaise-like texture. The tub says to apply it daily. But I chose to apply it thrice a week. I do other hair-care DIYs too. So I really don&#x27;t want to overwhelm my hair with daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very thick and at first I feared applying it would be tough. However, the product is absorbed by the hair pretty fast and I like that. It does not leave the hair greasy, which is a huge plus. I usually brush my hair first and make sure it&#x27;s untangled. Then I scoop the product out, apply on the scalp and then brush again so that it&#x27;s evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is formulated to be applied on the hair and washed off after some time. But nothing is mentioned about it in the directions. So I chose to apply it in the night and wash off in the morning. As it&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s totally ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the second week of using it, I felt a really good difference. My hair has a beautiful shine and it&#x27;s softer now.</li>
    <li> I use this product. It works well with your hair. It gives you a natural shine and softness.Believe me it really works. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months and I tell you I love it. Please try they also have the other one for hair breakage. You it to seal and moisturize your hair for best results. Try them all.[[ASIN:B004X8HB7A Organic R/s Root Stimulator Hair Fertilizer, 6 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;http://astore.amazon.com/powebycond-20/detail/B004X8HB7A</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product about a week ago.  I have used the Olive Oil conditioning cream which works wonders on the ends of your hair but was constantly having to add it for constant moisture on the scalp.  This one, though not heavy at all, provides lasting moisture once applied to the scalp and brushed through.  No more popping and breaking of new growth when combing through my hair.  I love it.  My curls last and everything.  No weighted down feeling but lasting moisture which really helped the manageability of my hair.  I have relaxed, colored hair which is currently not in the best condition.  I will continue to use this as I believe it will also aid in the growth of my hair and the managing of my new growth in between relaxers.  Seems that this would be really good for anyone trying to transition from relaxed to natural.  I&#x27;m seriously thinking about it.</li>
    <li> I used the whole container and saw no results. Read reviews before making the purchase and decided to give it a try!! It didnt help my hair nor did it moisturize my hair! I dont want to make it sound horrible, but it didnt work for me so I wont buy again!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this before reading the reviews, after doing some research I see some people are losing hair :( I don&#x27;t want to take the risk. Probably will find a home in my hair products bin and stay there.</li>
    <li> I use the product in order to moisturise my hair (not my edges or my scalp)and it works great .&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the smell but Everytime my head feels dry ;&lt;br /&gt;It does a very good job and I appreciate This products .</li>
    <li> This product adds so much hydration and nourishment to the hair and scalp. Only a very small amount is needed. I think those that have build up used too much  for their hair type. I can see that possibility with using too much, and it&#x27;s easy to use a heavier hand. This is not a \\&quot;more is better\\&quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my relaxed and thicker hair, I do my entire scalp with less than a dime size amount. Natural textured hair may need a touch more. Very thick hair may need more.  You may experiment with the right amount for your needs.  It&#x27;s applied directly to the scalp.  After applying it needs to be gently massaged into the scalp. The product works itself into the hair, so there&#x27;s no need to apply it directly to the hair. The consistency is lightweight and creamy.  This is not an oil or pomade.  I use twice a week and have never experienced any flaking or dullness. My hair is growing nicely, healthy and has a rich sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My hair was cut \\&quot;buzz short\\&quot;. Since Christmas, it&#x27;s grown 4\\&quot;.  I \\&quot;dust\\&quot; my ends every 2 months.  If taking good care of hair and it still looks dull, it&#x27;s possible the ends need to be clipped. Too many split ends makes hair look dull. This fertilizer adds to beauty and health of new growth, and it can help prevent ends from splitting up the entire hair shaft, but once split, the ends are damaged. They can be treated, but not repaired back to normal. A regular trim or dusting is a good ideal. Actually, if rest of hair is looking well nourished and healthy, those rough ends really stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product is great for  most people with  relaxed, natural and transitioning hair. It&#x27;s good for  stretching relaxers, because it works so well on both hair textures.  There are, good for the hair, herbs infused in the Fertilizer. While ORS doesn&#x27;t claim this is a \\&quot;hair grow\\&quot; product, they do say using this product provides the right environment for the scalp, and the protection the hair needs to experience growth and maintain healthy hair. I believe it.  This may be a wonderful addition to the hair care of anyone on a hair journey, or anyone that just wants to maintain the beauty and health of their hair. Using on a regular basis, I think most will be quite pleased with the results.  The smell is very light and pleasant.  I highly recommend.ealthy hair. I believe it.

    <li> this is not only a great moisturizer. It appears to be a great strengthener for my daughter. My daughter is eight and I&#x27;ve been using this on her hair since she was about 4 years old.</li>
    <li> este producto ha mejorado mi cuero cabelludo, se detuvo a la sequía. maravilloso.[[ASIN:B004X8HB7A Organic R/s Root Stimulator Hair Fertilizer, 6 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I have been using this product straight for over 2 weeks and I am seeing wonderful results!! I highly rec&#x27;d this product to some one who is looking for a product that is easy to use and that helps with hair growth.</li>
    <li> As an avid fan of Organic Root Stimulator&#x27;s products, this is PERFECT for my natural hair! I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and I love how it lightly moisturizes my hair! It doesn&#x27;t give a \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feeling and the smell is very pleasant. I use this to moisturize my hair first, then seal the cream in with pure castor oil. They both provide a great combination and both work wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> If you want a product that DOES regrow hair, get this product and use it in conjunction with the temple and grow balm, and the scrub shampoo if you really want great results. This product by itself works a little slower, but it leaves your hair really soft and manageable . I love it, but then again I love all Organics products- I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I brought this item from Walmart because I need it a condition for my hair I have 4b hair texture and 4Ahair texture and this work very with my biracia hair texter  it makes my hair feel like silk it also made my hair grow 4inched in 8 weeks of using its amazing</li>
    <li> I like this product, I have been using it about once a month for a year and my hair has filled in and has a lot of body. I have been recommending it because &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34;. Just don&#x27;t expect yo use in once and done. It takes a little time.</li>
    <li> There was an mix up with the qty on this order, however the company made sure all issues was taking care of (fixed) I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this and was happy because it helps my hair roots gets nourishment and also comes out later very shiny. I would recommend this to everybody to use it.</li>
    <li> First of all, the name of the product, \\&quot;Organic\\&quot;, is totally deceiving since it contains parabens, sulfates, urea and propilene glycol - all synthetic ingredients. It also doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.. I was reckless enough to purchase it in the first place just by looking at the name and not reading the ingredients. I gave it a try anyway and it irritated my scalp causing it flaking even more then i had before. won&#x27;t purchase it again and don&#x27;t recommend it for someone who has dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I can live without this product. I tried it based on reviews but it&#x27;s not for me. A bit heavy and it weighs down my hair (even when applied to the scalp). Once it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s a wrap. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this off and on for over five years and it works wonders. I have recently started wearing my hair natural after 20+ years of relaxing. This is the only product that I could put in my hair to detangle it. I put this in my hair,massage it into my scalp for 5 minutes and comb through. Not one snap,crackle,or pop!I have thick coarse hair and this makes my hair soft and manageable.When I use this product I don&#x27;t have to constantly comb my hair and when I do,the comb glides through. Love this Stuff!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 4 months ago after I stopped wearing micro-braids. After taking the braids out, I noticed I lost ALL my hair in the temple area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, not only have my hair grown back in the temple area, but the overall condition of my hair has dramatically change. My hair is heathier, and the texture is smoother. My styles seem to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> this was very good but I don&#x27;t have any left thanks any way</li>
    <li> This makes your hair very greasy and I didn&#x27;t see any difference in softness of your hair it just makes it greasy and everything else is so dry still.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that makes my hair feel moisturized. I have relaxed/demi colored hair, so I put this on right before bed and wrap my hair. When I wake up in the morning my hair feels reaaally soft, even with some of the damage I&#x27;ve gotten over time. This is the only product that has done this for me. It&#x27;s texture feels creamy, not too thick, but not light. Less really is more. I&#x27;ve tried to switch to another product, but it just makes my hair frizzy. Hair fertilizer makes my hair feel soooo manageable! I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/17/14: I wanted to add that I stopped using this as I&#x27;ve transitioned to natural hair. It doesn&#x27;t work as nicely as when my hair was relaxed. So I still recommend this, but for people with relaxed hair. The product I mentioned before that once made my hair frizzy now works better for my natural hair. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  Don&#x27;t think I would recommend it.  I have only used it a few times but don&#x27;t think I would buy it again</li>
    <li> After 4 years of successfully growing my hair natural, I used this product and it took MY HAIR OUT. The makers want even believe it! Oh my god. I cried like a baby.... COURT...definitely!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and greasy, so use it sparingly.  I used it daily and really didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all.</li>
    <li> my hair seems fuller and my scalp feels less tight after dyeing my hair with the use of the the hair fertilizer.</li>
    <li> Her HIAR STARTED BURNING AND FELL OUT IN SPOTS FOR MORE THEN ONE DAY EVEN AFTER SHE WASHED IT&lt;br /&gt;EVERYTIME SHE COMBS THIRE IS ALOT OF HAIR IN THE COMB&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS FAR FROM ORGANIC&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS WAY TO MUCH CHEMICALS&lt;br /&gt;IF U READ ON THE BACK IT SAYS IT MAY CAUSE BURNING AND HAIR LOSS&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A BAD ASSS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY AND HAIR</li>
    <li> Will be returning this item. It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be and the lid was broken and solution was seeping out. I already notified seller, and they agreed to accept it back. Will be returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this stuff from WalMart just to try it out. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair long so I thought this might help. I use ORS all the time and I love their other products. HOWEVER, I swear this stuff is making my hair weaker. Whether my hair is falling out or breaking off, there has never been so much hair in the shower and I comb my hair everyday, so I know this is more than just the usual shedding. There&#x27;s literally a massive amount EVERYDAY. I haven&#x27;t seen any bald spots, but it freaks me out because I&#x27;ve never had this much coming out at once. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product. Didnt have any expertations. But was supriced in &amp;agrave; good way when i tried it. Recomend this product for stronges Hair.</li>
    <li> Just receive my order today... Excited about using it!!</li>
    <li> Great product for my uber dry hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with coconut oil to help grow out my hair and in just one month I have seen a difference! Not only does my hair look longer but it looks so much healthier! :)</li>
    <li> This is a must have for areas of stubborn growth. It has the right ingredients to nourish and feed the scalp. Those suffering from thin edges and nape problems should definitely look into this. I used this product every two weeks, in conjunction with the ORS hair mayo. When I deep conditioned with the mayo I applied hair fertilizer to my scalp after flat ironing. My nape grew in very well. This hair fertilizer wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing so I mixed in some JBCO. Perfect combination.</li>
    <li> This is a great product by organic root stimulator. It really does improve the condition of your hair and aid in its growth.</li>
    <li> Only thing this fertilizer stimulated for me was the money that came out of my wallet to make the purchase. Yet another product I cannot vouch for because I have not used it enough to say yea or nay to it&#x27;s value. I will have to leave the usefulness facts of this product open for someone else to review.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work a little but makes your hair so greasy you cant leave the house!! not really worth it</li>
    <li> didnt do much for my hair</li>
    <li> Worst product. Does not work. My hair has never looked so greesy, and the product does not help hair grow or look better.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff! Such a lovely healthy treat for my hair. Absolutely a must have for everyone!</li>
    <li> This product is light and not greasy but provide your hair just the right amount of moisturizer. Make sure when using this product, you completely rubing into your scalp for the best results.</li>
    <li> This product was very good. The scent is like a minty, fruity mixture, you dont have to put too much of this product onto your scalp, otherwise when you rinse it you will have a greasy look left over. LESS IS MORE when dealing with this product.</li>
    <li> I live in a tropical climate this is great for travel especially if you want to take a longer time before you relax your hair without breakage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on as a scalp mask along with coconut oil..Not really sure if it makes my hair grow faster but combined with the coconut oil it really leaves my hair feeling nourished.</li>
    <li> Best hair fertilizer out for a great adorable price! If you use it right it will, work regadless of your hair type . Always Use while your hair is wet not dry or it will become greasy. Massage to the scalp or problem area for best results please use while hair is wet or damp. I&#x27;m biracial and my hair ir dry amd brittle this leave it my hair healthy and long looking while restoring its strength and length! I had a receding hair line from wearing a ponytail now I have hair growth in that area so excited ! Ordering another bottle for myslef and other family members</li>
    <li> I love this product it works for me. Make my hair grow in thick and strong. I use it everyday. It really soothes the scalp.</li>
