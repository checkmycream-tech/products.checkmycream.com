    <li> Great product. Works really well.</li>

    <li> Works good as long as you have a Brazilian.  the new hairs that have grown out in 2 and a half months are curly and frizzy.  I have an appointment at the 3 month mark but it does not help frizzes in between.  Love the fresh scent in between washes.  You cannot beat the price on amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product my wife loves it.</li>

    <li> Fixes my 50year old unmanageable dry hair and makes it smooth and healthy looking all day.  More is not better... I use a dime size amount for median length hair.. a tube last me about a year.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price.</li>
    <li> Love this. The only product that gets rid of the frizzes. Hair looks great. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
