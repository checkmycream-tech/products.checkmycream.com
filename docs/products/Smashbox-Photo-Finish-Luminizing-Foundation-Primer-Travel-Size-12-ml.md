<ol>
      <li>to travel and product size seemed perfect.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product!!!</li>
      <li>Best stuff I put on my face!</li>
      <li>and it does beautifully on mine.</li>
      <li>In fact, it&#x27;s beautiful and glowing that way.</li>
      <li>It does give skin a beautiful glow, but there is no color so you do not need to worry about your skin tone.  </li>
      <li>It creates a beautiful glow and smoothes the skin very nicely.</li>
      <li>Glides on effortlessly, looks great alone or under makeup.</li>
      <li>Best of its kind.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product!!</li>
      <li>It enhances naturally good looking skin tone.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the most amazing primers I have ever used!  </li>
      <li>Love this product !</li>
      <li>Love this primer!</li>
      <li>It kind of lights you up without the heaviness of foundation.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
      <li>I have not come across any over the counter products yet that provide that kind of coverage.  </li>
      <li>Put a nice finishing powder on top, and be set for the day.</li>
      <li>What I love about the product is velvety</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Primer is good for priming but there isn&#x27;t much of a noticeable glow.</li>
      <li>Definitely a must have, it gives me a beautiful glow just by itself or with makeup on.</li>
      <li>but it is like having a lamp beam light onto your face.</li>
      <li>So, here it was in a three pack of the travel size, perfect for tucking in my travel bags and one to use everyday.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to use alone, as a primer, or on top of regular foundation.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything special or help with my oil.</li>
      <li>I love this primer so much</li>
      <li>The texture is good, the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, and I definitely didn&#x27;t feel like it was caked on.  </li>
      <li>I like the primer, but I will say there isn&#x27;t very much!  </li>
      <li>price is very reasonable!</li>
      <li>and it was worth it,</li>
      <li>Of course, I could not resist, so I opened it right away to try it.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for myself and then used it on my sister who was getting married.</li>
      <li>The extra kick of luminization in this formula makes your skin look healthy and energized.</li>
      <li>i love this product, and its harder to find than ever now</li>
      <li>I was getting ready</li>
      <li>I would say that there are maybe 10-15 applications in the bottle, depending on how much you choose to use.</li>
      <li>If you like the Photo Finish Luminizing Foundation Primer by Smashbox and you&#x27;re often on the run, then you&#x27;ll love the little pint sized, travel container.</li>
      <li>Then again I am a dark skin african american woman, this may work better for medium to light skin tones.</li>
      <li>I live the way it makes your skin look and feel</li>
      <li>This is my new must have product in my skin care regimen in the morning.</li>
      <li>I am tempted to try other Smashbox primers but if and only if they have the same kind of feel.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I echo the others, this product is amazing, need only a small amount for a luminous glow.</li>
      <li>This makeup seems old like it has been lying around for a while.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the subtle glow that this gives without being too bronzer-y.  </li>

<li> Unfortunately stores like Ulta no longer sells and has discontinued this product which this is why I purchased on line and definitely will buy again</li>
<li> I like the product but for the price it was way to small!</li>
<li> I can use it as a primer or as a base if I don&#x27;t want to use foundation!</li>

    <li> I purchased this for myself and then used it on my sister who was getting married. It kind of lights you up without the heaviness of foundation. I put a powder on after it to tone down some of the shimmery-ness. It isn&#x27;t like glitter but it is like having a lamp beam light onto your face. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product ! Unfortunately stores like Ulta no longer sells and has discontinued this product which this is why I purchased on line and definitely will buy again price is very reasonable!</li>
    <li> Best stuff I put on my face! Absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> I wore this primer under my makeup for my beach wedding on Oahu. It creates a beautiful glow and smoothes the skin very nicely.</li>
    <li> For some unknown reason, Smashbox has discontinued this!  I echo the others, this product is amazing, need only a small amount for a luminous glow. Glides on effortlessly, looks great alone or under makeup. Best of its kind.</li>
    <li> I like the product but for the price it was way to small!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!! Definitely a must have, it gives me a beautiful glow just by itself or with makeup on.</li>
    <li> I love this primer so much I often just use it alone.  I get lots of compliments on my complexiion too!</li>
    <li> Love this primer! My skin looks radiant, all day!</li>
    <li> This makeup seems old like it has been lying around for a while.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything special or help with my oil.</li>
    <li> I like the primer, but I will say there isn&#x27;t very much!  I bought this to wear underneath my wedding makeup.  I LOVE the subtle glow that this gives without being too bronzer-y.  The texture is good, the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, and I definitely didn&#x27;t feel like it was caked on.  I definitely got the glow and it was worth it, but I was a little sad that there wasn&#x27;t enough to keep using on a daily basis.  I would say that there are maybe 10-15 applications in the bottle, depending on how much you choose to use.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Sephora took it off the shelves since the summer but hoping they bring it back!</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have loved for it&#x27;s subtle sheen, but a primer that I&#x27;m unable to find in the stores any longer.  So, here it was in a three pack of the travel size, perfect for tucking in my travel bags and one to use everyday.  It&#x27;s nice to use alone, as a primer, or on top of regular foundation.</li>
    <li> I live the way it makes your skin look and feel</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!! I can use it as a primer or as a base if I don&#x27;t want to use foundation! In fact, it&#x27;s beautiful and glowing that way. Put a nice finishing powder on top, and be set for the day. I&#x27;m not sure how it would do on oily skin, as I have dry skin and it does beautifully on mine. Not one tiny line is emphasized either! I would recommend it to my sister as well as my daughter or my daughters in law!</li>
    <li> Primer is good for priming but there isn&#x27;t much of a noticeable glow. Then again I am a dark skin african american woman, this may work better for medium to light skin tones. I rather continue buying the regular photo finish primer.</li>
    <li> If you like the Photo Finish Luminizing Foundation Primer by Smashbox and you&#x27;re often on the run, then you&#x27;ll love the little pint sized, travel container.</li>
    <li> I saw this primer on a clearance shelf at Nordstrom.  I was getting ready to travel and product size seemed perfect.  Of course, I could not resist, so I opened it right away to try it.  This is one of the most amazing primers I have ever used!  Let&#x27;s just say the next day, I went back to the same Nordstrom store and cleared up the remaining clearance stock of this product they had on the shelf. (I know -- I was bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primer itself looks like it has color, but when you apply it, there is none.  It does give skin a beautiful glow, but there is no color so you do not need to worry about your skin tone.  What I love about the product is velvety feel it leaves on the skin.  I have not come across any over the counter products yet that provide that kind of coverage.  So for that reason I am totally sold on this product.  I am tempted to try other Smashbox primers but if and only if they have the same kind of feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason why I like this primer is that it is not heavy so it does not clog my pores.  It enhances naturally good looking skin tone.  Also I have oily combination skin.  After I apply this primer and add highlight on my cheeks or a little bit of powder, my skin no longer shines like a moon by the end of the day in the office.  This is my new must have product in my skin care regimen in the morning.</li>
    <li> i love this product, and its harder to find than ever now</li>
    <li> I have been using this formulation for years now because it stays on all day and makes my makeup stay in place. The extra kick of luminization in this formula makes your skin look healthy and energized.</li>
