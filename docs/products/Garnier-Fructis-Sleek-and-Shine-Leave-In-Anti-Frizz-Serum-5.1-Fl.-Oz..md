      <li>(more so on hands than hair)  </li>
      <li>I run my fingers under my hair to make sure all the strands are treated, then wash my hands to get the product off.  </li>
      <li>and I also used hair vitamins that worked wonders and made it grow :)</li>
      <li>A friend suggested I try Garnier Fructis Anti-Frizz Serum, and I love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love this product too.</li>
      <li>love.</li>
      <li>- Requires more than recommended amount to achieve desired effect  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft, silky, shiny and beautiful, easy to straighten or curl, and it is just amazing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had many friends comment on how great and healthy (!)</li>
      <li>This keeps it smooth and also smell pretty good too.</li>
      <li>I am so glad and happy that I have finally purchased it :).</li>
      <li>it makes my hair look amazing and its super light.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>this brands shampoo and hair conditioner has been my favorite for many years but this serum is really doing nothing as an anti frizzer!</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly, shoulder length, Caucasian hair that tends to get frizzy with humidity.  </li>
      <li>I have fine curly and frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>it is cost friendly, light weight (for those who do not like their hair weighed down) and simply great!</li>
      <li>Pros:  - Cheap (compared to John Freida)  </li>
      <li>and this is great at smoothing it and keeping it from getting so frizzy in this southern weather.</li>
      <li>smooth and seal split ends, by adding a coating on the hair that seals in moisture and also seals OUT moisture.</li>
      <li>When I get done, my hair looks shinning and silky smooth.</li>
      <li>and it is cheap too.</li>
      <li>I have tried some of the cheap anti-frizz creams, sprays etc.</li>
      <li>My hair is so smooth and sleek when done, and it stays that way all day.  </li>
      <li>Ordered several things off Sephora, none were great.  </li>
      <li>So I just started trying EVERYTHING I could find that claimed to smooth out hair.  </li>
      <li>When I ordered this product, the description, ingredients list, and photo was for the discontinued formulation (no longer available in stores), which is what I wanted.</li>
      <li>daily and after washes, it  leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
      <li>The smell is light and yummy.</li>
      <li>The reason why this serum works and the others don&#x27;t is because it is so LIGHT.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of products that have scents because most scents bother me but this product&#x27;s scent is very refreshing.</li>
      <li>i have a long hair i used like 3-4 pumps before straighten my hair and looks great.</li>
      <li>Just be careful not to apply too much and it should work perfectly.</li>
      <li>Right off the bat I was happy with how this product protected my hair from the heat of my flat iron.</li>
      <li>so I threw a container in the basket along with the Fructis Full Control Anti-Humidity Hair Spray.     </li>
      <li>Kind of like replacing the natural oils your hair has before you keep cleaning it.  </li>
      <li>Eventually, I will need to just cut it out, but this serum works great to smooth and make the ends shiny / less frizzy.</li>
      <li>But right when it is applied, it looks and feels fantastic.</li>
      <li>sometimes my hair would look great and other times</li>
      <li>Some of my favorites are \\&quot;Paul Mitchel Super Skinny Serum\\&quot; and \\&quot;Proclaim Glossing Polish Color and Heat \\&quot;..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am African American &amp; 3 years natural. I don&#x27;t often flat iron my hair except for when it&#x27;s time for a trim and then I try to get the longest wear out of the straightened style as possible. Right off the bat I was happy with how this product protected my hair from the heat of my flat iron. I used it on small sections in conjunction with Garnier Fructis Flat Iron Protector Mist. They straightened it better than any product I&#x27;ve used before as well as giving it incredible shine and body! It&#x27;s very hot and humid here in TN, so I&#x27;ll do a follow-up on how my hair held up after a day of running around tomorrow. Until then, I&#x27;m very pleased, especially for the price of $5 bucks from my local Target!</li>
    <li> I really like how little of this product you have to use to be effective. And it smells teriffic. It leaves my hair feeling great and really tamps down the frizz which is necessary in the Dallas humidity.</li>
    <li> I am an international student from Africa. I read some of the reviews and decided to try the Garnier sleek and shine line. I am so glad I bought this product line. My hair has never felt better. I shampoo and condition my hair with the sleek and shine shampoo and conditioner. Next, I towel dry my hair, apply a little bit of the leave-in conditioning cream, then follow with the anti-frizz serum. Make sure to rub your hands together before applying the cream and serum. After applying the cream and serum, I blow dry my hair and make a low ponytail. You can use a flat iron to straighten your hair before making the ponytail. I sometimes apply the anti-humidity styling cream to the ponytail to keep it firm. When I get done, my hair looks shinning and silky smooth. I would encourage African-American women to try Garnier sleek and shine line. If Garnier quit the sleek and shine line, I would go crazy.</li>
    <li> It does the job of making hair silky smooth and for an awesome price. About $3 here at my local store will last a month or more depending how much you use and the amount. One of the best products in the Garnier Fructis line.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s my favorite to use after I straighten my hair.  I bought it online because it has gotten hard to find near my house.</li>
    <li> Love the product!&lt;br /&gt;The seller was efficient and  wrapped it in a way there could be no possible spillage.</li>
    <li> This is the only product my daughter will use on her hair.  She loves that it keeps her dark hair so soft and shiny.  We can&#x27;t find it in the stores so therefore we just hop on-line whenever she is close to being out-- just ordered 4 for her to take with to college!  Great product!</li>
    <li> My hair is bleached, needless to say it&#x27;s a bit dry. I used this product while my hair was still wet, I then blow-dried and WOW what a difference! My hair is sleek &amp; shiny (they aren&#x27;t lying). I&#x27;ve tried several different Anti-Frizz serums, and this one in my experience is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviewers of this product I am also african american with relaxed hair.  I too have tried many of the really EXPENSIVE brands.  I have also tried an Ojon Serum that was much higher in price...this one beats them all.  By way of recommendation by the reviews I read.. I have now tried the following..sleek and shine shampoo, smoothing milk, color conditioner, sleek and shine leave in conditioner, and the serum.  I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with the shampoo because I really need a good detangler.  If it does not detangle well I have breakage.  I was not that impressed by the leave in conditioner either but the shampoo with the color conditioner worked really well.  The smoothing milk doesn&#x27;t do much but the SERUM works really well.  I blowed my hair out with a brush and the color conditioner seemed to seal my hair and highlight my color very nicely.  I picked up the serum a day later and ran some through my hair...instant junkie.  This stuff adds body, bounce, shine...this is the finishing touch.  The next time I will use this on wet hair along with shampoo, and color conditioner.  My hair texture is bouncy, shiny, and very healthy looking.  Much better than when I leave the salon.  The shampoo and conditioner were on sale for a wopping $2.50 each.  For $20.00 you could have the whole line.  TRY this line of products...You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I like this product because frankly I just am lazy and don&#x27;t like to comb or brush it more than is absolutely needed. This keeps it smooth and also smell pretty good too. I recommend for any other lazy men with long hair who just want something thats easy and don&#x27;t require alot of work. The onl;y downside is that it does leave a oily residue on your hands but I just use  disposable gloves to put it in.</li>
    <li> The new forumla stinks so bad I can&#x27;t use it!  I am so disappointed they changed the formula.  I will have to find a new product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised no one has mentioned this. I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s just me but this stuff cuts down my drying time to half, maybe even a THIRD of the time it normally takes. I love it. I&#x27;ve used lots of serums and didn&#x27;t really notice this with any others. Also, with other serums that contain silicone (dimethocone, dimethoconol) which is almost ALL of them, my hair always ends up damaged when I use it daily. Silicones leave the hair shaft smooth and seal split ends, by adding a coating on the hair that seals in moisture and also seals OUT moisture. That means you should use a clarifying shampoo at least once a week to break down the silicone and allow your conditioner to do it&#x27;s job. If you don&#x27;t, then your hair is going to get dry and weak but you won&#x27;t notice it for awhile because the silicone is masking it and just making it APPEAR healthy. I&#x27;m not a hair expert, but I&#x27;ve researched it because every winter for the past few years, my hair has turned HORRIBLE and dry and started breaking off to theOjonnt I wanted to cry. I didn&#x27;t realize I was doing it to myself by using serums every day. I don&#x27;t learn my lessen though lol I keep using serums and not using a clarifying shampoo until I notice the damage and I&#x27;m like CRAP. I started using THIS serum in the summer of last year and now it&#x27;s March and I have NOT had that horrible hair damage in the cold months from using this.. So it is a MIRACLE product to me and it is cheap too. Hallelujah!  Anyway, since I&#x27;m already rambling, I want to mention that when I experienced my hair breaking and getting dry and HORRIBLE, I would buy packet samples of Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment Plus from eBay (the s*** is crazyyy expensive, that&#x27;s why I bought samples) But it&#x27;s great great great omg GREAT. It fixed a lot of the damage and I also used hair vitamins that worked wonders and made it grow :)</li>
    <li> Unlike the other gals that have left reviews, I am not a woman of color--I&#x27;m as white as they come and I love this product too. I have naturally straight hair and I bleach it platinum blonde every 6 weeks, so I am constantly battling the dried out damaged look. I have tried various conditioners and shampoos and many work for me. But no matter what I use I still have frizzies and that dry, over processed look. This product solves all of that. Unlike other products, it is not too heavy and is just enough to tame the flyway ends and give me an incredible shine. I have had many friends comment on how great and healthy (!) my hair looks and  its all due to this product. Bonuses are the relatively low price (compared to many other shine products, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens of them!) and the pleasing scent. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly, shoulder length, Caucasian hair that tends to get frizzy with humidity.  For many years I lived with the frizz, while trying many products that left my hair looking greasy or flat.  A friend suggested I try Garnier Fructis Anti-Frizz Serum, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing and towel drying, I put a dime sized squirt in the palm of my hand.  I rub my hands together and then lightly pat my hands all over my hair, applying very sparingly to the scalp part.  I run my fingers under my hair to make sure all the strands are treated, then wash my hands to get the product off.  I add some mousse or gel and then comb it all through my hair, shake my head and scrunch my curls and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum really helps with the frizzies, and makes my curls stay curly all day long.  I often skip a day washing my hair because I no longer wake up with a bush that needs taming.  One caveat:  don&#x27;t use too much of this product or your hair will look greasy.  Just a tiny bit is enough!</li>
    <li> I am African American. My hair is really course before I use a perm and when I finally perm my hair it turns into a dull frizz ball, but straight. I picked this up from Walmart last night because I had heard some wonderful things about it and my roommate used it and her hair came out amazing. I was apprehensive however because she&#x27;s Indian and our hair textures were different. I take risks with products so I threw a container in the basket along with the Fructis Full Control Anti-Humidity Hair Spray.     When I finished perming and drying my hair it was standing on my head in a very large frizz ball. I ordered pizza and the delivery driver was laughing, that&#x27;s how horrid it looked. I used a little more than a pea size of the serum because my hair needed an extra something to get rid of the frizz. I then used my hair straightener. Oh my gosh did my hair get soft, shiny and straight for the first time ever without having to use half a container of grease! I was putting weave in my hair and needed my hair to be as straight as the weave and I have to say that you cannot tell where my hair ends and the weave begins. I am ecstatic about this product and I am glad I made the splurge! Even the hair spray was awesome and assisted in making some of the nicest spiral curls I have ever achieved from just wrapping my hair around the barrel of a curling iron. Tight, shiny and long lasting curls. I applied the serum after I dried my hair but you can use it while it&#x27;s wet as well. In my experience my hair reacts to hair products better if I put it on after my hair is dry otherwise I get a tacky-feeling frizz ball effect instead of just frizzy.    African Americans tend to not be able to use many products that were not designed specifically for our hair texture because either the product will dry it out or make it too oily and flat. This serum gave my hair bounce and shine and for that I am thankful to be able to add this to my arsenal of products. I definitely recommend that you goto Walmart because I purchased this serum for $3.33 which means this site is a bit over priced. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I located a better deal(40% better) at local grocery store after placing the order.  Please have competitive pricing on your items.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> i am from the Caribbean, i brought this product in a pharmacy thinking it was just like all the others. i was wrong. If you have relax hair like most black girls then this product is for you. It makes your hair soft, manageable and smoothed. i used this product while my hair was damped it felt great, my hair dried feeling really soft and without breakage. Try it now.</li>
    <li> I have tried higher end hair serums, as well as lower end ones, and I have to say that this one is, by far, my favorite! Not only is it super inexpensive but it delivers what it promises to do -- it gives you sleek, shiny, and manageable hair! I use a few pumps of it on my towel dried hair and after blowdrying, my hair is incredibly soft and silky. Once I&#x27;m done blowdrying, I use less than a drop of it to run all over my hair to give my hair a super smooth and polished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it! Also, it smells very light and citrusy. I&#x27;m not a big fan of products that have scents because most scents bother me but this product&#x27;s scent is very refreshing. I would highly recommend using this serum, and don&#x27;t go a day without using it myself!</li>
    <li> I used to love and swear by this product. Whenever I straightened my hair this is what I used to use. The finished product has always been smooth, soft, and silky hair. I also use to use this as my main detangler. I have curly hair so I have been wearing my hair curly all summer. Now that it started to get cooler I tried to straightened my hair. I had a little left in the bottle I had so I decided to pick up a new one. I used it and I did not get the same results as I have been getting the past three years. My hair was not soft and sleek as how it used to be. Something told me to compare the ingredients on the bottles (the old bottle and the new bottle), and it shows that they definitely changed the formula. All the other times that they have changed the formula it seems to work for me. However, this time, I think they got it all wrong. Now the search is on to finding another serum that will give me great results. I definitely will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Leaves hair so soft and healthy.  Wish I would have found this years ago.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this is great at smoothing it and keeping it from getting so frizzy in this southern weather.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair looking greasy... Even when used sparingly. Doesn&#x27;t last more than a half day.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry, colored, don&#x27;t like to wash it every day.  This Serum helps condition when I blow dry it every day.  Only thing I have found that helps and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, expecting very little. My hair is wavy and if left on its own it tends to frizz up and get really big. I have tried some of the cheap anti-frizz creams, sprays etc. and most of them had slight impacts on my hair. This one, however, made my hair soft and much flatter. Cheap and effective. Just try it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many products and spent a lot of $ trying to find something that would tame my hair.  I use this serum before blow-drying my thick, frizz-prone hair, then use the flat iron spray before flat-ironing.  My hair is so smooth and sleek when done, and it stays that way all day.  I am amazed that something so inexpensive works so well.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a product that really works for my hair I just love it! The price and product are great I am so glad and happy that I have finally purchased it :).</li>
    <li> Smelled amazing i like it</li>
    <li> This product has saved the ends of my hair! I got an ombre last summer and it ruined the ends of my hair...seriously. Eventually, I will need to just cut it out, but this serum works great to smooth and make the ends shiny / less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Target while searching for something to help with fizzy-ness and flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product since I&#x27;ve used other similar products with no improvement but I was pleasantly surprised! I&#x27;m not usually someone who likes the product-in-my-hair look but this product does help me handle flyaways and frizz. It also helps hold my curls when I curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that this product smells SO SO SO good! I love the Garnier Fructis scent (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should probably mention that I apply this to my DRY hair in the morning. I do one pump into my hand and rub my hands together before combing it through my hair.</li>
    <li> Smooth and shiny, but can make your hair a little greasy and flat.  After about 10 hours, I notice that the product moves up my hair follicle to my roots.  This causes a greasy mess at my scalp.  But right when it is applied, it looks and feels fantastic.</li>
    <li> Keeps the frizzies away.</li>
    <li> Kind of like replacing the natural oils your hair has before you keep cleaning it.  Gives my hair just enough control and added shine.  I like Garniers other leave&#x3D;in conditioner a little better though.</li>
    <li> * Love this serum, you only need a dime shape amount to rub in your hands and then put on your hair that is below your head/scalp.  * I like to interchange this with the Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Spray or the Color Leave-In or regular leave-in treatment.  * Will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this anti-frizz serum thinking that it would do wonders for my hair.I put only a teeny tiny drop-not even the size of a pea into my hair and....blah!.My hair,that is normally soft and sleek was hanging in oily clumps within seconds.Thank god that Suave Daily clarifying shampoo and conditioner helped!.I would recommend to buy Suave Daily Clarifying collection or the Suave Professionals collection Rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner.Dont worry, if you buy this product you&#x27;ll certainly need a bottle!</li>
    <li> This stuff is just wonderful. The reason why this serum works and the others don&#x27;t is because it is so LIGHT. Unless you apply way too much, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair at ALL. And it does its job by eliminating frizz perfectly! I have tried so many defrizzing serums and this one is definitely the best, the search is over. Just be careful not to apply too much and it should work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have mid-length hair that isn&#x27;t thin, but it is fine.  Even though I brush my hair several times a day, it seems to get tangled and messy and knotted up very easy.  I&#x27;m a 43 year old woman who&#x27;s mother is always telling me to brush my hair and it drives me nuts!  So I just started trying EVERYTHING I could find that claimed to smooth out hair.  Ordered several things off Sephora, none were great.  Tried the Argan oil, didn&#x27;t help.  So I picked up this entire line - the shampoo, the conditioner and this serum.  So far they work better than anything else I have tried.  My hair is smoother and softer then it has ever been. The products all have a great smell and the best thing is they don&#x27;t cost that much.  You  have to be careful with the serum though.  It is an oil.  Sometimes if I use too much my hair will feel/look oily.  I use slightly less than one full pump, rub it into my palms, then massage it into my hair when it&#x27;s wet.  I try to focus most of it the ends, trying not to get much right near the scalp.  I&#x27;m happy with the line and I&#x27;ll keep using it.  Hopefully it will keep my mother off my back!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works great</li>
    <li> I like using this product for my hair extensions. After i was them and let them dry, i appy the product and let it dry. It makes them silky and smooth, and helps minimize detangling which usually happens overtime with hair extensions.</li>
    <li> Ive had the same bottle of this for.. a year maybe 2. Its cheap and it lasts!! You only use but a pump MAYBE 2 (size of a dime)&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and is lightweight but, if your not careful and you put just a touch too much in, you will get the greasy look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;Overall id recommend this little  bottle :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;m a guy, with very thick, wavy/curly hair. I&#x27;m trying to grow it out, but have been trying to find a product that was gonna work, while not leaving a hole in my wallet. This stuff really does work. I bought this elsewhere for about half the Amazon price (really, for 9 bucks, I could get 2 bottles at my local grocery store vs. Amazon).  Smells great, and when used before/after straightening, actually leaves hair feeling smooth and less frizzy. Only wish it had more staying power, and was less greasy (my hands feel like an oil slick after using it). I also feel like I have to use more than 1-2 squirts to make a dent in my frizziness (and my hair is only about 5 inches long at this point)  Pros:  - Cheap (compared to John Freida)  - Smells good  - Works well with wet or dry hair  - Leaves hair healthy and shiny, even after a flat iron  Cons  - Greasy (more so on hands than hair)  - Requires more than recommended amount to achieve desired effect  - Could have more staying power  - Try looking for it at local stores first (apparently, its hard to find, but costs much less in stores)</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product, the description, ingredients list, and photo was for the discontinued formulation (no longer available in stores), which is what I wanted. The package arrived containing bottles of the new formulation, which is not what I wanted. I can buy that in any drug store for cheaper, and without shipping costs. I have alerted the seller of the issue and requested a refund/exchange. Hopefully they will update their photo and item description, but if they haven&#x27;t - be advised: If you are looking for the discontinued formulation, don&#x27;t order it here.</li>
    <li> This product far exceeded my expectations. I have mid-length curly hair - and it was frizzy! I hated wearing my hair down because no matter what I put in my hair it either made my hair look wet and flat and be hard and crunchy all day, or just didn&#x27;t do a good job handling frizz. It was always a hit or miss - sometimes my hair would look great and other times I could do the same thing and my hair would be all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With experiences of product after product failing me, my only hopes were to find a good leave in conditioner/oil that would help with dry hair and frizz. This product not only did that, but more. After only one use my hair was noticeably different. The very first day I wore this product in my hair I received compliments on how shiny and pretty my curls looked - they were much neater curls as opposed to crazy curls. My hair is no longer frizzy, no longer dry, and this is the only product (paired with Garnier Fructis Moroccan sleek oil treatment)that I use in my hair (no hairspray, gel, mousse, etc!). I put it in when I get out of the shower, and whether I let my hair air dry or put it up, it controls the frizz and leaves my hair soft and shiny. If I straighten my hair it holds the straight all day without needing any additional product. Whether I wear my hair straighened or with my natural curls, it always looks healthy, shiny, and smells wonderful because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 1 warning, and it has nothing to do with the product, which is why I gave it 5 stars: obviously this is an oil. You will need to experiment with how much product you need for your hair type. If you put too much your hair will look oily.</li>
    <li> i have a long hair i used like 3-4 pumps before straighten my hair and looks great. It does not feel/look oily which is great and my wavy hair looks calm:)</li>
    <li> I could not believe the immediate results after using the product. I have fine curly and frizzy hair. When I use this after a daily deep conditioner there is no need for any other products. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure about it since I have naturally really thick frizzy wavy/curly hair and usually when I blow dry it my hair gets straight, but it&#x27;s a huge puff ball. When I use one pump of this and work it through my wet hair then blow dry my hair comes out amazingly straight. It&#x27;s never been this soft and calm with any other product. I&#x27;m not sure how it works for other hair types, but since it works so great on my difficult hair I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be even better for less frizzed hair. Definitely recommend it to people.

    <li> I am from the Caribbean, black nonetheless, with BSL relaxed hair. I have tried various other serums and use them on a regular basis. Some of my favorites are \\&quot;Paul Mitchel Super Skinny Serum\\&quot; and \\&quot;Proclaim Glossing Polish Color and Heat \\&quot;.. I usually use my Super Skinny Serum daily and after washes, it  leaves my hair feeling great. However, I ran out of that product and didn&#x27;t feel like purchasing a new one for $22 so I decided to give \\&quot;Garnier Fructice Leave-In Anti Frizz Serum\\&quot; a try!... This serum is amazing. It is extremely lightweight and I love that!! It does not weigh my hair down. Even on dry hair it reduces my frizz significantly and my hair is bouncy as ever. And I purchased it only $5 at CVS! What a Bargain! I am yet to try it on wet hair after washing, but as soon as I do I will update this review and let you lovely ladies know how It goes! Regardless, I recommend this product..it is cost friendly, light weight (for those who do not like their hair weighed down) and simply great!</li>
    <li> Feels silky and nongreasy in ur hands but didn&#x27;t notice any help with taming the frizz.  Keep wondering if I should toss in the garbage but I hate wasting money</li>
    <li> I did not like this product as an anti frizz- this brands shampoo and hair conditioner has been my favorite for many years but this serum is really doing nothing as an anti frizzer!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and until now have never found a product that works on frizz. This one does! I love all the Garnier products. They are inexpensive and they do what they say they will do.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product one star a month ago.  It made my hair look like I put canola oil in it.  I would use just one pump, and I would have used less if it dispensed less.  I would let half of it drip down the sink, but it just didn&#x27;t EVER look good or feel good.  Plus, washing it off your hands seriously takes some degreaser- hand soap is not enough!  I am terrible about throwing away things- I kept thinking that maybe it would work out somehow.  Well, it really did!  I finally tried it on wet hair, fresh out of the bath, and it&#x27;s now the ONLY post bath product I use every time.  It makes my hair so soft, silky, shiny and beautiful, easy to straighten or curl, and it is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am white, with bra-strap length wavy-curly hair that is moderately thick, very fine and (currently) undamaged.  (I&#x27;m planning to put in some streaks.)  I don&#x27;t have problems with splits or frizz, but my ends have felt pretty rough sometimes, and I&#x27;ve had flat, greasy roots with fluffy length- I never have those problems now!  I put in a whole pumpful while my hair is soaking and comb it through, then put it up in my hair turban(very soft microfiber material- curly ladies, stay away from rough towels!)  I cannot tell you what a difference it&#x27;s made to my length and ends!</li>
    <li> This product gets rid of all the frizz in my hair!! I use this with the garnier fructis sleek and shine leave in conditioner and it makes my hair bouncy, smells good, and no frizz! What more could you want?! Frizz free hair all day! :)&lt;br /&gt;BTW, i used to use redkens all soft aragan oil. The garnier fructis anti frizz serum works 10x better, dont waste your money on the redkens aragan oil :)</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  i have AA relaxed here.  i used this after conditioning, before blow drying.  and i use this after flat ironing my hair.  it makes my hair look amazing and its super light.  love.</li>
    <li> I am a man with short, curly hair.  I&#x27;m pretty active and I live in a hot, humid climate.  I end up showering far too often which turns my hair to dry, frizzy garbage.  I don&#x27;t like the texture that gel or hairspray give my hair.  The Garnier anti-frizz serum has a nice smell, gives just a bit of hold, and doesn&#x27;t look wet all day like hair gel.  If you&#x27;ve got a dryness problem I would recommend using this product with the [[ASIN:B005GQ6HUK Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Leave-In Conditioning Cream]] for a deeper treatment (although not at the same time).</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Works well to control frizz, even in heavy humidity. Lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I first bought this product years ago from a local department store and continue to use it occasionally. I have very long, straight hair that is dry and fine from years of flat-iron abuse. This serum is excellent for taming my frizzy split ends and for protecting my hair when flat-ironing. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of other creams and serums, and this ranks fairly highly on my list. For my hair type, I only need to use a tiny bit. (One bottle lasts me a VERY long time, which is a bonus.) If I accidentally use just a little too much, I end up looking too oily and it tends to rub off on my face. The smell is light and yummy. I recommend it for most hair types, but be careful to use just a little dab at a time, especially for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I like it , the garnier Fructis keeps my hair straight, and no tangle s in the hair. It&#x27;s nice to have it.</li>
    <li> Just bought this a couple days ago, when I pumped it into my hand, I realized it was oily. So you might think it would make your hair look greasy. I was going to stay home for the rest of the day so I decided to give it a try. When my hair dried, it looked clean and shiny ! I love this product ! It made my hair look like it did when I was 17 years old ! Healthy and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping. I rather.</li>
    <li> Amazing product ,very good value for money &amp; very fast dilivery.MEHRYAR  From  Hampshire  UK  Thank you</li>
