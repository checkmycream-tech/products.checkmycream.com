<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works as it should and easy to use</li>
    <li> It kills the nasties !!!!! Aids, hepatitis, fungus, etc..... I am a collector of antique and vintage razors and shaving implements and with the nature of these devices being sterile is a top priority...... it works period. trusted by hospitals and barbers worldwide. My brother in laws mother is a DR. and she has really given me a proper insight as to how Barbacide works and why it should be used period for any barber or even blood spills or soils of biologic origin. Bottom line if you care about your health or those you serve as a beauty professional or medical professional this is what you want or the big brother Barbacide plus. just be sure to read all instructions and mi to the proper ratio and you are golden.</li>
    <li> I recently took up using a safety razor and wanted a way to disinfect it before or after each use.  The primary reason I chose this product was due to some of the other reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am quite pleased with this disinfectant. The blue color in the Barbicide jar sitting in the bathroom adds a great feeling to the space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor of this product is actually quite pleasing. If you are thinking of an order like Lysol, think again. It is a subtle medicinal smell when diluted according to the directions. I use this every day for my razor before shaving. I soak it for a while, rinse it and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor mixes very well with the elixirs, tonics, creams, splashes, soaps and oils found in many a bathroom. Very much like walking into an old fashioned barber shop. My wife has even taken to using it for some of her grooming tools as well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy. No regrets at all and this bottle will likely last for quite some time.</li>
    <li> Because this stuff is so serious, I put it in it&#x27;s own container with a lid, with labels such as &amp;#34;use gloves&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;poison&amp;#34; so my family knows it is serious stuff.  I also have a dedicated measurement cup that I labeled also, &amp;#34;for use only with Barbicide&amp;#34; and keep it in the container.  Keep it on a high shelf, etc.  It works great.</li>
    <li> The Barbicide web site says that the solution will work in 10 mimutes and should be changed daily. See Barbicide .com and follow the Infection&lt;br /&gt;Control tab to learn more.</li>
    <li> well what can you say about something that keep germs away as a barber you must used this product if you are in the business&lt;br /&gt;I must keep this on hand for my satisfaction</li>
    <li> effective for sterilizing my de razors and nail files etc..... very good..recoment it for anyone wanting clean  and healthy equipment.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. That&#x27;s all I wanted. A little goes a very long way. Good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you want something besides bleach as a disinfectant/antifungal. No worries about getting it on your cloths like bleach. A little goes a long way mixed with water</li>
    <li> Worked great, and I liked that it was compact. I have a foot file I use for personal use, and I pour barbacide and water into a jar and place the file in there for 10 minutes after use just to be extra sanitary.</li>
    <li> A must-have for anyone doing hair, nails and feet! ;0)</li>
    <li> What can be said?  Barbicide works great for cleaning my single edge razor.  I use the Barbicide small jar on my bathroom counter, which takes up little real estate.</li>
    <li> It kills germs, and smells good enough to almost drink, but don&#x27;t drink it.</li>
    <li> It works great . and i love it. it is good at disinfect things. I want more now. Great product</li>
    <li> Very good flavor and strong taste</li>
    <li> Good deal! Wal-Mart was $11.00 more for this product.</li>
    <li> I use it to disinfect all my DE razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to track down the source of some minor skin issues. This has helped tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off - this is the product that licensed barbers/salons use to keep their equipment from cross contaminating between clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value - It&#x27;s super concentrated. This bottle will last you the rest of your natural life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience - Mostly, I use this to sanitize my razor between uses. I keep a jar with the prepared/diluted solution in my bathroom. I drop my razor into the jar, brush my teeth, shower, etc. Finally, I rinse the razor and shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within about a week, I noticed drastic improvements in my skin. I used to get a lot of redness like acne (I&#x27;m 34, a little old to have breakouts like a teenager). I had dried flaky skin in the corners of my mouth. Now, using a clean razor, these conditions have dropped off 100% at times, and when I do see some of these problem return, they are greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone that wants or needs to sterilize grooming equipment.</li>
    <li> just what I needed to go with Barbicide jar.  Good shipping times</li>
    <li> I purchased a set of manicure/pedicure tools that I take with me to the salon whenever I get pedicures. I disinfect the tools a few hours prior to each appointment with Barbicide solution, and my nail tech uses my disinfected tools during my session. Call me a control freak, but I like knowing absolutely for sure that my tools are used only on me and are always very clean. I follow the dilution instructions on the bottle and have not had any infection or other issues since I&#x27;ve been doing this (for 2 or 3 years now). My pedicure appointments are 2 or 3 weeks apart, so I use fresh solution every time, and store my tools dry in between disinfections/appointments.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years to clean hair brushes,combs&amp; hair guards. Cleans great.</li>
    <li> I bought the jar. Needed solution to pour in it. Didn&#x27;t really pay attention to size, it was an add-on item. 16oz. Good for trial to see if you like.&lt;br /&gt;But the rep behind the name of barbicide is there. Could be same stuff you nay come across spas they keep implements in. Get some and a jar and keep your combs in. Always sanitary and ready.</li>
    <li> Functional and is what I expected.</li>
    <li> Barbicide has a good reputation and has been around for years. I use to disinfect straight razors. It works and it works good what else do you need to know. JR</li>
    <li> If you need or want to disinfect razors, scissors, combs, tweezers, nail clippers, etc. this is the best you can get. It is highly concentrated so this pint goes a very long way. Read about this stuff on wikipedia; the history of it is pretty interesting, too.</li>
