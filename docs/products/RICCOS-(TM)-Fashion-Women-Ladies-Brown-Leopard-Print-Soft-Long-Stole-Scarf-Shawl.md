    <li> It is not what it even looks like. It is so short not long like in the picture. I am very disappointed.</li>

    <li> it was not a long. It looks like my grandmas head scarf</li>
    <li> It doesnt look same as the picture....material is cheap</li>
    <li> The scarf is not the product advertised at all. It&#x27;s short and not long and looks cheap in person. Good thing it was only like $3 when I bought it, but still. It&#x27;s not the product I thought I paid for and their advertising was very deceiving. I kept it and I still wear it, but I&#x27;m salty that it&#x27;s not the product that it perceived to be. Oh well, get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
    <li> The scarf is very pretty! Nice material, good price, and goes really well with everything. I really like it.Thank you!</li>

    <li> Unfortunately this scarf isn&#x27;t what I had expected. The fabric is extremely thin making the scarf seem chintzy. Also, it isn&#x27;t too long.  I was hoping for more of the quality/look as in the photos &amp; advertised description.  The one good benefit is the price was inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I do not like this scarf due to it being short. Being short means I can not wear it like I want to.</li>
    <li> I like the scarf that I received,however it is not the same one that was pictured.  It&#x27;s lighter in color and has two different leopard prints on it in stripes (not even close to the picture) after waiting over a month for delivery it was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Nice new scarf. Soft thin fabric. Looks very nice on.</li>

    <li> Tool awhile to get here, but that was expected. Scarf in photo has more tan colors while the scarf that came has more browns and is sheer in material. I like it better, actually. The ends are not sewn well - it&#x27;s not a high quality scarf, but at the price, it was a steal! Be sure to wash on a gentle cycle and in a laundry bag and it should last just fine. I am short and the scarf is not long - for me, it&#x27;s a great length! Super happy w/ the purchase!</li>
