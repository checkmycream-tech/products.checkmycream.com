      <li>I really love it</li>
      <li>Truthful as description.</li>

      <li>Otherwise it seemed ok.</li>

      <li>I ordered this since when I deep condition, works perfectly.  </li>

      <li>Nice and easy to clean! :)</li>
      <li>Love the Velco, though easy to use neck fastener.</li>
      <li>Not heavy weight, works great.  </li>
      <li>The material is cheap and rips easily.</li>
      <li>It could be longer, but for the money, it works just fine.</li>
      <li>Feels a bit cheap but does the job  and hasn&#x27;t torn yet.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace the free one that came with a set of clippers that I had.</li>
      <li>It snaps securely and fits any age.</li>
      <li>Cheap, disposable grade.</li>
      <li>Very nice but short life.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I expected for the price and is working out great .</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>A nice tight fit to neck,large coverage area!</li>
      <li>I would have liked it to be a little longer in the back, but I liked the fact that it adjusted to my neck size.  </li>
      <li>infact i bought 2 and would definitely get more when i need it.</li>
      <li>This cape is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Very comfy!</li>
      <li>I chose a five star rating because this Shampoo Cape was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Its price is exactly what I would pay given what I expect to happen to it.</li>
      <li>It seems to be of good quality, so it should last me for a long time.  </li>
      <li>It has the velcro lining which holds it in place and the length and width are reasonable for home use.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a real salon using this product.</li>
      <li>so much easier to cut my kids hair when they don&#x27;t need a shower afterwards.</li>
      <li>Fine material and the velcro is decent, but I thought it would be closed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little better quality than the ones that you get free with some clippers but not much.</li>
      <li>The back is not long enough, and the material is splitting in more than 7 spot around the velcro.  </li>
      <li>It is only long in front; it is also cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>, I usual wrapped an old towel around my shoulders to keep my clothes from getting  stained but now  I have  this Cape  and love it</li>
      <li>Sturdy material with a velcro strap that makes it fit all my boys- from my husband down to the one year old.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is the velcro is tricky to snap on if it gets wet, but its an easy fix.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s plenty large enough to keep hair off my clothes.  </li>
      <li>i got this to help someone out in life to open up a barre shop  thank you so much for it it nisei</li>
      <li>I think you need to use neck strips along with this in order to protect your clothes completely.</li>
      <li>It helps a little...but doesn&#x27;t keep hair completely off their body.</li>
      <li>The flap in the back is not as long as the front, and all hair or chemicals comes right off with ease.</li>
      <li>The size of the cape is accurate, although they seem extremely small.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected for the price.</li>
      <li>The material is a bit stiffer (plastic feel) than I expected, however, it held up pretty well in the washing machine.</li>
      <li>All other capes that I have purchased have been too large.  </li>
      <li>While it is not super strong, it did not shred to pieces like the last one did over a few months.</li>
      <li>(Larger than children&#x27;s capes, definitely not large enough for normal sized men).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great cape for it&#x27;s price. Does the job, and that what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I had hoped this would be like the capes used in salons for cutting hair.  It is only long in front; it is also cheaply made.  I&#x27;ve never seen a salon use a different cape for shampooing and for cutting hair, and this certainly won&#x27;t be much use for cutting hair.  Don&#x27;t know what I was thinking.</li>
    <li> I am not a hair stylist, but I needed one of these to do my own hair at home. The material is a bit stiffer (plastic feel) than I expected, however, it held up pretty well in the washing machine. It did not tear or become deformed, and it does have the length as shown in the picture.The flap in the back is not as long as the front, and all hair or chemicals comes right off with ease. Make sure you do not put it in the dryer as it says on the label, as that might surely shrink it. I just hung mine in the shower to dry and it was good to go again.</li>
    <li> Very comfy! Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my hir dresser, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I wanted this product as a barber cape, for a home haircutting business, and it was very good, quality, length and easy to fit. infact i bought 2 and would definitely get more when i need it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair anymore :(  so I just have my wife cut it with clippers at home. I bought this to replace the free one that came with a set of clippers that I had. It&#x27;s a little better quality than the ones that you get free with some clippers but not much. But for the price it&#x27;s a good deal in my mind.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my Mum as she dyes her own hair, but I was disappointed to see that it wasn&#x27;t knee length all the way round.  It&#x27;s long at the front and then only about a foot or so at the back.  Maybe if I actually measured out the dimensions I would have worked that out, but in case you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t, now you know.  It also doesn&#x27;t join under the arms.  Otherwise it seemed ok.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. I can&#x27;t imagine a real salon using this product.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to review? What&#x27;s not to like?  I use it when I color my hair.  It could be longer, but for the money, it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Cheap material but a good price.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected for the price and is working out great . It is a great buy.</li>
    <li> The quality of this cape is so inferior I don&#x27;t no where to begin describing my disappointment. I have used this cape a total of 6 times and it is going in the trash today.  The back is not long enough, and the material is splitting in more than 7 spot around the velcro.  I would not recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> The size of the cape is accurate, although they seem extremely small. (Larger than children&#x27;s capes, definitely not large enough for normal sized men). The material is cheap and rips easily. I would absolutely NOT buy this product again. Absolutely horrible.</li>
    <li> Cape is just what I needed for when I cut my kids hair at home. Good feel, good size, great price.</li>
    <li> My wife clips my hair about once a week and this works well for keeping the flotsam and jetsam from getting all over my threads. Folds up nice and compact.</li>
    <li> This cape was as described.  I would have liked it to be a little longer in the back, but I liked the fact that it adjusted to my neck size.  All other capes that I have purchased have been too large.  It seems to be of good quality, so it should last me for a long time.  I would recommend it for occasional use.</li>
    <li> This product arrived very fast and it is great for all types of people. It works a lot better than a towel and I love it. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Fine material and the velcro is decent, but I thought it would be closed int he back or at least have enough material. I bought it to give my husband buzz cuts. This will cover his front, but I am concerned about the back now. I have not used yet.</li>
    <li> so much easier to cut my kids hair when they don&#x27;t need a shower afterwards. plus i throw it on when i color my own hair</li>
    <li> Great for a do-it-yourselfer at home. No more putting the kids through itchy hairs all over their backs or fouling a towel to keep it off their skin.</li>
    <li> it gets the job done, but I do not love.  The cape is long in front but short on sides.</li>
    <li> BEST PRICE I&#x27;VE SEEN IN A MINUTE!</li>
    <li> I should have order a cloth one it is a little rough on the neck.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected for the price. Not quite small enough for my three year old&#x27;s neck, but it still works well.</li>
    <li> Great shampooing cape</li>
    <li> I used this cape outside as I got my head shaved.  The hook and loop neck closure worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, it is hotter than the hinges swinging on the gates of hell if you&#x27;re sitting under the cape in 85° sunshine!</li>
    <li> works good, easy to clean</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still a bit big for my two boys, but not an issue.  Works great!  No more itchiness b/c hair gets on them!</li>
    <li> I do my hair at home and this cape was just the thing  I needed, I usual wrapped an old towel around my shoulders to keep my clothes from getting  stained but now  I have  this Cape  and love it, it&#x27;s waterproof too so no  worries about washing it.</li>
    <li> Product tore shorty after purchase.</li>
    <li> Great cape, I use when I cutt my friends hair.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to clean! :)</li>
    <li> Great Value for the price. Durable. I especially like how the Velcro adjusts for tightness around d the neck. This works for cutting my 2 year olds hair as well as my husband&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Very good item! I&#x27;m hsppy that I boughed it?</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do. my clients like it. no complaints. Washes well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s long in the front and very short on the back. Overall,it&#x27;s nice. I hope I can use it to prevent the hair everywhere.</li>
    <li> Truthful as description.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s make me feel like I have my own salon and teaching good hair type, and your clothes stay clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend yes</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Fits well and still in good shape.</li>
    <li> The capes started to rip after the 3rd use along the seams. I will be choosing another product for future</li>
    <li> This is so helpful for having at home. The only thing I would change would be it being long all the way around to the back also.</li>
    <li> i got this to help someone out in life to open up a barre shop  thank you so much for it it nisei</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for! A nice tight fit to neck,large coverage area! Would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Works great. Sturdy material with a velcro strap that makes it fit all my boys- from my husband down to the one year old.</li>
    <li> I ordered this since when I deep condition, works perfectly.  The only drawback is the velcro is tricky to snap on if it gets wet, but its an easy fix.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I had to purchase one of these.  While it is not super strong, it did not shred to pieces like the last one did over a few months.</li>
    <li> Cheap, disposable grade.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit cheap but does the job  and hasn&#x27;t torn yet. I use it a lot so I guess it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I chose a five star rating because this Shampoo Cape was exactly what I needed. I&#x27;ve have taught my wife how to cut my hair and I decided that I needed a Barber Cape just for personal use. I came across this cape and decided to try it. It has the velcro lining which holds it in place and the length and width are reasonable for home use. I really love it and I might just get myself a second one.</li>
    <li> The cape is just how described, black and vinyl with velcro neck closure. Fulfilled by Amazon, so this was an -&#x27;add-on&#x27; item to our order. Great price and will work great trimming hair, will need another for sure!  : )</li>
    <li> I use this when buzzing my sons&#x27; hair. It helps a little...but doesn&#x27;t keep hair completely off their body. I think you need to use neck strips along with this in order to protect your clothes completely.</li>
    <li> Its ideal for a big guy like me who cuts my own hair. Love the Velco, though easy to use neck fastener.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, great price, Denise</li>
    <li> Very nice but short life. Replace after about a year.</li>
    <li> This cape is exactly what I was looking for. I use it for my toddler and expect it to get abused and destroyed. Its price is exactly what I would pay given what I expect to happen to it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s plenty large enough to keep hair off my clothes.  Not heavy weight, works great.  Great deal on this.  THANK YOU !!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Just what we needed to cut our boys hair at home.  It snaps securely and fits any age.</li>
    <li> Excellent price receive in great time and was greatly needed for school. This is a great place to purchase these items cheaper than a store.</li>
    <li> I would say I &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34;, but I guess there isn&#x27;t a cape anywhere that I love.  However, I&#x27;m hoping this will be serviceable.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I need to wash my 94 year old Mom&#x27;s hair, and this protects her clothing from getting wet.  It folds up into a small roll, for storage.</li>
