    <li> Very cool and soothing.</li>
    <li> I think the essence  is difficult to absorb in my skin</li>
    <li> A big not for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like to see a more detailed review for this product and more, check out here&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Im soo glad i tried this. It made my face so smooth and even looking. I have acne prone skin with scarring and this mask did its job and then some. It even dried up some of the active bumps on my face.i did use some moisturzer after the mask only because my face felt kind of sticky but it wasnt a big issue. I was a little confused on how to use it but a quick google search helped me out. This mask is a God send. Even my coworkers notices my skin looked clearer. I love these masks!</li>
    <li> Love this product very moisturizing</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast than I thought, it only took one week to ship all the way from Japan. I like the masks. good experience</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> They did not work very well.</li>
    <li> provides all the benefits as any other masks from department stores (shiseido, SKII, etc) but at a fraction of the cost, so why pay more?</li>
    <li> I have had multiple face masks that have caused my face to turn red and puff up.&lt;br /&gt;These are wonderfully gentile and soak right into my skin. Afterwards my face feel like silk and stays soft and supple for days.</li>
    <li> The mask came to my house very quick and I absolutely love the product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount of serum and I like the texture of the sheet.</li>
    <li> Ordered this on a recommendation.  Do not regret it one bit!  I broke out so badly a week ago, leaving acne scars and blemishes on my face.  After one use, I started to notice a difference, my skin was whiter and clearer than it was.  After a week, my complexion has become smoother and clearer!  Blemishes are disappearing and acne scars are too!  Love this!  Just ordered another!</li>
    <li> got whitehead after applied one</li>
    <li> I like the feeling after i masked. However, the next morning got a little bum on my face for a while. I&#x27;m not sure what cause it, but i went away later in the day.</li>
    <li> Decent mask. Didn&#x27;t feel any amazing difference but feels safe with some of these stocked in my fridge hah</li>
    <li> I heard so many good things about this product and decided to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;When I open the individual pack, I got every surprised by how dry the sheet was. The package said it contains 20ml liquid but the mask sheet was barely moisturized (huge difference from My Beauty Diary and other brands I have tried). I looked at other reviews on this mask and found it is suppose to contain a lot of liquid. The sheet itself is well made and thick so  my first reaction is that the product has expired. I tried to find the expiration date on the package but couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> i doesn&#x27;t make my skin very white. But it did works.</li>
    <li> No direction it was in different language but still I gave it try no result</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s make this simple. I love it and I will buy them again and again!</li>
    <li> It really can make you whiter, try this, it is your best choices!</li>
    <li> It really does brighten your skin tone and also really hydrates it. I am very pleased with my purchase :).</li>
    <li> the packing box was damaged, but the I still like it.</li>
    <li> It is a very good moisturizing mask. But I am not so sure about whitening effect. It is also a little bit pricier compared to &amp;#34;my beauty diary mask&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> A best whitening facial mask from Japan. No mess just lay on your cleansed face and let it do its work. Package and Delivery was excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but compare to its price, I don&#x27;t think it worth it. Another thing, the package is already broken when I received it....</li>
    <li> The package looks old.</li>
    <li> Compare to the red box, this is more help with brightenning my face. If goes for moist of your face, go with red one &amp;#34;super moist&amp;#34;. But for brightening of your face, this one helps more.</li>
    <li> I love this facial mask, I bought them from Japan, the price is much cheaper than here, almost half of the price. Good to give it a try. Twice a week.</li>
    <li> These masks are my all time favorite!! I use this once a week for 20 mins. My skin feels smooth and soft next morning.</li>
    <li> It brightened my face right after I removed the mask!</li>
