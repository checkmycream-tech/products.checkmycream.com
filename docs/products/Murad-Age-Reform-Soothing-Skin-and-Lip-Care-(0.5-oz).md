    <li> I use this at bedtime and it always works.  Wish there was something this good for daytime.</li>
    <li> I love this protector. However, I think that they might be discontinued. I used another &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of this same product and company that was discontinued. Now it is difficult to find this version of the product.  I will miss it if it is discontinued.</li>
    <li> Love my murad products.</li>
    <li> I have very delicate skin and can&#x27;t use products with fragrances, strong chemicals, etc., and yet my lips are often dry. This is the best lip therapy I&#x27;ve ever used and I always keep a back up tube because I can&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for the worst winter chapped lips!  So I decided to use it just at night now that it&#x27;s spring...and love waking up to super soft lips!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Murad!  I used to buy this at a very popular store but they stopped carry it.  Imagine my excitement when I found it here on Amazon.  It is very nice on my lips.  I have sensitive lips and I have no problems at all using Murad Soothing Skin and Lip Care.  The price is a bit steep but it truly is worth it.  The free shipping with Prime makes it even more worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip care I have found especially if it is dry out.  It does not have a taste and lasts a really long time</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and Murad Lip Care is The Only Lip care I have found to take care of My Dry Flakie lips!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only buy this perticular Murad Age Reform Soothing Skin and Lip Care, believe Me it is the BEST</li>
    <li> I love Murad Lip care! This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for my chapped lips and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
    <li> I liked this balm, however, the price point is way too high for me.  Going back to Carmex and putting my money toward the Humane Society.</li>
    <li> I got this at Massage Envy and I absolutely love it. I have really bad chapped lips and this product is the only one I have used that makes my lips better. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but it feels a lil too much like Vaseline for my taste. It works well though.</li>
    <li> You can get other types that work just the same. I found that Aquaphor works just as effectively and the exact same for sooooo much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have used this lip balm before. I usually bought it from my previous employer and it was wonderful. This is not the same product. It smells like chemicals, it must be fraudulent product. The original smells sweet like pomegranate.</li>
    <li> There is no second opinion: this is the best that ever happened to our lips. We use it especially in the Alps while skiing. Please, Murad, never take it from your range.</li>
    <li> I shared this product with several of my friends and they also have purchased and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product for getting rid of brown spots on my face.</li>
    <li> Miracle product !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that ensures complete hydration of dried lips.</li>
    <li> My go to lip balm.  It&#x27;s not addictive and a little goes a long way.  Absorbs nicely- not tacky or oily.  I hope they never stop making this.</li>
    <li> simply amazing it moisturize my lips like no other lip balm.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years (well over 5 years) and it&#x27;s great for moisturizing my lips and keeping them in great shape. I don&#x27;t take the time to use it on my cuticles as much as I should but when I have it&#x27;s had good results.</li>
    <li> It is disappointing as this Skin and Lip Care line is not as good as the Skin and Lip therapy line.  It dries up quickly and is not rich enough.  It does not really worth the price for such a product.  Just don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t continue with the therapy line....</li>
    <li> Best lip treatment EVER. Tried it at my spa and I&#x27;m addicted. Will be buying again once this runs out.</li>
