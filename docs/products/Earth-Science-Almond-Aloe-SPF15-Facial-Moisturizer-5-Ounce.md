    <li> I like this product a lot. Nice, mild and pleasant smell. Because I have oily skin, a little goes a *long* way. It comes out of the bottle kind of solid, so before application I suggest squishing it between your fingers - this will really allow you to see how far it can spread. Those of us with oily skin definitely want to avoid applying too much of the product in one area. That said, it works well and doesn&#x27;t make my face as oily as some other moisturizers. This will definitely last me a very long time, too.</li>
    <li> Its not really a moisturizer but more of a sunscreen. Its acceptable coverage for winter but not enough SPF for summer. I smells wonderful! Not like a perfume but a fresh almost baby powder sent. It does make my face soft but also stings a little when I put it on. It will also cause me to break out on the sensitive parts of my sin.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and so far this moisturizer has not made me break out.  It is very light and has a nice light smell.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy, and protects your skin with SPF. I like that it&#x27;s more natural without all of the chemicals. I also like the face wash and night cream by the same brand. I&#x27;ve bought this moisturizer several times in a row.</li>
    <li> I tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house, and it so far surpasses any other sunblock that it is ridiculous!  It is not thick and goopy, it absorbs very easily into the skin without leaving a greasy film or white haze.  It glides on and has a very pleasant almond smell.  Also, I have incredibly sensitive skin, and this product did not cause breakouts or other irritation, which is quite the feat.  I cannot wait to have some of this stuff for myself.  Wonderful product!  Just wish it came in higher spf too.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using this as a daytime moisturizer, no shininess, just perfect!</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years now, and I love it. It is a very light cream, but it protects my skin all through the day. I just use it every morning.</li>
    <li> Good ingredients, inexpensive, works well on very dry skin, includes SPF, my go to moisturizer that I also use on my hands or forearms when I will be outside.</li>
    <li> i thought this is all natural... including the SPF&#x27;s active ingredients...  but then again, it&#x27;s my fault for not paying attention.  the smell is great and the texture is very light.  i have super oil skin, so i like things that are moisturizing but not greasy.  the smell is fine, not too strong.  unfortunately i am allergic to it.  i put it on before going out, went to BJs and went home.  about an hour in between.  my face turned completely red.  not i wasn&#x27;t sick or anything.  i tried it again on my arm...  yes, i am allergic...</li>
    <li> This is my everyday face lotion. Even though it offers SPF  protection, it doesn&#x27;t  smell like sunblock. It has a very mild smell, goes on smoothly and leaves my skins feeling moist.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great--light but moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. The built-in sunblock keeps me from burning, even if I&#x27;ve been active and sweating. I highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> i seriously swear by this stuff.  its all natural, has awesome ingredients, smells good, moisturizes really well, is good for acne prone skin.  and it has spf!!!!!!!! Wont clog pores either!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This product now contains Dimethicone.  Are you kidding me!!!!!  Dimethicone defeats the purpose of using a moisturizer as it dries your skin out.  Check out Himalayas Moisturizer.  More product same price better ingredients.</li>
    <li> this product just did not do it for me. i had acne and a little but of an oily complexion. i remember the smell was just weird, not foul but not pleasant either. i remember the consistency being like a little gritty. it did not moisturize at all. i would slather it on but id still feel dry. i use it with the clarifying wash from the same brand, and was not feeling any of them. i threw both out before they were empty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old so the years of having acne and oily skin are not so long behind me. I spent a lot of money and time trying to invest in a lightweight, good-quality moisturizer when I stumbled upon the Earth Science almond-aloe SPF 15 facial moisturizer. I LOVE this moisturizer, I use it every day. It has a very light but pleasant smell to it, and WON&#x27;T clog your pores! It goes on white but rubs in quickly and makes your skin shine and eases any redness or irritation you may be experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe soothes your skin and the almond helps protect your skin from pollutants. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost three years now and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I expected a better product since I read many good reviews about it but I was quite disapointed. It irritates my skin and it doesn&#x27;t even give a good sun protection.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for over 7 years now and I&#x27;d never have it any other way.  It feels a little thick when it first goes on, but once it sets in, it makes my skin soft and flawless.  Don&#x27;t judge it based on the first feel.  Give it a chance to set in and you&#x27;ll see why I&#x27;ve been using it for the past decade.  :)</li>
    <li> I use this and their foaming facial cleanser.  I recently went to have a facial and the technician kept saying how great my skin was.  I periodically use their mask product too.  Overall, love their stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have irritable skin, and this works well for me.</li>
    <li> At first I was worried that this product would not moisturize enough ( I have combo / sensitive skin with dry patches and redness) but as I continue to use it I realize that I seem to be breaking out less and my make-up is no longer catching on the dry patches but actually looks smooth.  I also use Simple  brand face wash almost daily but few times weekly use Earth Science Clarifying facial wash.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well, but it also caused a breakout. Once my skin got used to it my face cleared up. Face felt moisturized all day. Bottle clogs easily.</li>
