    <li> good stuff, i like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent:  Aveeno all ways is a top of the line product.</li>
    <li> My head is not as itchy</li>
    <li> Watered down not worth it. also not cheaper than buying at the store</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and dozens of products weigh it down, including salon brands. This conditioner and shampoo is amazing! I do not shampoo every day and I have never had a greasy non-shampoo/conditioner day with Aveeno.  Volume is great too.</li>

    <li> I have used various other similar product and they all seem to weigh down my hair.  The Aveeno Nourish is non greasy and adds volume, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair very soft and smells good.</li>
    <li> This Aveeno hair condition is great, it leaves your hair so soft and you just use a small amount. (Course I have short hair)</li>
    <li> I see much more volume with my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a better product for fine hair than I&#x27;ve used, but still not what I&#x27;m looking for...if that even exists.</li>
    <li> love this product.  I also buy the shampoo.  Makes my hair soft and managable</li>
    <li> I can feel the difference in my hair, much easier to brush after using this.  My hair felt dry before using this.</li>
    <li> They want a small fortune for this product in my local stores and I am tired of paying high prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo and conditioner, I use them both together and they do a good job of giving my fine color treated hair volume.  My hair does not dry out at all, it appears shiny and healthy.  My skin is sensitive and I find this shampoo is one of the few on the market that I can use.  Most shampoos and conditioners have fragrance in them that I cannot tolerate; Aveeno does not.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Too thin of a conditioner. I like a heavier conditioner and was expecting that since it is the Nourish type. Might be better for those that do not need a ton of moisture.</li>
    <li> I like Aveeno because is smells good and feels clean</li>
