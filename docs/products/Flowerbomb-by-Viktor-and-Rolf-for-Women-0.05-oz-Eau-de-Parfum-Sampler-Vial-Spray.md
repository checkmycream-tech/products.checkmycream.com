      <li>I like Marchesa Parfum d&#x27;extase as a feminine scent better</li>
      <li>Love, love ,love this scent.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy each spray!</li>
      <li>I guess if you like the smell of vanilla you will love this.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought the trial version.</li>
      <li>it is both sexy and suptle.</li>
      <li>Seriously my favorite smell in the world.</li>
      <li>Sample smelled amazing and company sent an extra sample of another great perfume</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong and eye watering or head throbbing like most perfumes out there.</li>
      <li>because I was busy reading all the great reviews.</li>
      <li>pretty nice fragrance</li>
      <li>Perfect little bottle</li>
      <li>Felt it would have been justified</li>
      <li>I regret and wish I never purchased this...waste of money and it&#x27;s a sample I could have gotten free at Sephora.</li>
      <li>Thus my mild dislike of it, came on stronger since I smelled so strongly of this perfume.</li>
      <li>I do believe this is my new and forever favorite perfume!</li>
      <li>It smells like a rich, seductive flower, and the scent lasts.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong and smells like for an older woman..</li>
      <li>Think it works for a lot of people and if you like a sweet smelling perfume, you will probably like this.</li>
      <li>Smells good but not like flowers, as the name suggests, and it doesn&#x27;t last, no one noticed I had it on,</li>
      <li>I found this to be too sweet and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>Really like the smell of this perfume!</li>
      <li>I love that it comes in a tiny spray bottle!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It smells sweet and classy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more subtle and smells so sexy...</li>
      <li>But if you are turned off by the super sweet perfumes such as Princess or Lemptika, then I say get the sampler size as well to determine if you really like it or not.</li>
      <li>Which I wanted to like so much.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast</li>
      <li>Too much like Lemptika Lolita.</li>
      <li>Very small but a good sample.</li>
      <li>Ordered two of these and the company sent me one complimentary different scent.</li>
      <li>Live and learn</li>
      <li>Now I live it too ( Spice Bomb).</li>
      <li>I like the scent over time, it changes from a spicy floral vanilla and warms to something soft and feminine.</li>
      <li>It does not smell old grannyish, no offense to anyone reading this.</li>
      <li>Its a little too sweet smelling for me.</li>
      <li>I do not live next to a mall or big city and cannot sample fragrances first before buying.</li>
      <li>The first few hours of the fragrance I found to be a little much, even with just one spritz from the sampler on a wrist.</li>

<li> ;) I&#x27;ve only used half a spray maybe 4 times (only a couple of drops spray out) and only have half a vile left, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other sample perfumes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> The other downside was opening the package and it was leaking and got all over me.</li>
<li> My wife having a small version to keep in her purse.</li>
<li> The shipping price to get this little package though is ridiculous!</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t realize though that this size was a serious miniature.</li>
<li> While I like it a little, it was a very expensive purchase.</li>
<li> Sorry,  but this smell gives me a head ache.  </li>
<li> Stupid me,  for not reading the description,</li>

    <li> Smells good but not like flowers, as the name suggests, and it doesn&#x27;t last, no one noticed I had it on, not even my boyfriend and he always kisses my neck....</li>
    <li> Like scent but so $$ I wont buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite perfume.  It smells like a rich, seductive flower, and the scent lasts.  It&#x27;s not like any fragrance I&#x27;ve ever used.  I will definitely be buying this fragrance again.  A great summer perfume!</li>
    <li> Love this flower/rose smell. It does not smell old grannyish, no offense to anyone reading this. It smells sweet and classy. Really enjoy each spray!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant fragrance. Lasts through the day.</li>
    <li> I found this to be too sweet and not something I would wear.  Good bottle design and name but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> pretty nice fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!!! The shipping price to get this little package though is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> Great way to figure out if you like a fragrance without having to spend a fortune. I do not live next to a mall or big city and cannot sample fragrances first before buying. Love the smell!</li>
    <li> Very small but a good sample.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome perfume that stays with u all day...</li>
    <li> Love, love ,love this scent. But can&#x27;t afford a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; size. Ordered two of these and the company sent me one complimentary different scent. Now I live it too ( Spice Bomb). Get it!!</li>
    <li> The Fragrance is Very Sexy!</li>
    <li> My wife having a small version to keep in her purse.</li>
    <li> Sorry,  but this smell gives me a head ache.  Can&#x27;t believe I paid for samples.. Stupid me,  for not reading the description, because I was busy reading all the great reviews. Just not my kind of scent..doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers to me.  It&#x27;s very strong and smells like for an older woman.. I regret and wish I never purchased this...waste of money and it&#x27;s a sample I could have gotten free at Sephora. Sample seems to be used too.  Live and learn</li>
    <li> Perfect little bottle so I could try it out. I do believe this is my new and forever favorite perfume! It isn&#x27;t as strong and eye watering or head throbbing like most perfumes out there. It&#x27;s more subtle and smells so sexy... And fancy! ;) I&#x27;ve only used half a spray maybe 4 times (only a couple of drops spray out) and only have half a vile left, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other sample perfumes I&#x27;ve tried. All in all, I love it!</li>
    <li> smells awesome. Arrived fast</li>
    <li> I guess if you like the smell of vanilla you will love this. I was hoping it smelled like roses or a garden. It did smell kindnof good but i got irratated of it after a week.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try Flowerbomb before buying it. after the sample, i did buy a bottle.  i love this scent it is both sexy and suptle.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and the size was perfect to fit in my purse. I would recommend this fragrance...I get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Seriously my favorite smell in the world. I love that it comes in a tiny spray bottle!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great smell, but I should have just gotten a sample from the mall instead.</li>
    <li> I like the scent over time, it changes from a spicy floral vanilla and warms to something soft and feminine. The first few hours of the fragrance I found to be a little much, even with just one spritz from the sampler on a wrist. I like Marchesa Parfum d&#x27;extase as a feminine scent better but I&#x27;ll wear this once in a while too.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought the trial version. While I like it a little, it was a very expensive purchase. Felt it would have been justified had i LOVED it- but I don&#x27;t. Its a little too sweet smelling for me. Too much like Lemptika Lolita. Which I wanted to like so much. The other downside was opening the package and it was leaking and got all over me. Thus my mild dislike of it, came on stronger since I smelled so strongly of this perfume. Think it works for a lot of people and if you like a sweet smelling perfume, you will probably like this. But if you are turned off by the super sweet perfumes such as Princess or Lemptika, then I say get the sampler size as well to determine if you really like it or not.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites! Smells great! Thanks!</li>
