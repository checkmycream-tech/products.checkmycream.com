    <li> I TRIED THIS PRODUCT  OUT ITS AMAZING.I LIKE THE DIFFERENT SCENTS IT COMES IN AND THIS  WAS MUCH CHEAPER THEN THE LOCAL STORES..</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product highly enough.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before and it was good, but they seem to have changed the formulation.  What I got this time was a gummy substance that could not be applied.  I tried adding water to thin it to usability but that didn&#x27;t help. I won&#x27;t be buying Freeman products again.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  I have been using Freeman Cucumber Facial Peel Off Mask for nearly 20 years. Once you peel off the mask your skin is so soft and clean. It gets rid of the dead skin and you face is really clean. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants fresh clean skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin soft without irritation.  Scent is mild, which I prefer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have sensitive skin and this product is great to help softening the skin and removing impurities.</li>

    <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the effect of the older peel off masks I have used.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the pores very well.  It does however leave the face feeling silky.</li>
    <li> Awesome bought three more</li>

    <li> Great for getting blackheads out. Will dry your face out if you use it 3 or more times a week. I wish it would spread a bit easier (it&#x27;s very thick). A good product overall.</li>

    <li> Good stuff, just don&#x27;t get it in your hair.  Hard to get out of eyebrows, sideburns, etc. OUCH!</li>
