      <li>Along with the skinny serum my hair has never looked better .</li>
      <li>My hair felt smoother, cleaner and much more manageable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner...</li>
      <li>Most hair products are always trying to create volume and add to your hair.</li>
      <li>If it were a minty or even a floral scent it would be better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not used to my hair looking greasy, so this took some getting used to but for daily hair washers this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used better shampoo from the grocery store.</li>
      <li>There are just too many counterfeiters out there these days.</li>
      <li>I love Paul Mitchell products... just not this one.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Great product for very course hair.  </li>
      <li>Also, it is very friendly for colored hair.</li>
      <li>Best price I could find and product was exactly as described fast delivery.</li>
      <li>and was always instructed to use a special kind of keratin shampoo and conditioner free of sulfates.</li>
      <li>Since the serum works magic in my hair and Paul Mitchell is cruelty free, I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I really think someone in their warehouse is switching out the good stuff with something from a dollar store.  </li>
      <li>A while back I decided to try the serum and loved it!  </li>
      <li>The product smells awesome and it helps defrizz my hair.its quite expensive but is a great buy.</li>
      <li>My hair snags so easily</li>
      <li>I usually love Paul Mitchell products (Gloss Drops are great), but will definitely be tossing this one out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to manage.</li>
      <li>conditioner is really strong and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It is an incredibly lightweight shampoo and conditioner set that allows you to wash hair semi-daily without making it dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have fine blond wavy to curly hair.</li>
      <li>It works for my hair just fine.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited about this because I love the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny serum</li>
      <li>The conditioner leaves a film or tack in your hair and never makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
      <li>So light.</li>
      <li>This is great for my hair, I have wavy to curly hair that I&#x27;m currently growing out from sun and chemical damage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>I tried many cheaper products with out much success.  </li>
      <li>Everyones hair is different, so for some folks this may be great</li>
      <li>She loved it and to this day, I will never forget what her 9 year old son said after using it:</li>
      <li>It arrived in a timely manner, it is exactly what I wanted/ordered , and has been great thus far!</li>
      <li>Smells great, good cleaning and conditioning with out weighing hair down too much.</li>
      <li>The product was fine and it delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>I love the WHOLE super skinny line!</li>
      <li>You have to use double/triple the amount of shampoo to get that clean feeling in your hair.  </li>
      <li>Out of all the MANY brands I have tried, I must say that this has to be my favorite by far.</li>
      <li>clean, SLEEK, slippery shampoo washes and untangles my hair in the wash cycle..</li>
      <li>I have coarse curly hair and this does a good job of managing.</li>
      <li>My waist length hair dries so quickly now too.</li>
      <li>but when I used the Shampoo and Conditioner it made my hair super oily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost as if it has a mild relaxer in it, though I don&#x27;t believe this is the case.</li>
      <li>It was NOT paul Mitchell super skinny.  </li>
      <li>The Super Skinny shampoo and conditioner though just don&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i have to update this to say i am really enjoying the new sulfate-free varieties out there...</li>
      <li>If your main need from a shampoo is to make your hair feel REALLY clean without feeling stripped, try this out, it&#x27;s super!</li>
      <li>The Smoothing set gives you a gentle washing without stripping your hair of the natural oils needed for a healthy hair look, and it&#x27;s also good for some treated hair types that need gentle shampoos to preserve the new texture of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really just don&#x27;t enjoy this product at all.</li>
      <li>well, it&#x27;s not even worth 2 bucks.</li>
      <li>and it felt like I had a weeks worth of product in my hair</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.​</li>
      <li>But it seems that this product is not the right choice for my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s most likely from not washing the product out of your hair completely, which you HAVE TO make sure you do.</li>
      <li>But, only if and I say IF you have a certain kind of hair.</li>
      <li>my hair was instantly softer and more shiny, and they was from using Pantene..Would not recommend.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My stylist uses the super skinny serum on my hair for styling, so naturally i thought i would like the shampoo and conditioner. Instead, i feel like every time i wash my hair it is covered in wax. Its hard to brush and feels like there is just product build up like crazy. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and a dry scalp.  I can usually wash my hair every other day.  My stylist highly recommended this shampoo and conditioner.  I tried them, and so wanted to love them.  But they left a slippery build-up on my hair.  My husband even commented that my hair felt oily, and he didn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;d switched to a new shampoo and conditioner.  I, too, noticed that my hair felt greasy, and my scalp itched terribly.  I kept using the product, hoping I&#x27;d change my mind, with very dissatisfactory results.  I found myself switching back to other cheaper drugstore brands and feeling relieved at how much better my hair felt when I wasn&#x27;t using the Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner.  I would then try the Paul Mitchell again, only to have the same poor results.  I finally abandoned the Paul Mitchell completely.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It truly was the worst shampoo and conditioner for my hair that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I was very disappointed, as I wanted it to work (especially after buying the large-size bottles!).</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel dirty and even if I rinse it for longer it still feels like I left conditioner in my hair and is painful to brush.  I&#x27;m really disappointed!  I have very thick, course hair.  It just takes the life and shine out of it.  I like the smell of it though!</li>
    <li> I love this line, but don&#x27;t buy it from this vendor.  The product I was sent is not good.  My hairdresser said that it is fake Paul Mitchell.  This product is causing my hair to be coarse and unruly.  Now I need a clarifying shampoo to get my hair back to normal.</li>
    <li> I love the WHOLE super skinny line! I was suprised to read some bad reviews for it though. Many people complain of a greasiness or \\&quot;build up\\&quot; on the hair after use, but it&#x27;s not really build up. It&#x27;s most likely from not washing the product out of your hair completely, which you HAVE TO make sure you do. When used right, this line has a wonderful shampoo &amp; conditioner as well as the super skinny serum (it&#x27;s a must have for me and my friends with any haircare regimen!) I&#x27;ve paid $150 for the keratin straightening treatment to be done on my hair (It works amazingly to straighten and smooth your hair for months!) and was always instructed to use a special kind of keratin shampoo and conditioner free of sulfates. I&#x27;ve been desperately searching for something free of sulfates that also conditions my hair enough. I finally gave in and tried the super skinny (which has few sulfates) and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I don&#x27;t even need to get the keratin treatment done again yet and last time I did it was 5 months ago! I have long hair that tends to be dry if not conditioned enough, but this line was perfect!     Hope I helped! xxx</li>
    <li> I have reviewed this product as a single item as well. This product is great for me: Irish/English curly/frizzy/dry hair. Virtually all shampoos tangle my hair--some to the point where I can&#x27;t even rinse out the shampoo because my hair has turned into an impenetrable dreadlock. I literally have to put on conditioner sometimes just to rinse out the shampoo!! I do not have normal Caucasian hair! Plus I have relaxed and bleached it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you wash it, your hair actually feels like normal human hair instead of a brillo pad! This shampoo first taught me that a good result starts with a good shampoo. Previously I thought I could use any shampoo I wanted and then use a heavy duty conditioner to make my hair feel human again (and not rip my fingernails off while trying to get through it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is really strong and moisturizing. It will last you a year! I wish they would put it into a tub as it is difficult to get it out of the container because it is so thick. A great value, for sure. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this to an African-American friend who has very frizzy, tough hair. She loved it and to this day, I will never forget what her 9 year old son said after using it: \\&quot;Mommy, my hair feels so soft!\\&quot; :  It warms my heart!</li>
    <li> I never thought I could actually come to hate a shampoo/conditioner, but I have.  I&#x27;ve only used this for 3 days and I am throwing it all away.  I won&#x27;t even give it away.  This stuff leaves my hair feeling and even looking gross, greasy and dirty.  When I finish blow drying my hair, I have a grimy feeling all over my hands and my hair looks so gross and I wanted to get back in the shower to wash my hair with any product other than this junk.  At first, I thought maybe I just didn&#x27;t rinse my hair enough so I made sure the next time to really rinse well.  No difference.  I can&#x27;t imagine what my hair would be like after using the whole 10 oz bottle.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> I love Paul Mitchell products... just not this one. I have fine, limp, long, naturally oily hair, and this shampoo DOES NOT work well for my hair type. It leaves my hair heavy, stiff, waxy and greasy at the nape. It never feels dry at all, even hours after washing. To be fair, I stuck with the shampoo and conditioner until I had used at least half the bottle to give it a fair test... and I will never buy it again. Over time, the buildup, waxy feeling, and stiff, odd texture just kept getting worse.</li>
    <li> Great product for very course hair.  I have dry and wavy hair and this works great to allow the curl to be nice and beach like without frizz.  Would only recommend for someone with very thick hair.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have found for my hair.  My hair snags so easily I have a terrible time combing it out.  This conditioner seems to minimize that problem for me.  I tried many cheaper products with out much success.  Not sure the Shampoo does any better than the others but I like to use matched products.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works great but the conditioner makes your hair feel dirtier then before you washed it! I still use the shampoo but will not be using the conditioner again.</li>
    <li> No leaks!  That&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have been using for many years and my hair is thick and curly... if I&#x27;m out my hair will not do anything and feels really dry... I love this product and need for hair</li>
    <li> This line is great! But, only if and I say IF you have a certain kind of hair. Most hair products are always trying to create volume and add to your hair. Which is bad for hair that (and this is the kind of hair I was referring to)is just big, like where when you go to the salon they have to chop the heck out of it to take the weight out and it will be curly in some places and not in others; if you cut it to your chin, your head would look like a mushroom, THAT kind of hair. I wouldn&#x27;t use this hair on pencil straight hair or thin hair, it would probably make it lifeless or give it an oily appearance. The product is not oily, and it doesn&#x27;t have the feeling of adding a smoothing agent. It&#x27;s almost as if it has a mild relaxer in it, though I don&#x27;t believe this is the case. The scent is light and kind of reminds me of watermelon. If your main need from a shampoo is to make your hair feel REALLY clean without feeling stripped, try this out, it&#x27;s super!</li>
    <li> Not sure if the product was old or what but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same as the product I bought from my stylist. I won&#x27;t be buying again!</li>
    <li> Out of all the MANY brands I have tried, I must say that this has to be my favorite by far. Say good bye to all the frizzies. I absolutely love the way my hair feels, love the way my hair shines and I love the smell. I recommended it to one of my friends and she said it made her hair oily. I was very surprised when she told me that. I guess it doesn&#x27;t work on all hair types. If it should help anyone, I have dry hair at the ends and normal hair close to the scalp. My hair is between wavy and straight.  I love it and I will still recommend it to everyone except people that have oily hair to begin with.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, bleached hair. I get a keratin treatment a few times a year. I tried this conditioner since it claims your hair will dry faster (my hair is porous and takes a long time to dry). The first time I used it, my hair felt heavy and greasy, so I thought I just didn&#x27;t rinse well enough. I used it again this morning, rinsing really well, and the same thing happened. The back is so coated and filmy that my blonde hair looks light brown. My flatiron won&#x27;t even penetrate through it! Glad to see others feel the same way...thought I was going crazy! I usually love Paul Mitchell products (Gloss Drops are great), but will definitely be tossing this one out.</li>
    <li> Got dry colored medium long curly hair?&lt;br /&gt;i would say my hair is fine to medium course...dry and needs care..believe me i know what a bad&lt;br /&gt;hair day is.&lt;br /&gt;This clean, SLEEK, slippery shampoo washes and untangles my hair in the wash cycle..WHAT?..yes it does..it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING and little bit goes a long long way.  Its conditioner/treatment is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have to update this to say i am really enjoying the new sulfate-free varieties out there... my&lt;br /&gt;hair loves them/never been healthier...loreal evercreme and deva curl are great products and my&lt;br /&gt;other POO products are not getting the same attention.</li>
    <li> A while back I decided to try the serum and loved it!  My hair is incredibly thick, coarse, naturally wavy and dyed.  Since the serum works magic in my hair and Paul Mitchell is cruelty free, I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner.  Unlike the shampoo and conditioner I had been using previously (Organix Teatree and mint), I only had to use a small amount of the Paul Mitchell brand.&lt;br /&gt;I come from Greek/Italian heritage and I have tried so many different brands, even brands geared towards women of color and I&#x27;ve never really been satisfied with anything until now.&lt;br /&gt;This product sort of lessens dry time...I really haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a change there, but I didn&#x27;t purchase it for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The major downsides of Paul Mitchell products are:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Price.  It&#x27;s expensive...It&#x27;s basically 2-3 times more expensive than your average hair care brand.  But if you have the money to splurge, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The scent/smell.  I have a really sensitive sense of smell and this stuff has a fruity scent to it.  I am not a fan of fruity scents.  If it were a minty or even a floral scent it would be better.  It smells a bit like Garnier Fruitis.&lt;br /&gt;To me the reasons to buy it are:&lt;br /&gt;1.) It sort of saves me money.  Instead of buying up 2-3 bottles of conditioner at a time and using a quarter of a bottle everytime I wash my hair...I think I&#x27;ve used maybe an eighth of a bottle of the Paul Mitchell brand and it&#x27;s been 4 washes.&lt;br /&gt;2.) It&#x27;s cruelty free.  Paul Mitchell doesn&#x27;t test on animals and I prefer putting my purchasing power towards companies that don&#x27;t torture animals and don&#x27;t use tax payer dollars to afford such torture.&lt;br /&gt;Something to consider:&lt;br /&gt;Before dropping the dough on this particular line, make sure you have the right hair type for these products.  Ask your stylist if they&#x27;d recommend it for your type of hair.  This product is NOT for everyone who thinks they have thick/unruly hair.  And make sure you only use a small amountand rinse it out cleanly.  Some reviewers have complained about the residue and if you use to much of any brand there will be residue.  And also beware of who you purchase from.  ALWAYS check to make sure the seller is a reputable and licensed seller of the line/product.  There are just too many counterfeiters out there these days.</li>
    <li> love that I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of this to wash my hair, have had it for 3 months and still have 3/4 of a bottle of each.</li>
    <li> I was persuaded by the hair salon rep to get the shampoo and, since I started using it last week, my hair has been breaking off in clumps. Even in the shower I swear I&#x27;m pulling chunks out of my hair. Alarming to say the least. Thankfully I have a thick head of hair so nobody has noticed it yet. But if I keep using it, I&#x27;m probably going to go bald. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Worst ever !!!!! I used twice and both times my hair was left straw like and tangled .. I had high hopes for the product but was very disappointed. I would never recommend this product to anyone !!!!!</li>
    <li> This whole line of products is excellent! I haven&#x27;t run out yet. This is fantastic for people with course thick hair. I have very long hair. I need to do a clarifying shampoo twice a month with this product. but it&#x27;s worth it.​</li>
    <li> Love this! My hair looks &amp; feels amazing! It&#x27;s so easy to manage.</li>
    <li> My friend saw a recommendation on some magazine, so she bought it. She loves it so much that she recommend it to me. But it seems that this product is not the right choice for my hair.</li>
    <li> Really changed my hair</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo/conditioner alot.  It works for my hair just fine.  It has a nice scent and is affordable.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely manner, it is exactly what I wanted/ordered , and has been great thus far! This stuff really helps control my crazy hair!</li>
    <li> The product was fine and it delivered quickly. The only problem I had was minor leakage around the cap upon opening the package but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. This is great for my hair, I have wavy to curly hair that I&#x27;m currently growing out from sun and chemical damage.</li>
    <li> Best price I could find and product was exactly as described fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. I was pressed into buying it from my salon, and at $10+ a bottle... well, it&#x27;s not even worth 2 bucks. This stuff leaves so much product and residue on my hair, I can&#x27;t straiten or do anything with it. I kept having to rinse my hands off just from trying to brush my hair out, and even that was a struggle. Other people say you are supposed to let it rinse out. I stood in my shower for 4 minutes rinsing from all angles trying to get the stuff out, and it felt like I did. But once my hair dried, it was even worse than the first time I used it. Just trying to straiten a piece of hair smelled like burning flesh. I will never buy another product from this company again, this stuff is horrible to use and work with. I have fine blond wavy to curly hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo itself is wonderful. I&#x27;ve used this treatment by Paul Mitchell before and it has done wonders for my very thick and unruly hair. I give a rating of two stars due to the condition of the package I received. In truth, It bewilders me on how this package even made it to my front door. To say it in my most eloquent way, it was beat to all hell! All four corners of the box were smashed and the box itself was covered in what looked like soot.I pick it up to find that I can feel the bottles of shampoo rolling around. I open it up to see that there are four measly pieces of newspaper for packaging and that&#x27;s it. The bottles of shampoo unsurprisingly resembled the box that it came in. How they did not explode while shipping is a miracle. I chose to order from Barlett Discount Beauty. I was charged over 13 dollars for shipping and it arrived in terrible condition. A forewarning to all those considering this seller.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have naturally kinky curly hair that poofs up into an afro during the right weather.I dont brush it dry, only when wet to avoid frizz.  If you don&#x27;t have the right type of hair then don&#x27;t waste your money, but I happen to love this product. My hair felt smoother, cleaner and much more manageable. I absolutely love this product. I cannot find it anywhere in town anymore, thankfully Amazon has it!</li>
    <li> Works amazing on thick fine hair.. Frizzy to smooth with one wash and dry. This is the real deal!l</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> These are great products for taming thick hair.  They should be used together.</li>
    <li> Love me some Paul Mitchell Skinny!  I have to say that I have a lot of issues with tangles when I get out of the shower and sometimes it take me longer to comb my hair out (it is barely shoulder length) then to shower.  This product is transforming and my hair is so easy to comb through!  Try it you will love it!  Also, it is very friendly for colored hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great value.</li>
    <li> Great for straighting your hair</li>
    <li> Really helps reduce the curl and especially frizz in my hair.  It keeps my hair feeling soft and sliky in the shower instead of the way curly hair feels bunched up with other shampoos/conditioners.  When I blow dry and straighten my hair, it really, really reduces the frizz and lessens the tendency for it to curl back up.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner... So light. Along with the skinny serum my hair has never looked better .</li>
    <li> I chose this shampoo and conditioner because I wanted something name brand and because I have used the Paul Mitchell serum and loved it.  This shampoo and conditioner is terrible!  It left the nastiest residue or build up in my hair.  It felt like wax.  My hair stylist told me to throw it away and never use it again, she had to use dish soap strength stuff to get it out of my hair (as if it were grease).  I would not recommend this to anyone, it&#x27;s the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would by this when there are way better products out there.</li>
    <li> I have thin-normal hair but a lot of it.  This product leaves the NASTIEST build up on your hair.  When I brush out my hair it leaves my brush white!  But the thing is you can&#x27;t even brush out the waxy feel until you wash it again.  My hair feels like wax, it is disgusting.  It may work for thick, very frizzy hair, but if you have normal to thin hair- even if it somewhat damaged- DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT! Unless you like waxy gross hair.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this because I love the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny serum but when I used the Shampoo and Conditioner it made my hair super oily. It was almost like there was a build up at my roots.  I even tried using less conditioner and then no conditioner but I still had the same problem.</li>
    <li> One of my fav shampoo and conditioners.  I have coarse curly hair and this does a good job of managing.</li>
    <li> Helps manage curly/frizzy/dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair, although I get keratin treatments... This helps my hair stay stick straight. I Aldo like the smell. Wish it came with pumps to get to the middle/bottom of bottle.</li>
    <li> The product smells awesome and it helps defrizz my hair.its quite expensive but is a great buy. I&#x27;m bi racial and I really didn&#x27;t knw what to use for my hair and this product does the job.</li>
    <li> After reading the product description and the reviews I was anxious to try this product, by sadly I was very disappointed.  It did not make my hair soft, smooth, or easier to dry and style…just the opposite in fact, my hair felt course when wet, and just heavy and un-manageable when dry.  It seem frizzier that normal and I had to spend even more time trying to get it smoothed out with my flat iron, and then due to the heavy feel it made it seem dirty and oily.  Everyones hair is different, so for some folks this may be great…just be aware it may not work the same for you, and it is a lot to spend on a product you cannot return!</li>
    <li> Weighs my hair down.  It&#x27;s okay.  I will use it on occassion or  I will put it below in my cupboard and will probably forget I have it.</li>
    <li> Alright, I bought this product because I was hoping it would help my frizzing ends and shorten the dry time.  The thing is, the rest of my hair is normal.  When I washed it the first time, I put a leave in conditioner in as well and it felt like I had a weeks worth of product in my hair so I tried again only putting the leave in on my ends. Still coated in film. Then I just washed it, making sure to get everything out and not putting any product in my hair and it was still coated. I&#x27;m assuming from my experience that this is NOT the shampoo for people with normal hair but damaged ends.  While it did smooth out my ends and shorten the dry time, it&#x27;s not worth the gross build up.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend purchasing this product off of Amazon to ANYONE. Stick to buying it in the salons, it will cost you more in the long run but it will save you a headache in the end. I purchased this as it is my favorite shampoo/conditioner and I figured I&#x27;d save a few bucks and it would be more convenient for me as I would have to drive at least half hour to the nearest salon to get it. Biggest mistake and waste of money I&#x27;ve made. I put the shampoo in and I thought it smelled a little different from what I&#x27;m used to, then I put the conditioner in and that smelled normal. When I got out of the shower I couldn&#x27;t even brush my hair, I have long thick hair so it was very painful. I ended up getting back in the shower and rewashing my hair with some other cheaper store brand stuff I had, at least with that I could brush my wet hair. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT ONLINE</li>
    <li> I usually trust Paul Mitchell and like their products.  The Super Skinny shampoo and conditioner though just don&#x27;t cut it.  You have to use double/triple the amount of shampoo to get that clean feeling in your hair.  The conditioner leaves a film or tack in your hair and never makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I had a lye treatment done to my hair and bought this product (along with the Skinny Serum) on the recommendation of my stylist.  It is an incredibly lightweight shampoo and conditioner set that allows you to wash hair semi-daily without making it dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because my hair normally is so dry, I was used to washing it once every three days (not to worry, I still wash the rest of my body on a daily basis), mostly because most shampoos are so harsh that this was all my hair could take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this set I find that my hair starts to look greasy after the second day because the product is so light.  I&#x27;m not used to my hair looking greasy, so this took some getting used to but for daily hair washers this is perfect.  The Smoothing set gives you a gentle washing without stripping your hair of the natural oils needed for a healthy hair look, and it&#x27;s also good for some treated hair types that need gentle shampoos to preserve the new texture of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because the set is expensive and I wish it gave a slightly deeper clean in one washing, but it&#x27;s still a great product I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, it&#x27;s going in the trash!!! Dried out my hair</li>
    <li> Smells great, good cleaning and conditioning with out weighing hair down too much. My waist length hair dries so quickly now too.</li>
    <li> This product was not the actual Paul Mitchell version but a knockoff. Don&#x27;t waste your money! My hair could definitely tell the difference. In fact as soon as I stopped using this product my hair was instantly softer and more shiny, and they was from using Pantene..Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy this shampoo because I have frizzy hair. This shampoo and conditioner is way to heavy and yucky feeling. I really just don&#x27;t enjoy this product at all.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and I figured this would be a good choice but I wrong. It made my hair feel coarser. I can usually avoid tangles with most conditioners, but not this one. Not buying this one again.</li>
    <li> After getting out of the shower I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through my hair.  It was so tanglelyhttp://www.amazon.com/Tools-Accessories-Hair-Makeup/b/ref&#x3D;sv_bt_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;node&#x3D;11062741 and pieces of my hair were ripping out of my head, which is probably because i was being too harsh, but I&#x27;m used to being able to smoothly glide the brush.  In my experience if hair is too hard to brush its because it has been dried out.  After drying and straightening my hair it now looks so greasy its as if I haven&#x27;t bathed in two weeks.  I don&#x27;t want to go out in public like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair that is thick because there is so much, but thin in that it can look greasy easily with too much product.  Its wavy in an ugly not all over way, and frizzy.  After using this product it is straight but its so flat on my head it looks dirty.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo as a Christmas present and fell in love (purchased at a salon).  When it ran out, I bought this set.  It was NOT paul Mitchell super skinny.  It made my hair feel like wax - thick and stiff.  It was repulsive. I&#x27;ve used better shampoo from the grocery store. The only reason this vendor gets any rating is because they gave me a refund on the nasty stuff.  I really think someone in their warehouse is switching out the good stuff with something from a dollar store.  Don&#x27;t buy from this vendor.</li>
