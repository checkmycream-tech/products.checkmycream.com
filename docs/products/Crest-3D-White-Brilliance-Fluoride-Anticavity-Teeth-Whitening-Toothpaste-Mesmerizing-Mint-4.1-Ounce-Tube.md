### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I am very impressed.</li>
      <li>Crest sent me the wonderful kit to help make your teeth whiter after one step.</li>
      <li>perfect.</li>
      <li>Best tooth whitening products I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>This is a GREAT GREAT GREAT product!</li>
      <li>What a great feeling.</li>
      <li>and while I do notice a difference it&#x27;s not that great of a difference.  </li>
      <li>This one doesn’t taste that great</li>
      <li>I find this remarkable.  </li>
      <li>I also had good results re:</li>
      <li>GOOD  </li>
      <li>They taste okay and works great.</li>
      <li>and they didn’t work so good, but this one is truly amazing.</li>
      <li>(I take those kind of claims on toothpaste and rinses with a bit of skepticism), but it is a good paste.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, it does not contain peroxide which many reviewers claim to taste.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy this kind again.</li>
      <li>copious amounts of it to be honest.</li>
      <li>After using the toothpaste, yeah my mouth feels great and clean.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong mint taste kinda like altoids.</li>
      <li>Most often experienced after I ate, my mouth would feel minty and cool, like just after brushing.  </li>
      <li>perhaps this is a &amp;#34;poor woman&#x27;s treatment&amp;#34; to full lips without going through the pain of injections!! :)</li>
      <li>But it does taste good and works as a good toothpaste for making my mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It is a process for sure</li>
      <li>But as a way of whitening your teeth, I would have to say that there are better options out there.</li>
      <li>This Crest White 3D Brilliance toothpaste is excellent stuff.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>My mouth felt better all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the best success using it in conjunction with an electric toothbrush, to really ensure everything&#x27;s getting cleaned up.</li>
      <li>, what more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>And for the most part, all toothpaste seems to whiten the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
      <li>I still haven&#x27;t seen many results, but I will continue to be patient and hopefully I&#x27;ll notice the whitening effects in no time.</li>
      <li>Since I gave up my diet sodas and have started drinking more coffee and iced tea, I have noticed that my teeth have become somewhat stained.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I think the toothpaste is probably more of a maintenance type whitening.</li>
      <li>Need I say more.</li>
      <li>and I like everything that I can judge about it more: the mouthfeel, the look of the tube, and most importantly, the fact that it comes in a stand-up tube that frees up space around my bathroom sink.</li>
      <li>This is a high-grade toothpaste that tastes great, develops a nice foam, and leaves my mouth feeling terrific.  </li>
      <li>I see it as a good maintenance product after a professional whitening service or for very lightly discolored teeth, nothing more.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice minty taste and makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
      <li>It leaves a clean and refreshing taste in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>The toothpaste is a mix of gel and paste, and bubbles easily and continues to lather without wearing out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will say that both my wife and I love the way this toothpaste feels, it foams up and when you&#x27;re done brushing, your teeth feel really clean as does the rest of your mouth.</li>
      <li>It was an easy substitute to make.</li>
      <li>and the flavor is minty but not too strong</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any special whitening or refreshing qualities in it.</li>
      <li>taste is fine.</li>
      <li>First of all, don&#x27;t expect this to make your teeth perfectly pearly white.</li>
      <li>I use it with the brilliance boost and after 2 times notice a HUGE difference.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely great toothpaste, but I have not really been able to tell that it has whitened my teeth.</li>
      <li>and I can already see a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Although nothing will make it taste better, you will have fresh taste in your mouth all day.  </li>
      <li>I love how it makes my teeth sparkle and how it makes my breathe so fresh.</li>
      <li>It tastes really good actually and has little beads in it that do wonderful powers.</li>
      <li>but you sure do notice a difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t get to excited about immediate results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Crest 3D brilliance is a unique toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s more effective at whitening or not, but it&#x27;s at the same price point</li>
      <li>What I can say is this: of all of the toothpastes and mouthwashes I have used over the years that promise your mouth will feel clean for hours</li>
      <li>&#x27;s the thing, peroxide kills germs and whitens teeth, this toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a full month now</li>
      <li>Good but unremarkable flavor, with no noticeable whitening effect even when used daily, I would say perhaps TOO foamy.</li>
      <li>My last experience with Crest was nothing like this one and that is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>Considering how much this goes for, I was expecting more.</li>
      <li>When I’m done brushing, my mouth feels super clean and stays that way.</li>
      <li>Overall this is fantastic and effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It tastes excellent and the fresh feeling continues to last five to ten minutes afterwards.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this option, and will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
      <li>This new toothpaste is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always thought it had a great taste and slightly helps whiten your teeth when you use it.  </li>
      <li>toothpaste has a fairly strong but not unpleasant minty taste and produces a normal amount of foam when using an electric brush.</li>
      <li>While Crest 3D did help to whiten my teeth, it wasn&#x27;t particularly effective (nor were any of the others) unless I rinsed my mouth and/or brushed my teeth soon after drinking coffee or wine or eating blueberries.  </li>
      <li>Mesmerizing Mint Flavor</li>
      <li>To be honest, I felt as if I had just left the dentist.</li>
      <li>Using brilliance was, quite literally, a breath of fresh air.</li>
      <li>but it foams up and cleans the plaque right off.</li>
      <li>I also really appreciate that the fresh feeling in my mouth lasted for a few hours during the day, whereas most others tend to wear off.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this and will continue to use it as my primary toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Maybe they were &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34; as much as they were clean and polished.</li>
      <li>The last thing that I appreciate about the product is that the steps were very easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>not that cool, fresh brushed feeling that I love so much.  </li>
      <li>BUT, I will say it&#x27;s a good toothpaste to maybe take a slight shade off the color of your teeth.</li>
      <li>Toothpaste is a good, if a little pricy, product.  </li>
      <li>Then lastly use the strips and these are super easy.</li>
      <li>my teeth were discolored in the first place.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The label claims that you will see noticeable whiting after your first use and after a week I can legitimately see a difference on my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I used this toothpaste for the first time this morning</li>
      <li>And then my teeth looked noticeably whiter after the first use.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it in the future.</li>
      <li>Perhaps a more concerted effort on my part (brushing several times a day) might give me the results I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This toothpaste feels a little more grainy than the older version, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Unlike whitening strips, which can be effective in only a few treatments, you need to consistently use this paste over the period of a few weeks for best results.</li>
      <li>Another thing that I love so much about this product is how it is incorporated into my daily brushing routine.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels fresh and teeth are smooth for hours after use, and the flavor is a solid mint without being too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I much preferred using the Crest White Polishing treatment which gives better results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice, but I&#x27;ll more than likely will stick with the other toothpaste that I normally buy once this runs out.</li>
      <li>It is good but not memorable in any way.</li>
      <li>One package and two long strips placing is pretty easy until you get to the molars</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is promoted to add shine and luster after just one use, but I didn&#x27;t really notice that.</li>
      <li>One month after starting the product, the light stains are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In 2 days I see a difference! Seriously I wish I had taken before and after pictures. And I swear my teeth feel cleaner (could be imagining it but I swear they do). It has a very strong mint taste kinda like altoids. If you don&#x27;t like minty things this is not for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to ascertain the whitening power of a toothpaste, but I do notice that my teeth are at their whitest when I use this product regularly over a few weeks. It also has a nice minty taste and makes my mouth feel fresh. I love this toothpaste and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> I also had good results re:whitening, however when I use this paste at night my lips become swollen or &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34; by morning! Anyone else share this result? The only thing I changed recently is my toothpaste, to this one. My lips remain weirdly uncomfortable all day....perhaps this is a &amp;#34;poor woman&#x27;s treatment&amp;#34; to full lips without going through the pain of injections!! :)</li>
    <li> First of all, don&#x27;t expect this to make your teeth perfectly pearly white. It&#x27;s not going to. BUT, I will say it&#x27;s a good toothpaste to maybe take a slight shade off the color of your teeth. It made my teeth slightly whiter (noticeable), but not significantly.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT GREAT GREAT product! This along with the boost works wonders! Best tooth whitening products I&#x27;ve ever used! EVER! Btw..I&#x27;m a smoker. Need I say more. Just get it!</li>
    <li> Quite a few whitening toothpastes have made it onto my teeth over the past few years.  Most recently I&#x27;ve used Rembrandt, Colgate&#x27;s Optic White and now 3D White from Crest.  Since I&#x27;m a coffee and wine drinker (AND a blueberry eater), my teeth need all the help they can to maintain the natural off-white color that teeth are really supposed to be.  While Crest 3D did help to whiten my teeth, it wasn&#x27;t particularly effective (nor were any of the others) unless I rinsed my mouth and/or brushed my teeth soon after drinking coffee or wine or eating blueberries.  However, what augmented the performance of this toothpaste was it&#x27;s companion product, namely &amp;#34;Crest 3D White Polishing Treatment - Brilliance Boost.&amp;#34;  You basically brush your teeth with 3D White, then use the polishing treatment immediately afterward.  My recommendation is to use a multipronged approach of brushing often, using 3D White and then finishin off with the 3D White Polishing Treatment.</li>
    <li> If you want whiter teeth, this is the stuff for you. I use it with the brilliance boost and after 2 times notice a HUGE difference. I&#x27;m glad bc I love white strips but have such sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Since I gave up my diet sodas and have started drinking more coffee and iced tea, I have noticed that my teeth have become somewhat stained. I have tried other toothpastes as well as peroxide and soda in an attempt to at least reduce the stains with very little success. I had hoped that this Crest 3D White Brilliance Toothpaste might do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste has a fairly strong but not unpleasant minty taste and produces a normal amount of foam when using an electric brush. Stains are not gone but I believe that they have faded somewhat. Perhaps a more concerted effort on my part (brushing several times a day) might give me the results I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this particular product is no worse than other brands claiming to reduce tooth stains and is actually a bit better than some I have tried.</li>
    <li> This Crest White 3D Brilliance toothpaste is excellent stuff. Within a few brushes you can see the stains lifting on your teeth and they become generally whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is promoted to add shine and luster after just one use, but I didn&#x27;t really notice that. It takes a few brushes to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is fine. However, I am not a fan of chemical tastes, which this has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I don&#x27;t use fluoride toothpastes at all. Unfortunately, they haven&#x27;t made an effective fluoride-free whitening toothpaste yet and until they do I am stuck with these types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if whitening is what you want, don&#x27;t hesitate in buying this.</li>
    <li> This is the first whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried--and I&#x27;ve tried them all--that ACTUALLY WHITENS. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week and I can already see a huge difference. I&#x27;d pretty much given up on what I was starting to think was just a marketing gimmick, but I gave it one last shot... and I&#x27;m glad I did. This is really worth the extra money, and will now be my regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Oddly enough, I am giving this toothpaste a 4-star review, even though it&#x27;s difficult to comment on the whitening aspect.  What I can say is this: of all of the toothpastes and mouthwashes I have used over the years that promise your mouth will feel clean for hours, this is the only one that actually delivers.  2-3 hours later, if I haven&#x27;t eaten anything, I can still feel the effects of this toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t care if this sounds like a commercial: it leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> So right off the bat you can smell the small amount of peroxide in this paste. If you&#x27;ve ever used whitening strips or had your teeth whitened you know the smell I&#x27;m talking about. Obviously you shouldn&#x27;t swallow this stuff and it tells you this on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it&#x27;s definitely not a significant amount and I wouldn&#x27;t get to excited about immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that both my wife and I love the way this toothpaste feels, it foams up and when you&#x27;re done brushing, your teeth feel really clean as does the rest of your mouth. We both really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a little under a month and I&#x27;d say that my teeth seem to have whitened a little bit it&#x27;s hard to tell and I should&#x27;ve taken a picture for comparison. I drink coffee every day... copious amounts of it to be honest. So I need all the help I can get. My wife says she has definitely noticed some lightening of her coffee stains and stains between her teeth. Again, I feel like mine have gotten lighter but just maybe a shade and over the course of 3 weeks it&#x27;s hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing, peroxide kills germs and whitens teeth, this toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean so even if it&#x27;s barely doing any whitening at all, I&#x27;m still going to use it. I like it a lot and will definitely continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using Aquafresh Extreme Clean with Whitening but really I only get it because of the super minty flavor, my mouth definitely feels cleaner after using the Crest.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product but I don&#x27;t see anything in it that would distinguish it from a hundred similar products on the market. I haven&#x27;t noticed any special whitening or refreshing qualities in it. It is good but not memorable in any way.</li>
    <li> As one who has been using Crest 3D White \\&quot;Arctic Fresh\\&quot; toothpaste for several years, I wanted to try this new product to see if there were any differences from the old one.  This toothpaste feels a little more grainy than the older version, but that&#x27;s okay and the flavor is minty but not too strong and it&#x27;s definitely not overpowering. It leaves a clean and refreshing taste in my mouth.  As far as getting my teeth white, time will tell, but based on everyting else, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> No question that this toothpaste took away some tea and coffee stains.  I use this 3D White product in addition to my regular toothpaste, and that seems to work even better.  I would estimate a 20% increase in whiteness after one month of use.  Not very harsh, but I do find I have to do an extra rinse to avoid gum irritation.</li>
    <li> Item: Crest 3D White Brilliance Mesmerizing Mint Flavor Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;For some people this product works wonders. And for others, they don&#x27;t see results. It all depends on how your teeth are stained and to what degree. After using this for four weeks, I noticed a two-shade improvement. I received similar results with Colgate Optic White toothpaste (competitor).  The first two weeks gave me the difference, but the second two weeks, I did not see a difference.  And my teeth are not white. They are definitely stained. I&#x27;ve seen people with white teeth, and the issue is the degree that my teeth are stained. I&#x27;ve tried toothpastes, whitening mouthwash, and even a professional whitening kit from the dentist. They improved the shade of my teeth a few shades, but none ever made my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes excellent and the fresh feeling continues to last five to ten minutes afterwards. The toothpaste is a mix of gel and paste, and bubbles easily and continues to lather without wearing out. For some people, this will whiten their teeth. For others, it may improve a few shades, or may not be noticeable. It depends on how your teeth are stained and to what degree.  It did work for me, just not to the degree I was hoping for. But it still does the job it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> In my younger years, I always used Crest brand toothpastes. As I got older and prices went up, I switched to cheaper brands, figuring there really couldn’t be that much of a difference. Well, after trying out the new Crest 3D White Brilliance toothpaste, my mind is changed. There is indeed a very big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During one of the longest and coldest winters on record in the Northeast, I drank a lot of tea to fight off the frigid temperatures, and my teeth showed it. Even though there were only very light surface stains, I take great pride in my smile and was disappointed with what I was seeing in the mirror. Crest 3D White Brilliance took away my worries. One month after starting the product, the light stains are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the brightening aspect though, this toothpaste blows other brands out of the water in terms of its breath-freshening capabilities. When I’m done brushing, my mouth feels super clean and stays that way. Yes, I do believe I have now entered back into the fold of loyal Crest users.</li>
    <li> This is a high-grade toothpaste that tastes great, develops a nice foam, and leaves my mouth feeling terrific.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t see any difference in whiteness (I take those kind of claims on toothpaste and rinses with a bit of skepticism), but it is a good paste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various iterations of Crest 3D Toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve always thought it had a great taste and slightly helps whiten your teeth when you use it.  Highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m switching to this from Ultrabrite, which I&#x27;ve been using ever since it won a Consumer Reports round-up of whitening toothpastes. I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s more effective at whitening or not, but it&#x27;s at the same price point and I like everything that I can judge about it more: the mouthfeel, the look of the tube, and most importantly, the fact that it comes in a stand-up tube that frees up space around my bathroom sink. In conjunction with the 3D White Polishing Treatment (polish first, then toothpaste), my teeth look a shade lighter and my mouth feels a tad cleaner.</li>
    <li> Well, this definitely seems to help keep my teeth clean. I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s outstanding in comparison to other toothpaste, but it definitely gets the job done. Since this toothpaste is suppose to whiten my teeth, it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s really working. But it&#x27;s definitely not making my teeth worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, but I&#x27;ll more than likely will stick with the other toothpaste that I normally buy once this runs out.</li>
    <li> I saw a noticeable difference in my teeth after using it for one week. I love how it makes my teeth sparkle and how it makes my breathe so fresh. 2 thumbs way up for this product!! Whitens, cleans and freshens, what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> This is absolutely great toothpaste, but I have not really been able to tell that it has whitened my teeth. I have used it for about a month, without seeing any noticeable whitening of my teeth. I do like the fact that it really foams up in your mouth, and thus you don&#x27;t have to use as much toothpaste. So, as a toothpaste, I give it two thumbs up. But as a way of whitening your teeth, I would have to say that there are better options out there. Also, this is very expensive for toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Even hours later (no eating or drinking), a bit of the mint flavor and clean feeling remains.  The mint flavor is actually a little overwhelming at first which may be why it lasts so long.  It&#x27;s hard to say if the whitening aspect really works though.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference nor has anyone commented, but I regularly use Crest whitening strips so it&#x27;s not like my teeth were discolored in the first place.  I think the toothpaste is probably more of a maintenance type whitening.</li>
    <li> My last experience with Crest was nothing like this one and that is a good thing.  This new toothpaste is absolutely fantastic!  The &#x27;Mesmerizing Mint&#x27; flavor is extremely minty and very pleasant without being overpowering, think spearmint meets ice cold peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;The label claims that you will see noticeable whiting after your first use and after a week I can legitimately see a difference on my teeth.  I also really appreciate that the fresh feeling in my mouth lasted for a few hours during the day, whereas most others tend to wear off.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this and will continue to use it as my primary toothpaste.  My only complaint is that as with most good things, the tube doesn&#x27;t last very long.  It will last about two weeks with two of us brushing our teeth 2 to 3 times a day.  Overall this is fantastic and effective.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS!! GOOD  STUFF!!!!</li>
    <li> This is completely average tooth-paste. Good but unremarkable flavor, with no noticeable whitening effect even when used daily, I would say perhaps TOO foamy. Even when using the suggested amount, you essentially end up frothing at the mouth. Don&#x27;t waste your money - generic toothpastes are quite fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System free, courtesy of BzzAgent and Crest for the past few weeks. I have used Crest toothpaste products religiously for as long as I can remember, except for when it comes to whitening products. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Crest , but for some reason, I&#x27;ve always thought that the whitening products were pricey. I jumped on the opportunity to try a product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only whitening product I&#x27;ve tried in the past was Listerine mouthwash and let me say, it was disgusting. I left a very bitter taste in my mouth (despite its &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; flavor) and a weird, filmy residue. This product, however, actually tasted minty and I didn&#x27;t feel like anything was left behind in my mouth. I still haven&#x27;t seen many results, but I will continue to be patient and hopefully I&#x27;ll notice the whitening effects in no time. Another thing that I love so much about this product is how it is incorporated into my daily brushing routine. It&#x27;s not like I had to add another step or lengthen the time it takes to brush my teeth. It was an easy substitute to make. The last thing that I appreciate about the product is that the steps were very easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 4 out of 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but do recommend this to people considering trying out a teeth whitening system.</li>
    <li> My teeth are totally whiter, I swear!</li>
    <li> I tried the Crest 3D White Brilliance Mesmerizing Mint Flavor Toothpaste along with the [[ASIN:B00I5H5Y56 Crest 3D White Polishing Treatment - Brilliance Boost, 3 Ounce]], and I must say, I was really surprised.  My assumption is that any toothpaste is the same, and all of them advertise pretty much the same array of effects, including whiter teeth and refreshing flavor.  All toothpaste tastes the same to me, so I&#x27;m not impressed by packaging related to the taste.  And for the most part, all toothpaste seems to whiten the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the combination of these products actually whitens.  Fast.  I was not expecting that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Toothpaste didn&#x27;t feel particularly different from any other, but it did make my teeth feel quite clean.  Did it whiten my teeth?  I&#x27;m not exactly sure.  If so, it wasn&#x27;t a dramatic change until I used the [[ASIN:B00I5H5Y56 Crest 3D White Polishing Treatment - Brilliance Boost, 3 Ounce]] product.  And then my teeth looked noticeably whiter after the first use.  Was it because I brushed my teeth twice?  Perhaps.  But it was noticeable, whatever the reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Toothpaste is a good, if a little pricy, product.  In combination with the Polishing Treatment, it is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Ingredients include abrasive sand (hydrated silica) and drain cleaner (sodium hydroxide/lye), so, theoretically, it should work really well at whitening stained teeth.  Other ingredients include Sodium Laurel Sulfate (which many folks have sensitivities to) and mica (another abrasive).  Surprisingly, it does not contain peroxide which many reviewers claim to taste.  I have been using it once daily for two weeks and have noticed a very minor difference, but certainly nothing immediate or dramatic.  Harsh chemicals can burn lips and gums, so be certain to rinse repeatedly.  It may lighten coffee stains a shade or two with aggressive brushing, but if you are sensitive to SLS you want to avoid this product.  No substitute for a professional cleaning, might result in a very minor improvement, but has a high risk of irritating lips and gums.  Use with caution and discontinue use if irritation results.</li>
    <li> I have to start this review off by saying that I am a total sucker for a whitening gimmick. Mainly because I am too lazy to ACTUALLY whiten. Anyway, I used this toothpaste for the first time this morning and I am very impressed. I tend to stick to the Crest 3D line so when I saw this in Target, I couldn&#x27;t say no. I went all out and bought both the toothpaste and the booster. After using the toothpaste, yeah my mouth feels great and clean. perfect. Exactly what I wanted. I had recently tried Crest&#x27;s 3D Luxe for sensitive teeth and was not a fan. It made me feel like I had just chewed on celery for an hour and not that cool, fresh brushed feeling that I love so much.  Using brilliance was, quite literally, a breath of fresh air. Were my teeth whiter? Maybe. But I think I need to use it a few more times to give a final verdict on that. However, after using the boost I can definitely say that I saw a difference. Maybe they were &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34; as much as they were clean and polished. To be honest, I felt as if I had just left the dentist. What a great feeling. I would recommend this product, especially to any other whitening toothpaste nut like myself.</li>
    <li> Crest sent me the wonderful kit to help make your teeth whiter after one step. It is a process for sure but you sure do notice a difference after the first use. My god it was amazing, I have tried the older ones from way back in the late 90′s early 20th century and they didn’t work so good, but this one is truly amazing. You simply follow the steps you the brilliance paste the long one on top first. It tastes really good actually and has little beads in it that do wonderful powers. Then you use the brilliance toothpaste at the bottom and that one is white with blue glittery gel on the side. This one doesn’t taste that great but it foams up and cleans the plaque right off. Then lastly use the strips and these are super easy. One package and two long strips placing is pretty easy until you get to the molars and then it gets tricky. Make sure your teeth are dry and then place and watch the foaming action. You do need to leave these on for quite some time, so do something to keep you busy and not thinking about them. They taste okay and works great. I so saw a difference after one use, I think the toothpastes helped a lot too. Which was helpful to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a full month now and while I do notice a difference it&#x27;s not that great of a difference.  It&#x27;s slightly disappointing because of this.  But it does taste good and works as a good toothpaste for making my mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This product will give you about one shade,whitening if used as directed. It is not a miracle white product, so don&#x27;t get your hopes up. It simply cannot do what a dentist does. I see it as a good maintenance product after a professional whitening service or for very lightly discolored teeth, nothing more. This is based on using the polishing treatment also but not the rinse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Colgate fan and never liked the taste of Crest (personal preference). It&#x27;s marketed as a whitening toothpaste, and as that, it did not impress. I much preferred using the Crest White Polishing treatment which gives better results.</li>
    <li> I had been using a different Crest whitening toothpaste, and it stung the dickens out of my mouth. This one seems to be at least as effective for getting out tea stains, but doesn&#x27;t burn. A definite step up... I&#x27;ll buy this kind again.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White Brilliance toothpaste works ok. After the first few uses I admit I noticed a slight change in the whiteness of my teeth but it was nothing major. The minty flavor is subtle and the toothpaste itself does not foam very much as you brush. Considering how much this goes for, I was expecting more.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D brilliance is a unique toothpaste.  It claims to whiten, starting with the first use, have a lasting mint flavor fight cavities.  This is a rather tall order.  I did not see instant whitening.  After 2 weeks of continued use, I still don&#x27;t see a dramatic difference, but my teeth look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint flavor is not present at the time of brushing.  It is a rather off putting flavor.  But it foams well and cleans well.  I did notice continually throughout the day a cooling sensation in my mouth.  Most often experienced after I ate, my mouth would feel minty and cool, like just after brushing.  I find this remarkable.  My mouth felt better all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this toothpaste is a hit and a miss.  If you do not eat foods that stain, you should see instant results.  Although nothing will make it taste better, you will have fresh taste in your mouth all day.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White Brilliance toothpaste is a godsend for me: over three weeks, with once-daily use, it has helped lessen, and even eliminate, minor surface staining on my teeth (wrought by enthusiastic coffee and tea drinking). Unlike whitening strips, which can be effective in only a few treatments, you need to consistently use this paste over the period of a few weeks for best results. It does work! -- just be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate toothpaste use with Sensodyne and this Crest whitening paste; it helps limit sensitivity induced by whiteners, and keeps me from over-whitening (and causing discoloration). My mouth feels fresh and teeth are smooth for hours after use, and the flavor is a solid mint without being too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this option, and will be purchasing it again in the future. I&#x27;ve had the best success using it in conjunction with an electric toothbrush, to really ensure everything&#x27;s getting cleaned up.</li>
