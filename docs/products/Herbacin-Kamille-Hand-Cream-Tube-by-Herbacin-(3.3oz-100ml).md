      <li>it&#x27;s still worth it!</li>

      <li>Plus, I like the mild chamomile scent.</li>
      <li>I have loved this cream for so long</li>
      <li>I love the green and yellow design on the bottle, and it smells good too, a bit medicinal, but nice.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This one is really excellent. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I collected a massive stash of hand creams from subscription boxes and gifts with purchase over the summer, but I&#x27;ve been waiting until the weather got cold to test them out.  December rolls around and it&#x27;s like my hands just know -- immediate dry skin, cracked skin on my knuckles, occasional bleeding if I&#x27;m really unlucky.  I am outside quite a bit in the cold weather, walking my dog, and I don&#x27;t always have gloves with me.  Plus, because I have pets, I find myself washing my hands frequently, which is also drying.  So I rely on hand cream.  A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the latest one I tried.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  I like the smell, which reminds me a bit of chamomile tea (makes sense, since this has chamomile in it).  I found it to be moisturizing without being oily and without leaving much of a residue on my hands.  It absorbed reasonably quickly.  And it provided a degree of instant relief, which lasted until the next time I washed my hands.  It&#x27;s thick and consistent in texture (not watery at all, even after sitting for a few months in the tube).  Finally, it did not irritate my skin.  I have to be really careful with hand creams because some of them (usually the ones with fragrances and dyes) can be downright painful to use if my skin is at all cracked.  But this felt pretty nice going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are what appear to be two ingredients lists on the product page, they&#x27;re not quite the same.  The one in the section that says &amp;#34;important information&amp;#34; matches the back of my tube.  I like that this has no dyes or artificial fragrances, though it can&#x27;t really be considered natural, as it contains some modified ingredients and some parabens.  This has added vitamins A, C, and E (listed by chemical names in the ingredients list) which may provide some antioxidant-type benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good hand cream.  Recommended if you like the scent of chamomile and don&#x27;t mind occasionally using products that contain parabens.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive hands.  Herbacin Kamille is wonderful in helping keep my hands moist.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream so far.</li>
    <li> I golf a lot and work in the medical field, so I have to wear gloves all the time, and this hand cream is the best I have tried to stop my hands from chaffing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is not cost-effective, however, to order only one tube through Amazon (doesn&#x27;t actually ship from Amazon) because of the shipping charge.</li>
    <li> I just happened to find it at a local beauty supply store and have been hooked ever since! My hands get extremely dry, especially in the winter and I also have sensitive skin, so I have a very hard time finding a good lotion that actually works! Well, this stuff is perfect...it has a very light scent, goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy and best of all, it lasts a long time...leaving your hands feeling like velvet for hours!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. A nurse turned me onto this: she told me that she only needed to apply it once a day in spite of frequent hand washing. The scent is light and clean. Even my brother likes it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 9 or 10 years now, and I&#x27;ve never found anything better.  I&#x27;m a nurse, and I wash my hands 50 plus times in a shift, as well as using alcohol-based cleaners in between.  Needless to say, my hands get in horrible shape FAST if I don&#x27;t stay on top of it.  In winter, it doesn&#x27;t take much for them to be cracked and bleeding, and Herbacin Kamille hand cream will have them completely healed in one to two nights.  I order 5 or 6 tubes a year, and keep them in different rooms of the house, in my locker, and in my car.  Just putting it on gives relief, and the silicone and glycerin keep the moisture locked in if you get your hands wet.    I&#x27;ve also found that it works better than anything on extreme skin dryness anywhere else.  My 14 month old son inherited his dad&#x27;s dry skin, which when he was a kid, was treated by cleansing with a thick cream a few times a week, and very rarely taking a water bath.  My son had the same condition, and three days of this cream slathered all over him made his skin soft as a newborn again.    I&#x27;ve also used it on the back of my legs where they became raw from being so dry and the friction caused by going from standing to sitting positions at work so often, and it completely healed them.    I&#x27;d rather have this cream than some $40 NYC spa-based cream any day; it&#x27;s cheap, it does the job well, and the scent is low-key and pleasant enough.  Give it a whirl; I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy and lasts!</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best hand cream ever.  I have been using it for 2 years now after a recommendation from my doctor.  It&#x27;s so smoothing, but not at all greasy. .and i love the clean smell. .</li>
    <li> I originally found this product in a boutique when I was traveling and it has been very hard to find in stores.  I am thrilled to be able to find it on Amazon and even though shipping costs more than the product itself it&#x27;s still worth it!</li>
    <li> This hand cream is a cut above all the others. Keeps my old hands smooth and cuticles soft, even in the harshest winter. I know this sounds exactly like a commercial, but this product will speak for itself. The aroma is mild and pleasant (though, perhaps, too much for some people) and it&#x27;s not greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> great rich cream that is absorbed by the skin nicely so it won&#x27;t stay greasy.  highly recommend it to anyone with dry hands.  very mildly, not noticeably scented, which is great...</li>
    <li> I have loved this cream for so long and I go out of my way to get it, so I had to write my first Amazon review for it. I first came across this hand cream in 2003 after I stopped in a Berlin drug store and a tube of it was under 1 euro, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I instantly fell in love, there has never been another hand cream I&#x27;ve ever tried that feels so incredible on your skin, lightweight and not greasy like some, but doesn&#x27;t just wash right off! It left my hands feeling the softest they&#x27;ve been probably since I was a baby :) Plus, I like the mild chamomile scent. So you can imagine how bummed I was when I left Europe, came back to the states and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I was so thrilled to find it on a whim on Amazon several years later! Now I order it regularly. It&#x27;s well worth the extra expense, and I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product, I really like it.</li>
    <li> This goes on so smoothly, and the mild scent is wonderful!  After just a couple days of using it, my hands no longer hurt from being dry and cracked.  I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works this well.  I keep this in my night stand to use just before going to bed, and I wake up with soft hands!  It also seems to have improved the health of my nails, and they seem to be growing faster.  I like it so much, I&#x27;m ordering the large bottle with the pump!</li>
    <li> I have used it for years, it is great for winter hands and non-greasy</li>
    <li> This Herbacin Kamille product comes in a tube vs a small tin.  Both products the best on the market in my opinion.  I am never without one of them. Tube is better value (less expensive) and works almost as well as tin, maybe a tad slower.  Buy them both and decide for yourself.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for cracked hands - put it on before bed each night.  Also works really well on diaper rash.  We call it the magic cream!</li>
    <li> This is magical stuff. It heals. It goes on and stays on without feeling too greasy or sticky. I&#x27;ve used it for many years. And the smell is very pleasant, without being too overpowering.</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly and I liked everything about except that it smells like baby powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worked in the medical field for 30 years and my hands were always in hot water, harsh chemicals &amp; developing solutions for x-rays.  My hands used to look so old but since using this product they look so much younger.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.  I&#x27;ve used just about every cream available including RX prescriptions and this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found.  I have very sensative skin and I can use this on my face. It works great on sunburns &amp; it&#x27;s the only cream that I&#x27;ve used on my kids since they were babies that didn&#x27;t sting their sensitive skin!  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over 18 years.  All my family &amp; friends love it &amp; I always bought it for them for gifts. I used to be able to buy it at my local pharmacy &amp; beauty supply, but no one is carrying it anymore.  It was so much more convenient when I could buy it locally.  I have never seen all your other products but I would love to try them.</li>
    <li> Excellent hand cream. Does a great job of moisturizing and this&lt;br /&gt;size was a great value at the price offered.</li>
    <li> My favorite heavy duty, winter hands, lotion. Period.</li>
    <li> I have beem using this hand cream for years. It&#x27;s one of the best hand cream/lotion that I have ever used. I even use it on my feet.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the BEST lotion. I am an avid hand washer in the winter time and no matter how I care for them I got badly chapped hands with tons of tiny little splits all over the backs of my hands and lizard skin. To make things worse, I really hate greasy lotions and can&#x27;t put lotions on my hands that have a slippery texture or don&#x27;t absorb quickly. I have tried L&#x27;occitane, C.O. Bigelow, O&#x27;keffe&#x27;s chapped hands, Eucerin, lotions with Alpha Hydroxy Acids in them, lotions that my nurse friends recommended, pure olive oil, and basically every cheap and expensive lotion that looked promising. Nothing was working for me. Some how I decided to try this and it healed my hands most of the way in four days. On day one just closing my fists made my knuckles split and by the 4th day all my splits had started to heal up and no new ones occurred, somewhere between the second and third day, the dead skin started coming off and my hands started to hydrate well again and on the 4th day they looked almost normal again. it is the ONLY lotion that worked for my hands even after I continued to wash my hands as much as I did. Also the texture is creamy and not slippery greasy so its tolerable. Really if you tried everything before and you have badly chapped hands just buy this. it works. and its four dollars.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot and in the winter it really takes a toll. This cream takes about 10 years off. My hands look so smooth, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. I love the green and yellow design on the bottle, and it smells good too, a bit medicinal, but nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for about five years.  My hands are rough; Herbacin Kamille keeps them from cracking, etc.</li>
    <li> This cream moisturizes my hand very well. Love the smell and the price is not too bad for a good cream.</li>
    <li> You get so much value out of them.It makes the hand more moisture.I use it every day.It also makes people feel very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This natural lotion leaves your hands SOOO extremely hydrated and soft it&#x27;s amazing.  I put it on my hands and feet before bed and wake up to them feeling soft and healthy.  I love it</li>
    <li> This product have very nice smell！I hope it will work well on my dryness hand, also I like this brand.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this stuff. It smells awesome and is thick and rich without leaving my hands and feet greasy or gooey. It&#x27;s not an all-over body lotion, obvs; I use it on my hands and feet for extra night time moisturizing. Love love love.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample by a Canadian pharmacy tech I met (they have more education and do a lot more than their American counterparts) to help ease my chronic cracking and splitting of the skin around the fingertips. This winter I started to apply it 2X a day (work it in to the affected areas) and as of this review I have no splits. It is lightly fragranced-perhaps slightly too flowery for me, but if it works what the heck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it is my most favourite hand cream, which can protect my hands for whole day or night.&lt;br /&gt;And it is the very product with high cost performance.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice and the consistency is rich. After putting the hand cream on, my hands feel moisturized, not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream! I discovered it when I was living in Germany and was very happy to see it available on Amazon. It absorbs into the skin very fast without leaving a slimy or greasy feeling. It repairs dry hands quickly and it smells nice but subtle.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have used it in place of the prescription medication for the mild eczema on my hands, and it does a much better job without the greasy medication cream. It absorbs quickly, has a pleasant fragrance, and actually works. I am totally pleased with the quick results it produces.</li>
    <li> I was getting sores on the back of my hands this winter, like red, soft flesh, because my hands were getting so dry. Finally I couldn&#x27;t take using just the general lotion anymore and added this little item. After just 3 days of about 5 small applications the sores were unnoticeable unless you were looking specifically at where they used to be. By the fourth day you would have never known I had dry hands. I use this now once every other day and my hands have never felt so soft/smooth, and the smell is pretty nice as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this online because my recollection was that all the ingredients were natural and non-hazardous. So imagine my surprise when the tube arrived and I read: Methylparaben. Ethylparaben. Propylparaben.</li>
    <li> Great non-sticky hand cream that&#x27;s super fast absorbing.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my hands well. I keep it on my nightstand and used when my hands feel dry. The fragrance is pleasant too.</li>
    <li> i LOVE it so much, it smells good and very moisture. I think it&#x27;s by far the best cream out there to moisturize dry hands.</li>
    <li> I like this hand cream.  It does not have a strong smell and it keeps my dry skin moisturized beautifully.  I would buy it again just to have an extra to toss into my purse!</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it for hands and for the face. It works better than anything else I tried.</li>
    <li> Great hand cream. It really softens and moisturizes my hands. I love how good it smells! :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this could get over 1 star from anyone; it offers relief from dry hands for about 10 seconds, then you need to look for some Aveeno (which offers immediate relief and lasts for hours). Total waste.</li>
    <li> The best hand cream ever! I have used this hand cream for years and it continues to be the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> This wonderful German hand cream seems to be healing my dry skin cracks on my hands!  I truly love it!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Smell is ok. Miracle</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hand creme. Light and good for the skin. I am thinking about buying the body lotion from this company</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I received a tube as a gift and used it to the last itty bitty drop.  Then of course I went to Amazon! I usually wind up throwing out hand cream because it leaves greasy residue on anything I touch.  This product is great for summer or winter.  I knit a lot which really dries out my hands.  This product moisturizes my hands and does not come off on the yarn.</li>
    <li> i received this lotion as a gift and all my family ended up using it too. It is the best hand lotion that I have ever used and does not leave your hands greasy and stays on all day.  I cannot tell you how picky I am and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I rated this three stars because of the packaging, not the product. I love the product. It stays on and is not sticky. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s waterproof but it feels like it stays even after washing my hands. I use it on my face, too, because its not greasy or sticky. The packaging it arrived in could have been a little better just by adding a strip of tape to both ends. It opened without any resistance at all meaning anyone could have opened it in transit. There wasn&#x27;t a packing list in the package which I found unusual but it could have been removed in transit. I barely shook the book-box and the end popped out. LOVE the cream not so much the delivery package.</li>
    <li> This was highly recommended by a friend, and she was right!!  I only wish I could by it a local store, but maybe it&#x27;s just as easy to have it delivered to my door.</li>
    <li> It is not worth the price. The quality is not good. I don&#x27;t like it.....&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why it cost so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m required to sanitize my hands dozens of times a day at work, which leaves them raw, irritated, and of course, more open to infection than hands that are healthy. Herbacin Kamille Hand Cream is a wonderfully healing hand cream, that soothes without stinging. The scented version isn&#x27;t too heavy, but I prefer the unscented when it is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a 1/2\\&quot; squeeze to your hands, and it&#x27;s enough to smooth dry rough skin; the cream absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. The cream is also slow to freeze, so it works well even when I leave a tube in my car. I always have one tube at home, and another tube at work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a specific lotion from Germany and found this one. The smell is somewhat pungent, but it works for longer period of time than most lotions.</li>
    <li> I have the absolute worst dry hands in the winter and I&#x27;ve tried many lotions.  This is the only one that I find that works, is not greasy and has a pleasant scent.  Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Awsome great product.  This is amazing on dry hands.  Great for hands that get very dry and crack with winter.  My parents love this.  Havent&#x27; been able to find in stores.  Very fast delivery.  Ordered at last minutes for Christmas and received on time to give.</li>
    <li> perfectly good to hand skin.  Keep moisture of the skin.</li>
    <li> Works really well on my dry chapped hands! One of the best hand creams that i&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> This hand cream has helped stop the dryness around my cuticles and hangnails from forming.  It has a light pleasant scent and it aids in softening the skin.</li>
    <li> bought 3 of these for use during winter time. After doing dishes, scrubbing bathrooms and constantly washing hands I apply this lotion and amazingly leaves my hands so soft and hydrated. Formula is paraben free and smells nicely. Husband stole my second tube and third is kept in car.</li>
    <li> Is it true or fake? Why its quality and smell are different from my last one bought in other places?</li>
    <li> I just love this!!! It&#x27;s not greasy and makes my hands soft.</li>
