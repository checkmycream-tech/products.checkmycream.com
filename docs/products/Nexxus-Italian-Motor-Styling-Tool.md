<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the way this blow dryer looks.  The pearl white finish is attractive, and the black side grips keep the blow dryer from sliding off the bathroom counter.  Very nice feature.  It fits well in my hand and is not too heavy.  Much lighter than the last dryer I had.  I was surprised how quickly this dried my hair.  I have been using a Revlon ceramic dryer, and it was fast.  This Nexxus dryer dried my hair even faster.  Also, my old dryer burned my fingers and hair easily.  This one, even on the hot setting, does not overheat my hair while still drying it more efficiently.  The buttons are much easier to use than on dryers I have previously owned.  The cool shot work well.  I have not used the attachments yet.  My only complaint (thus the 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the low setting on the blower still blows a little too powerfully.  Less air flow on that setting would make styling easier.  I am still adjusting to this.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy but lightweight hairdryer. I love that the cold shot button is one touch on and one touch off( you don&#x27;t have to continually hold the button down). It is quiet pretty quiet for a hairdryer and drys my hair quickly. Dryer comes with a diffuser. Great buy for the money. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my dryer about 6 months &amp; it works very well except for one thing.  It was shipped with the black attachment jammed onto the dryer&#x27;s neck and NO one can get it off so I use it that way which doesn&#x27;t exactly suit.  I&#x27;m known for having an impressive talent for breaking into to things, out of things, &amp; getting over &amp; under things.  I thought it was odd that it arrived wearing the attachment.  Maybe there was no choice.  If I could just zoom along I&#x27;d give it 5 Stars.  Can someone tell me the trick?</li>
    <li> Somehow I broke my Conair Blackbird, or it broke itself, after only a few months of use. I was bummed but it was kind of heavy so I came back to Amazon to find something lighter. I almost got another Conair but then I noticed this one had a LOCKING cool shot button. Nexxus is probably made by Conair anyway but that tipped the scales for me and I ordered this one. It is very light and the noise is much less annoying than most hairdryers I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s hard to give it 5 stars since I haven&#x27;t been using it long and I usually reserve the 5&#x27;s for things that last for years but what the heck. Hopefully it will last years because I really like the way it&#x27;s designed. The little details like strip of rubber on the sides to put a buffer between it and the counter, the way the back comes off to clean the filter instead of a door on a hinge (those always come loose over time), the long cord, the POWER! Yes it does blow my hair around a little too much and for the first time ever I&#x27;m using the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting on a dryer which is fine by me! It&#x27;s also very pretty to look at. I hesitated a minute since most of the reviews were from people who got it for free, and I always question that sort of thing, but I knew I could return in if it was a complete fail because Amazon is good like that. I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made and well functioning dryer.  It is a little heavier than my old dryer and while the noise level seems about the same this one is much lower pitched which I prefer.  It does a good and quick job.  My daughter and I both like it.</li>
    <li> I have thinning \\&quot;older\\&quot; hair that tends to gently frizz when drying and lose any heft/weight it has left.  Typically, I just dry the hair around my face, because I don&#x27;t like taking the time to dry all of my shoulder-length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say, that I am PLEASANTLY surprised that this dryer combines quick drying skills AND reduced frizz.  I&#x27;ve used both diffuser attachments which dried all of my hair quickly.  Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit noisier than my other hand-held blow dryers, but so what?  I run it for less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this unit, she uses it on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting and says it is just as strong as her other one&lt;br /&gt;- when it is on \\&quot;high\\&quot;. So yeah if you need a powerful unit, this is the one for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat is basically instant - and hot.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; works very quickly also- although there isn&#x27;t a light that comes on when the heat - or cool is on, which would be a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator, a handy loop to hang it when not using it and the color is a nice pearl-white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> The Nexxus Salon Hair Care dryer is a compact and surprisingly powerful machine.  The \\&quot;Italian AC Motor\\&quot; and air tunnel are encased in an off-white plastic tapering tube 8.5in long, 3.25 in. in diameter at its widest point. The 4.5 in. long handle is curved to fit the hand (right or left hand). A heavy rubber cover protects the electric cord extending from bottom of the handle so excessive wear due to dryer changes in angle can be avoided. The cord is 6 ft. 4 in. long. The 110 V plug has built in test/reset buttons that act as a circuit breaker if the cord gets too hot. The unit has not overheated while operating the device since I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is very powerful, blowing air with high power. The tapered tube of the blower has effective \\&quot;Ionic Technology\\&quot; that helps prevent \\&quot;frizz,\\&quot; a factor I have had some experience with after testing another dryer two years ago. The end of the blower tube has Titanium Ceramic technology that produces \\&quot;infrared heat\\&quot; that I have found does not burn the hair with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two attachments for the end of the dryer tube. One is a \\&quot;concentrator,\\&quot; a 3.5 in. wide black plastic funnel with a flattened air exit. This produces an air stream that is wider but more concentrated than the blower tube without the attachment. The second attachment is a round plastic \\&quot;Diffuser\\&quot; 6 in. in diameter that spreads the air out through eighteen 1.25 in. teeth. This works well with long hair to fluff up the hair and create curls and waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hand controls can be operated easily for left or right handers. There are two black oblong rocker buttons and one round button. The lower black button controls motor speeds: off, low, and high. The upper black button controls air temperature: cool, warm, and hot. The round button set high on the handle is an off/on cold button. With one push and release the machine will blow cold air without changing the temperature setting controlled by the upper black button. A second push and release of the round button will return the air to the setting of the upper black button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses the Nexxus dryer frequently and likes the machine very much. We asked a friend, a hair salon owner, to try it out in her shop. She likes the power of the machine, the functioning of the handle controls, and the effectiveness with her styling work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Nexxus Salon Hair Care dryer for its compact design, powerful motor, and functionality for personal and professional use.d push and release of the round button will return the air to the setting of the upper black button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses the Nexxus dryer frequently and likes the machine very much.

    <li> I like to get the safety warnings out of the way first (really, that&#x27;s what they say).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned lots of Conair products over the years but nothing this expensive. In this case you really do get what you pay for. Everything about the dryer says \\&quot;quality\\&quot;. It is very well balanced and the ergonomic handle fits the palm perfectly with the buttons near the fingertips not under the palm where so many cheap designs locate them. Positive detent between button selections. The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; selection works for setting your style before removing curlers. Heavy-duty cord with an ALCI plug which is a very nice safety feature. Double lint screens on the back. The outer one slips off easily for cleaning. The concentrator is great for select sections of hair like bangs. The diffuser  is almost the size of VW hubcap and takes a little getting used to but once you do if works great for fine, curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking like a dandelion puff-ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pearl finish is a very classy look. Five year limited warranty. Coupon included for 3 oz size Nexxus shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Although it would be some time before you determined that the infrared heat prevents damage, it is good to know that the feature is available. This is an attractive hair drying tool, and I like that it feels lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the drying time is quicker, and I like that it includes the diffuser for close-up and/or specific areas.  This handles easy, and yes, sometimes we could always appreciate longer cords.  This make it easy to work on another person&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature I use is the locking cold.  This is great, just to blow away cut hair pieces.  The heating element is 1875 watts and  that is quite hot if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice, sleek styling tool, easy to use, easy to use on others!  Rizzo</li>
    <li> The Nexxus Italian Motor Styling Tool,did not disappoint My hair is long and very curly and living in an area where the water can be hard and wreck havoc on my hair such as fizziness I used the diffuser as an attachment With the choice of using hot or cold air ( I used cold) and the speed ( slow for me) my hair came out great no frizz or fly away hair This is a keeper and I would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> We received this &amp;#34;Nexxus Italian Motor Styling Tool&amp;#34; via the Vine Program to evaluate, and the woman of the house (and the one with hair) immediately put it through the paces. She has nice thick brown/gray hair, and was very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Some details:&lt;br /&gt;Pros (▲):&lt;br /&gt;▲ Italian AC motor (they claim it drys 50 percent faster drying time and 3x longer life...can&#x27;t verify, but it runs well)&lt;br /&gt;▲ 3 heat &amp; 2 speed settings&lt;br /&gt;▲ Includes a concentrator and a diffuser&lt;br /&gt;▲ Decent power: 1875 watts / 15.6 Amps&lt;br /&gt;▲ Easy to remove/clean air filter&lt;br /&gt;▲ Long cord (&amp;#62; 6 ft)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (▼):&lt;br /&gt;None really&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buzz word terms like &amp;#34;Titanium Ceramic technology&amp;#34;  (the claim is it produces even infrared heat to help protect hair from damage) &amp;#34;Ionic technology&amp;#34; (claim is it reduces frizz)...not sure if they truly make a difference, but I do know that the woman of the house gave this model a thumbs up! Recommended without reservation ;-)</li>
    <li> A very powerful hair dryer - uh, I mean &amp;#34;Styling Tool&amp;#34; :)&lt;br /&gt;It dries fast and the attachments are a great bonus.  I never would have thought to attribute lack of frizz or hair health with a dryer, but it seems to leave hair in better shape than other dryers.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;Ionic technology&amp;#34; they speak of, but it&#x27;s nice.  The long cord and the non-slip nub on the sides point out an attention to detail that is a nice touch.  The description claims 3x the life based on their &amp;#34;Italian Motor&amp;#34; etc.  If that&#x27;s the case, this would be a great value.  A lot of power and features for a long time is a good combo.</li>
    <li> Excellent, brand new in box, great quality as expected from Nexxus, received in 3 days.</li>
    <li> Given my usage, this may seem odd. But I got this for my modeling and painting, which its been very helpful with for a lot of the same reasons. The cord is long enough I don&#x27;t have to use an extension to get it to where I need it, and the fan and the heating coils warm up and are steady enough that I don&#x27;t have any problems with uneven drying, and it also cools down fast enough I don&#x27;t scorch anything I set it on or scald my hands if I accidentally touch a part of it after I finish using it. Very nice design with easy to use controls.</li>
    <li> It’s a dryer that feels good in your hands, durable and lightweight. Not cumbersome in the slightest. The cord is of good length and the features – three head settings with two speeds and includes extras – a concentrator and a diffuser which makes I’m going to assume would make this a great unit for various hair types and styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair it’s proven to be fast drying and after trying the various heat and power settings I’ve found that others should and will be happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I’m pretty happy with this blow dryer and would recommend this one to others looking for a new hair drier for themselves.</li>
    <li> Dryer is light weight easy to hold...it&#x27;s perfect for thick hair it gives you a quick blowout</li>
    <li> This blow drier will change your life if you have thick, unruly hair.  Not only does it get my hair dry quickly but it doesn&#x27;t leave it one big, frizzy mess.  It&#x27;s not quite good enough to skip the flat iron but it&#x27;s close!</li>
    <li> Nice dryer with a great feature....a locking cool shot button. This is hard to find in hairdryers, even expensive ones.  I love the cool shot feature ,keeps your finger from getting sore while holding the button down while you &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; your style.&lt;br /&gt;I love the different speeds and heat levels.  Many expensive dryers don&#x27;t have this feature.  I tried a T3 Featherweight that had only hot and cool and hi and low.  It went back, as it was either burning me, or no heat. This has a nice medium heat, which is just right.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, I returned it, though.  It weighs a ton, and my arms got tired.  I bought a Rusk W8less, which is a wonderful find.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this five stars because it has the most powerful motor I have ever had as well as the incredible range of controls for it. Usually, even the best have just two power settings: low and high. This has a medium. Add to that the various temperature settings and the only way it could be better is if you could program it to float in the air above your head. Excellent.</li>
    <li> The dryer handle fits nicely in hand with a comfortable balance, buttons are conveniently placed,&lt;br /&gt;and this dryer does a remarkably quick job of drying my thick/coarse head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;cold shot&#x27; lays waves in place, styling in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this dryers versatility, functionality and powerful force of air.&lt;br /&gt;And I appreciate the rubber bumpers on each side of the dryer to protect the vanity top from abrasions and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have problems with frizzy hair so I can&#x27;t speak to the ionic feature reducing friz up to 75%&lt;br /&gt;but I have noticed it gives my hair more shine, with a healthy look and professional touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRYER FEATURES&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 2 speeds,  low &amp; high &amp;lt;&gt; 3 heat settings, cool - warm - hot &amp;lt;&gt; locking cold shot to set style in place.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; The infrared heat which is produced by titanium ceramic technology is supposed to work on molecules inside hair,&lt;br /&gt;so as to dry it inside out - which is to minimize friz &amp; protects against heat damage&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Includes 2 attachments &amp;lt;&gt; diffuser for body, curls &amp; waves (large 6\\&quot; dia) &amp;lt;&gt; concentrator for pinpoint styling (3 1/2\\&quot; opening)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAINTENANCE FREE MOTOR&lt;br /&gt;Italian motor ~ I do believe it drys hair twice as fast. Nexxus claims the motor lasts 3 times longer.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a filter on the back of blower which needs periodically cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;Very quick &amp; simple to do ~ lightly turn the back piece of the blower housing to the left ~ easily comes off.&lt;br /&gt;Remove dust/lint &amp; twist cover back on blower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAST BUT NOT LEAST ~ SAFETY&lt;br /&gt;&gt; This 1875 watts dryer is exactly 15 amps, which may be the capacity of some home fuses/beakers.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; This 6&#x27; 4\\&quot; cord is durable/flexible with heavy insulation for safety conducting 15 amps. plus a loop near the dryer to hang it up with.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Appliance leakage circuit interrupter (ALCI) shuts off the dryer if immersed in water or overheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair dryer is said to be designed to work with Nexxus moisturizing hair care products,&lt;br /&gt;and includes a coupon for free 3 oz trail size shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;5 yr warranty Nexxus from Conair.k with Nexxus moisturizing hair care products,&lt;br /&gt;and includes a coupon for free 3 oz trail size shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;5 yr warranty Nexxus from Conair.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent styling blower. The air flows out in a massive, evenly-heated gust. The motor provides the perfect level of heat to dry hair in any style, with one-button cool air flow for setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit provides three heat settings to administer from either of two speed settings. It includes a concentrator attachment, as well as a large diffuser that makes short work of voluminous hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that my Nexxus styling dryer is lightweight. I enjoy its comfortably balanced grip. It has a long, well-reinforced cord with a test and reset buttons on the supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite features of my Italian Motor Styling Tool, besides its outstanding performance, is the addition of the rubber feet on each side of the dryer, which keep the dryer from sliding off of the vanity as readily as other dryers that I have used in the past; it&#x27;s such a simple thing, but small features such as this go a long way in the overall satisfaction with a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the rear intake, the cover may be removed with an easy counter-clockwise rotation for cleaning. The quality of the unit seems to have been manufactured with exceptional precision. The painted, rigid fins of the blower outlet seem immune to the typical wear of the bathroom environment. Attachments clip in firmly, yet they are easily changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor noise generated by using this blower is more tolerable than that of the typical inexpensive dryers. The large, constant flow of air throughout its properly formed chamber is nowhere near as pitchy as the desperate pull noise produced by lower quality models - it makes a warmer tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing tool, that provides efficient drying and styling power. The even air temperatures are perfect. There is no scorching heat like that emitted from the toaster-in-a-tube dryers. I highly recommend the Nexxus Italian AC Motor Styling Tool for achieving perfect results, without any of the damage that the extreme-temperature units tend to do to hair.ure units tend to do to hair.</li>
    <li> The Nexxus Italian Motor Styling Tool does a stellar job of drying and styling my hair. I love how fast I can dry my hair with this product. Needing less time with the blow dryer which gives me more time with the curling iron and/or flat iron. It comes with a concentrator and a diffuser. It&#x27;s one sweet looking product with it&#x27;s pearl white finish makes it as lovely as it is practical.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of ionic technology ever since I read about an ionic pet brush in the Sky Mall catalog on a trip. I have also owned a Sharper Image ionic hair dryer for years. I am a believer in the ionic technology and it works just as well in both hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one advantage the Sharper Image dryer has is that it is a little quieter. This dryer is pretty loud, but it dries amazingly fast. Even though it dries fast it doesn&#x27;t seem to overheat my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer also looks sharp with the white plastic and black cord and the slim handle fits well in my hand. It comes with a giant diffuser, which is interesting, and a pinpoint styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is a nice upgrade over my old dryer. The only drawback is the increased noise, although I won&#x27;t have to listen to it for long because this dryer dries about 3 times faster.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  o  Feels solid and high quality&lt;br /&gt;  o  Fit and finish are excellent&lt;br /&gt;  o  Reasonably quiet motor (as blow driers go)&lt;br /&gt;  o  Strong air flow&lt;br /&gt;  o  WILL BLOW &amp;#34;ROOM TEMPERATURE&amp;#34; AIR!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  o  Was not free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a blow dryer that would blow ROOM TEMPERATURE air, and that would lock into such a mode either via a COLD SHOT button that would lock into position, or a temperature setting on the heat control switch.  I tried another cheapo blow dryer that I found here on Amazon that ostensibly has a &amp;#34;locking cold shot&amp;#34; button.  Well it locks alright... but it is NOT a COLD SHOT button, even though that is how it is labeled on the handle of the blow dryer!!!  All it did was increase the fan speed!!!  IT WAS THE FAN SPEED BUTTON!!!  AARRRRGGGHHHH!!!  What kind of egregious marketing duplicity will some companies stoop to!!!  So anyway, after much wailing, gnashing of teeth, and searching, I found this one and one other that were supposed to have &amp;#34;locking cold shot&amp;#34; buttons.  The other, it turned out, did NOT, as I discovered when I posted a question to the Amazon Q&amp;A forum for that item.  However, people that responded to my inquiry here indicated that this one most definitely does (and a big THANK YOU to those that replied!!!).  I got mine today, and it DOES *exactly* what I want.  The &amp;#34;COOL&amp;#34; setting on the heat control switch and the COLD SHOT button both appear to cause the blow dryer to blow room temperature air.  I measured the temperature of the air coming from the blow dryer with the heat selector on both the COOL and WARM settings, and with and without the COLD SHOT button engaged.  The fan speed was on LOW.  The intake air temperature was 75 degrees.  COOL &#x3D; 81, COOL with COLD SHOT &#x3D; 81,  WARM &#x3D; 122, WARM with COLD SHOT &#x3D; 81.  So it would appear that the switch setting of COOL and the COLD SHOT button both kill the power to the heating element, which means that the COLD SHOT button only really &amp;#34;does its thing&amp;#34; when the temperature switch is set to WARM or HOT.  But that is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;The quality seems first rate.  The motor sounds smooth and powerful and the air flow is strong, even on LOW, and it does not produce the loud screechy whine that the cheap blow dryers often produce.  The color reminds me of the opalescence of pearl.  Fit and finish blow away (no pun intended) the cheap blow dryers that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am EXTREMELY pleased with this blow dryer.  It was a bit on the pricey side, about twice what I was hoping to spend, but given the quality and the fact that it does EXACTLY what I want, I feel it was worth the money.  Once person that responded to my question said that he had a Nexxus for 20 years and the only reason he had to replace it was that it got dropped and broken.  If this one lasts that long, I will be ecstatic, but the longevity will only be revealed in time, so I can&#x27;t speak to that as of yet.</li>
    <li> This is probably the most amazing blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair! I&#x27;m 32, so I have a long standing history of doing so! My hair is very long, down my back, super thick and naturally curly. I straight-blow dry my hair in less than 10 min with this bad boy! The power of the motor is unmatched for over the counter, under $200 dollar, blow dryers. The diffuser for curly hair is the best I&#x27;ve ever used also! Using it, my curly hair blow dried in 5 min! If there were more than 5 stars available, I&#x27;d give it! Btw...this dryer was $80 at Ulta. Amazon&#x27;s pricing was the best anywhere!</li>
