<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and love it.  I bought another brand so I could compare and it was no where near as effective.  Buy it!  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> When I last ordered this serum back in September 2013, the price was $25 and now it is almost double the original price. What a shame! Even when I had last used it, it was sort of okay. Nothing extraordinary about it. Also, I couldn&#x27;t use the entire bottle back then because it starts coagulating after a month or so. Wouldn&#x27;t waste $50 bucks on something that doesn&#x27;t even last long enough to use.</li>
    <li> I think adding this to my skin care regime is making me look 26 and I am 36. Wonderful. I use it 3 times a week. I have noticed less breakout and my face looks happier and healthier. Loving the the radiant glow I now have.</li>
    <li> Mixed with hylauronic acid it helps with making wrinkles disappear</li>
    <li> I ran out of my first bottle and immediately bought a second. I love this stuff! makes my skin GLOW and my pores appear smaller.</li>
    <li> I bought to use post micro-needling, which I haven&#x27;t gotten into yet...but have used this prior to using the hyluronic acid.  Coming out of the shower, which skin is till moist and cells are open - I use the Vit. C &amp; E so that it has a good change to go in deeply and be absorbed.  IT goes on sticky and somewhat thick, but as you do other things after your shower (rub in body lotion, deodorant, comb out hair) it absorbs nicely leaving a not sticky finish.  After that has absorbed, I use the hyluronic acid to finish off the skin ritual and the two products have made an amazing difference in just two weeks!  I am 60 and have started getting compliments on my skin recently, so it HAS to be these products as nothing else has changed!</li>
    <li> the solution was not as strong as I thought it would be. It does however seem to provide pretty good exfoliation characteristics</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 bottles of this serum through another Amazon account and when they arrived, both were cloudy and foggy and completely different from Skinceuticals and CSS alternatives.  I make my own CE Ferulic serums too, and the Timeless bottles were reminiscent of poorly formulated early versions.</li>
    <li> This product seems to  be working. My skin is clearer and looks better.  I only use  it in the morning</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this product. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but once i stop using it I see a difference in the look of my skin. I didn&#x27;t really notice fading of dark spots or discoloration, but it does brighten my skin and makes it glow more. I use it as a preventative measure under my sunscreen to help prevent sun damage.</li>
    <li> My skin glows. Even my dermatologist commented on how healthy I looked.</li>
    <li> after using this my skin will glow the next day ! which means it is really working ! i do recommend it for who ever wants to keep thier skin moisturized and fight aging and sun spots !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;am from Oman where the sun is shining almost the whole year!  ! ordering this from America really cost me alot more that real price of the product ! but it worth it! i will order again! wish u ship to Oman!&lt;br /&gt;so thanks for this product</li>
    <li> I am using thie along with my micro needle roller. See a big difference in fine &amp; not so fine lines around my mouth. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford the CE Ferulic product from the Skinceuticals brand and decided to try this one out instead.  I have been really happy with this product; it has done a fantastic job of helping to even out my skin tone and has even helped to lighten the dark circles that I get under my eyes.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much improvement in the under-eye region, but this product made a real difference for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dark under-eye circles are genetic (my mom and grandmother resemble raccoons) and my lifestyle doesn&#x27;t help; I am a lawyer who spends long hours in front of a computer screen and I do not get the recommended amount of sleep each night.  I have been trying everything to try to keep the circles from getting worse but nothing would make a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product daily for 3 weeks, there was a noticeable difference in how dark the circles were.  The rest of my skin tone was somewhat evened out and brighter, but the biggest improvement was that the circles were so much lighter and now are much easier to hide.  Have been using it for 3 months now with just a dab of the Maybelline under-eye concealer, the circles are almost completely hidden.  Three months ago, I&#x27;d have to cake that concealer on in multiple layers just to cover the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my overall skin health, I have a very severe case of polycystic ovarian syndrome and the lovely hormonal cystic acne that comes along with it.  I am being treated with an arsenal of strong prescription topical creams, but my skin is incredibly acne prone and I have to be really careful; thanks to all of the prescription creams, my skin is super sensitive.  I have been able to use this as part of my daily morning regimen for the past 3 months now and have not had a single issue with breakouts or any additional skin irritation.  I apply this serum first and wait for it to dry completely, then apply a prescription gel and wait for it to dry, and then I slather SPF 30 sunscreen over my whole face.  It has worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did arrive as a clear fluid, but I have noticed in the past two weeks that it has gotten a bit darker/yellowed.  It still appears to be working just fine and is the same consistency, but I just wanted to mention it as several other reviewers had noticed it as well.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, I&#x27;ve been using it with my dermaroller and now my skin looks so much better. Scars are fading away :) simply love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks.  I personally don&#x27;t feel like I have seen much difference, but just yesterday an acquaintance told me that my skin was looking healthier and she was unaware that I was using anything.  I am using this in conjunction with the 0.5mm MicroNeedle Skin Roller and Phytoceramides.  The unsolicited comment gave me hope, so I will continue to use them and see if the results continue to improve.  I am going to also start taking weekly pictures to see if the results are real.  But this product on its own merit is great.  It came very quickly and was packaged well.  It was clear, which I understand is important.</li>
    <li> perfect facial brightening Vitamin C serum combined with vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper and better then any expensive facial serum, provided use of daily moisturizer with sun protection cream to prevent damage to skin and staying away from sun.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase. I am using a combo of products on my face right now, but I start every morning with the 20% vit c&amp;e, and I think it may be doing some good.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I think of as used for antiaging drops.</li>
    <li> great for micro needling definately make  a difference, use your sun screen if you go out that is all</li>
    <li> Great product! Reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this serum. I find it works well for a day and a night time. It is light, non greasy.</li>
    <li> received quickly and works great</li>
    <li> This is quite strong so you need to be careful how much you apply....but seemed to work well.  Don&#x27;t use every day.</li>
    <li> This serum is applied after using a derma roller, and while it stung a bit at first, I could see an immediate effect on my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
    <li> The product arrived clear which means it&#x27;s fresh (vitamin C is not oxidized yet), and it is watery in consistency which makes me believe that it does contain 20% as claimed.  It is hard to apply due to the consistency, but the benefits (smoother, firmer skin) are more noticeable and show up quicker compared to other vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried, and it didn&#x27;t break me out.  Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> was rancid when received</li>
    <li> item is very high quality and shipped very fast</li>
    <li> I would love to go on about this product and how wonderful my skin look however, I don&#x27;t want you all to buy this product so it becomes hard to get.  I already find the shipping time a bit ridicules.  Excellent product, but leave it for me!</li>
    <li> Good sized bottle.  I have been using 1-2 times a week after using a roller.  My pores are MUCH smaller and my skin is smooth and firm.  Not much difference in my hyper-pigmentation but it has only been 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product and my face misses it when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum everyday since I got it, a good month or so now. I do not see any difference in my skin. None what so ever, another waste of money on beauty products.</li>
    <li> very good product.  noticed results right away.  great price, brand names of the same thing cost a lot more and aren&#x27;t any better.  will be reordering soon.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Powerful, though. Be careful if your skin is sensitive</li>
    <li> What a huge difference this made, renewed and refreshing while plunbing up my face. Love this!!</li>
    <li> I learned about Vitamin C for the skin from my sister, but she spares no expense and I am definitely a bargain shopper. I decided to try this and I have not been offered a senior discount since (I&#x27;m 53). My skin is clearer and firmer, fine lines definitely diminished, I have only used 1/2 of 1 bottle so far. I will buy this again. My one concern is that though the solution smells very fresh and clean it was a bit thick on arrival and has just gotten thicker, it can&#x27;t really be considered a liquid, its more gel-like and difficult to draw up into the dropper. Still seems to work though!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law.  She loves it and swears it is awesome and has used it for quite some time.  She is beautiful so I believe her!</li>
    <li> I purchased directly from Timeless, because it was cheaper, and they have a 30-day return policy.  I tried it for three nights and I hated it - it has a repulsive smell, and even though I kept it far away from my eyes, when I woke up in the morning, that delicate skin area looked so awful it was though I had aged 10 years.  I contacted Timeless to return it, but they never responded.</li>
    <li> I recently began to use this product to help fade some of my hyper pigmentation from a past breakout. I definitely saw and improvement in my skin overall. It seems more even toned and helped with the fading. I have not tried any of the competing companies with C+E Ferulic Acid Serum formulation, so I cannot compare the results. However, these results have been more than sufficient enough for me to count purchasing this product. Give it a try if you are looking to improve the tone and evenness of your skin!</li>
    <li> Im usually too lazy to write a review,&lt;br /&gt;I have been having Photo facial Treatments at the Drs office and wasted lots of money on it,nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;I said ok i will give it a try it has been a month and i can see diffrence.I had 2 pregnancies and my face is covered with brown like spots.&lt;br /&gt;So this is helping,just make sure to put  sunscreen on.&lt;br /&gt;What i do is i use dermo roller once a week or every two weeks and apply this product that is also great</li>
    <li> I just received this product and first off, I love the protective packing. it is bubble wrap protected and encased in a plastic container with packing filler in it (that made me happy because of the festive colors (: )  ..the bottle is also larger than I expected, I thought 1 oz. was smaller but glad it&#x27;s not! so far, I really like that it is not oily but not too watery either. I also love that it only takes one pipet (dropper) full to cover the neck and face. I will make an edit after a couple weeks to say how it is working.</li>
    <li> this produve might be too irritated for my skin,&lt;br /&gt; i dont know why i feel itch and have pimples after apply......</li>
    <li> Excellent with the derma roller, a must to buy! You can feel it work and after a few uses, you can see a difference. I have heavy dark spots and if it works for me, it can work for anyone.</li>
    <li> Or if you tend to thumb your nose at sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermo told me to get a 20% Vit C product, and I chose this one. It&#x27;s a bit slippery, but you&#x27;ll get used to it. Keep it in the fridge,because C is very unstable. Don&#x27;t use this once in awhile-use it every day because C gets weak after 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this product amazed me with the first bottle. Dark spots lightened dramatically, my skin smoothed out and seemed to be a bit finer-grained. Firmer, too. Fine wrinkles disappeared, deep ones got thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a couple of other brands on Amazon-one was too watery and didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing. One was actually kind of chunky with undisolved powder. I like this one by Timeless Skin best of the lot.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I saw a significant improvement in my skin within the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product and especially it&#x27;s price, compared to other brands.[[ASIN:B0036BI56G 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz.]]</li>
    <li> Goes on like water - no sticky or greasy feel left on face. Has all the ingredients of another much more expensive formula that I used in the past. I will continue to purchase this one!</li>
    <li> I think this product is good for the price.  However, be aware there is a metallic odor, but I&#x27;ve never tried a C serum before so it could be that they all smell.</li>
    <li> Shipped timely, as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and the results after a short period of time are amazing.  My skin feels much softer, and the fine lines around my mouth and eye area are diminishing greatly.  I can hardly wait to see the improvement after months of use!</li>
    <li> As with any vitamin C product, heat will degrade it. I wish they would be send with a cold pack, especially in the summer months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face after cleansing in the evening, there is a slight tingle/sting after putting it on but in the morning my skin looks brighter and clear.  Good price and good product.</li>
    <li> Great product, nice texture, not too thin in consistency like other products.  Keep in refrigerator to prolong shelf life.  I will purchase this product again after trying several others, comparing how it made my skin feel after use.</li>
    <li> This is as good as more expensive products. You just need to use it consistently (that goes for everything we use) to begin to see improvements in your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought it on the advice of friends .. Will buy it again and I would recommend it my friends</li>
    <li> I Haven&#x27;t notice a big improvement yet. I can say that my face is glowing. Like it hasn&#x27;t before. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and this product goes by very quickly. I love the ingredients But my face stinks in the morning. It smells like cheese or something similar. Has anyone else experienced this? I don&#x27;t know but I will continue to use for the 3rd month to see if my acne scars fade some.</li>
    <li> Bought this brand rather than a rival $158 brand, so i have nothing to compare it to. I&#x27;d hoped to use it on my face, but every time I do, I get horrible, deep-seated, red, angry pimples that take weeks to clear up.  But I use it on neck, chest, arms and hands and it&#x27;s had a notable brightening/lightening effect esp on hands and arms.</li>
    <li> i love this.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels like a baby skin in a few days!!!!&lt;br /&gt;however.. i can&#x27;t buy this anymore...&lt;br /&gt;I am a college student and there is no way i can fit this thing in my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it works like wonder.</li>
    <li> really good product, made an immediate impact</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more affordable vitimin C for my face in the mornings.  This product had very good reviews so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I have been very happy with the product.  It goes on smoothly, silky feeling to my skin.  I love the clear silky feeling to my skin.  My skin appears to love it so I&#x27;m hooked.  Thank you for a great adorable product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0036BI56G 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz.]]    I was searching for a vitamin c serum after the one I used to buy got discontinued (from avon).   I found this and it had only one review but since it was a good review I took a chance. I&#x27;m so glad I did, I&#x27;ve been using it for only 2 weeks but I already noticed a difference! My skin is smooth, tighter and lighter. I use it only at night by itself but I was thinking of using it with a cream but I dont even think I need to, besides I dont want over load my skin with lots of products. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> For those name brand products that have the same name and cost much much more...  I have found the sister to you and needless to say the price is right...  I will definitely purchase this product again from this seller..  The service was quick.</li>
    <li> Product arrived packaged well...in original box and bubble wrapped...fast shipping as well...received in under a week.  This is my second bottle...I really like the way this serum makes my skin feel...super soft and smooth...I&#x27;m going to make myself believe that it helps my fine lines...maybe after the second bottle I will be surprised!  I do believe it helps keep your skin more moisturized, which is important part of skin care and anti-aging along with frequent facials and good sunscreen. Miracle in a bottle...I think, no...good moisturizing serum...definately!</li>
    <li> Vit C product that rejuvenates and brightens your face! Your skin soaks in this product and it feels so velvety soft!</li>
    <li> Seems like a good product and with 20 per cent Vitamin C, it must be having some benefit, since C is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this product made my face glow great products great price. Have us used other similar expensive products and this did the same thing</li>
    <li> This serum is an excellent product both at the price point and results. I integrate this serum with a facial oil in the mornings and I have had a brighter complexion. Similar products cost 2-3X as much. If your on the fence, don&#x27;t be--get it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this did anything to my skin but definitely a great addition to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> The product went bad in a month and a half.  Not worth it.  What else is there to say?  Shame!</li>
    <li> I like to have a low fuss low time beauty routine.  For that the best alternative is to use products that are easily and quickly absorbed into the skin.  Heavy creams just sit there forever.  This vit C is absorbed almost inmediately and the results are beautiful. I have good skin in my face but as son as I started using it on my neck where the sun damage is more noticeable I saw improvement very quickly.  Now it looks as young as my face does.  I wash my face in the morning when I get up, I apply this product and I give it only 10 minutes before I start my routine.  In the mornings this is the only beauty product I use and I go straight to the SPF moisturizer and then make-up.  This is someting totally worth having, you will love the results.</li>
    <li> I received this product about a week ago. I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with derma-rollers. So far I have notices dramatic changes for such a short time of use.  I am dark skinned; have acne scarring around my nose and chin, dilated pores on my chicks. I have noted more cleared skin, less pimples, youthful glow and even skin tone.  Less dilated pores, a lot less black head.  So far great results for a very reasonable price and amount of product</li>
    <li> great texture. will buy again.</li>
    <li> After some research on line about vitamin c and its benefits, I also did research on pricing.  This product cannot be beat for the price.  I never used vitamin c before and have noticed a huge difference in the skin on my face and back of my hands.  My skin tone is more even and my complexion seems more translucent.  I have been using it for about 4 months now and won&#x27;t be without this product.  I have received positive comments from friends and family and gave credit to vitamin c.  I don&#x27;t see any difference in the active ingredients in this item and other high end name brands that cost 2,3 or 4 times as much.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Expected more from the product.</li>
    <li> I believe there are better companies with similar products to try before this.  My experience with this company has been a bit shady.  I ordered some of their product some time ago direct from their website.  The product seemed of ok value, clear (or very pale yellow) and didn&#x27;t discolour for about 4 months.  I believe it did have a positive effect on my skin, however I will not be ordering from them again for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;The account I opened on their website has obviously been closed or altered because I cannot log back in to order more.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried emailing them three or four times to ask for my password to be sent to me and have heard nothing back.&lt;br /&gt;Since I ordered from them my spam in my email has increased 10 or 20 fold, leading me to believe that they have sold my email address to other companies.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to google this company in connection to bad reviews and found many accounts of peoples credit cards being charged for items they did not buy and shoddy customer service.  It all seems a bit sketchy to me so I will not be buying from them again.  There are similar products out there with more reputable companies.</li>
    <li> I have finished the bottle and I am very hopeful.  I will continue to order a new bottler in order to get continued improvements.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is better than some of the more expensive brands, and it doesn&#x27;t feel tacky or sticky when you apply it.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product I actually only ended up using it for about a week. I found that it started making my skin dark in the areas I used it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I am an African American or what. So the product is actually just sitting around for me. Although, I did read a lot of reviews for it on Youtube that were very positive- I just didn&#x27;t see a difference for me. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I never had major skin issues even in my 20s except some blackheads, few breakouts every few months and 2 unnoticeable milia under my eye. But as soon as I entered in my 30s, I became conscious about my skin and wanted to change my skincare regimen to include some anti aging products. I read about AHAs, BHAs, retin A, retinol, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C etc etc. Overwhelmed with information availble on internet I decided to make the safest choice i.e vitamin C (with hyaluronic acid) as others can be little harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my first bottle in Jul 2013 after reading great reviews. It didn&#x27;t take me long to see results, my blackheads were gone in a week, some old acne marks were lightened, dark circles diminished and surprisingly enough my milia flaked off! People started asking me what I am doing different that my skin looks so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finished this bottle, I decided to buy &#x27;most popular&#x27; and expensive vit C serum out of curiosity. It was great too but not any better than this. I am happy I tried, atleast I know now that this one is as good as the expensive C-serums out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using timeless since then and ordered my third bottle 2-days ago. No blackheads, no acne breakouts, just brighter smooth even skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.- This year, I also included BHA 2% liquid in my skin care with very good results. C- serum in morning, BHA at night.</li>
    <li> Its fresh and its in a colored container which prevents oxidation.  Nice labeling also. The price is nice. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have spent a boat load of money trying not to look my age. Looking younger like eating healthy can be expensive. However sometimes you run across a product like this serum that works and is affordable. I have been using this Timeless Skin Care product for about a month now and even my kids see the great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 13 year old daughter use to tell me daily about how old I looked.....I am I gonna look like that when I am 52 Mom? Now I hear you look great did you get younger? That is the best endorsement you can have to try this product. It is a great feeling now to look in the mirror and see how much better I look and feel.</li>
    <li> Gave my skin a very nice glow.  I use this after the micro needle roller and it is great for repairing skin.  I am out of it...must buy more.</li>
    <li> Love the product but no matter how you screw the lid on it is loose in a few hours. Will not stay secure.</li>
    <li> I just received my order of this product today, does any one else think it smells fishy? or is this normal? I can live with it if it&#x27;s normal.[[ASIN:B0036BI56G 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz.]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m intrigued by the amount of positives reviews... Truely.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this vitamin C serum for a month now and it didn&#x27;t improve my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet the opposite in fact my complexion is now rather dull with the same amount of blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this review because I did tried another brand of vitamin C serum 2 years ago and was blown away by the the positive effect it had on my overall skin texture and complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of this company so tried Timeless Skin Care hoping for the same result.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m either an exception to all this great reviews or this product is just mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;PS: The one star is for the prompt communication with this company and the good secure packaging.</li>
    <li> Got it in 2 days love it</li>
    <li> I used to love this brand, and my first 2 bottles worked beautifully. It used to do a good job on my skin tone, and in fading discolorations. However, this last bottle I purchased must&#x27;ve been a bad one. The serum was milky and cloudy. It was ineffective.</li>
    <li> Was sent here by &amp;#34;hotandflashy&#x27; YT videos ...  love this, non irritating and appears to make skin look softer. I bought 1/2 oz blue glass bottles that she recommended with droppers and I transfer it into these upon arrival. I keep one in the fridge and use the other first, so product doesn&#x27;t oxidize as fast  ... supposedly makes it last longer.</li>
    <li> Love it! Change in appearance in my complexion after 2weeks of use!! Highly recommend . Great price..much more expensive in dept. stores and percentage of C is lower.</li>
    <li> Just received and really don&#x27;t know how it will work but have used for 3 days and it seems to be working. Don&#x27;t know if it will do everything promised but let&#x27;s hope so.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely perfect on my skin. It glows and I am 54 years old. Love it great price too!</li>
    <li> So far so good skin does look better and brighter. Did not cause any peels or out breaks.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I am happy with this product and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my blackhead prone skin and I already have saw great improvements with breakouts!!!!! Will continue to order this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I read about the amazing benefits of Vitamin C as well as the importance of creating an airtight and low light packing. After taking advice from the writers of the Future Derm blog, as well as various online reviewers who favorably compared this serum to other more expensive brands, I am glad I purchased this. My skin is clearer and brighter, helping to minimize acne marks and some freckles.</li>
    <li> I have used Skinceuticals in the past when I worked for doctor who kindly allowed me to get the product at wholesale price while I worked for him.  (It was still almost 3x as much as what Timeless Skin Care charges for their product at full cost).  I haven&#x27;t been able to afford a quality vitamin c serum for some time now and have been noticing how my skin has been affected by that.  The combination of Vitamin C (L-Asorbic acid), Vitamin E and ferulic acid helps to make your sunscreen more effective as well as build collagen over time.  It&#x27;s an absolute must for anyone serious about skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to be sensitive, oily and prone to cystic acne.  The Skinceutical version had a heavier feeling on my skin and actually made me break out.  This formulation is a little higher in pH (not so high that the beneficial effects are compromised) and has a higher percentage of Vitamin C than Skinceuticals.  These changes make the serum feel lighter on my skin.  It has not caused any breakouts.  The higher percentage of Vitamin C is ideal for those with oily skin but may be irritating to those who have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strong smell typically associated with Vitamin C serums is markedly decreased in this product because they have added a fragrance.  It&#x27;s not like you can smell a particular scent but I do know the overall smell is not as strong as the Skinceutical serum.  I personally don&#x27;t like the idea of fragrances because that can apply to a whole assortment of chemicals but for the price of this serum -- I&#x27;m not complaining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am thrilled with Timeless Skin Care&#x27;s Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid serum.  With my limited budget, it&#x27;s nice to know that even in a poor economy I can still afford quality skincare.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great value.</li>
    <li> This definitely works.  I&#x27;ve used it for 4 days and already notice dark spots and other discolorations fading.  Skin feels tighter and fuller as well.  Definitely worth the price too.  1 oz. will probably go a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with my derma roller. Works well, but I wish it were less expensive.</li>
    <li> Great price and results.  My skin is definately birghter and tighter. I&#x27;m 43 years old, annd I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily, non-greasy, seems to be having a good effect! Delivery was quick and product arrived in perfect condition. I have ordered it twice and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this instead of the pricey Skinceuticals version; It feels the same and smells very similar.  Too soon to tell if it works the same, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product.  My skin is more clear and toned.  I would definately re-order this product.  I have a fresh and clean look all the time 0 make-up.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice anything after using.  Don&#x27;t particularly like the texture Eire. Feels like putting thicker water on skin. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet only have used it for 3 days,like this  so far</li>
    <li> This was my first venture into serums, I was stopped cold but the outrageous prices when I first looked awhile back.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;It took about 4 days for the improvement to show and my skin has steadily improved.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t find this earlier.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several months, at least 6 months, and have seen a difference in my facial appearance.  I have some damage from severe sunburn as a teen growing up and this has minimized the damage considerably so I will continue to use.  This has helped more than any product previously used.  The only thing that would help any more than this would be cosmetic surgery.</li>
    <li> Still using with hope</li>
    <li> Stuff makes my skin smooth, soft, clear and glowing. Really, what else would one want from skin care? I&#x27;ve tried serums that cost ten times the amount and never gotten the same results. I always come back to this one when my skin seems like it needs a refresher or it is dulling down.</li>
    <li> The product leaves your face feeling great. I know it says do not use on oily skin but I have had no issues with it, I do however use a very small amount. The evenness on my skin looks better and the product feels really nice and light. The shipping was really fast. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> This product seems to oxidize quickly.  I have kept it sealed and out of light save for when I am applying it, and yet it has turned a cloudy color.  Vitamin C serum that has oxidized is not good for use.  I ordered this product twice and the 2nd time it seemed to oxidize faster than the first time.</li>
    <li> Great product but turns yellow after a month.  I kept it in a dark place but I guess that is not enough to keep it from going bad.</li>
    <li> I saw it in a blog and 3 brands were compared based on the amount of Vitamin C in it and this brand was a winner with 20%.&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying it in the morning and even around my under eyes and I believe it is making some difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am taking it as simultaneously with Phytoceramids from Sports Nutrition.</li>
    <li> Maybe serums just aren&#x27;t for me, but I thought I would give this a try.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference after using for 2 months.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fraction of the cost of the more expensive brands. This is the second time I have purchased this product. Extremely fast shipping too! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am giving the product five stars because it uses a tinted glass bottle (important since light kills Vitamin C) L-Ascorbic acid and stabilizes the mix with Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E. Two effective stabilizers in stabilizing the unstable Vitamin C molecule!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d also like to explain some things to users of this product and things users should know about vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve noticed about a lot of ascorbic acid powders or vitamin c products on Amazon, it&#x27;s the fact that they only say ascorbic acid/vitamin C but don&#x27;t say what KIND. That&#x27;s it. Vague ol&#x27; &amp;#34;ascorbic acid&amp;#34;, plain ol&#x27; vitamin C. I say this because ascorbic acid consists of two molecules: L (Levo meaning left) and D (Dextro meaning right) L-Ascorbic acid is the superior molecule thanks to being more beneficial to our skin! Makes the skin acidic which means unhappy bacteria, helps build collagen, and helps to reverse UV damage while evening out your complexion! Dextro-Ascorbic acid on the other hand has substantially less vitamin C, actually has more cons than pros and does not occur naturally. The thing about our bodies and the asymmetry of molecules is that if we can use one hand of a molecule in a beneficial manner, its opposite-hand molecule is likely to do badly for our physiology. So while L-Ascorbic acid is awesome, D-Ascorbic is not. When you have a compound that has BOTH hands of a molecule, your body will either reject the incompatible handed molecule as waste, both hand-molecules will cancel each other out making the benefits of the compound null, or your body will just react terribly to the bad-hand molecule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why it is important to make sure you are getting PURE L-ASCORBIC ACID and thankfully, this serum has it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, as quality as these ingredients are, I&#x27;m going to be very honest, if you&#x27;re NEW to vitamin C and you&#x27;re starting out on 20%, your skin is going to STING and apt to possibly getting slightly burned. Evenif you don&#x27;t see it, you&#x27;ll definitely feel it. Ascorbic acid is an acid, after all! A lot of the reviews note stinging when the serum is applied and that is of no surprise because buying this means you are starting out on the HIGHEST acceptable concentration of vitamin c for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please start out on a gentle amount when you&#x27;re new to Vit C skincare. 5% vitamin C is a great concentration to start at. Ramp up your concentration by 5% every two weeks so by week 2, you&#x27;re moving from 5% to 10%, week 4 from 10% to 15%, week 6 15% to 20% and STOP. When you reach 20%, you are a-okay and totally ready to use this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GO NO HIGHER THAN 20%! Anything higher than 20% is bad! Even the famed L-Ascorbic acid has its limits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if Timeless Skin Care offered multiple concentrations of this serum, that&#x27;d be absolutely amazing for the customers who have to build that tolerance. But I really do strongly recommend you build your way up to 20% concentration tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be kind to your skin, everyone!</li>
    <li> Skinceutical uses the same ingredients ,but charges at least four times more!  I used both and find them to be no different,  other than the price. It&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin,  my skin looked good for about a week,  then nothing,  no change. I used the whole bottle for a month.&lt;br /&gt;Saw no real change in my skin.  47 and aging..</li>
    <li> Excellent value and product. All the same ingredients as the other competitors for way less the price. I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years and very satisfied.</li>
    <li> it makes my skin feel smooth and tight. But i got 2 bottles and the contents were 2 different colors. one was yellow color and the other bottle was milky transparent.. so I don&#x27;t really know what color it should be! So far the yellow one worked great</li>
    <li> i have used this for two weeks now and was disappointed in the results. skin felt good but did not see a difference. will not but it again</li>
    <li> I have been using this about a month, and can see some different in my skin tone.  It was recommended by someone on You Tube for skin over 50.&lt;br /&gt;I will re-order as it is a good price for Vitamin C syrum.</li>
    <li> Timeless brand is a great brand.... but the company I ordered it from is awful..... The liquid is supposed to be clear!!! it came cloudy and smelled weird... I contacted them they told me it was made with a new processing system and now comes cloudy... everything I have read says it SHOULD not come cloudy!!  I have bought 2 others before this and they were clear!  I kept going round and round with this distributor.... I asked for a new bottle to replace it, they stopped replying!!!!  As you can tell they lack customer service!</li>
    <li> I have bought this numerous times and in the beginning loved it but the last 2 orders have not been good. Turned cloudy with in 2 weeks and smelled like alcohol? will be trying another brand</li>
    <li> I can feel the skin tingling which is a good sign with the ferulic acid involved, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Vit C</li>
    <li> Use every night. Diminishing lines and wrinkles already.</li>
    <li> I use this together with Retinol 2% and I like the two combined.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on you tube, Hot and Flashy. Tried it and liked it. I would highly recommend this product. I use it every day twice a day.</li>
    <li> I use this serum prior to moisturizing morning and night. It feels wonderful and works better thn much more expensive serums.</li>
    <li> Smells just like rubbing alcohol. Very pungent. i have been using this for over 1 month to use in conjunction with 350mg Phytoceramides. It was cloudy when I received it and company said \\&quot;it was a new batch\\&quot;. So either way I lose. I bought this to accompany the by mouth 350mg of Phytoceramides. This stuff actually hurts my skin. I should have bought the more expensive brand. This stuff doesn&#x27;t even come with instructions.</li>
    <li> Love this serum!!! The smell is like a woodsy scent and it feels refreshing on my face. I have purchased this product before and I will continue to do so. My Dermatologist highly recommended it and I&#x27;m so glad she did.....Love it!!!</li>
    <li> If they could make this for the bath , I&#x27;d have the skin of a prepubescent super model</li>
    <li> I am 50 - and have been blessed with beautiful skin all my life - a gift from GMA....however, as I have been aging.....not so much.  I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun, from $300.00 beauty creams to you name it...after this product?..my skin looks like it did at 35....I am not kidding!  I love this stuff....whatever it is!  Keep making it....it works wonders for me!!</li>
    <li> I will buy this again and again, ..what else can I say?  (it is light, non greasy, and just what i was looking for but couldn&#x27;t find locally in any shop)</li>
    <li> This item was much cheaper than the product my dermatologist sells, and has the same potency, so I am pleased overall.</li>
    <li> Have not used this product long term yet so I can&#x27;t give an adequate review. However I can say I care on how my skin feels after the serum is applied. It feels a little sticky. I was expecting it to feel silly.</li>
    <li> I bought Timeless Skincare 20% Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid Serum from timelessha.com. It&#x27;s well formulated (l ascorbic acid, vitamin E and ferulic acid | pH of 3), lightweight and has no discernable fragrance. I replaced the dropper with a pump from specialtybottle.com to minimize contact with air. I store in in the fridge to prolong it&#x27;s non-oxidized state. Timeless Skincare 20% Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid Serum is very effective for fading hyperpigmentation and easy on my wallet.  Ingredients: Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid, Fragrance</li>
    <li> great product, I would highly recommend this product. My skin looks better and I use it every morning before makeup</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum.  My skin has never looked brighter or more even toned.  This particular serum from Timeless Skin Care was recommended by Angie on YouTube and I am so glad I took her advice and ordered it.  The ordering process was easy, it arrived even sooner than expected, and the product is fresh and arrived in perfect condition.  I will definitely be ordering this on a regular basis.  Thank you for a wonderful product and fantastic customer service!</li>
    <li> When I first received the 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz., it was cloudy.  I contacted Timeless via amazon.com and they responded immediately.  They explained that it was probably exposed to heat and sent me a replacement product immediately.  Not only am I extremely pleased with the product, my results, and the price - I am extremely happy with the customer service at Timeless!  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I usually never write reviews about products, but decided to give my opionion on this one because after almost a year of searching for better Vitamin C serum I am back to Timeless. I have been using Vitamin C serums for about 2 years now and literally have tried about 5-6 other brands because I&#x27;m a sucker for reviews :). They were good, but none of the ones I&#x27;ve used before or after Timeless have given my skin as smooth of a feel as this product, so I am back for good. Perhaps it is the Ferulic acid that does the magic, but regardless - this formula seems to work the best for me. Perhaps there is a product out there that&#x27;s even better, but I haven&#x27;t found it and at this point it would take a lot of convincing to make me give another one a shot. Oh, and about 1-2 star reviews: most of them are complaints about shipping speed and other topics unrelated to product itself, so please read ALL reviews before deciding on the product.</li>
    <li> I really notice a difference in my complexion, it makes my skin glow, my mother even said to me that my skin is the most even she&#x27;s ever seen it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: OCT 2012 I&#x27;m on my third bottle, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go without this. It makes my complexion great, and helps with my acne. (one bottle lasts about four months before it goes bad, if you keep it in a cool dark place, I&#x27;m not even half through the bottle when it goes bad)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2013: I am SSOOO impressed I had to come and write more about it. A little while ago I had horrible break outs and bought a different brand  that promised skin lightening. That brand went bad faster, and didn&#x27;t have the beautiful complexion results I get from this (my skin was horrible anyway so it didn&#x27;t matter)  I went back to this, the clearness of the serum is pristine, makes me want to drink it. It is perfect for summer, not only because it adds sun protection, but because I do tan a bit in the summer, but put a much higher SPF on my face, so I have a tan but my face does not. This is a harsh chemical. I am not able to put it straight on my skin, it can cause chemical burns.  It does make my face look a little reddish, but the sun kissed, just got back from the beach look. So now my white face predicament is over too! Thanks for such a great product, I&#x27;m glad I found this  in my twenties!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week 2x&#x27;s daily and I already see dramatic results! My skin is clear and even toned- all large pores seem to have shrunken. I am very impressed for the price. I admit I was very skeptical when I first received the item as there was little information on the bottle. The consistency is just like others have described: very watery/runny and a bit cloudy looking. I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> This works extremely better than most of the expensive creams,i had a very damaged skin with deep wrinkles specially on my forehead now its almost all gone within 3 months of using it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now.  Wow what a difference.  It has made my skin softer and clearer. I use it in the morning under my moisturizer and retin A at night 3X a week.  I have received numerous compliments on my skin. I was going to buy SkinCeuticals but decided to try this first.  I will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> I have a month using it and it is just as good as $150.00 I paid for skinceuitical brand</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel as thought this product has Vitamin C in it. I have used Vit C before and this product does not even sting.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this a couple of weeks and have gotten so many compliments on my skin glowing. This will be a long term product for me</li>
    <li> I use this as an alternative to Skinceuticals. Its a great product although sometimes it arrives clear and sometimes cloudy.</li>
    <li> my grandma uses this product a lot and she looks very young for the age of 54. she has nice smooth skin</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any measurable difference after completing the product.  Felt good going on however.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 5 month and I definitely see my skin much healthier.</li>
    <li> I tried this the same time as Alpha Hyrox oil free. Using both made a big difference in the appearance of fine lines and discoloration. I&#x27;m 46 and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel great</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this product!  I was using much more expensive Vitamin C serums until I found this one after some research.  I&#x27;m glad I found it.  It works great - gives my skin a nice, healthy glow and helps keep it smooth.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mother, it cleared all the sun sports from her face, aplying it every day in the morning. She is very pleased, I&#x27;m ordering one for myself and my sister</li>
    <li> I put this on first before my  Estée Lauder firming serum and than my Estée Lauder hydrationist moisturizer. And my face has never been so smooth so healthy looking.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of this.  It absorbs into skin very quickly, not at all greasy. I add a moisturizer on top, could see a difference within just a few uses.  It really helps to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; the fine lines around eyes and mouth etc.  BUT you need to use it regularly.  It attracts moisture and holds it causing the areas to plump.  I noticed the difference and my regular moisturizer couldn&#x27;t do the same on its own.  I have mature skin so I have to use more than the three drops others  speak of (per application).  Compared to other products on the market that make similar claims this is a reasonably priced addition to add to your skin care regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast and free!  I have bought their Squalane  and Hyaluronic Acid also.  No breakage or leaking.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best skin care product, available without a prescription, I have ever used. After my first application at night, my skin was smoother and dewier the next morning. With continued long-term use, I have noticed that my skin tone has become brighter and more even, and elasticity improved. The consistency is a viscous liquid, perfect for spreading over your face and getting into your pores. After it is absorbed into your skin, it leaves a natural dewy finish, not an oil slick. I like that this formula doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of extraneous ingredients like a lot of department store brands. I love everything about this product! When you order it, you are shipped a FRESH batch, so you get the maximum benefit of the ingredients. The vitamin C does oxidize over time, and I like how this company cares enough to send you freshly made product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. All the high quality vitamin c serums ive seen are clear like water. This states that it will be cloudy when you receive it because its been just mixed, but guess what? Ive seen this made on youtube and its never cloudy, always clear. I used to buy this from skinceuticals and the formula was amazing. I changed because I wanted to save some money but I suppose you get what you pay for. I shouldn&#x27;t have put it on my skin because I heard once it turns a different color besides clear, then its actually extremely bad for your skin. I suppose that&#x27;s what happened to me, my skin got oily, my pores got huge and I even broke out. I also kid you not, the marionette lines around my mouth are a lot more noticeable. I hate this stuff. This company is a scam. Be careful buying products from them because they are sending upu old products. Vitamin c is unstable and can damage your skin if its old or cloudy or brown etc. Don&#x27;t believe their company that it will be cloudy and will turn clear after, that&#x27;s never happened to mine and ive had it for almost a week. Im soo sorry I gave this a try. Now I will have to start from scratch and try to get rid of the breakouts, the large pores and the tired aweful looking complexion of my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this Serum and it doesn&#x27;t sting or make my face sensitive.  I hope it&#x27;s working, it has been part of my morning routing for about 6 months now, and I feel good about using it.  I use a retinol complex at night.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product! I use this at night after micro needling so I feel a brief sting, but I definitely notice a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s smoother, pores are smaller and I have a couple of spots that have lightened. I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month and I only use it a few times a week, but I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and is a light weight serum.  Does not make my allergy-prone skin burn or breakout in a rash. Does well under my Dior moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I would recommend this product. I had no problems with this purchase. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and will definately re-order.  This item has the exact same ingredients as similiar products that are priced much higher.</li>
    <li> This serum works very well.  I can barely see my 11&#x27;s anymore and others can&#x27;t see them at all.  It can slightly burn when you first start using it but, try every other day for a while if you have to.  It is truely worth it. I use my clarisonic at night, then this serum  and then moisturizer.  My skin has really improved.  I bought some blue bottles like these to put half of it in, wrap in foil and put in the fridge.  I got that tip off of youtube.  It seems this kind of serum will turn yellow before it lasts the estimated 3 months.  This way you will get your entire 3 months worth of treatment out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order again and from the same seller.</li>
    <li> Great antiaging product. Makes a big difference. Easy to apply. Absorbs quickly. I would highly recommend this product. Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Youth in a bottle! I highly recommend purchasing this product. It has changed my skin texture &amp; I have been getting a lot of compliments for the change. I will purchase this again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes this would perform just as well as the luxury brand vitamin c serums I have purchased in the past. I was very hopeful. However it does not. It does not have that distinctive smell directly linked to vitamin c serums, but further on it doesn&#x27;t react as well on my skin as say Paula&#x27;s Choice Super Booster. I use this serum every morning and every night, and frankly as soon as I apply it I can feel that this is a low quality product. I will continue to use it until it runs out, I want to give it a fair shot. However I doubt I will repurchase this again. It&#x27;s just not a top notch product, I have not seen nor felt any improvement in skin tone or texture. If you are looking for vitamin c serum that will deliver results, unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t seem to be it. I would not recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I had been strictly a SkinCeutical user for quite a while and the C &amp; E Ferulic Serum, is what I use the most frequently from their line of skin care.  However, SkinCeutical is very expensive, their serum costing well over $100.00 for one fl. Oz.  With all of the cleansers, serums, creams, oils, moisturizers, and other skin care products that I am currently using this is beginning to add up to hundreds of dollars, money well spent, but this is still a serious amount.  Anyway, while cruising through Amazon.com, this Timeless C &amp; E Ferulic pops up on a page, and for a small fraction of the price that I had been paying for the same product in the SkinCeutical line.  Therefore, I took a chance and ordered it, hey; $24.95 with free shipping is a drop in the ocean when hundreds of dollars are being spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing that pleased me (it&#x27;s pretty silly), was that this serum is packaged in a dark blue glass bottle.  Most of my other skin care products come in dark brown glass bottles, and it&#x27;s hard to differentiate which product is which, without my glasses on.  Now, I do keep them in a specific order for just that reason, but when someone &#x60;messes with my stuff&#x27; and I am in a hurry, having everything in the same type of container is inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Research comparing SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic Serum  to  Timeless 20% C &amp; E Ferulic Acid Serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took both products and compared the ingredients.  They are almost identical, they use different names for their emulsifiers, SkinCeuticals uses Laureth-23, and Timeless uses Polysorbate 80 but it is basically the same thing just under different names, and SkinCeuticals lists the ingredient &#x60;Alpha Tocopherol,&#x27;, which is another name for vitamin E.  Therefore, essentially the KEY ingredients of both products; L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Vitamin E, and the Ferulic Acid are equivalent to each other, EXCEPT, Timeless contains 20%  of L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), whereas SkinCeuticals only has 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visual Results:&lt;br /&gt;My final test of these two products was to apply them to my face, so on one side, I used SkinCeuticals serum, and on the other I administered the serum from Timeless.  Both serums provided the tightening effect desired, and neither one gave any irritation.  After a moment or two, letting the serum absorb, I used my 8X magnifying mirror for a close-up scrutiny and noticed no visual difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Since both SkinCeutical C E Ferulic Serum and Timeless 20% C  &amp; E Ferulic Acid are essentially the same, and the SkinCeutical brand is almost 5 times the price, normally around $125.00, then I choose Timeless C &amp; E Ferulic Serum at $24.95 (plus free shipping).  At this stage in my life, I am not into brand names as much as I am into positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading, and I hope that my review has helped regarding narrowing down choices for facial skin serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a Serum Product Description from the Timeless Skincare website followed by their application directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C - antioxidant that evens skin tone and helps build collagen.

Apply 1-2 times daily, depending on your skins sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) If going out, wear a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> From the mouth of my plastic surgeon friend, this is a MUST HAVE. Use this during the day, a Derma Roller, and Retin A at night and BOOM! It not only fixes your skin,MIT preps it for old age (ugh). This stuff is good, at half the price of its expensive twin sister by Skin Ceuticals.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only been using this a few weeks.  have i noticed an improvement in my skin?  yes, i think so.  i plan to keep on using it.</li>
    <li> Love it for my 80 year old skin! Really does diminish fine wrinkles and improves texture(pores)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for years.. i was so happy to find a skinceuticals competitor&lt;br /&gt;the price cannot be beat and the quality is excellent.. plus the company is communicative if necessary..</li>
    <li> I received my order about 3 days ago, while it took awhile for it to get to me because its made fresh, it was worth it, even in just the short time I have been using this, (3 days twice a day) I can see and feel a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture and feel, even wrinkles are starting to be less visible. I didn&#x27;t expect to see anything in just a few days but saw enough difference to have to post this review! I can&#x27;t wait to see what a months use will be. I got my daughter to use it as well, she has some scaring from acne so we will see if it helps her too. Going to continue to buy and use this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this and then changed to another and now I am back.  When I first used this my daughter said she could see results.&lt;br /&gt;I could too but I thought it was just me.  She bought another product like this and we both used it and I thought it was just ok.I reordered Timeless and wow immediately saw the difference.  I am 65 and have good skin just starting to show age. It gives me a more youthful appearance.  My skin is smoother and softer looking.  This product is a watery consistency but it outweighs the little thicker product in results.  Buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I find hardly a difference between the two items and this was so much cheaper.  Even has the same smell which I liken to Bacon? but doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
    <li> The formula for this serum is right on paper but not so much in use.  Has caused sever flushing everytime I use it...something it should be working against.  Not sure if it was diluted.  I bought the same formula from a different company I seemed to be more effective and potent.</li>
    <li> Consistency was more runny than expected, but overall a good product.  Seems to absorb into skin very well.  Looking forward to results!</li>
    <li> This is the only one I buy now.  It keeps my skin soft and helps keep my skin tone even.</li>
    <li> I like that the formulation is L ascorbic acid 20% and the ingredients don&#x27;t contain anything useless. The best (and most important) thing is that the serum is made freshly and designed to last 3 months thus making us aware that there is a time limit on Vitamin c products so they don&#x27;t oxidize and damage our skin.</li>
    <li> Great product really works!</li>
    <li> Just bought again for my third time...Great results and no breakouts</li>
    <li> So this goes on feeling greasy and sticky, and you wonder what is happening on your face, but just wait a few minutes. It absorbs after about 5 minutes and then you can put on your sunscreen or whatever your next step is.  This never made my face sting, and I have super sensitive, combo skin, so that fantastic. I&#x27;ve only been using it about a month - not long enough to see any dramatic difference, but long enough to know it isn&#x27;t going to break me out. Definitely a good alternative to the $162 product...</li>
    <li> This product just seems sticky and I saw no benefit.  Would like a refund but I think I&#x27;ve had the product for too long.</li>
    <li> When the product was received, it was cloudy, and should be clear. I followed the return policy and as of this date, about 6 weeks later have not received a replacement, refund, or further notice. I am very disappointed as the other reviews were quite favorable.</li>
    <li> Loved the texture of my skin after applying it. It looks smooth and kind of shiny- in a god way, but every time I used it, by evening I had a pimple. It was disappointing, since I liked the immediate results.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to try a VitC serum for a good price. Every skin is different and has specific needs so wanted to see if my skin needed VitC (along with Vit E and Ferulic acid) and what would be the outcome before I wrote a review. I saw instant and phenomenal results over the past 3 weeks of use. I could tell it was fresh because it tingles when I put it on my skin and I use it morning and evening on clean dry skin. I keep it in the fridge to keep it fresh. Its clear, odorless and colorless so I know its as it should be from reading other reviews.  I am turning 60 this year and working on my skin so as to welcome another year but attempting to look younger or improved!  Well, I think this has been helping a lot and have had positive comments on my skin from the work crew. Nice to have others notice the improvement! And a little goes a long way!  I wish I had done this 30 yrs ago! Dynamite serum for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum because I am unable to purchase the vitamin C serum that I love.  This one was okay but just seems more harsh on my skin compared to the vitamin C serum by Sal Sol.</li>
    <li> From the very first time I used this product (post peel), my skin looked and felt fantastic. I have used many products with one or two of the ingredients but never with Vit C, Vit E AND Ferulic Axcid...this product is all and more of what they said. I would definitely purchase this product again and again. There is nothing to dislike about it and I would recommend it highly to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Julie- Nice quality. Goes on smooth and potent ingredients. Works better after exfoliation. Will reorder when I run out and will use on clients!</li>
    <li> One bottle didn&#x27;t show me  any difference...I need to try again for a longer period.  Price is ok but I was hoping for more positive effects on my skin since it&#x27;s supposed to be like the Skinceutical product.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician so I know what Vitamin C is and should look like and smell like.  This is perfectly clear with no odor at all.  It is nothing like Skin Ceuticals.  I am using it to see if there is anything to be gained but I am not holding my breath.</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal product, I saw instant results and at a fraction of the price compared to similar products. I will definitely be buying this again</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum and have tried others.  It does work, makes a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin. It appears slightly more supple and healthy.  Plus, the price is right.  I use it daily in conjunction with an herbal toner and moisturizer.  I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and paying more attention to my skin.  This works for me.  I would recommend to friends or even gift to friends or family.</li>
    <li> My third repurchase of this serum. It really makes a difference in skin clarity. Works just as well as the C &amp; E serums costing $100.00 +.</li>
    <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this to replace laser pulse treatment at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, also using with Hyaluronic Acid Serum during the day (with generic vitamin e cream). So far so good!</li>
    <li> I would love to say that this is a miracle fluid that eliminates wrinkles, blemishes and makes me look years younger.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  However, it did improve my skin texture and did work on blemishes.  It is not harsh at all and my skin well tolerates application twice a day.</li>
    <li> I had seen this product reviewed on YouTube and decided to try it.  I keep this serum in the refrigerator to help keep from oxidizing too soon.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but I like how my skin feels.</li>
    <li> Has a strong odor but besides that this is a very effective serum on it&#x27;s own, although I prefer to use it with a microneedle roller for application efficiency. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I use this in the day and Peter Thomas Roth retinol at night. I only wish there was a product like this to replace PTR the way this replaces expensive vitamin C serum. Buy it, your skin will love you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Second purchase and it&#x27;s really is wonderful. I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both times I have bought it the product comes cloudy, this just means its very fresh and the vitamin C has not dissolved yet. If you put it in the fridge it will remain cloudy. The fridge keeps it fresh, and I was told this is fine by timeless, who did say it will last longer in the fridge. It never gets a chance to turn yellow. BTW it will clear if you leave it out of the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try their 100% hyaluronic acid. i can&#x27;t live without either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product; however, it leaves my skin very oily. Also I am having problems with the lid staying on. I&#x27;ll screw the lid on and not even an hour later it so lose. It has spilled it multiple times and it is so Sticky that it takes forever to get off. This product is just not for me, I&#x27;m going to stick with Vitamin C creams from now on.</li>
    <li> It works really well but the third one I ordered is colorless, so I looked at the ingrediants to see if there is anything different and I noticed the bottle does not have acid  and it did before. Will it still produce the same results?</li>
    <li> Wonderful for your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product but have one caveat - the serum starts out so well but by the time I am 2/3 through the bottle the product quickly begins to oxidize. If only there was a way to prevent this, the product would be perfect. Perhaps if this company could devise a dispenser that would prevent the serum from oxidizing, it would be worth the extra cost. The serum does a great job of moisturizing my skin and it had the surprise benefit of clearing up my complexion - far better than the acne products I was using (Pro Activ, Murad, etc.). Even my husband noticed the difference! I tried a less expensive  Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum that was also sold on Amazon and there was no comparison in the benefits. This serum was significantly better. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any dark spots go away, but this helps keep my skin moist.  Have to use a fraction of the amount of moisturizer after putting this on first.</li>
    <li> I got this serum because of a youtube tutorial by hotandflashy who recommended it for age spots. It&#x27;s easy to use.  I use between 5 - 7 drops and spread it over my face concentrating on the areas prone to age spots.  It dries quickly to a smooth finish.  I then use a moisturizer w/ SPF 30 and either a foundation or tinted moisturizer w/ SPF 30.  It has lightened my age spots considerably.  This is my first bottle.  I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I was trying to decide if I should by this off brand versus the OTHER brand that is much more.  After reading the reviews, I bought this one and so happy that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU HAVE TO USE THIS TO BELIEVE IT.  Use consistently each day and WOW will you see a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yeah!</li>
    <li> I ordered before speaking with my dermatologist. When I showed him and asked his opintion he said a waste of money; just finish it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been given two samples of  high priced serums at one of my facials. One I liked and the other I didn&#x27;t. However, each was very expensive, over $100, and I&#x27;m not about to pay that amount for skin care.  I began researching other products online and did some investigating on &#x27;Bare Faced Truth.com&#x27;. They had researched Timeless Skin Care and gave the Vitamin C + Ferulic Acid Serum a thumbs up. They compared it to the sample I was using, and Timeless was ahead hands down. And the price was a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;ve been using it and love the results. My pores have diminished significantly and my skin has a nice glow. All you need are 3 drops after cleansing and toning, smooth over your skin, let dry and then apply your moisturizer with sunscreen. I&#x27;ll be trying other Timeless products, as well.</li>
    <li> I used before another brand and when I used it I can feel the tickling sensation and some times itchy also I saw how the product color stars changing to yellow but on this one I haven&#x27;t feel anything so Im not sure if really works also is very clear like water no color change and vitamin c oxidize so that is why the color change  but I will keep using it to see if will work thanks...</li>
    <li> I rated the product a 4 because I really can&#x27;t tell if it is performing--but if it has Vitamins C and E then it has to be doing something good--right? I used it right after I needled my face about four days ago-and about three days afterwards.  I don&#x27;t know how often the product should be used, since it was a serum, I presumed daily?</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference in my skin as of yet..  I have been using the product once a day for over a month..</li>
    <li> It is ok, but after use it I will get acne more in my face....&lt;br /&gt;So I use it with water or to make it with other mask</li>
    <li> been using this product for years.  all my friends have switched from their favorites to this one because they see how great it makes my skin look and feel.  no. 1 on the market!</li>
    <li> Love this! I am on my second bottle and use it on my face, neck, chest &amp; backs of hands. I use it generously since it will oxidize in about 3 months. I split it into 2 bottles and keep it in the refrigerator to have it last longer. It has definitely improved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this in my skincare routine!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a change. I would recommend buying the OZ NATURALS VITAMIN C SERUM instead. I liked that product better. This is more tacky on the face compared to the OZ, it goes on clear and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz. from Timeless Skin care arrived earlier than estimated. The serum came packaged in a clear packaging stuffed with confetti in a tiny rectangular parcel/ box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is runny/ watery. To prevent oxidation, I place the 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum in the refrigerator. After each roll with Derma Roller 1.0 mm micro needle from Peau de L&#x27;ange, I massage and pat the chilled 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid on my face with clean hands to maximize its efficiency (there is a slight, but bearable sting). In combination with derma rolling and 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid serum, my face feels firmer and more plump and (my) dark spots are noticeably lighter.</li>
    <li> So I can tell this must exfoliate..or just simply dries my face out.  I&#x27;m not sure I notice any good differences at all.  In fact I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t.  But I will continue to use this bottle up just incase there are unseen benefits.</li>
    <li> I use this product before putting any creams on my face. It feels very silky going on and makes my skin feel smooth. I will have to see if I notice any changes in my skin after further use, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> It is the best product I have ever used to brighten my face. It is also much cheaper than the most other similar products.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order and it seems to work as well as some expensive items that people try to sell me at the salon.</li>
    <li> My skin feels a lot  better since I started using this product. I would recommend this product to anybody who is interested in trying it out.</li>
    <li> Astaxanthin Has Multiple Skin Benefits&lt;br /&gt;Astaxanthin helps to stimulate continuous production of collagen in the skin which is responsible in maintaining skin tone elasticity and firmness. Astaxanthin can inhibit melanogenesis or reduce melanin production (about 40 percent) diminishing age spots, freckles, and dark eye circles gradually.5,6 Its effect is superior to vitamin C. Topical astaxanthin may act as an effective skin whitening agent, which is a tremendously popular trend in Asia.&lt;br /&gt;There have been a number of studies about astaxanthin&#x27;s skin benefits using oral supplement, topical application or the combination. These studies have shown a substantial improvement (between 35 to 59 percent) in wrinkle reduction, skin smoothness, skin moisturization and elasticity over a period of two to 12 weeks.7,8,9 Astaxanthin is definitely a new potential and promising skin anti-aging nutrient.</li>
    <li> When fresh (less than ~3 months old and clear in color), this product is wonderfully beneficial.  Unfortunately, when I received my product, it was already amber in color (matching what remained of a several months-old bottle), indicating that it was no longer effective, so I had to return it.  Disappointing, but I have seen similar reviews here and elsewhere indicating that Timeless has been filling orders with what are effectively expired products.</li>
    <li> I have used vitamin C serums for 10 years. Skinceuticals and Cosmetic Skin Solutions were my go-tos until I discovered Paula&#x27;s Choice one year ago. After watching HotandFlashy on Youtube, who recommended Timeless over PC AND CSS, I ordered. I was surprised that it smelled caustic (unlike the lunchmeat/hotdog smell of the other vitamin C serums I was used to). Timeless stung like crazy using 6 drops, but I soldiered on. After two weeks, I noticed that my skin looked horrid!! I couldn&#x27;t figure it out. I was on an extended vacation so there was no stress, I was eating and sleeping well, but I looked years older. Finally, I took a look at the ingredient list. Benzyl Alcohol!!! Seriously??? This stuff is absolute garbage!!! I am 47 and have (had, right now it looks like hell!) great skin. I get compliments from strangers on a regular basis, but now? It will take weeks of TLC to get my skin in order again. Don&#x27;t pinch pennies. It&#x27;s not worth it! True VitC serum smells like hot dogs...seriously, it&#x27;s the best indicator of a good serum. I am ordering my Paula&#x27;s VitC booster tonight. After some research, I see that Benzyl Alcohol is basically antifreeze...no wonder Timeless Vitamin C serum smells like acetone!!!</li>
    <li> It made my pores black.</li>
    <li> This product is hydrating, I use it on my face, neck, and hands.  It also seems to be firming.</li>
    <li> The serum makes my skin breakout.  I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle and see a difference in my complection.  Even the back of my hands where I wipe the excess is noticable clearer and brighter.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 strars because the seller raised the price and I can get it for half through the Timeless website!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in between a 3 and 4 stars. Overall this is a good moisturizer for its price, but for the 2 months I&#x27;ve been using the product, it does no more than hydration for me. I notice my skin is slightly smoother and more hydrated compared to using other moisturizers, but it does not noticeably firm my skin (in 30s) or fade dark spots. I&#x27;m now mixing it with my retinol cream when apply and will keep it in daily routine, but will not strongly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This serum is as good as any of the high dollar vitamin C serums - I&#x27;ve tried them.  The only difference is this one is affordable.  Vitamin C serums oxidize quickly and paying a large amount for a serum means losing part of it in a short time.  This serum works perfectly well and you get it at a great price.</li>
    <li> wonderful product will use every three months thanks</li>
    <li> Only been using it for three days, but love it so far. Stings a bit...but gives skin a lovely glow. Will post later observations as time goes on. (Recommended by a YouTube &amp;#34;middle-aged skin care guru.&amp;#34;  So far, all of her recommendations have been spot-on and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Not so sure about this one. I think I am using it wrong.Does anyone have any good tips on how to use this product.Vit C seems to break me out, this one doesnT but my face looks tight and shiny after I use it. Not an attractive look:) i do put on sunscreen as my final product.</li>
    <li> I have used this ferulic serum for over a month now and have not seen any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love it , I like how I have Glowing skin now.It&#x27;s amazing serum.I&#x27;ll purchase again :). Best vit c serum.</li>
    <li> I have bought 4 bottles of Timeless C+E within last 2 years, but won&#x27;t buy again. I used to love this vendor&#x27;s product but my last 2 bottles have been duds. On my 3rd purchase the top wouldn&#x27;t stay screwed on tight. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it until liquid started turning dark yellow/brown within a month. I thought I just got a bad bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last purcase (bottle #4) was cloudy, but turned clear within 3 days (like all the comments said)...but the bottle top (with dropper) won&#x27;t stay screwed on again. Every morning I find top 1/2 way unscrewed...so every night before bed I have to screw top on real tight. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m babysitting a product like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C goes bad quickly &amp; becomes ineffective when exposed to air...like when the top won&#x27;t stay tightly screwed on. I don&#x27;t want to waste time/energy returning product, so I will use the rest of this bottle until it turns really brown or starts to burn my face. Then I&#x27;ll have to find another product/vendor for my C+E Ferulic purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum, I mean LOVE it.  This is the second bottle I purchased; only because I broke the first one.  I would have given 5 STARS but for some reason the second bottle does not close tightly, it is loose which lets air in and I am afraid it won&#x27;t last as long.  Once it turns to an off color and no longer clear I was told I have to get a new one from a friend.  I can already see the color starting to change, so looks like I am going to have to fork up another $25 for a new one.  But the serum itself works wonderfully.  I really do notice a difference and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  Like I stated at the beginning this serum is AWESOME.</li>
    <li> Loved these products!</li>
    <li> Received product promptly, and when I had a question regarding it also received a prompt and courteous reply.  I like the way it feels on my skin.  I still have to give it a little more time to see if it makes a difference in the way my skin looks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this Product. Paired up with Phytoceramides I use from Sports Research. Using both products I&#x27;ve found my skin much more hydrated and still wrinkle free. I will continue to use these products without fail.</li>
    <li> After a month of use on only one side of my face, I could not detect any difference. On a positive note, this did not cause any breakouts either. I&#x27;m glad for those that this works for, but my search continues.</li>
    <li> I run and do workouts almost every day.... knowing this stuff helps destroy free radicals is comforting!</li>
    <li> I have been using this formula for 3 months and can definitely tell a difference in the tone, texture and discolorations of my skin. You need to develop patience when using this.  After applying a dropper full, let it absorb for 5-10 minutes, then add your sunscreen, and let that absorb for a few minutes before applying your foundation.  Make sure you apply only thin layers of serum and sunscreen to avoid becoming too oily during the day.  More does not equal better/faster results!  It was difficult at first for me to retrain myself to slow down and rearrange my morning routine to accommodate  this serum but the results have been well worth it.</li>
    <li> Exactly put: It burns and doesn&#x27;t work. It felt sticky and actually made my acne worse. I bought this because of a youtuber I was watching at the time who bought a whole line of products from amazon. I don&#x27;t swear by amazon to keep my skin clear now. Now what saved my skin was good old Biotin, and Gunilla of Sweden products.</li>
    <li> I love this serum and it has become a regular part of my daily routine. It helps lighten dark spots on my skin from acne, which normally take months to fade. With this serum they fade in weeks, I&#x27;m also not breaking out as much. My skin is smoother and feels so soft! I would highly reccomend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I initally bought the vit c but the consistancy was hard to work with....like water.  I did use it though.  When I saw that this had the same and added vit E I thought I would try it.  Like I said before using skincuticils at 120$ which smelled bad this was a miracle.  The consistancy is a little thicker because of the added E.  It is easy to use, has no smell, and has done wonders for my face.  This has and will become a staple in my skin care regime.  It has 20% vit C so you may have to adjust how often you use it.  I typically use it 5 days a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an RN and Esthetician for 25 years. I have tried many skin care products some very effective, some not. I did not like the liqued texture of this product nor did it smell nice.  But that wasn&#x27;t really that important I found that it just wasn&#x27;t very effective for me. It didn&#x27;t seem like there was much vitamin C in the product.</li>
    <li> The product itself is unexceptional, but I strongly encourage anyone considering Timeless products -- which all sound good, and the price is right -- to check into the \\&quot;company\\&quot; first. They have no physical address; their phone is answered by an answering service. As far as I can tell, they are snake oil salespeople trying to stay one step ahead of the law. I found out the hard way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, didn&#x27;t really see any difference to be honest</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I use it morning and night. It is a part of my skin care products.  I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive/adult acne prone skin and some acne scares which is the reason I bought this product because I heard that it&#x27;s amazing for the healing of the skin if used with the Microneedle roller. It did nothing for me expect made me horribly break out :( I think the Vitamin E in it made me break out. I regret buying this product because for months I had clear skin until I used this product. You live and you learn..</li>
    <li> its alright for the skin. but I didn&#x27;t feel any improvement until a few days from using it. it arrived on time though</li>
    <li> Great buy after buying more expensive version of same thing.  Wish product came with ingredient sheet.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered more - I think it is good for my skin and makes it more glowy.  Need less moisturizer with this product - seems to make my makeup apply smoother.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any permanent change in my skin.  However, my skin does look better after I apply this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. It can&#x27;t hurt. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet but will keep everyone up- dated. I use it after I exfoliate and it is not oily at all.</li>
    <li> Great product, my 2nd bottle, I keep it in the fridge to splash it on cold since I live in Florida</li>
    <li> Love it! It is a great anti-aging product and makes my skin brighter and younger. I&#x27;d try it first if I had sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product and what it&#x27;s done for my face! In the summer I keep it in the fridge and when I run out my face becomes very sad.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this serum; it is light and absorbs quickly into the skin. Having only used it one week thus far, no one has yet stopped me on the street to rave about my complexion, but I am expecting that :) I like the way it feels and personally, my skin appears more radiant to me...Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and an excellent price!</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum worked fine for the original price that I paid for it $24.95.  Now it&#x27;s almost twice the amount, sorry but I&#x27;d rather make my own or purchase another product before I buy this again. Its not worth it....</li>
    <li> An excellent Vitamin C serum at a fantastic price.I use it at night under Retin A and during the day under sunscreen, and my skin is definitely brighter and less prone to breakouts. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum beneath my sunscreen every day for 2 months. This hydrates nicely, and I have noticed that my skin is smooth, clear, and much less blotchy than it was before I starting using C+ E Ferulic Acid Serum.  There is also a visible difference in discoloration and texture. Thank you Timeless, for making this fantastic product affordable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and have been impressed so far with what it has done for my deep forehead wrinkles.  They have not vanished, but they definitely are not as prominent as before.  My face does seem brighter and my hyperpigmentation has lightened, but this could be because of not being out in the sun that much. Either way, I like the reults so far and will continue to buy simply because of what it does with my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I will never let myself run  out again!!!</li>
    <li> It appears to work somewhat just a little to slow to see the results.. just a little to early to know for sure.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month now...sometimes twice a day. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin yet. I don&#x27;t like the fact that the solution only lasts for 3 months.</li>
    <li> The top would not stay closed tightly on this bottle.  The price is great compared to the bottle of CELLUX C I bought, HOWEVER, this stuff brings red spots / sup spots to the surface, as opposed to giving my skin a more even color.  Also, is a tad oily, which I did not see in the Cellux C product.  I have my reservations about the effectiveness of this product.  Just because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; in compairson with other Ferulic Acid products, does not make it a good buy if it does nothing.</li>
    <li> good product, starting to see some changes in the skin. i have manny spots in the skin and its start to working out.</li>
    <li> I have seen some hyperpigmentation on my face lighten up ... sun damage.  It gives my face a bright, healthy glow and a squeaky clean feel while I am washing my face due to the use of Timeless Serum.  I love this product and know it is made fresh when you order it.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like this product, and I believe it has improved my skin.</li>
    <li> product seemed to work when fresh, but turns orange fairly quickly (within 1-2 months) even in a cool medicine cabinet. And, the product is no longer near as effective when the color changes due to oxidized Vitamin C. I was okay with wasting about 1/4 of the bottle when the price was around $25, but noticed the price has doubled since last purchased. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 3 weeks so havent noticed any difference yet, I would expect it to take at least 3 months to notice any difference. It has a slightly unusual smell but you dont smell it once its on your face. Watery consistency which is a bit of a pain to apply eg if you place the drops on your fingers it runs between them, if you put it on a cotton wipe you use a lot more product cos it gets soaked up. The other reviews for this serum were good so I&#x27;ll complete a bottle before I give a final verdict.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like. Don&#x27;t close well. Smells bad</li>
    <li> Very good serum, my face look a lot better.</li>
    <li> This product works. It feels good on skin. No complaints.  Used times and I think my skin loves it too.</li>
    <li> Love this vitamin C serum which is a higher percentage of Vitamin C than similar serums and you get more (1 oz, vs .5oz in most serums,) making it a good value for this type product. The packaging lends itself to more rapid oxidation. I use it freely, love the way it goes on. A bottle lasts me 2 months. I use it daily on my face and backs of my hands.</li>
    <li> Works great and price is reasonable. I keep it refrigerated to make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is glowing and it makes a difference if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Great for scars and lines, this serum is a great deal. Just ordered my second bottle, wish it would hurry and get here!</li>
    <li> It was cloudy when i received it. It clogged my pores, and broke my skin out! I won&#x27;t be buying this product anymore.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! If I had unlimited cash I would buy enough to fill my bathtub and soak in it daily, because if it&#x27;s this beneficial to my face, I can only imagine how great it would be for the rest of me. My skin has never looked better. I can&#x27;t say 100% if it&#x27;s just the serum--I&#x27;ve been practicing a better skin-care regimen lately, which includes a Vitamin C moisturizer, bi-weekly exfoliation and I&#x27;ve stopped eating sugar, so it could be a result of all of these things combined. But regardless, the Timeless serum seems to be an essential element of my skin&#x27;s improvement. I like that it comes in dropper form as it&#x27;s easy to disperse just a bit to my fingertip (a little goes a long way). I&#x27;ve been applying to my throat and hands as well. I&#x27;d drink it if I could! FYI--I am a 50+ woman who has spent some time in the sun, had lingering acne through my 40s&#x3D;enlarged pores. Since adding the Timeless serum to my skin-care regimen, my skin is glowing and my pores are noticeably diminished. I look young for my age any way (the one plus of oily skin is fewer wrinkles), but I really can&#x27;t remember when my skin looked this good. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Timeless, YOU need to explain to your LOYAL CUSTOMERS why you jacked the price to more than DOUBLE!!!  If I have to pay a higher price, it will NOT be to you!  Really!  I&#x27;m pretty disgusted.</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing results! Within 2 days my skin was looking brighter. Within a week it was clearing the congestion under the surface. Only not giving it 5 stars because the top will not stay tightly closed and I think this will shorten the potency of this product. Super price too.</li>
    <li> Not sure this vitamin C thing actually does much</li>
    <li> Made my skin burn, eyes water and my skin become very dry.  I have stopped using&lt;br /&gt; this product. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and will reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C product is very good. It really works at firming your skin. It doesn&#x27;t take long before you see an improvement in the tone of your complexion. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Reviews were great too soon to rate how effective...no directions for application?</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent shipping.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth, works great, good buy.</li>
    <li> Did not do a thing. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had off and on problem facial skin since my teens, and I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s now.  Is it acne, allergies, rash, menopause, who knows?  After struggling the last six months with skin that just wouldn&#x27;t clear up, I used this the first time by itself, almost a full dropper.  It was too much.  It did have a tightening effect immediately, but it was similar to getting a minor facial peel where the skin looks like plastic wrap is stretched across your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, and every day since, I just combined a few drops of this with my regular facial moisturizer.  Bam! That did the trick!  My skin has finally cleared up, is looking smooth and feeling healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw I also bought a new Clarisonic at the same time.  The two together produce powerful results, much younger and fresher looking skin.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic when I saw this serum for sale, but thought I&#x27;d give it a chance.  I have been using one that costs over four times as much for over five years. This formula is what my dermatologist recommended as the one that will retard aging better than anything else on the market.  Hard to know what I&#x27;d look like if I didn&#x27;t use it, but I truly believe that this formula has prevented wrinkles and has kept my skin looking pretty good for my age (64).  When it first arrived I thought I had made a mistake ordering it because it did not have the distinctive odor I associate with this product....a kind of lunch meaty smell, salami maybe.  Yeah, sounds unpleasant, but not that bad, it goes away,  and is a tradeoff I am willing to make.  What the lack of that smell meant was that the product was extremely fresh, as the smell crept up with time and exposure to light.  Every other similar product I have ordered was not that fresh.  The smell told me that this product is exactly what they said it was.  It works every bit as well as the more expensive version and I feel I can use more over a larger area, specifically on my hands and upper chest.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this formula, give this brand a shot.  As far as facial serums go, this is extremely reasonable and a little goes a long way.  If you have been using the high priced version, try this one and save some money.  I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I think like everyone else, I wanted to find my original purchase of this item from Skinceuticals at a lower price so I tried this out and as much as I wanted to make it work like its more expensive version, it has not.  It feels harsher somehow and my skin does not glow or seem as healthy as when I used Skinceutical&#x27;s version of it (in fact it made my skin kind of dry and scaly.)  I guess in this case you get what you pay for...  It&#x27;s worth saying however, that the item looks well made and I think what this company is trying to achieve is positive with regard to giving people the option to buy a Vit. C &amp; Ferulic combo at a decent price.  I wish so badly it would have worked out.  I notice others seem to think it is similar by comparison and it may be that my skin is just particularly sensitive to the formulation.</li>
    <li> (update Sept 2015: continue to use this and have tried competitor products, it works and I am quite old! but skin looking good!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reputable dermatologists say there are only a few active ingredients out there that are proven to do anything beneficial for the skin besides moisturize it (which Crisco or vaseline could do too!) , no matter what hype the cosmetic companies put out. One of those is vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Caution: don&#x27;t use a Vit C product at the same time as Retinols (Retin A or OTC Retinol products like Roc etc), or Glycolic acids, or beta acids (salicylic etc). Use the Vit C in the a.m. and the others in the PM, sometimes even that will be too irritating for some skins. At the least put a few hours between applications of acidic products!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product first on a skin care forum I belong to, as I am a sort of hobby aesthetician and makeup artist and always looking for something to help my own aging skin. I use a derma roller (many brands and most are about the same, needle size is the key difference), and this product used in concert with it really has helped stimulate collagen (the disappearance which is what causes skin to look &#x27;aged&#x27; , when the padding beneath the surface begins to degrade and so the skin hangs like an empty balloon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it off and on for several months, and also got some for sisters and friends. In everyone&#x27;s case I have seen an improvement in skin tone, and definitely a subtle &#x27;plumping&#x27; effect. It&#x27;s not a miraculous overnight remedy, (nothing like that exists in a bottle!), but it does help over time, and you&#x27;ll see some difference within a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also important is that the manufacturer is using a DARK glass bottle. First because Vitamin C breaks down with exposure to light, and also because if it were plastic container, the acidity would cause some leaching of plastic byproducts into the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The viscous feeling of this product is due to the hyaluronic acid in it. Hyaluronic acid is the same substance (but in sterile form and at a different molecular density), that is in fillers like restylane, and that also occurs naturally in the human body. It can&#x27;t really penetrate below the dermis, but with the derma rolling process, I believe a little of it can make its way in, and that it aids in plumping effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great value and reputable supplier. The reality is these active ingredients wholesale at a minimal cost, and the big brand names are marking them up by ridiculous amounts and creating elaborate marketing campaigns and photoshopped images of 22 year old models, and many consumers fall for the hype and believe the cost is justified; and while this product isn&#x27;t &#x27;cheap&#x27;, it is moderately priced compared to department store brands, and it lasts a good while as you only need a few drops each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have recommended for those starting a skin improvement regimen to take a few good before and after pictures (spaced a few months apart at least, then periodically) or have a friend do so. Then you can apply &#x27;high def&#x27; photographic effects to the before and afters shots, which will reveal the damaged skin that the naked eye can&#x27;t detect, and subsequent improvement (or lack thereof!), in great (often disturbing! detail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(There are free programs online that can do this(ipiccy is one), or if you use photoshop etc, that allow you to increase detail in your skin - usually called something like &#x27;high def&#x27;, &#x27;gritty&#x27; etc). Department store makeup counters used to have these boxes with special lights and mirror that you&#x27;d put your face in and would reveal the sun damage that is not apparent to the naked eye - using as a selling tool-- this HDR effect does the same basic thing - reveal what the naked eye can&#x27;t see but which IS there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proof was there for me that my skin was looking better, less damaged. In my case the derma roller was part of it, but this product wasalso key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Trying to improve my reviews by being more specific...so do click the &#x27;&#x27;helpful&#x27;&#x27; button if you indeed feel it was)also key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Trying to improve my reviews by being more specific...so do click the &#x27;&#x27;helpful&#x27;&#x27; button if you indeed feel it was)</li>
    <li> This product cost less than $25, yet delivers the same anti-aging punch as a leading competitor&#x27;s product, priced at more like $100. As another review put it, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the mornings under my sunblock and AHA creams. Research shows that Vitamin C can boost the anti-aging property of sunblocks, and that ferrulic acid helps boost the activity of Vitamin C. Vitamin E is an excellent anti-oxidant; it will combat free radicals generated in the course of the day. I read on the futurederm blog that Timeline&#x27;s formulation absorbs quickly and more deeply than other C + E + ferrulic acid products. That&#x27;s good for my multi-step regimen-- it saves me time in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d use it at night too, but I use tretinoin and have not seen information on whether the 2 products are compatible. If I find out that they are, I&#x27;ll use this at night too.</li>
    <li> I have read the benefits of using topical vitamin C, but never gave it a real try. Well, about 2 years ago I ordered vitamin C from another brand by amazon (don&#x27;t remember the name of the brand, it was a brown bottle) but I used it about 2-3 weeks, it was very watery (impossible to hold it in your fingers to put it on your face) and turned yellow-brown in less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this one about a month ago, I saw the difference on my skin since the first time I used it, (don&#x27;t expect miracles) but the skin looks brighter and you get some glow. You can also notice it on your fingers just by using them to put the product on your face. I got motivated and pair it with Retin A, 2 weeks after my skin looks amazing (really!) I believe I will stick to this regimen for the rest of my life.  Topical vitamin C, topical vitamin A and sunscreen. I&#x27;m 34 years old and my major concern is slow aging process.</li>
    <li> I love it ! Great results</li>
    <li> This product is still available on the Timeless website for $24.95. I don&#x27;t know how this distributor gets away with selling it for twice the price ( and postage)!</li>
    <li> i love product. i will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product my face looks younger</li>
    <li> i have only used this product for two weeks, but, it seems to be working. time will tell if i keep using or not.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any difference. I will keep applying it and see if there are any improvements.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Sept 28th and didn&#x27;t receive it till Nov 16th! I had actually forgotten about it.  The product itself is as described. I have only used it a few times so far. Since I have very sensitive skin, I am always careful about what I put on it, but I did not have any adverse reactions to this at all. I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to see any benefits yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product after reading other reviews. The shipping time was a little longer than I thought. Have used this about 3 weeks and I notice better tone of the skin. Definitely need a good moisturizer after as it feel dry/tight and I have dry skin. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have bought this on Amazon previously.</li>
    <li> Will strongly recommend!!! Every time I use this serum my skin is immediately glowing and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s AMAZING pre-applying makeup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*would strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have tried to use this three different times and everytime I use it more than one day in a row I break out I will go back to using SkinCeuticals</li>
    <li> so far so good. used for a week and saw some improvement.</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month now - - don&#x27;t really see a difference in my brown spots, but my skin looks &amp; feels great!  It does have a bit of an odd smell, but I can put up with it for compliements on my skin!</li>
    <li> HOLY CRAP!!! Whats in this stuff? After one use i can hardley believe what this has done to my face. Brighter, softer and my forehead wrinkles actually disappeared after 2nd use. Iam 50 yrs old and have been trying all sorts of products...NOTHING compares to this serum. It must be exactly what my face needed as i cant believe what Iam seeing in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I did a 70 % lactic peel 2 weeks ago that has helped somewhat and have been using olay regenerist for the past 6 months (love that stuff). I know this is strong as i accidently put some on my eyelids and it burned pretty good. Did not sting anywhere else as I use glycolic wash (infinite skn- love all their products) and peels so my skin is ok with this strength of product. Today is only day 2 and  iam so happy with it thought I would write this review.  Will not ever be without...This stuff ROCKS!!! Cant wait to see what happens with continued use.</li>
    <li> I use this about once a week, I am not sure if it works or not.  It is kind of sticky a bit but it easy to use and worth a try. I will probably just go back to drugstore products after this is empty so I guess that means I am not blown away by the results.  I still have quite a bit of the bottle left so I will update if I suddenly start glowing with healthy skin. That is all I want--to glow with healthy skin.</li>
    <li> well i kept reading about the fabulous effects of topical vit C+E Fe acid. i wouldn&#x27;t have spent the $100s of the popular name brand so i found this less expensive yet similar product and tried it. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since I&#x27;ve never tried the expensive ones before. And honestly couldn&#x27;t understand why this one could be so much cheaper and still be effectively comparable to the others. So i was doubtful.   My experience was surprisingly positive. It came in a nice sized dark blue glass bottle. The liquid was clear, and orderless and seemed fresh to me. One major problem i had though, it didn&#x27;t have any instructions or even suggestions on it&#x27;s purpose. Now i understand the the items specifics on this website has brief directions and a description, but i was forced to come back to this web page once it received the bottle to remind me what to do with it. I&#x27;m suffering from melasma on my upper lip and it looks like a mustache!! It&#x27;s the worst problem I&#x27;ve ever had with my skin and it&#x27;s been bothering me for about 2 years. I&#x27;ve used retin A and hydroquinone (prescription), it only helps if used constantly and faithfully. But i live in Florida and mixing sun and those two are a huge problem. So i looked for something that would help hasten the results and hopefully help protect my face from more damage. Apparently this product does well to protect you from the sun&#x27;s UVA and UVB and helps other products to work better by letting them sink in more effectively. From what i could gather from sources online, this is what i did: (1st) i washed my face. (2nd) wiped it down with witch hazel &amp; let it dry. (3rd) then pulled a few drops of this 20% Vit C+E Ferulic serum and poured it on my face (it&#x27;s runny, kinda like slippery water) and gently rubbed it in and let it dry. Then i either used the other products at night or applied sunscreen and makeup for day. It seemed to make my face nice and moisturized and firm. It&#x27;s not oily or sticky and really nice under make up. Icouldn&#x27;t tell if it helped the other stuff to penetrate better but i thought it helped with the tone and texture while using the other products. The others can be irritating, causing redness and peeling. But this product definitely halted any of those symptoms. With all that said, i think it&#x27;s a pretty useful product and I&#x27;ll be buying it again and others this company offers.   PS. I waited to write this review until i was finished with the entire bottle. It shipped fast and It lasted over 2 months with pretty much daily use.</li>
    <li> If you compare this to another high-end cosmeceutical product on the market, you will see what a value it is. This Timeless Skin Care brand has the same ingredients as the expensive brand for much less money. I think this is a very good product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. I think it is the topical vitamin C, because I had the same problem with another vitamin C skin care serum before. It&#x27;s an overly sweet citrus smell. My solution is to only use this at night. That way, I don&#x27;t feel like I smell like a rotten orange during the day. The serum is very light and non-greasy. A little goes a very long way. So even a 1 oz. bottle lasts quite a long time. If you research it, this combination of C and E really does protect your skin. Great price. Great product overall.</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz had a few plastic surgeons on his show that explained what to use on your face to help you look more youthful. So, I went on to search for a vitamin c product that contained L-Ascorbic Acid 3-10% (this has 20%) &amp; one in an opaque container. This product has both, and they stated that adding vitamin e will work even better which it has as well. The other products I looked at were around $100. I refuse to spend that kind of money on a something you put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum does work overnight as another reviewer stated. My skin looks great just after a few days. At night, after using the Clarisonic which I love too, I put Retin- A on for acne, then place a lot of this serum on. It doesn&#x27;t burn. I store it in a black box in the fridge like other reviewers have mentioned. I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, but I was unable to use this. It had a burning sensation on my skin.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle....fantastic, my skin is softer, smoother.  Also taking the Phytoceramides...what a difference a month makes when using this product. It is also packaged so nicely and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> My skin looks clearer and seems to have kicked up a couple of notches on its &amp;#34;healthy glow&amp;#34; meter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally believe that many of the improvements seen with beauty creams/serums are simply the results of simple skin hydration and/or our own hopes and prayers, but I think this serum actually does something, mostly because other people have commented on my skin and because I seem to feel confident going out without foundation a lot more of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo-ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read from other reviews that vitamin-C can lose its effectiveness over time so I use generous amounts (about a full dropper&#x27;s worth) and keep mine in the fridge.</li>
    <li> I do not write many reviews but feel compelled to share how superior this serum is.  I am now in my mid 40&#x27;s &amp; I find that my skin has more and more issues: sun damage, large pores, unevenness, and fine lines. I have tried many high end and expensive products from my dermatologist as well as the dept. store make up counter.  This serum is better than anything I have ever used.  It performs just as well as the CE Ferulic I purchased from my derm but for a fraction of the cost!  Recently I ran out and for the first week my skin still looked pretty good, but after that my pores became more noticeable and I lost the radiance.  I immediately re-ordered and within just a few days my skin began to look amazing again.  I get tons of compliments on my skin since using this product.  Love.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t seen any results but that doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t in the future, just that I am not seeing any immediate or noticably discernable results.  Note though, one time my application must of been too much as when I awoke in the morning my hands and face had look like I had applied one of those self-tanning creams and it took a couple of days for it to disappear.  So use sparingly!</li>
    <li> Perfect for a combination or oily skin. Nourishes, softens and gives your skin a glowing effect with a pinkish hue :)</li>
    <li> Feels heavy on face and smell alittle.  Doesn&#x27;t give me the glow that other Vit c serum I used before this</li>
    <li> If you use retin-a, this stuff will make your skin thicken up, and be much stronger. It makes your face look radiant, and is SOOOO much cheaper than the name brand version, while containing the same ingredients. Great product, will continue to buy forever. You can&#x27;t beat the semi-glowing-tanned look without hurting your skin from tanning. Everything looks healthier  when I use this every morning under my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I usually buy more expensive Vitamin C serum. I thought what the heck I&#x27;ll give this a go, I haven&#x27;t been able to afford my regular brand, I&#x27;m loving this, very soothing and I use it with a dermaroller bought on Amazon, with great results. Forget spending your hard earned dollars on other Vitamin C serums, try this! I&#x27;ve faded my acne scars and age spots, and it makes my skin feel great!&lt;br /&gt;Dermal Roller here that I use (bought on Amazon) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZCQD30/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s01_i00</li>
    <li> I just finished my second bottle and have ordered my third. This product really seems to be working well for me. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face, neck, plus on my hands and forearms. My forearms are where I have the most sun damage. Daily use of this product has diminished the blotchiness and mottled appearance. The skin on my hands looks a lot better. On my face where there is less discoloration I am still seeing brightening and evening-out of skin tone plus diminishing of fine lines near my eyes. My skin also seems firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a couple of months so am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I am a light-skinned Caucasian in her 50&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Worked great, but price is higher than I prefer to pay.</li>
    <li> I have the most irritable, difficult, and hard to maintain healthy skin.  So, I was very skeptical about this product but after reading the endless 5 star, raving reviews I figured I would give it a try.  I am 31 yrs. old with combination oily &amp; dry skin which is extremely sensitive AND acne prone!  I needed a product to even my skin tone, reduce fine lines, and regain collagen as well as simply maintaining healthy skin.  I have used this product twice a day after using Simple facial wash, morning and night. I use about five drops on each half of my face and my neck and a drop rubbed in under my eyes.  I just finished my first bottle, which I was waiting to do until I left a review.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even tell you how awesome this product is!  You MUST keep it in the refrigerator in a dark place (like in a black box) because it is not shelf stable and will spoil if not.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will be purchasing this product from this company for a long long time!</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived on time but I could not remove the plastic seal. The bottle cap or top is damaged so my bottle does not close properly.&lt;br /&gt;The serum stung my skin so I looked at the ingredients again and googled the first few ones and this is what I found out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene glycol is a synthetic liquid substance that absorbs water. Propylene glycol is also used to make polyester compounds, and as a base for deicing solutions. Propylene glycol is used by the chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries as an antifreeze when leakage might lead to contact with food. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified propylene glycol as an additive that is \\&quot;generally recognized as safe\\&quot; for use in food. It is used to absorb extra water and maintain moisture in certain medicines, cosmetics, or food products. It is a solvent for food colors and flavors, and in the paint and plastics industries. Propylene glycol is also used to create artificial smoke or fog used in fire-fighting training and in theatrical productions. (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry)&lt;br /&gt;So, since it comes at the beginning of the list of ingredients after Water and vitamin C, this product is basically diluted antifreeze with a few lemon juice drops in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(just to add to the fun : a gallon of Propylene Glycol costs $20 at the hardware store. There are 128 ounces in gallon)</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Really evens out skin tone..lightens skin</li>
    <li> best product at the best price.  this is made fresh when you order it!  can&#x27;t ask for better than that!  i highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful exfoliating oil. My face truly feels amazing the next morning after I use this. Since it does have Vitamin E in it and I have oily skin, I only use it twice a week and use retinol the rest of the week. It&#x27;s the perfect balance and clears up any blemishes overnight. This company is also amazing. They go beyond good customer service. This company offers THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have EVER encountered. There was an issue with my first bottle where the seal or something had an issue and it all leaked out and I wrote to them. They apologized and offered me a refund or a replacement. I mean they almost instantly answered my e-mail. I chose a replacement and they sent me a gift, as well for my issue and perhaps because I didn&#x27;t make a big deal out of it? LOL Things happen. So, I am with this company all the way. They showed me that customer service is NOT dead and that it is not impersonal. All you have to do is stop assuming no one will answer you. Timeless Skin Care is there if you need them.</li>
    <li> It is non greasy. A little goes a long way. Very nice packaging and I can tell it is fresh. For the price and results it is awesome! No need to spend so much on other named brands! It soaks right in. I use it before my moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product.  So much less expensive and does not smell as bad as Skinceuticals  Makes my skin soft without breaking me out.  I wish I could get away with using less though.  I don&#x27;t think this bottle will last more than three months at the most.</li>
    <li> I have notice my pores getting smaller and it think it is because of this product.Makes the skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a less expensive product and saw reviews that recommended this one.  Not sure yet, but it seems fairly comparable.. perhaps more drying...</li>
    <li> Great product to help ease the pain and agitating feeling after using your derma roller! Applies on clean and dry!</li>
    <li> I bought this and first let me tell you...it took TWO WEEKS to receive from the day I purchased on Amazon til the day I received it. VERY SLOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it 2 x&#x27;s a day (morning and night) for about 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t experienced ANY change. I know it takes 6-8 weeks to notice a difference in skin, but others have talked about the immeditate \\&quot;plumping action.\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t seen that either. I will continue to use and then post an update when the bottle is gone so others know what to expect. I also bought the Timeless Hydro (whatever it&#x27;s called!) acid with it. I add a few drops of that to this serum and a few drops to my retinol cream, for added benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my biggest complaint is that it feels, looks, and smells just like plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m 34, combo skin with fine lines popping up and deeper creases in my forehead and \\&quot;11s\\&quot; in between my eyebrows. (I use my all my facial expressions when I talk.) I also have melasma (pregnancy mask) on my cheek bones and forehead.</li>
    <li> This Timeless Skin Care serum helps with oily skin and acne. It has the vitamin C &amp; E ferulic acid which exactly what experts recommend at a responsible cost. My tip is to keep it in the refrigerator -the serum keeps it&#x27;s clear appearance and the cold serum helps calm the skin as well. Put on after cleanser and toner in morning...before lotion and make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum comes in a glass bottle but the packaging is done very well, no worries about it breaking. Usually able to purchase with free shipping. Downsides: due to lifespan (avg. 1 month) &amp; sensitivity of product, can only order one at a time &amp; shipping takes longer than I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> The texture is great!  However, it smells like hot band aids.  Then, once you get over that initial shock, the smells stays on your skin for hours.  I don&#x27;t understand why this company added fragrance at all, let alone one that smells so rancid.</li>
    <li> The customer service was good but I am not getting any of the results others have gotten.  I was really hoping to get rid of my wrinkles...not overnight, but over time.  I having been using the product for 4 weeks morning and night and have not seen any change.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle in a dropper! It came quickly and with refrigeration never spoiled. My skin glowed and tightened within 2-3 uses and and just continued to shine brighter with every use. I stopped using it and noticed the difference so I just ordered my second bottle to get my tight glowing skin back! This is a must have!</li>
    <li> I bought this product  and have been using it for about a month after the first few days of use I had a mild rash under my chin and my sterling silver necklace turned to burnt black color. I stopped use for a week then resumed using the serum. I now have a horrible rash all over my face I was also using it under my eyes, the rash is itchy on my eye lids and under my eyes. My upper cheeks under my eye are puffy. Don&#x27;t know what to do. Does anyone know the side effects of this product and has anyone had a similar reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Before the reaction the serum seemed to be working skin was brighter.</li>
    <li> You know it&#x27;s good when you can feel the high consentration of vitamin C burn. This is a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I researched all of the ingredients and they are all benificial. Not tons of fillers. I looked at a lot of other products, I will re-order and continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Worked okay for the price.</li>
    <li> Using with hyaluronic acid serum  have good results.</li>
    <li> feel like I&#x27;m doing something really good for my skin...have heard it&#x27;s best to keep&lt;br /&gt;refrigerated to keep from going bad or changing color....</li>
    <li> I have used better products, did nothing for the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> wonderful product you see results very affordable</li>
    <li> C E Ferulic acid serum was recommended to me by an aesthetician at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, but I balked at the $160 price tag. After reading extensively on the subject and researching other brands, I decided to go with Timeless Skin Care, mostly based on a nother aesthetician&#x27;s blog in which she compared the serums of Skin Ceuticals, Timeless Skin Care and another brand. I am very happy with the quality and effects of using this serum. My skin looks better and my makeup goes on better as well. As a 43 year old woman who wants to do what she can to protect her skin and prevent signs of aging, I can say that this product is a good investment.</li>
    <li> I really liked this serum. I mostly used it to help out my dry skin, which I think it did. I did have to wait awhile to receive the shipment</li>
    <li> This product in conjunction with the M.T. Roller truly improved the look &amp; feel of my skin. I am hooked on these products now.</li>
    <li> I use this after derma rolling. First I use the Vitamin C with E Ferulic Acid Serum followed by the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. So far, my skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading the glowing reviews.  Unfortunately I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and I can&#x27;t get over the smell.  There is no smell as it goes on the skin, but after sitting on my skin for 15-20 min something changes and it literally stinks.  I put it on at night so I just go to sleep and don&#x27;t smell it too long, but unfortunately even after washing my face in the morning I still smell it.  Its nauseating, I&#x27;m very disappointed.  Not sure if anyone else had this issue, maybe its a chemical reaction with the ph in my skin??.  .</li>
    <li> Absolutely love everything about this product! Definitely buying again.  Great value and my skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Such a wonder.  It does not irritate my skin but it does gently improve my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
    <li> Love this serum!  Your skin will glow!  My only negative is that I have more than 20% left and the serum is starting to oxidize.  Nevertheless, I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife I have rosacea and decided to try it on my face to see if I had any positive results. I have tried steroids creams, pills, soaps, lotions, scrubs and oils and nothing worked for this skin condition but this serum worked in 2 days. Not sure why but I don&#x27;t have flareups or excessive dry skin on those areas. And since it worked I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> My skin is not sensitive but it gets itchy after I apply this serum. And I can&#x27;t tell if it works after using it for a month.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m only a week in, but it does make my skin on my legs softer/smoother.  Hopefully after a full month of use I&#x27;ll see some real change.  I&#x27;ll update it in a month!</li>
    <li> After six weeks I still see no improvement. I fell for the spin marketing. Sephora and drugstore brands probably offer serums cheaper and as useful.</li>
    <li> I use this along with a large part of the Murad Resurgence line and some other serums. It all helps alot. I particularly like to use this after derma needling.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail yesterday.  I put it on in the afternoon and then again at night.  I also used Pure Hyaluronic Acid by ASDM Beverly Hills, which I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks.  When I woke up this morning, my skin was plumper and my pores seemed smaller.  My skin tingled during the night, I guess that indicated its working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hyaluronic Acid alone worked well, but with this product it was pretty amazing, especially after just one night.</li>
    <li> The best product I&#x27;ve tried for oxydation of the skin.  I run and bike all the time and this product helped me with the brown spots on my forehead!</li>
    <li> When this first arrived it I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  Once I tried it I was hooked.  It made my skin so smooth.  I am now on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> So far, I am happy with the product.  What I do not like is that it came without any instructions for use.  I had read other reviews that also said this, so I was prepared.  I do, however, think the company should change this.  When you sell a product, please include instructions for use and/or warnings about the product.</li>
    <li> My second bottle, this is truly a miracle! love the feeling in my face</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT...BUT I would NOT buy it here for this price of $69.....it didn&#x27;t used to be sold by Liquidation Warehouse...was sold directly from Timeless....If you love this like I do...go to their website and order DIRECT...I live in Hawaii and there was no shipping charge~ and that is amazing~!! [...]</li>
    <li> Seems like a great product and based on the reviews I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately with my sensitive skin, I reacted badly. I broke out into a severe rash. I had to give it to a family friend. I would be cautious if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know if this product was making a difference, but I&#x27;ve had so many people asking me what my skin care routine is because my face looks so good. I guess it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> THIS FEELS GREAT GOING ON, ONLY THING I DON&#x27;T LIKE IS THAT IT ONLY LAST FOR 3 MONTHS&lt;br /&gt;AFTER THAT I GUESS THE EFFECTIVENESS WEARS OFF :(</li>
    <li> I liked this very much</li>
    <li> Mom usually uses Skinceuticals Phloretin CF and tried this when I sent it to her and she says it&#x27;s good.  She didn&#x27;t say if it was better than the Skinceuticals though.  Great sellers, though.</li>
    <li> i,ve paid $20 more from a different brand.  this is an excellent serum for skin.  i use it in the morning before i add sunscreen.  if you value your skin, you need to apply this serum.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Have been using this for over a year. Go to reorder and the price has more than doubled!!!! Will not repurchase!</li>
    <li> I saw a blogger do a story on this serum and have been hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came fast and was packaged well. I checked to make sure the serum was clear (I know if it is anything but then it needs to go back due to oxidation.) It was clear. I kept it in a dark cupboard in the original packaging to ensure that it stayed good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW, night one I apply it - no stinging, no oily mess. Has the consistency of water almost. I went to bed and woke up to fantastic results. My Face felt so soft and looked pretty clear! I have used an entire bottle and am ready for another one. It did not clear up all my hyper-pigmentation like I wanted me it definitely improved my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recently gave me a sample of &amp;#34;The competition&amp;#34; Skinceuticals brand and I was NOT happy with the results. For one the Skinceuticals brand reeked. Second it felt greasy to me. I did not like the oily feel and neither did my skin because a day later I broke out along my jawline. I will never use that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 46 year old skin. Non-smoker, non-tanner. I have some rosecea and  redness. This product did not make the redness worse like some products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know, you can&#x27;t beat the price! It is not a miracle, anti-ager but it is certainly a nice addition to add to an arsenal of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars- I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> im hoping this stuff works for me as it has for others.  it goes on nice but the dropper top wont stay screwed on so i cant lay it down. i know my skin could use this type of product and i believe its helping. i will reorder larger size next time</li>
    <li> I am on my 2 bottle and I put on every morning under my moisturizer with sun block effectve and affordable</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for several weeks and compared to the hyaluronic acid product i normally use, this one has a bit more of a thicker consistency. I assume it is because of the Vitamin C and E and it being Ferulic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend either one of those products, in conjunction with Argan Oil ( i normally by the one from Timeless skin care as it has no smell and for the qty. the best price yet very high quality).&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid 40th , struggled with adult acne break outs and any combination of those three products improved my skin by 70%. Of course the wrinkles I had will never completely go away, but my face , after about 6 month of use of these products made my skin 97% acne free, skin is smoother, wrinkles deminished and my skin has a much healther glow.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend these products vs. spending so much money on high $ products with fancy names in department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a ph balance facial cleanser from Alpha Hydrox. And a tea tree toner from Lush(but any natural toner of ph balance  cleansere will do)&lt;br /&gt;I apply the serum mornign and night. The argan oil only at night , since I do apply foundation</li>
    <li> I am using this nightly in combination with other facial care and believe I am seeing some improvements - easy to apply and no stinging.</li>
    <li> Update: I ordered 2 of these and they arrived cloudy/foggy and very different from the Skinceuticals and Cosmetics Skin Solutions formulations.  Save your money and buy CSS or make your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Original review&lt;br /&gt;Users please note the formulation change in this product.  This product used to contain both l-ascorbic acid and MAP, both forms of Vitamin C.  This probably explains the many earlier reviews which noted that the serum felt different than Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.  Very recently, Timeless has re-formulated this product by removing the MAP.  I think this is best given that MAP and l-ascorbic acid require very different environments/phs to fully absorb with full efficacy into the skin.  The new formulation may be more similar to Skinceuticals and CSS CE Ferulic serums now--after trying it for a month, I&#x27;ll report back with a review on that.  The rating here is provisional until I get good results from this product--the lowered rating is temporary and reflects the fact of formulation change without advertising it to customers.</li>
    <li> This product will eliminate spots and scars over time.  I use it morning and night and have noticed visible improvement with freckles and age spots.  Goes on light and is quickly absorbed to use under moisturizer and/or makeup.</li>
    <li> My skin started getting drier and drier as soon as I started using this product. As soon as I stopped it quickly returned to normal. Other than dryness I noticed NO improvement to my skin tone at all. Very disappointing.  I was warned this would happen with the generic form but for the money I decided to take my chances. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I use the Vitamin C serum, hyaluronic acid, and hyaluronic with Matrixyl, and I love them all. My experiences with this company have been excellent. Excellent product, prices, and service!</li>
    <li> This is so overpriced it is ridiculous! Yes, it is a good product, but only for the price I paid a few months ago. It has more than doubled in price since August! You can find other Vitamin C Serums that are just as good for far less than this outrageous price! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Very nice serum....light weight and absorbs quickly into skin....have not seen a big change but will continue to use and re-order when I need another bottle.  I think these types of treatments take a little time to see any difference.</li>
    <li> I chose to only give 3 stars for 1 reason and one reason only, I will also be giving skinceuticals only 3 stars in my next review. The reason being that although this product works beautifully, it tends to oxidize at a rate I cannot keep up with. It works even better for me than it&#x27;s famous cousin Skinceuticals c+e ferulic at a fraction of the cost. So if your debating which to purchase, save your money and go for the Timeless brand. Use it fast! Use it all over your body because it only lasts so long before it turns orange and smells foul. I have tried 2 different bottles and after noticing the fast oxidation I decided to try skinceuticals, to my disapointment that one turned just as fast... Great product tho, works amazing for tightening. I wish they would consider changing the dispenser to something that didn&#x27;t let in so much air...</li>
    <li> I like their responding to my email which it was quickly and I like what they replied which was they were late five days to ship it because they never keep their product in the store they make it fresh on demand. I like their dark bottle so it will keep vitamin C from light.&#x27;&#x27;it is early to tell since I have been using this product for one month, but I didn&#x27;t find a quick result..The  pores became less, but not to much I wish if it works with under eyes or lines but there is no difference till now. Also the absorption degree is not to high, but it will be absorbed eventually. Maybe I didn&#x27;t find a perfect result in one month, but the result i got it encouraging me to keep going using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks.  I guess my skin doesn&#x27;t need it because I have seen zero difference in its tone or evenness since I started using it.  Not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, but I haven&#x27;t seen a change good or bad.  The consistency is like water, there is no odor or fragrance.  Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works great minimizing pores! Very silky and absorbs quickly leaving your face very soft</li>
    <li> I started using this product last year..  Great product however, it has recently doubled in price...  Forced to order another Vitamin C within my budget so I order a cheaper one - same product same results... Will stick with my new product..</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on someone else&#x27;s recommendation.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not thrilled with it.  I use only 5-6 drops in the AM, and apply it to a dry face after my toner.  I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping anything.  I do notice an oily finish with it, which I don&#x27;t like.  I&#x27;m going to shop around and see if I can find something better.</li>
    <li> I was using this for a while , and then went to Paulas Choice C , well i have to say Timeless is MUCH BETTER BY FAR! It really faded my marks , Just waiting to finish the PC product befor I get more from Timeless. So if you&#x27;re on the fence , don&#x27;t think about it just buy Timeless.</li>
    <li> I am dark skin women who have been using this product for one month. I have not seen a change yet. I use it three times a day as prescibed. I probably need more time.</li>
    <li> Makes my face break out.  Tried using it for 2 weeks to see if this product was the culprit.  Once I stopped. Breakouts stopped.</li>
    <li> I chose this product for the anti-aging factors within Viatmin C serum. I have experienced noticable improvements in the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> I really love it, good for acne treatment. I really recommend this product for oily skin. and has very good price too</li>
    <li> Just received my bottle and its cloudy.  Can&#x27;t really \\&quot;rate\\&quot; it til I actually try it.  Have contacted the seller about returning it for a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; bottle.  I purchased the Derma-Roller a couple weeks ago and have been using it at night.  Can someone tell me how to use the serum and the roller together??  Do I put the serum on first before I roll or do I put it on after I roll??  Sometimes the instructions on these products aren&#x27;t too clear.  Thanks for any help.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in 2013 and loved it. My family and friends started making comments on how much my skin looked younger and moist. I had not found any other product that delivers such good results so far. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use the whole bottle before my daughter dumped it out to use the bottle :/ It was working very well when I started. I used it with a derma roller. (540 Needle Derma Micro Titanium, also on Amazon).</li>
    <li> I have just ordered my third bottle of this and I love it! I had run out about a month ago, and I can now definately tell how well it works because my skin currently very oldish and gray/drab. When I was using it my skin looked much more radiant and rosy. The only drawback is that sometimes it starts to turn yellow before I run out but for the price it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes your face feel and look smooth!!!</li>
    <li> i AM 54 years old, and did not hope that using this cream I would look younger, but it has made my skin more soft.&lt;br /&gt;for younger people would work better.</li>
    <li> I feel like it is good value for serum that works.  Arrived very timely and I feel like I can see results.  I would recommend to friend.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin but this product works well under my moisturizer. I plan to continue purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;dw</li>
    <li> I waited for the original, and very expensive, version of this product to expire. When it did, I chose a much more affordable version. This one is even less expensive, and it appears to be as effective as the other one I&#x27;ve used. (By the way, some legitimate science supports the use of these components, but the vitamin C needs to be stabilized, and it can be difficult for a consumer to know whether that&#x27;s the case for an individual product. I can&#x27;t access at no cost the entire article right now, but here&#x27;s one abstract taken from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology: [...]</li>
    <li> Love the product, but wasn&#x27;t quite prepared for how much it dried by skin. I use it once a day because I can&#x27;t seem to keep my skin moisturized enough to use twice a day. Otherwise a wonderful product. A great value.</li>
    <li> I could see a difference in my skin after 2 weeks!  Skin color evened out and  looks brighter and smoother.  I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation; but I always put sunscreen on too.  I highly recommend this product. BTW my skin has been with me for 61 years!!</li>
    <li> great product for a great price and results</li>
    <li> This is what got me started on vitamin c, now I make my own. Its a lot cheaper to make your own</li>
    <li> Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Face and neck appreciate the vitamin c - skin is definitely more even and just a bit softer.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to apply sun screen afterward  if you&#x27;re using this in the mornings and heading out to UV exposure.</li>
    <li> I was interested in vitamin c and did a bit of research and decided this was a more economical purchase then the Skinceuticals. The liquid arrived as expected in a the blue bottle and the liquid was clear. I keep it in a closed cupboard out of the bathroom and direct light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleansed my face, placed some drops on my fingers and applied to my face. It was fine thought I had scraped my chin and when it passed over, it stung for a wee second. That hasn&#x27;t happened since. As it&#x27;s liquid, it does roll around but I use Argan oil and I&#x27;m used to the finger tip procedure. If I&#x27;m feeling lazy, I just squirt some into my palm and either dip my fingers in or pat around my hands before applying on my face. I also use underneath my eyes, not all the way to my lashes but just some dabs here and there. I always rub the remainder on the tops of my hands so they feel nice too. Everything feels nice and soft, sometimes puffy but in a good way! I put some on my lips once and I felt like Angelina Jolie a little while later just don&#x27;t lick your lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply each morning. Afterwards, I use an additional Ole Henriksen vitamin c cream, followed by SPF 30 and a tinted BB cream with additional SPF. Could be over kill but I&#x27;ve had photofacials so my skin in pretty blemish free and I want to keep it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for results, I was expecting to be blown away from most of the reviews but my skin is pretty good to begin with so I&#x27;m always a little disappointed :) I&#x27;ll keep using this as part of my routine though. I am interested in trying skin needling/rolling with this but I&#x27;m worried it will sting seeing you are creating tiny holes in your face, then putting the acid on top.</li>
    <li> This product has vitamins that have been proven to help skin absorb and retain moisture. It works well and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> Great Serum....very happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Kept 1/2 in fridge to keep fresh....stayed perfectly!!</li>
    <li> It is okay. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in my skin yet.  Stephanie</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and has come out on top when compared with the same product manufactured by others, including Paula&#x27;s Choice. But, don&#x27;t buy through Amazon at this ridiculous price. Buy directly from Timeless for $24.95.</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t really see a difference.  But that&#x27;s OK... worth a try</li>
    <li> This is the best serum and terrific results as an integral part of my skin care regime.  I have been using this since Oct 2013 and just ordered my second on (probably should have ordered in January, but when I realized it was time to reorder, I placed the order and had it in days.  Great stuff!  I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> love the feel, no problems wearing under makeup - no pilling. Glowing without greasy feeling. would highly recommend and will repurchase</li>
    <li> Great skin food at a terrific price. Beats the high-line competition by a mile. It&#x27;s a staple in my daily regimen and I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician.</li>
    <li> This product is more of a liquid and works well with makeup.  I like to use it before I use my NuFace Toner.  I think it really helps.</li>
    <li> I saw this on youtube so I decided to give it a try. Wow, it just changed the look and feel of my face. My goodness I was so pleased I&#x27;m now using it on my legs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to review a face product ... I don&#x27;t expect miracle and I&#x27;m not expecting any product will make me look any younger, reduce existing wrinkles, etc.  All I hope for is that the ingredients somehow help slow down the aging process a little.  I don&#x27;t have any way to judge the effectiveness of this product in those terms.  What I can say is that the ingredients look very equivalent to a well-known much more expensive product which I was using previously. This product looks and feels the same. And I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and it&#x27;s still clear. With the other big name product, within a couple of weeks, the product had started to turn amber/brown.  So I am very happy with the product and will plan to repurchase.</li>
    <li> My first review!&lt;br /&gt;I love Retin A and decided to use some around my eyes. This unfortunately gave me eye wrinkles and caused me to look many years older, lol. After just one use, the 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz. has reduced the eye wrinkles and crepiness dramatically. I look like a teen again! Just wanted to share for those seeking a remedy to the Retin A/eye wrinkles dilemma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used it at nighttime:&lt;br /&gt;Washed face with Purpose face wash&lt;br /&gt;Applied clean and clear toner&lt;br /&gt;Applied 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum to my entire face&lt;br /&gt;Waited 10 minutes for it to absorb&lt;br /&gt;Applied Nivea creme all over my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later and my skin is still looking great. I plan on using it every other day in the p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I store it in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was longer than expected but I had tracking info from the seller. This serum was sooooo worth the wait. Thank you Timeless Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Updated regimen 12/17/13:*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now realized that my skin is sensitive and have stopped using toner and other drying facial products. The eye wrinkles are now gone. The only targeted eye product I now trust is Olay Professional Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex Anti Aging; it has peeling/exfoliation without causing eye wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser: Cerave&lt;br /&gt;Serum: 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Day &amp; Night Cream: Cerave facial moisturizing lotion (PM) or U-lactin&lt;br /&gt;Wait 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Acne med: Retin A (.025% 2-3 times/week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-hour Olay Regenerist Daily Thermal Mini-Peel once or twice a week all over face, including under eyes and lips</li>
    <li> ;I liked it ,but a bit costly....especially when a klutz  spill most of bottle  bummer me.  ..but ii i had better beauty allowance i would try again ,</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with hyaluronic acid post microneedling and my skin is glowing! The product stings when applied after the treatment since its acidic and microneedling just created micropunctures on the skin. I can tolerate this discomfort better than facialsthough because I have control of the process. I have always gotten compliments on my skin but using this product has definitely made my skin looking healthier, glowy, non-greasy and supple. I wish I had started using this sooner.</li>
    <li> Cheap in comparison with expensive brand but as effective!  I use this product every morning with SPF sun block.  And I use a Retinol product along with Olay regenerist cream for night skin care.  This combination seem effective for my 55+ years old skin to keep it smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this one minor scars and also on my face after using the the &amp;#34;pin&amp;#34; method, and I love how my skin looks and improves with the use</li>
    <li> Timeless E Ferulic Acid Serim is absorbed immediately on clean skin smoothing out wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I use this serum to lighten dark spots left on my face from cancer removal.  My dermatologist suggested hydroquinone, but because of the studies showing a cancer risk, I chose to try this serum instead.  I&#x27;m in my second month of using the serum and the spots have faded by at least 50%.  I also decided to try it on my rosacea areas since my dermatologist said vitamin C is a great anti-inflammatory....and it&#x27;s REALLY reduced the redness.  I also notice that the underlying bumps have gotten much flatter.  Thanks to this product my skin looks great....and I&#x27;m hoping with continued use, the dark spots will fade away completely.  Also, the price of this product is MUCH MUCH cheaper than the Skin Ceuticals product that is similar.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you must be aware the rubber gasket/washer in the eye-dropper causes it to spontaneously loosen. It is too thick or perhaps the wrong material. When it un-screws itself then is picked up by the top - well you can imagine what happens. You should fix this. It leads to waste. Also it seems that a loose top doesn&#x27;t provide the seal one might hope for and perhaps you should provide.</li>
    <li> this is better than using C on its own. its really work too. I get so many compliments since I started using that I stopped noticing..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about six months and loved the look and feel of my skin. Then I ran out and did not have an opportunity to re order due to travel. My face almost immediately lost its radiance and glow, it actually turned dull, patchy and porous. I quickly re ordered and noticed a difference within two days. My face looks more even and glowing. I use it pm, followed by retin a cream and moisturizer, as well as am followed by moisturizer and sunblock. Will never be without this product again! I am 47, have no wrinkles and intend to keep it that way.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have purchased very expensive brands in the past &amp; this compares or exceeds them!&lt;br /&gt;I have seen results. Brighter, smoother skin. Love it &amp; love the price!</li>
    <li> It has vitamin C and E which makes it more moisturizing than the ultima Swiss vitamin c, however ultima Swiss has hyaluronic acid and this timeless one does not but you can purchase the timeless hyaluronic acid too separately and you get more quantity and more for your money! If you want a vitamin c serum that mousturizes well this is it!</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s really as good as the much pricier C E ferulic products but I do like this one. It doesn&#x27;t sting, is quickly absorbed, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it had alcohol in it which is very strong. This negates the benefits of vitamin c. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other serums with vitamin E and C, but I prefer this one.  It&#x27;s in a blue bottle to better preserve it.  I like the way it goes on with the dropper.  It is thick and doesn&#x27;t run like some others.  I see improvement in my skin when I use it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE to my previous review:  While the PRODUCT is great, BEWARE THE SUPPLIER YOU PURCHASE THIS FROM!  I purchased most recently from Amazon, via &amp;#34;Hair Major&amp;#34;.  The first bottle delivered had already started to go bad, as the serum was a pale yellow (indicating oxidation and, therefore, ineffectiveness).  Amazon and Hair Major were very prompt about sending a replacement (on a Sunday) but the second bottle was significantly WORSE than the first!  So obviously, the serum has been sitting on the shelf too long.  Never again will Ipurchase this from anyone other than the manufacture Timeless Skin Care directly, as they make it up fresh - which, for a product like this, is a necessity!     I use it every day after cleansing - pat a layer on face, n eck, chest and backs of hands, then I follow it up with a layer (3 pumps) of Olay Regenerist - Frangrance Free.  Then a moisturizer with a good sunblock.  Sunblock is essential when you use this serum as it does increase the skin&#x27;s photosensitivity.  I&#x27;ve reordered the product three times -- it&#x27;s always fresh and lasts just about as long as it takes me to go through a bottle (around 6 weeks).  You have to take care about its storage, though -- keep it sealed tightly and shield it from sunlight.  Once it starts to oxidize, it will take on a yellowish tint and it&#x27;s no longer effective.  They make the batch fresh each time they ship to you.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This product does work, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to keep it.  I thought of returning and even got the RMA.  I read more about it and decided to give it a try and use it with the microneedle roller size .50mm.  I can see the difference, and it didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  I had a dark spot on upper chest and tried other things, that did lighten but with this it is almost gone.  I have to really look to see where it barely is.  I use this at night and it leaves my skin moist.  I have only used for maybe two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now and I have had people ask me what I was doing that I looked like I had turn back time.!!!</li>
    <li> I like this serum and at this unbelievable price. A well known competiter sells for $149.00 and i like this better! Try it around eyes, but don&#x27;t get in eyes. Thanks for a great product at a fantastic price....Austin Elliott</li>
    <li> I purchased this with their Hyaluronic acid serum. After a month of usage I saw no results. I have ok skin but suffer from enlarged pores, pigmentation and some black heads. This serum plugged pores around Tzone and did nothing fir my skin. I examine my skin daily under high mag mirrors, this product clealy plugged all my pores, disappointing.  I am done with the bottle i will order no more.</li>
    <li> I can already see a difference in just a matter of weeks.  it is not too strong where I feel a burning sensation but there is tingling and you know it is working.  Once I have done this I follow up with a collagen cream, my skin has been looking great. I would recommend for sure (warning, as they say when you get chemical peels, do not do overheat or sweat.  I did make that mistake, had it on in the morning and went to gym early afternoon.  Face felt very hot and itchy, won&#x27;t make that mistake again, but still was nothing serious.  My face cooled down once I did).  **Updated a few weeks later.  My mom asked me over dinner if I have had botox!!  She knows that is not something I would consider but she said she still had to ask, she couldn&#x27;t believe how good my skin looked.  I only use this product about once-twice a week.  I think any more than that would be over doing it for me personally.  But I love it and will be replenishing when it is out.</li>
    <li> I am mid 40&#x27;s male, spent alot of years in the sun and have been focusing on my skin health for the last year.  It started with eating an anti-inflamatory diet [[ASIN:0061735329 Clean: The Revolutionary Program to Restore the Body&#x27;s Natural Ability to Heal Itself]] along with fresh carrot juice everyday (no it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and the active form of vitamin A from carrots is not toxic)and sweating from exercise at least 3 times a week. I had a professional CIT session about 2 months ago and decided to do them at home using the derma-rollers.  I bought this product as an adjunct to the rollers.  Well, I haven&#x27;t used the rollers yet and I have been using this for 10 days, I can not begin to express how happy I am with the results! Co-workers have asked me what I am doing, \\&quot;your skin looks amazing.\\&quot; It feels soft too. I exfoliate in the evening with a sugar scrub and once a week with the Olay Micro dermabrasion [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion 2.2 Oz and Peel System Skin Care 2.0 Fl Oz]]and I apply this at night and in the morning.  I have taken the advice of some others and kept it in the refrigerator to help keep it longer. Turns out that this product is much less expensive than its competitors too.  I would not hesitate to recommend this.  Give it a week or two but I can tell you you will notice results in texture within days- smooooth!</li>
    <li> I was going to go for another brand of facial Vitamin C as well but I sure am glad I decided to order this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my skin is tighter, fresher, younger looking, less lined...  Yes.  All that.  And my pores even look smaller.  I will be faithful to this fantastic product now that I&#x27;ve found it.  Not one other product I&#x27;ve used has made such a great change in my skin  :)  I highlly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a couple of weeks and already noticed brighter skin. Saw a recommendation of the ingredients on Dr. Oz and gave it a try. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it five stars but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week.  Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in anything but am willing to finish out the bottle before finally deciding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 2 - one month later.  I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THE SHIPPING ON THIS PRODUCT WAS SSSSOOOOO SLOW. I RECIEVED THE PACKAGE WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS I OPENED THE BOTTLE IT DIDNT HAVE A SMELL, I THEN SHOOK IT UP AND IT WAS CLOUDY LOOKING. WHEN I PUT IT ON MY FACE, IT FELT GREASY BUTIT ABSORBED IN MY FACE RIGHT AWAY AND THEN MY FACE JUST FELT MOISTURIZED I DECIDED TO STILL PUT ON MOISTURIZER(CETAPHIL) AND THAT WAS A MISTAKE LEFT MY FACE SUPER SHINY.... SO NOW I PUT LESS THAN A DIMESIZED OF MOISTURIZERON MY FACE THIS PRODUCT ALONE DOES ENOUGH I GAVE IT THREE STARS BECUASE ALTHOUGH I HAVE SEEN MY FACE LOOK BRIGHTER I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY MAJOR RESULTS REGARDING MY ACNE SCARS.... I WILL COME BACK WITH A TWO MONTH REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Love, love!! Softer glowing face,</li>
    <li> I would much rather spend $25 on this wonderful skin product than $150 from the &amp;#34;famous dermatologist brand&amp;#34; with the exact same ingredients.</li>
    <li> It has helped clear up my skin and the pigment from pregancy is fading:)  My skin is softer and more young looking..</li>
    <li> For this price I love I use in the morning after toner and over serum I put day cream other company&#x27;s charge hundred $for same thing and I loved hyaluronic acid from this company I ad to my all creams and body lotions I have to write that I use for 2 years I over 40th I  have no complains for my skin :) I will buy all the time !!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this after my Clarisonic face cleaning.  I could tell immediately this was gold for my skin. Immediate results.  My face and neck are super smooth, brightened, and the skin seems tightened by this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 12/18/15:  I just found this bottle (from 2012!) at the back of my fridge, with a small amount left.  Yes, it has turned yellow, but I put it on my face and it still works!!!  It instantly imparts a healthy sheen to your face like when you were younger.  I woke up and looked like I was 15 years younger, no lie, and I&#x27;m 63. I had forgotten how wonderful this product was!  I just ordered 2 more bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A very very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this Vita C serum!&lt;br /&gt;I was a big fan of SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic, but it is so pricey at $150. I&#x27;ve bought several other brands between $80-$100 that claim to be the same. They were all horrible, sticky messes with no results. And one of them was from a reputable cosmetic dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;This TIMELESS C E Ferulic is fantastic.  I could see results instantly. Just like the SkinCeuticals version, it made my skin dewey and glowing. The next morning my skin looks refreshed and lifted. I have sagging, aging skin and this is the only thing that has worked.</li>
    <li> I developed acne after using this serum. Wish it would of worked. Guess my skin is too sensitive.</li>
    <li> I apply this in the morning when I am without makeup.  It feels good, skin is soft and supple.  When I do wear makeup I feel radiant.</li>
    <li> This serum contains a fragrance which is a needless irritant and totally unnecessary, thus I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Tried this product in the past and was very happy with it. Came back today to reorder, but I will not be placing my order because of the price hike.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to give moisture and reduce lines around my eyes. It is working there. However, it is oil based and is causing blemishes to other areas of my face. Being oil based it is difficult to keep in the exact place. Still using , not sure will continue if I can&#x27;t get it under control!</li>
    <li> I love this C serum. The price is reasonable and the product seems fresh. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t come with any instructions for application or recommended use.  Requested info from Seller who directed me back to original post which offered nothing useful.  Ended up throwing the product out.</li>
    <li> I liked it at first, but after a while, it irritated my skin. It may be good for some, but not for me</li>
    <li> This product works well with peels or microneedle. I have used it for only 3 weeks and I have seen improvement in my skin with regard to texture and uneven skin color. It is working for me. Other products are so expensive with inferior results!</li>
    <li> I was a little weary of ordering from this company, because I couldn&#x27;t find much information about them on the internet. Their website is not very informative and so really, the only information I had to go on were the Amazon reviews. I took a chance and I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1 1/2 weeks in combination with the hyaluronic Acid + Matrixyl + Algae eye cream. I have to say...I&#x27;m really loving them! I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but after just a couple of days, my skin tone seemed more even. Now, my skin seems softer, plumper and just looks better in general. In the last year, I had also begun to have redness around my cheeks and smile lines. It seems to have disappeared since I&#x27;ve started using the product. It is gentle enough to use regularly and a little goes a long way (I just use 1 drop per forhead, cheek, chin and neck). I should mention that after ordering, it took about 1 week for it to arrive in the mail and the products do not come with any real instructions (hence 4 stars). Regardless, I am really pleased with the results and will buy both items again.</li>
    <li> I have noticed or shall I say other people have noticed a difference in my skin.  People keep asking me what I have had done.  Nothing....it comes from a bottle!</li>
    <li> Being a woman in my mid 50s I am concerned about aging and age spots. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. It is light and non greasy. I believe I see some improvement in the age spots. I will continue to use it and we shall see. I keep it in the refrigerator for freshness after reading other&#x27;s reviews and suggestions.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the first time after seeing it in a face skin care video on YouTube. I cannot give a review on long term results, however, I love this stuff! My face so soft, supple, and healthy looking, which is wonderful as I am 49 years old. The price is very reasonable and it did make a difference from the beginning of use and I will buy this product again. This is my honest review and I did NOT receive this product free or at a reduced cost in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly, at night on a clean face before moisturizing.  I like the way it seems to have improved the quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and so far I like it! I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because I was concerned about the Polysorbate 80 and propylene glycol but I havent found any other products I like better that don&#x27;t have those two ingredients.  I bought it because my face has been crazy dry lately and it didn&#x27;t matter what I put on it, there was this crusty dryness to my skin.  This stuff felt a little weird at first but my face felt better even after the first use! I use it after washing my face.  Squeeze a dropper full in my hand and gently smear it all over my face and neck.  After it soaks in I put a little straight grapeseed oil over that and my face feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> I used this product up and did not see much of an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did burn somewhat in the beginning but then over the 1st week my skin got use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did leave me feeling sticky :(</li>
    <li> Seems to help with dark spots.</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth and after only a few weeks I am seeing improvement with my age spots.  The one spot has faded slightly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, suits my sensitive skin. I have been using this with low dose Tretinoin cream to try to reduce brown spots on the side of my face, and it is working well. This serum is easily absorbed. I first heard about it in Hot and Flashy 50 s blog. Well worth the money. Fast delivery from the USA too.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, lots of compliments on my face....however, the bottle keeps leaking, the top, gets loose, screw on top droper lid, I have wasted alot and now less then half left.  All over make up bag, twice!!!!  Resign the top, please.  I will still buy but change the lid.</li>
    <li> the bottle was creaked, received half the stuff. like it product what is left. skin feels soft in the morning, i think it is a god item to buy but may not because ended up getting only half the bottle. took tool long to arrive.</li>
    <li> I used this to help with some hyperpigmentation and redness. This did nothing by irritate my skin. I put it on at bedtime and woke up beet red!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend avoiding this one.</li>
    <li> It seams to work very very well for me :) I have just use it two for weeks now. My skin is more radiant and it glowing ...</li>
    <li> Loved my skin texture and brightness but this caused breakouts tor me.</li>
    <li> This serum is easy to use and feels great on the face. I did flake a lot and now mix it with some Argon oil. Next time I will purchase a reduced Vitamin C percentage, but it does work!</li>
    <li> i do like the amount of vitamin C it is potent enough to make a difference. I started to see smoother skin and less lines about 1 mo &amp; 1/2. I used it 3-4 times a week.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is as good as the other more expensive product I had...it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell the same?</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product but you are not the only company to put out a great and comparable product at much less cost. It seems though that you now feel the need to compete with the higher priced products. I will look for a product that is great but that does not try to take advantage of its loyal customers by jacking up the price!</li>
    <li> but it did not last long even if I only used it once per day. For the price, more should have been in the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this serum and it works great to fade spots on my skin.  Works better than the name brands and very affordable.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  My skin looks and feels so much better after just using this for a few days!! Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin peel BADLY every time I use it. I thought my skin just had to adjust to it at first, but after several uses, results still the same. SO disappointing.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!  Won&#x27;t use anything else.  Goes on nicely before applying other pruducts.  Terrific price for the product.  The shipment takes some time, but that is because they make each one fresh....which is how it should be.</li>
    <li> Works well for my challenged wrinkles! A little goes a long way. I would buy again when I need to.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and break out easily so I have to be careful what I put on it.  I love this serum! I apply it at night, right after I take a shower and when my face is still moist.  I wait 15 minutes and apply my retin-a.  I also use it in the morning, right after my shower and before my sunscreen/moisturizer. I have noticed a huge difference under my eyes.  The skin used to look a little wrinkly there, but now it has smoothed out  My skin tone has evened out and I look more refreshed! I love the way it feels on my skin....makes it look dewy.  I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> As a former consumer of a BIG name skincare brand that sounds like &#x27;pharmaceuticals&#x27;, I was psyched when I discovered this gem of a product.</li>
    <li> I like this particular brand a lot.  I use it daily, at night, since the sun depletes vitamin C.  It seems to work great after a light peel.</li>
    <li> I bought this because Skinceuticals is so much more expensive, around $124. This serum is amazing, my skin is so soft it feels like i don&#x27;t even need moisturizer. I will definately buy more.</li>
    <li> I definitely like this product as I am on my second bottle! Good product at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Great product! This is my second bottle. It has lightened the brown spots on my face. Use it daily! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for ths skin and feels great</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different types of hyaluronic acid products, vitamin C + hyaluronic acid, but I like this stuff the best.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day, let it dry and use pure coconut oil as my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m saving a ton of money not using all the fancy creams any more and my face has never looked better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I can just figure out the hair issues....</li>
    <li> I have seen no results after using a bottle of this as directed. Disappointing after the rave reviews.</li>
    <li> Love this. My skin looks more plump and younger, and I saw the difference within days of beginning to use it. Side note: although it makes my skin look healthier, it does not assist with tone, sunspots, or other pigment issues.</li>
    <li> Very good serum for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying so many different vitamin c serums and I think this is the one I&#x27;m going to stick to!  It goes on very nicely and I feel my skin was definitely improving with this serum.  The only problem I did have was that it oxidized before I could finish it but I&#x27;m going to try what youtuber hotandflashy recommended which was to transfer half of it into a glass cobalt blue bottle, seal it tightly and refrigerate it.  Once I&#x27;m done with the first half, then the second half will be a lot more fresh for longer use.  I&#x27;ve ordered my second bottle so I&#x27;m sure that will work.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what I expected, but I see no noticeable change in my skin. I have used the serum for over a month. My face has neither improved nor worsened.</li>
    <li> I will never be without this product again!!  Sunspots on the backs of hands are gone.  Staining on my neck from sun damage is fading fast.  Three huge pores on my nose are now nearly gone.  LOVE!!!!</li>
    <li> I can see a difference. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks and I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what exactly makes this serum so magical, but the texture of my skin feels so much smoother and softer. I keep mine in the refrigerator and it is still very watery so I just apply it to sections of my face at a time. It does sting a little bit at first but it feels refreshing and tightening. I apply it at night and by the morning my skin has soaked it up and looks clear. I think it is evening out my tone a little bit, which is mainly why I got it, but it has also minimized my pores and lessened my blemishes, which is a bonus. I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles so I can&#x27;t speak to that but my skin does feel firm and supple so I think it would help in that area too.</li>
    <li> I feel my skin tone and discolorations are improving with this product.  I have only used this serum for 3 months; I will continue to purchase to see if my results are consistent.  One bottle lasted for these 3 months.  I was not stingy with the product.  I used a dropper full for my face, neck, and upper chest every day and night.  If I had been more conservative, I&#x27;m certain this bottle would have lasted 5+ months.</li>
    <li> This is very good for the skin.  I use it in conjunction with other products.  I cleanse my face and every other day use my 1.0mm Micro Needle Roller then apply a dropper of this to my face.  It feel fabulous.  After massaging it into my face I go ahead with my Perfect Image cream and I wake up to a noticeably refreshed face!  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at an amazing price....wish it were a wee bit less waterey not sure what the consistancy of the name brand product.  Will definately be back for more!</li>
    <li> I am a 56 year woman with a few age spots.  I have tried many products to reduce the appearance of them including retinol and hydroquinone and they have stubbornly not budged.  However, after using this product daily for a month, my age spots are not only lightening, they are &#x27;breaking up&#x27; and disappearing.  Not only that, my skin is brighter looking.  Compared to other products with similar ingredients and claims, this is a deal--because it works!</li>
    <li> This product was good but I prefer the Vitamin C with 20% abscorbic acid in it better than this one.The one with the Vit C (20%) was the one recommmended by the skin doctors on Dr. Oz. I like using the Vit. C and I put some of that into my palm of my hand and then I bought another bottle called hydraulinic acid and mix a little of that into my palm with the Vit. C and use that to rub on my face, chest, arms. It really makes your skin  beautiful and soft and much nicer than anything I have tried before!</li>
    <li> I used the whole bottle, so now I can honestly comment.  What I noticed is some blackheads!! Seriously! It lightened my complexion up to where I noticed three tiny blackheads, that I always thought were freckles! Lol  After using it, I&#x27;d let it \\&quot;sink in\\&quot; for at least an hour, then follow up with an Oil of Olay product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use much of the product as the seal on the bottle was faulty and the product spilled out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this serum for some skin tightening and fading of age spot.  Been using this product for about 2 month and I do not see any improvement in my skin .  I have less than 1/2 of the bottle left and I will continue to use this serum until the bottle is empty and hopefully I will see some difference in my skin by then.</li>
    <li> Bought this when I started using a derma roller.  I apply this serum every other night and have seen an improvement in my skin as far as firmness &amp; smoothness.  It tingles when applied,,so you know those vitamins are in there working.  I have dry skin so I use a mositurizer every other night.  I like this stuff &amp; a little goes a long way...this bottle will last me awhile!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it night and day and on my second bottle...last a long time since it is in the dropper...I wish it wasn&#x27;t as runny though...if it was more like a gel form it would be easier to spread around on face....I make sure I hit the wrinkled areas more and I saw a difference in firmness and overall look and feel...</li>
    <li> I use this with the face roller. I loved it because I could feel it burning a little bit which to me means it is getting in there and working. I feel like my face has improved quite a bit. I loved it!</li>
    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased the Timeless Vitamin C serum and I love it.  I use it in the morning after using Retin A at night.  It does not irritate my skin and I feel it has helped enhance the effects of the Retin A.  I use it on my face, neck, chest, and hands.  One bottle lasts me about two months.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Arrived on time .. It does seem to make you look younger. Feels great to</li>
    <li> The product came quickly. However, it felt differently on my face this time than last time. It didn&#x27;t have a slightly tightening and tinkling feeling when I applied it on my skin. The liquid was cloudy instead of clear when I received it - I thought it might be was damaged by the heat (sitting outside in the mailbox for a whole day) so I contacted the company and asked for an exchange but they said that it is cloudy because it was just came out of the manufactory. - I don&#x27;t know...it felt like applying water on my face.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the Timeless skincare products.  High quality at a great price.  I used the very expensive skinceuticals before and like this product better.  In addition, I am convinced that this product is responsible for my skin continuing to look young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, customer service is friendly and excellent.  USPS completely lost my package and was useless when I tried every avenue to track it down. I wrote Timeless, and they sent a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, this Company!</li>
    <li> I am surprised how many favorable reviews this product has.  I have been using this for a little over a month and have noticed no difference in my skin. When the serum finally arrived, there were no instructions and was packaged not as you would buy something in a store so I wrote to the company through amazon questioning their business and if the product is really legit and though I did hear from them rather quickly, they completely evaded my questions about the product and the company. They just asked if I wanted a refund.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 months and wanted to update my review.  I&#x27;ve pretty much used the bottle and can&#x27;t tell any difference in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product from a  great company.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to clear up some dark spots and have been applying the serum twice a day.  While I&#x27;ve seen a slight improvement, I have received several compliments on how clear my skin looks -- this can only be attributed to the addition of this product to my very basic routine (soap &amp; water)!!!  Looking forward to finishing the bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Timeless serum for about 3 months.  Last week I had my 6 month dermatologist checkup for skin cancer, which involves magnified scrutiny of most of my body and facial skin.  She mentioned what really great condition my face is in and told me to keep up whatever I&#x27;m doing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colorado is a dry state, but I&#x27;ve noticed in the last couple of months that my skin looks fresh and is very soft.  Applying makeup is especially easy.  My color has improved, also.  After the first week or two of tingling and a bit of stinging, my skin has adjusted well to this serum.  It&#x27;s easy to remember to apply in the morning.  I also use a tiny bit of AHA cream over the serum and then apply 30% sunscreen or tinted moisturizer.  Most days, I&#x27;m good to go without much more!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This serum definitely has had a huge positive impact on my skin.  I use it under my moisturizer every day.</li>
    <li> Tiny bottle, works well.  A couple of drops will do all of your wrinkle lines.  I use this before I use my microneedle roller.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but it caused me to break out. I stopped using it just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t anything else causing the acne, but when I started to use it again, I broke out again.</li>
    <li> My skin is just not the type for this product. In the winter months my skin tends to get a little more on the dry side.  I thought I could get away with using a product with vitamin E in it.  I should have known better.  This formula had everything I wanted in it except that it had the added vitamin E.  So yes, my pores were clogged by this.  It is a good product, but like it says in the description, if you tend to have skin on the oilier side (even in the winter dryer months) then the vit E might block pores.  I did end up finding this formula without the Vitamin E on ebay, but overall it would be a great product for people with certain skin types.</li>
    <li> I tried this with the for that extra vitamin everyon needs in their face. I found that it was greasy and did not help anythingb on my face so i am now using their pure hyalaric acid with st. Ives collagen and vitamin e oil. NOW i see a huge difference in the tightening arounf the bottom of eyes and my face feels and looks wonderful again. I use them twice a day. But what works for me wont work for someone else&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I heard of the importance of topical antioxidant vitamin C on your face pointed out by a skin expert on Dr. Oz&#x27;s TV show.  This is it for me.  It is a non oily, silky liquid that your skin soaks up immediately.  I put it on clean skin first before any other lotion.  It feels like instant nourishment!</li>
    <li> Excellent. I have seen improvement in only two weeks!</li>
    <li> A fraction of the cost of Skinceuticals.  All the rewards if a C Ferulic!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are raving about this product, but I found this product useless. I have been using it for couple weeks now and I found my skin less smoother.</li>
    <li> HI.....&lt;br /&gt;This product a really really really wonderful ......&lt;br /&gt;I really loved it ....&lt;br /&gt;I have used and the results were very, very amazing .....&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to dispense with the curse .....&lt;br /&gt;I have won my admiration&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a plastic surgeon because of the vitamin C and E with the ferulic acid which improves the action of the vitamins.  It reduces the fine lines and smoothens the skin.  The bottle lasts quite awhile.  The price is much lower than similar products.</li>
    <li> Great deal on a great product. As effective as the $$100 plus serum I bought from spa. Would highly recommend this</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this amazing product through a dear friend of mine, which I thank everyday now. I have been using this amazing product for over a year now and it is heaven sent. I have dry sensitive skin which breaks out to most products, NOT THIS ONE!!! I use it twice a day when I wash my face, this product is very light weight yet moisturizing. I love in sunny Florida where ones skin can sure take a toll, yet I find my skin to be youthful. I am about to turn 30 and I am pregnant now, with still a youthful glow and bright skin. One bottle lasts me two and a half months, its worth every penny I spend. I have tried so many things for my face but this works so well!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My skin is even toned and happy. I love the dropper.  My order was lost but quickly replaced.  I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Love this product! The texture of my skin has changed and my pores are smaller. No more breakouts and my complection is finally clear. An esthetician told me about this serum and you can&#x27;t beat the price point compared to other products out there. Make sure your face is clean and dry, then rub it into your skin.</li>
    <li> It is cheap and not worth it&lt;br /&gt;no odor and when you place it on your face feels awful&lt;br /&gt;worth buy ever&lt;br /&gt;It is in the garbage now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m am from SC and have recently moved to NM near the border.  Since coming to the dryer climate, my skin has broken out horribly.  This product has helped slow my breakouts down drastically and I believe it will also halt them completely if I keep using this.  It even gets a good review from FutureDerm as an affordable Vit C serum that benefits people due to it price and longevity since VitC is not stable with out E.</li>
    <li> The product turned a milky white in less than 1 week of me opening it to use. I don&#x27;t know what I did to cause this, but this has never happened when I used the Skinceuticals or Cosmetics Solutions equivalent. This is quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find products with Ferulic Acid in them at a decent price.  This item fit the bill and seems to work as well as the more expensive ones over $100.  I recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle to take on a trip and after one day in my luggage I noticed it was leaking out.  Close examination revealed that the screw on top was not able to be closed completely, it would bounce open after tightening.  Eventually most of the contents were lost.  I wrote Timeless and was sure they would want to be made aware of this problem, but they ignored my email, and I got no response from them.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have an age spot on my face that this stuff is seriously making go away!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working but it&#x27;s a highly recommended by others and it is not sticky on the face.  I bought an inexpensive synthetic foundation brush which I use to brush face with it.  It does not sting and you can put your face serum. moisturizer afterwards and does not feel heavy build up</li>
    <li> I have used just for a couple of day and can feel the difference in my skiing. I like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the active ingredients in this serum is being absorbed on a cellular level, which basically renders it useless. One obvious sign of this are the traces of powdery substance that is left on my skin when the serum dries! That&#x27;s usually a tell-tale sign that the L-Ascorbic is not being absorbed into the skin. I used to make my own Vitamin C serum and this is exactly what is happening here!! This serum also leaves a sticky \\&quot;film\\&quot; on the surface of the skin which, again, indicates that the ingredients are probably just sitting on top of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a case of \\&quot;You-Get-What-You-Pay-For\\&quot;. I feel that this serum is not any better (and not any more effective) than a homemade face serum. The ingredients may be comparable to Skinceutical&#x27;s CE Ferulic serum but the delivery system to the skin on a cellular level may be lacking in this knock-off version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish this bottle but won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I would reccomend this product to everyone. My skin glows with it. i wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It keeps fine wrinkles at bay and keeps my skin tone even. I believe it also helps rebuild  collagen. I&#x27;ve never looked better</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of this serum and really, really like it.  I use a Clarisonic daily and apply this serum afterwards and I can really feel it penetrating.  I get compliments on my skin all the time and I refer to Vitamin C serum as my &amp;#34;secret weapon.&amp;#34;  The only reason I give this serum 4 stars is because it would be absolutely perfect if they added Hyaluranic acid to the concoction!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying using this Vitamin C serum in the warm/hot weather. I keep it in the refrigerator and apply it to my freshly washed face morning and evening. It goes on nice and smooth, as well as cool and fresh. I also use the serum on my hands. I am starting to notice a decrease in some lines and wrinkles. At 46 years of age, this is a great product for me. I don&#x27;t like heavy creams, so this is perfect for me. I even put the serum under my eyes and under my brow bone. I love it!!!This is very important~you must use sunblock on your face and hands every day when using Vitamin C. There are some great organic/natural broad spectrum sunscreens out there.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great pricing.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. easy to use and my dark spots are lighter.</li>
    <li> This has alcohol listed as an ingredient. Just alcohol. Oh how it burned on my face!! Alcohol, and alcohol denat are very drying for your face, and should not be in cosmetics! Avoid this product!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other vit. C, ferulic acid, Vit.E  serums and have found the others to be so sticky on the skin. One even broke me out under the eyes in very small pinpoint red raised bumps.  The others were also heavier and had the strong scent of lunchmeat!  This one is best because it is not sticky, it is water light, it has no oils so I did not break out at all.  The scent was almost imperceptible. I was about to order more when I saw the price went up from $24.00 to $47.00  in a couple of months!  Yes it is made by Timeless Skin Care but sold by &amp;#34;Treasure Book Caf&amp;eacute;&amp;#34; whoever they are.  What nerve, to drive up the price like that. I say that because I just went to the Timeless Skin Care site, I saw this exact product that they make, for the original price of $24.95!  Nothing has changed there!  Same exact description for the product that is used here.  This product itself is good, has made a difference in the uneven coloration of my skin, and the skin is smoother, less rough looking.  I expect more improvements as time goes on.  As for now, I will buy it at the Timeless web site, you should too!</li>
    <li> Came in fast. Very good service. Product seems to be working. These things take time.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me as a good Vitamin C serum to use as an antioxidant on my skin.  Vitamin C is known to oxidize quickly when exposed to light and air.  So I bought two 1/2 oz dropper bottles and divided this into the 2 bottles, and wrapped one in foil and put in refrigerator while using the other.  I am on the second bottle now and so far, no oxidizing.  Plan to reorder when I am near the end of 2nd bottle.  Would be nice if Timeless sold in 2, 1/2 oz quantities to keep fresher.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum for the value on the market that I have tried. I have been using for 3 months and I can really see a difference in my skin&#x27;s overall appearance. I just turned 50 and have received many compliments on how youthful my skin looks. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> bought this product the end of May and went back to visit my family in Asia without using it immediately, but I kept it in a dark and cool place. When I came back and opened it this Mid-August, the product was spoiled and was like jello. So disappointing. Not able to return, cause can not find the receipt. [[ASIN:B0036BI56G 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz.]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and can tell a difference - it makes the blackheads and whiteheads come to the surface quickly so they can be removed easier. My skin is smoother, more hydrated, which means less visible lines :)))))))) I will continue to buy this until they come out with something bigger and better!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and already have started seeing the difference. My skin feels smoother and clearer. When I put it on I feel little tingle but not irritating. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to be able to note a long term benefit. What I experienced is a tingling sensation when I apply the product to my face, which I presume is directly from the Vitamin C, a similar feeling to other Vitamin C products I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did notice is that my skin immediately feels tighter after application. What I&#x27;m not sure about is whether I can use this product after the derma-roller as my skin is ultra sensitive. When I get the courage to try that, I will update this review. It seems to be a well put together product in simple packaging of a small 1 oz dropper bottle.</li>
    <li> If you use witch hazel, you are closing up the pores so the product cannot penetrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply on freshly washed clean and dry skin while the pores are still open from the warm water.</li>
    <li> I can see my skin starting to change. It is softer and appears clearer.  Initially it stings a bit, but it subsides quickly and it takes a few minutes to be absorbed, you just have to be patient, it &#x27;s  definitely has made a difference.</li>
    <li> This is great! I can&#x27;t tell the difference between its effects on the skin, and SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic serum. which by the way costs $146.  This product has the exact same ingredients as Skinceuticals product for far less money.  Timeless Skin Care mixs your serum after you order it, assuring you get a fresh product!  The price is awesome, and so is the seller. This is my 2nd bottle, and it will be a staple for me as long as they continue to make it. I did not find it to be irritating to my skin.  I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about proper skin care.  Ladies, try it and tell your friends! Your skin will thank you for it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this since the day I received it and I see absolutely no difference in my skin then before.</li>
    <li> . No more breakouts. Dark spots have faded. Clearer and much smoother skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I use it at bedtime and in the morning . One bottle lasts about a month.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered 2 more. Reasonable price for a topical vitamin C and E combo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I started using vitamin C serum ! It helped sooooo much with my blackheads, whiteheads, dark acne spots and hyper pigmentation. All of my whiteheads turned into blackheads in a week and I had them extracted and now I don&#x27;t have any acne. This product is really amazing! I use it under my eyes as well and I keep getting asked what I&#x27;m doing to my face. I look so fresh in the morning when I wake up !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I used it alone (in the evening) without any moisturizer but found it too harsh and drying. Then I tried putting vitamin C on my face, waiting 5 minutes and then applying my favorite moisturizer/cream over it (NIA24). This seemed to work very well. Now I use it every morning and evening under my moisturizer. It hydrates, brightens, tightens and smooths the skin to the point where I see my face getting better and better every day. I&#x27;m so happy with this product I look at the mirror and can&#x27;t believe the difference! I would strongly advise you to use this product under your favorite moisturizer or you might experience skin dryness like I did.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite way to add vitamin C to my skin! It is not only C + E, but the Ferulic Acid helps to tighten pores, which my dermatologist said were huge. My skin looks smooth instead of rough! Plus, I give the company 5 stars for their courtesy and help when I accidentally got a bottle from an old batch, first shipment!</li>
    <li> Timeless has great products.  I like this one the least.  The Matrixyl 3000 with Hyaluronic acid seems to work better for me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and has taken some of the roughness out of my hands and face.  I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using every night for about a few weeks. I decided only use night not the morning. My skin feel so smooth and moisturizing in the morning.</li>
    <li> It was a lot of money for something that didn&#x27;t yield any changes in my skin. Perhaps you need to use it with a micro roller.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lactic 50% peel, and use this serum after thoroughly washing my face. It works as well as another product I used to use in a capsule and find the cost of this product better for my budget. I now use it sparingly each night on my forehead lines and they are diminishing which makes me happy. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product and I just pat it on wrinkles, then blend. I would recommend it to anyone who can patiently wait for results.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum based on the good reviews and the reasonable price, but my expectations were not very high.  However, after the first use, I was pleasantly surprised by how nicely my face felt. It absorbs very well and makes my face moisturized through out a whole day. After the first bottle, I was curious about other serums with good reviews. So, I tried  Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Argan Oil from the same company, but they didn&#x27;t work for me as well.  So, I ordered this again and now I know I am going to stick to this!  This is the first time that I ever left a feedback after shopping at Amazon for 10 years and that&#x27;s how much I like it!</li>
    <li> Ive use this for about a month off and on and I do have to say its done better than I thought. the main thing I noticed is the last couple years for some reason when I get out in the sun , the top of my lip seems to get really dark and it almost looks like a mustache ... HATE IT .. since using this this summer that has not happened so to me its worth it just for that&lt;br /&gt;but as far as helping anything else I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes</li>
    <li> I ordered this instead of the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic because the ingredients are 99% IDENTICAL! This arrived in about 8 days, and so far, so good. It has kind of a medicinal scent, but it goes away quickly. I read reviews by others saying that they didn&#x27;t know the instructions for use and couldn&#x27;t locate the company info, so here is their website: [...] If this continues to work, I will definitely repurchase since as someone else said, there are certain key ingredients that everyone should use to keep their skin healthy, including Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid. This has both and more! I&#x27;m a 39-year old skin care junkie.</li>
