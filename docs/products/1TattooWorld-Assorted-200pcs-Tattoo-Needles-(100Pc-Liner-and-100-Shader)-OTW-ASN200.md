      <li>When I do tattoos I like to show that everything is new and sterile but with these needles I don&#x27;t want to do that because one person decided not to get a tattoo due to the expiration dates</li>

    <li> Cheap needles. What else can I say, there are better needles out there but these ones do a great job.</li>
