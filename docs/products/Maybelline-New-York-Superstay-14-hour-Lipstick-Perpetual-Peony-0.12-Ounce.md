      <li>stays on all day and the color is perfect, it also is a matte like lipstick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is very good</li>
      <li>effortless and beautiful look</li>
      <li>I think the color is very bright, very suitable for my work, the use of good feeling mood!</li>
      <li>It goes on bright and will stand out.</li>
      <li>After lunch i have to reapply it, but it&#x27;s a good option if you don&#x27;t have time/patient to apply those 24-hour lipsticks.</li>
      <li>Ok, the color is great.</li>
      <li>Wonderful and consistent color</li>
      <li>Nice .</li>
      <li>i liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>I do not like my cosmetics to smell &amp; this one is very strong.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THE COLOR&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s glossy Love the smell as well</li>
      <li>The color is as shown, so if you dont mind smelly lips you should be ok :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t stay on the way I thought it would its ok</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>Stays on better than most lipsticks.</li>
      <li>&amp;&amp; LOVE the product itself; it actually stays on  for quite a while (idk about 14 lol) but it does a lot better than others!</li>
      <li>Has a very strong sweet smell.</li>
      <li>the color was nice, but the first time I used it the lip stick broke in the tube</li>
      <li>I love this color, I don&#x27;t wear lipstick on a normal basis but this is really nice.</li>
      <li>then a little lip gloss and that seems to be perfect.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
      <li>the color isnt as pretty and bright in the picture, it is a little more faded or pastel than that.</li>
      <li>i like it anyways though, its a pretty color.</li>
      <li>This color is my favorite lip color - have been wearing it for several years -</li>
      <li>This lipstick stays on pretty long and I absolutely love the color.  </li>
      <li>So I had been experimenting with different shades to find the ideal everyday lipstick which I can wear for the office without looking too decked up.</li>
      <li>I use this lipstick a lot because i love the color and because it lasts long.</li>
      <li>did not expect that the first product I find constant fixed without putting so many layers on the lips 0</li>
      <li>Very drying</li>
      <li>The lipstick, itself, belongs to the family of color stay lipsticks that dries your lips out and comes out very matte looking.</li>
      <li>In general is good quality, long lasting once applied.</li>
      <li>I realize color is difficult for products depicted on line, but I purchase nearly 95% of my products online and have had very good results with color.</li>
      <li>It must by lipstick if you are looking for that light pink color for your lips.</li>
      <li>I remember getting a Maybelline New York Superstay 14 hour lipstick, but the shade was not Perpetual Peony.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different on other people.</li>
      <li>Just for the record I am a light skin black women.  </li>
      <li>so when I reapplied it around noon and ate again at dinner which was 6, it completely stayed on &amp; I did not have to reapply for the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also leaves my lips very moist which is such a plus for me, and did not smudge into the glass for me.</li>
      <li>but I applied some lip balm underneath it and it simply gives me very sassy.</li>
      <li>These have to be my favorite collection of lipsticks; they will stay on for an extremely long time as long as you completely let it dry before needing to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it makes my lips soft and a natural baby pink.  </li>
      <li>But it is definitely not long lasting.</li>

<li> Not that long lasting</li>
<li> The only con is that it goes on really dry</li>
<li> it came on time and it stays on a long time.</li>
<li> the only Con. is that is TOOOO DRY !!</li>
<li> I was so excited to receive this lipstick in the mail, so I was extra disappointed to find that the product was less than stellar.</li>
<li> I must admit this lipstick is bit dry</li>
<li> I have a few of the same in different colors.</li>
<li> and I did not press hard when applying it just the normal way.</li>
<li> Extremely high quality, extremely goood price!!!! :0)</li>
<li> , I&#x27;d reccomend applying it earlier in the day so that by dinner time it will have completely dried &amp; will stay on while you eat (It takes about 5 hours to completely dry onto your lips).</li>
<li> Although it looks like a rosy pink in the tube, the Pink Peony was almost purplish in hue.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t believe that I ever received this one, and the one I did get was a baby pink, also</li>
<li> Just wrighting about the lipstick its not as pink as it looks.</li>
<li> It was like a lite pink.</li>
<li> but I was hopeing it was very pink.</li>
<li> So I had been looking around for a lighter shade lipstick in pink which could stay for little longer.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
<li> , so I just put on a Little Lip balm under and</li>
<li> however was a little lighter than it looked.  </li>
<li> But that lipstick is little darker for everyday use but nonetheless rocks on me.</li>
<li> but I guess thats the secret formula to make it last</li>
<li> and I guess that is secret behind making it long lasting</li>
<li> so I usually layer a little chapstick over it.</li>
<li> But could be just me hard to find lipsticks</li>
<li> This was disappointing, hard to use a broken in the tube lipstick,</li>
<li> Not happy at all!</li>

<ol>
    <li> I think the color is very bright, very suitable for my work, the use of good feeling mood!</li>
    <li> Nice . Not that long lasting</li>
    <li> I like the product, I chose the color Perpetual Peony N° 005, however was a little lighter than it looked.  In general is good quality, long lasting once applied.</li>
    <li> Soft, girly pink. Very drying so I usually layer a little chapstick over it. Does not last 14 hours for me. If worn without chapstick it lasts longer though it does start to fade with eating and drinking.</li>
    <li> stays on all day and the color is perfect, it also is a matte like lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT, will order again.</li>
    <li> Has a very strong sweet smell. I do not like my cosmetics to smell &amp; this one is very strong.  The color is as shown, so if you dont mind smelly lips you should be ok :)</li>
    <li> Ok, the color is great. But it is definitely not long lasting.</li>
    <li> the color was nice, but the first time I used it the lip stick broke in the tube and I did not press hard when applying it just the normal way. This was disappointing, hard to use a broken in the tube lipstick,</li>
    <li> These have to be my favorite collection of lipsticks; they will stay on for an extremely long time as long as you completely let it dry before needing to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wearing it to dinner, I&#x27;d reccomend applying it earlier in the day so that by dinner time it will have completely dried &amp; will stay on while you eat (It takes about 5 hours to completely dry onto your lips). I wore this on a day I had a dinner, then a party and I applied it in the morning but it came off during Lunch, so when I reapplied it around noon and ate again at dinner which was 6, it completely stayed on &amp; I did not have to reapply for the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves my lips very moist which is such a plus for me, and did not smudge into the glass for me.</li>
    <li> i have to mix it with a next color to get the shade i want</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife.  She says it doesn&#x27;t last at all, and breaks up on her lips.  Not happy at all!</li>
    <li> Just wrighting about the lipstick its not as pink as it looks. I don&#x27;t stay on the way I thought it would its ok but I was hopeing it was very pink. It was like a lite pink. It did not stay on like I thought it would. Ty</li>
    <li> I remember getting a Maybelline New York Superstay 14 hour lipstick, but the shade was not Perpetual Peony.  I don&#x27;t believe that I ever received this one, and the one I did get was a baby pink, also 14 hours, and it only lasts for about an hour on your lips.</li>
    <li> the color isnt as pretty and bright in the picture, it is a little more faded or pastel than that. i like it anyways though, its a pretty color. ither than that i liked it a lot. it came on time and it stays on a long time.</li>
    <li> I freakinnn loooove this color!! Extremely high quality, extremely goood price!!!! :0)</li>
    <li> LOVE THE COLOR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it doesn&#x27;t last 14 hours but it isn&#x27;t cheap it&#x27;s glossy Love the smell as well</li>
    <li> I have a few of the same in different colors. This was well priced &amp; shipped overnight! &amp;&amp; LOVE the product itself; it actually stays on  for quite a while (idk about 14 lol) but it does a lot better than others!</li>
    <li> I love this color, I don&#x27;t wear lipstick on a normal basis but this is really nice. It goes on bright and will stand out. I am olive/caramel tone color.</li>
    <li> So I had been experimenting with different shades to find the ideal everyday lipstick which I can wear for the office without looking too decked up. I was wearing Mac&#x27;s Daddy&#x27;s Girl Veronica lipstick for office before. But that lipstick is little darker for everyday use but nonetheless rocks on me. So I had been looking around for a lighter shade lipstick in pink which could stay for little longer.&lt;br /&gt;And I think I finally found it. It even goes perfectly with my Indian skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I must admit this lipstick is bit dry and I guess that is secret behind making it long lasting but I applied some lip balm underneath it and it simply gives me very sassy. effortless and beautiful look (atleast  that what I think).&lt;br /&gt;The low price cant be beat for this quality. It must by lipstick if you are looking for that light pink color for your lips.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this lipstick in the mail, so I was extra disappointed to find that the product was less than stellar. The lipstick, itself, belongs to the family of color stay lipsticks that dries your lips out and comes out very matte looking. Not a fan of the color either. Although it looks like a rosy pink in the tube, the Pink Peony was almost purplish in hue.</li>
    <li> doesnt stay on lips i recommend nars</li>
    <li> Wonderful and consistent color&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect that the first product I find constant fixed without putting so many layers on the lips 0</li>
    <li> Love the color. Stays on better than most lipsticks.</li>
    <li> This product is very good It Does Actually Last all the time you would want to wear it, the only Con. is that is TOOOO DRY !! but I guess thats the secret formula to make it last, so I just put on a Little Lip balm under and then a little lip gloss and that seems to be perfect.</li>
    <li> I use this lipstick a lot because i love the color and because it lasts long. After lunch i have to reapply it, but it&#x27;s a good option if you don&#x27;t have time/patient to apply those 24-hour lipsticks.</li>
    <li> This color is my favorite lip color - have been wearing it for several years -</li>
    <li> I realize color is difficult for products depicted on line, but I purchase nearly 95% of my products online and have had very good results with color. This was not even close. Additionally it doesnt make through an hour of my day. Its just lipstick after all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. But could be just me hard to find lipsticks I like I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different on other people.</li>
    <li> This lipstick stays on pretty long and I absolutely love the color.  The only con is that it goes on really dry but I simply use a gloss over it and it makes my lips soft and a natural baby pink.  It almost looks as if I was born with the color.  Just for the record I am a light skin black women.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
