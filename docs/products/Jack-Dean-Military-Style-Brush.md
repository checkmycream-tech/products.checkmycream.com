      <li>awesome brush, this is my first boar bristle brush, but i have yet to find any complaints with it.</li>

      <li>The brush is still a great product and does its job very well, evenly spreading out oils and keeping my beard healthy and happy.</li>
      <li>brush is perfect, but if you have a sensitive face it may take some getting used to.</li>
      <li>I have been looking at ALL the local stores for the perfect beard brush , one for work , truck, home .</li>
      <li>I love this brush and</li>
      <li>I love the way it styles.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this brush, why didn&#x27;t I get this sooner?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m bald on top but have a beard.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good grip.</li>
      <li>but I will for sure use this on my head and enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Makes hair easy to style using the brush alone...</li>
      <li>still going strong after lots of use</li>
      <li>(Yes, we do own several hair brushes, but they aren&#x27;t good for beards.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perfect size to fit in the hand , the bristles are spaced just right and strong enough but not painful .</li>
      <li>This was a Christmas gift for my husband and it has been a HUGE hit.</li>
      <li>This does the trick, with a comfortable feel.</li>
      <li>I use it for both my beard and hair it does a fantastic job on both.  </li>
      <li>I liked it so much I bought and additional one for my gym bag.</li>
      <li>Got this as a cheap brush for my beard and it works well.</li>
      <li>The bristles are coarse, as I expect a good brush should have and the indents on the side make it easy to hold and manipulate with your hand.</li>
      <li>On the downside it is a pain to clean and</li>
      <li>just right and this time it was !  </li>
      <li>my wife and duaghter leave it completely alone which is a nice side effect.</li>
      <li>and it has proved itself a worthy purchase.</li>
      <li>We are also now pregnant.</li>
      <li>The bristles are nice and stiff and the brush fits in the hand nicely with finger grooves on the edges.</li>
      <li>size is nice and compact and the ergonomics are good for such a basic design.</li>
      <li>my facial hair does it&#x27;s own thing, comb doesn&#x27;t help my beard.</li>
      <li>The $9.99 investment will be well worth it over the years with a brush as sturdy and resilient as this one.</li>
      <li>It might do all right with gel or hairspray.</li>
      <li>The right size and weight.</li>
      <li>It felt amazing when I brushed my beard for the first time.</li>
      <li>This is the third hair brush i have purchased recently and it is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Nice to be able to brush my hair without feeling ridiculous.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually bought 2 more to give as gifts to friends.</li>
      <li>Great for people with fully grown beards and thick hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this because, for the first time in my life, I grew a beard and needed something to brush it with.</li>
      <li>So, first girl who came over asked why I have a horse brush in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>Feels like it is built to last many years of service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brushes are exactly what I was searching for .</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>It works great on very short hair like mine where you are pushing the hair in the direction you want without really &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; it, for which you would want a regular plastic tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It really does help keep his beard looking smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d also point out that I don&#x27;t brush straight vertical up and down, but feel if you do a 30- 45 degree downward stroke towards your chin, it helps align your beard nicely, (could just be my face structure though).  </li>
      <li>but it is a nice little brush.</li>
      <li>It helps to tame my super wirey beard, and it feels nice (a little bit scratchy, in a good way) on your facial</li>
      <li>Maybe I am just immune to that, or have tougher skin, but I have not had an issue gently brushing my beard with this brush.  </li>
      <li>It was as advertised and it came fast.</li>
      <li>I does what it was made to do very well.</li>
      <li>From the moment I opened the box this brush has made growing and grooming my beard much easier.</li>
      <li>I have been using this brush for two weeks mainly to brush my beard hair</li>
      <li>Not saying this brush will help to knock up your old lady, but it will certainly help you get closer.</li>
      <li>This seems to work for me if you have a full thick beard it should be fine.</li>
      <li>I would recommend for a normal hair brush for men.</li>
      <li>and I got it a few days earlier than expected which is always great.</li>
      <li>The wood and solid construction sold me, and when it arrived it was exactly that.  </li>
      <li>WOW !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like the old school</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering the third real wood brush</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Appears to be good quality.  But, it is a bit smaller than I expected.  It seems small in my hand.  And, the bristles are a bit softer than I like.  But, I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my man beard and its the best i&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> My man is obsessed with his brush. It&#x27;s just like the old school one his dad has. It really does help keep his beard looking smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this brush as a Christmas gift. I was totally surprised as I suspected she would want me to chop off my beard and not help me to groom it properly. From the moment I opened the box this brush has made growing and grooming my beard much easier. The course bristles cut through tough and tangled beard hair with no problem. It makes my beard feel instantly softer. My wife now loves the beard and doesn&#x27;t want me to shave it. We are also now pregnant. Not saying this brush will help to knock up your old lady, but it will certainly help you get closer.</li>
    <li> Works great on my beard. Brushes out dead hairs, keeps beard tamed.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Got this as a cheap brush for my beard and it works well. The wood handle is great.</li>
    <li> still going strong after lots of use</li>
    <li> Excellent - just what I have been looking for. Quality construction - should last for years.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a denman brush that is plastic that looks a lot like this.  The wood and solid construction sold me, and when it arrived it was exactly that.  I love this brush and my wife and duaghter leave it completely alone which is a nice side effect.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! My husband loves it! He uses  it for his hair and his beard and he always looks so well groomed. The brush is very well made and looks like it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Best hair brush ever.</li>
    <li> awesome brush, this is my first boar bristle brush, but i have yet to find any complaints with it. yay</li>
    <li> Good brush. Very stiff bristles. Needed to be worked in but does its job.</li>
    <li> This type of brush is hard to find. Husband needed a replacement for his 20+ year old brush. Likes it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush to tame my beard, as well as keep my hair in line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not comb guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is perfect, but if you have a sensitive face it may take some getting used to.</li>
    <li> Best brush i have ever used.  I use it for both my beard and hair it does a fantastic job on both.  You really can&#x27;t beat the rough feel of this brush to cure beard itch.  This brush is not for the thin skinned.</li>
    <li> Great. This was a Christmas gift for my son.  He loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as a two in one solution for both my hair and beard. It works great on very short hair like mine where you are pushing the hair in the direction you want without really &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; it, for which you would want a regular plastic tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for longer than clipper length hair OR for a beard longer than a 9 on a shaver. For longer, thick beards it simply doesn&#x27;t have bristles long enough or stiff enough to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;The size is nice and compact and the ergonomics are good for such a basic design. On the downside it is a pain to clean and if the bristles get bent you will never straighten them out again.</li>
    <li> Quality grad and best out there at a great price</li>
    <li> Soft bristles may not be strong enough for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Bristles come out occasionally but overall holds up well.</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s bristles. It doesn&#x27;t smell. Pretty good grip. I don&#x27;t know what else to say. It&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
    <li> I have read some reviews about this brush irritating the face.  Maybe I am just immune to that, or have tougher skin, but I have not had an issue gently brushing my beard with this brush.  It does a great job helping to shape the beard by getting the snarls out and helps me distribute the conditioning oil that I use.</li>
    <li> A good quality brush for longer beards. I&#x27;d go for something a little less coarse for short and thinner beards. Great for people with fully grown beards and thick hair. It&#x27;s well built and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> So, first girl who came over asked why I have a horse brush in my bathroom. But she didn&#x27;t take it, so my problem is solved.</li>
    <li> I am honestly not sure how to review a brush. I bought this because, for the first time in my life, I grew a beard and needed something to brush it with. (Yes, we do own several hair brushes, but they aren&#x27;t good for beards.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would have to say this brush is very good if you want to brush your beard. It does keep it neat and looking sharp. The bristles are coarse, as I expect a good brush should have and the indents on the side make it easy to hold and manipulate with your hand.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my short hair in need of ocassional brushing. Bought two - one in my travel bag for use while away, and the other for daily home use. They&#x27;ve worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> The bristles are so closely spaced that the brush gets stuck in your hair if you use any sticky sort of product, like pomade, paste, or wax. It&#x27;s also relatively painful on the scalp. It might do all right with gel or hairspray. Personally, I threw the thing in the trash and bought a $3.99 comb.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for two weeks mainly to brush my beard hair and it has proved itself a worthy purchase. The brush is at a size and shape that I can grasp comfortably while its hard bristles allow me to tame my coarse beard hair with the help of beard oil. Out of the package, this brush looks and feels well made as I have yet to lose any bristles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush because it was a good price for a boars hair brush. I does what it was made to do very well. It is not as heavy as my old brush but it get&#x27;s the job done. I think it is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Perfect size.</li>
    <li> Use it on my beard every day. Has held up well and served its purpose.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush.  Maintains my beard like a champ.</li>
    <li> Great brush. I use it exclusively for my beard, which is very long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a comb/brush that does the job this one does.  I&#x27;m bald on top but have a beard.  I love the way it styles.</li>
    <li> Great product for my beard</li>
    <li> High quality wooden boar brush for my 15 year old son. Distribute hair&#x27;s natural oil. The right size and weight.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brush!&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 extras for travel and the gym bag. He says it&#x27;s a great size.</li>
    <li> This thing works great. It helps to tame my super wirey beard, and it feels nice (a little bit scratchy, in a good way) on your facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well on your head. Have not lost any bristles from this one. Feels like it is built to last many years of service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think any man with a beard needs to try this.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for my beard.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush, why didn&#x27;t I get this sooner?</li>
    <li> Got used to using this kind of brush in the Navy. The bristles are nice and stiff and the brush fits in the hand nicely with finger grooves on the edges.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever! It scratches out my head when I am tired.</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to brush my hair without feeling ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I wanted an inexpensive beard brush. This seems to work for me if you have a full thick beard it should be fine. The bristles seem solidly attached, a bit stiff so if your beard is light you might cry like a 12 year old girl. R. Lee Ermey would use this to brush out his chest hair is is so manly. I like it.</li>
    <li> This product does its job. It felt amazing when I brushed my beard for the first time. I have had it for about 3 weeks and it is still amazing!</li>
    <li> The brush is sturdy, has NOT lost 1 bristle after ~1 month of use (about 3 - 4 times per week), feels great on skin and can notice a difference after using the beard brush. I&#x27;d also point out that I don&#x27;t brush straight vertical up and down, but feel if you do a 30- 45 degree downward stroke towards your chin, it helps align your beard nicely, (could just be my face structure though).  I&#x27;m so impressed with this brush I&#x27;ve actually bought 2 more to give as gifts to friends. The $9.99 investment will be well worth it over the years with a brush as sturdy and resilient as this one.</li>
    <li> It was as advertised and it came fast. Great brush for beard. Have had it for a couple of weeks and only a couple of the bristles have fallen out. Good brush for the money</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed to find that the brush was largely black nylon bristles, with boars hair bristles added, but that is likely my own fault for not paying enough attention before purchase.  The brush is still a great product and does its job very well, evenly spreading out oils and keeping my beard healthy and happy.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I prefer a hair brush that rakes the scalp and tames hair between buzzcuts, old-school style. This does the trick, with a comfortable feel. It&#x27;s utility value cannot be overestimated. Get the brush. Now.</li>
    <li> WOW ! I have been looking at ALL the local stores for the perfect beard brush , one for work , truck, home . I took a chance on two of these sight unseen , the order came in Just TWO DAYS . The brushes are exactly what I was searching for . Perfect size to fit in the hand , the bristles are spaced just right and strong enough but not painful . I&#x27;m a picky person and like &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; just right and this time it was !  I&#x27;m ordering the third real wood brush just like my dad had when I was a kid now!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband and it has been a HUGE hit. He loves it and says it&#x27;s the best brush he has ever used.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my short/med fine hair..  Makes hair easy to style using the brush alone...</li>
    <li> This is the third hair brush i have purchased recently and it is by far the best.  The bristles do not shed.  It feels great on my scalp.  My hair stays in place with only a couple of brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brush. I liked it so much I bought and additional one for my gym bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use on my beard. It&#x27;s just a little too stiff to use on my face but as a brush to use on my  hair it is really good. I don&#x27;t know if they make it in different stiffness like , soft/ medium/ stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s not made for beards or maybe my face is just a little too sensitive but it is a nice little brush. Fits good in your hand and looks like it would be a brush for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep looking for a softer beard brush but I will for sure use this on my head and enjoy it. I would recommend for a normal hair brush for men.</li>
    <li> hope you don&#x27;t have a sensitive face because this brush is stiff! my facial hair does it&#x27;s own thing, comb doesn&#x27;t help my beard. Good quality brush though.</li>
    <li> Great product and I got it a few days earlier than expected which is always great.</li>
