      <li>This shampoo is great for flaky hair especially.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as good as Head &amp; Shoulders or anything that&#x27;s marketed directly at dandruff.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m worth it!  </li>
      <li>However it does clean well.  </li>

      <li>I purchased that same bottle before from my hair stylist and since it&#x27;s not the concentrate you need to use much more.  </li>

      <li>I have been using Eufora shampoo and their other products for 8 solid years and my hair has never been in better condition.</li>
      <li>I have been a consistent user of Eufora products for the last 3 years, and until now, I have exclusively purchased product through my salon which is an authorized Eufora retailer.</li>
      <li>I use the pure occasionally, it&#x27;s just to give my hair a change.  </li>
      <li>Since it is expensive, I sometimes alternate it with cheaper tea tree oil shampoo, but I am very glad I found this product!</li>
      <li>My hair goes frizz with anything that dries and strips the natural oils.</li>
      <li>I just spend an extra minute really working the shampoo into my hair and scalp and add a bit of water here and there to move it around.  </li>
      <li>This product is recommended for people with sensitive skin and/or scalp issues (me).</li>
      <li>Whichever version you buy, this stuff barely suds up</li>
      <li>I have normal hair (not too greasy and not too dry)</li>

    <li> This shampoo works very well on seborrheic dermatitis and is a natural alternative to chemical shampoos. It&#x27;s gentle and has a pleasant smell, and is a cruelty-free product! Since it is expensive, I sometimes alternate it with cheaper tea tree oil shampoo, but I am very glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and what I expected.</li>
    <li> Usually, I purchase Eufora Pure Cleanse at a salon; was not able to do this so I purchased this time on-line.  It still shampoos hair well but it is thicker than usual.  Do not know why it is thicker.  Do you?    Thank you,    Lena M. Howe</li>
    <li> Love the smell!! It really adds body to my thin hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. It looks and feels good all day. At a great price compared to salon prices.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for flaky hair especially.  We love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> This is a shampoo that I &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; use daily and it will not damage/dry out my hair.  I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.com .  It was shipped in &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; time.  And, I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My sister started using Eufora products so I looked into them for myself and bought Pure Cleanse. This product is recommended for people with sensitive skin and/or scalp issues (me). This shampoo has really improved my scalp, almost immediately. It&#x27;s all natural and is made up of majority aloe - how could it not be good for your hair and scalp?! It is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is my favourite shampoo:  it&#x27;s great for scalp health as well as colour and keratin treated hair.  It takes time for your hair and scalp to acclimate to if you&#x27;ve never used Eufora products.  I spent at least a month, maybe two miserable and hating the product because my scalp was oily and my strands dry.  After that period, everything acclimated and I won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
    <li> I use the pure occasionally, it&#x27;s just to give my hair a change.  Most used is the moisture cleanse and once in a while the urgent repair.  All the Efora products work great.</li>
    <li> Left hair lifeless and dull. So unimpressed.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great i live in the desert &amp; this shampoo keeps the moisture in your hair.highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product can use on hair an skin all eufora products r awesome I am a cosmetologist and have used many of the best products an  the hair repair is brilliant too</li>
    <li> love the shampoo but it is way over priced</li>
    <li> my hairdresser in pa had it, now I need it for Utah&#x27;s dry cold winters. makes my scalp so much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the premium shampoo brands and tried the drugstore brands that promise to be as good as premium (but never are).

There is no water and no parabens in this products--it is concentrated and lasts a long time. I was glad to see this on Amazon. Much better price than the salon price.</li>
    <li> I have been a consistent user of Eufora products for the last 3 years, and until now, I have exclusively purchased product through my salon which is an authorized Eufora retailer. When I discovered Eufora products online, I decided to give them try and now regret it. I did a simple side by side comparison of the Pure Cleanse shampoo - the first bottle from my salon and the second was the one purchased through Amazon. It was painfully obvious that the Amazon product was WATERED down. Needless to say. I will not purchase any more Eufora from Amazon. I learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> I have had scalp issues for years and this seems to soothe the scalp instead of irritate. Great product I would order it again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a lot of suds.  However it does clean well.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I like to use i once, even if I don&#x27;t get a lot of suds.  If you use twice, you get a lot more suds, but then it will be a little more &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;.  Strips more of the natural oils I think.  It is very gentle.  I have fairly fine hair.  Getting gray and a little more course.  My hair goes frizz with anything that dries and strips the natural oils.</li>
    <li> I have used Eufora products for many years, but my salon recently stopped carrying it, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  It IS pricey, but it does a great job on my hair and I&#x27;m worth it!  LOL</li>
    <li> This shampoo was just okay and way overpriced.  I was really disappointed.  My hair did not feel any different using this as it did using some cheap brand.  Just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It smells great, and even though it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t require a massive amount to get your hair clean! Great product.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo whenever I get my hair treated with keratin for smoothing and straightening.  The key to getting your keratin treated hair to last longer is to use a sulfate and paraben-free shampoo.  This does the job.  This particular bottle is the concentrate (no water added) so you only need a little otherwise you&#x27;re just wasting really expensive stuff.  I&#x27;ve seen another version of this shampoo on Amazon and it&#x27;s a larger bottle with a pump on it and that&#x27;s the non-concentrate version.  I purchased that same bottle before from my hair stylist and since it&#x27;s not the concentrate you need to use much more.  Whichever version you buy, this stuff barely suds up and I always feel as though I&#x27;m not using enough but that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to work.  If it was suds-ing up well, that would mean it had all the bad stuff in it that I&#x27;m trying to avoid, so I&#x27;ve had to get used to that.  I just spend an extra minute really working the shampoo into my hair and scalp and add a bit of water here and there to move it around.  Kind of a pain but given that it&#x27;s so expensive (cheaper on Amazon than at my salon) and I have to use it to prolong my keratin smoothing treatment, I put up with it.  It has a pleasant smell and it&#x27;s definitely good on my hair - lot&#x27;s of botanicals.  I have normal hair (not too greasy and not too dry) but I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is a smidge greasier when I use this stuff...probably because I&#x27;m not stripping my hair of all it&#x27;s natural oils with sulfates, parabens and other harsh chemicals.  It also helps to manage mild dandruff but it&#x27;s not as good as Head &amp; Shoulders or anything that&#x27;s marketed directly at dandruff.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I have oily hair, but have dry scalp and this helps to keep both under control.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo have been using for years. Received product timely.</li>
