      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years.  </li>
      <li>So glad to have found this online.  </li>

      <li>by the way I love the K-Pak Protect and Shine Serum.</li>
      <li>Best used on wet hair.  </li>
      <li>The product I have used for years is no longer available, so I was looking for something to take it&#x27;s place.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m familiar with it.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft and smooth!!</li>
      <li>The K-PAK really does bring shine, but more importantly helps tremendously with frizz.  </li>

      <li>They responded to my email right away, a plus, and said that they would send me a replacement right away....</li>

      <li>This is my first time ordering the product on line.</li>
      <li>because I personally have a bit of a love affair with silicones and esters, and I know companies use safe levels of everything in their products), but the truth goes a long way towards enlisting my trust and loyalty to a brand.</li>

      <li>Not the miracle I had hoped for, but this product has shown me more results than any other product I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For the benefit of those interested, here&#x27;s the complete ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will absolutely be buying this again - especially for humid summer months.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your hair with shine and no heavy or greasy build up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it and loved it for years - but am deducted 2 points simply because the ingredient list in here seems dishonest, listing only &amp;#34;Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Vitamin E&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>A few squirts and I am able to semi-dry or air dry my hair.  </li>
      <li>This product really worked with my thin, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have bushy, untamed, naturally wavy hair, and this is the ONLY product that I have found that controls and gives shine.  </li>

    <li> Totally satisfied! Will purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Kpax Serum is fantastic!  I have used it for years and was saddened when I couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  I like to combine it with \\&quot;Texturline\\&quot; by Artec, mixing a bit in the palm of my hand.  Honestly! THIS COMBO is what I call \\&quot;Hair style in a jar!\\&quot;  You can have \\&quot;ho hum\\&quot; hair that won&#x27;t do anything and the combo of these two just transforms the hair into a nice, attractive \\&quot;do.\\&quot;  If you color your hair, or process it in some other way, this serum will amaze you!  You can find other products out there, but none like this!</li>

No, no, no, no. Just no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the benefit of those interested, here&#x27;s the complete ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenyl Trimethicone, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Fragrance (Parfum), Aleurites Moluccana Seed Oil, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Hydroxycitronellal, Glycerin, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Thioctic Acid, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Allantoin, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Hydrolyzed Keratin (Quadramine Complex), Hydrolyzed Keratin PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycolipids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like it when companies try to hide ingredients.

    <li> My order came very quickly, the product was in perfect condition and the price was the cheapest on Amazon!! I would definetely order from this again!</li>
    <li> I read about this product in Good Housekeeping.  The product I have used for years is no longer available, so I was looking for something to take it&#x27;s place.  The K-PAK really does bring shine, but more importantly helps tremendously with frizz.  I really like this product and will continue to buy.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair heavy and feeling yucky ...I have other products I like better . Moroccan oil being one ...I will stick with that I guess.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair and this product allows me to wash and go on the days I want/need to, without the stress of &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; bad hair by lunch.  A few squirts and I am able to semi-dry or air dry my hair.  I will absolutely be buying this again - especially for humid summer months.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but felt this was something I needed to provide feedback on!</li>
    <li> I have very wavy hair, really helps smooth the frizz without making your hair greasy. I even use it between shampoos to freshen it up.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on damp hair or dry. Really great product.</li>
    <li> Not the miracle I had hoped for, but this product has shown me more results than any other product I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She loves it.  It does seem to work better than any other product on her waist length hair.</li>
    <li> I have medium to thin hair and it is to the middle of my back. I use this after I use Biolage shampoo and conditioner. I use two pumps and it covers all my hair. Does not weigh my hair down. My hair feels so soft and smooth!! I love this product :)</li>
    <li> This product really worked with my thin, fine hair.  Another one I bought made my hair heavy &amp; greasy.  This one makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> I received my K-Pak shine serum today and almost half of the bottle is missing. The top was wrapped neatly in plastic wrap and it still leaked out. I didn&#x27;t unwrap the package yet.  It is so messy! 1 star for this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/9/12 okay so I have spoken with OnLineBeauty via email. They responded to my email right away, a plus, and said that they would send me a replacement right away....hassale free and very courteous customer service! 5 star Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh by the way I love the K-Pak Protect and Shine Serum. I have used it in the past and was very pleased. This is my first time ordering the product on line.</li>
    <li> At this point, if I could rate this with no stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered why My box was wrapped in a plastic sack and placed on my door - because the whole box is covered in product inside and out!  They delivered a product that had leaked and placed it into a plastic wrap.  When I opened the box there is NOTHING LEFT IN THE BOTTLE!  All the product is soaked through the paperwork and box.  I am not happy and waiting for a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that I am not the only one that has had this problem - you think they&#x27;ll figure out how to package and ship?</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my stylist recommended it. It leaves your hair with shine and no heavy or greasy build up. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product and you really only need a little . This product is great !! Just a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. So I&#x27;m familiar with it. A little higher price than what I&#x27;ve paid in the past</li>
    <li> ended up giving it away, didn&#x27;t do the job for my hair;  natural coconut oil works better....better deal price wise</li>
    <li> effect was lower than what I expected. I am used to very goog results from that brand this one though wasn&#x27;t impressive.</li>
    <li> So glad to have found this online.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years.  I have bushy, untamed, naturally wavy hair, and this is the ONLY product that I have found that controls and gives shine.  Best used on wet hair.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
