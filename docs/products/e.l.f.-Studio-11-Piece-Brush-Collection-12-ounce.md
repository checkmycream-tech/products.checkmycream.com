<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received my brush kit today and it has in two angled foundation brushes instead of the angled brush and the blush brush..... sigh, I guess that will have to do. On the other hand, these are amazing brushes!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Better then Fash makeup brushes. Good for beginners makeup brushes users. Better bargain then buying them separately. Would recommend to buy them when they are less then $30 if your on a budget.</li>
    <li> it is not as good as I expect, the foundation brush for some reason is not as dense as giving me a full coverage.</li>
    <li> I had ordered the powder brush exactly like the one in this set from elsewhere, for half the price of this whole set, and loved it. When I saw this set I grabbed one up for me. I wear Sweet Face Minerals (not to be confused with Sweet Minerals) and some Bare Minerals. I use no liquid foundations at all. These brushes are perfect for mineral wearers. It&#x27;s got all the right brushes from foundation, blush, bronzer, eye shadow, eyeliner, highlighter to mineral veil. My extra powder brush has been cleaned several times and still feels just like new. The price on this kit is very reasonable and the case that holds the brushes is every bit as nice as the case that came with my $65.00 set from Sephora. These brushes are very well made and fit nicely in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 57yo and mineral makeup doesn&#x27;t sit in the creases and wrinkles like liquid foundation. It&#x27;s goof proof. It&#x27;s fast and easy to apply and your face looks natural and younger.  In addition, mineral wear is great for people with severe allergies because it&#x27;s all natural. Having the right brushes make a difference because cheaply made brushes shed, picks up too much product thereby wasting it and doesn&#x27;t apply evenly. plus they can be very scratchy. These brushes may be inexpensive but I&#x27;d put them up against my Sephora, Mac and Real Technique brushes any day of the week. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with mineral makeup and these brushes.  They&#x27;re great for travel but remember ladies, with mineral wear you rarely have to do touch-ups, especially if you use a primer over your moisturizer before applying your foundation and you used  well made brushes like these. If you do sweat just use a tissue and blot your face. You may see some product on the tissue but when you look in a mirror you won&#x27;t see any difference. I mist my face once after everything is applied and it helps to further set your makeup and give you that dewy look of youth.  I believe you can find the setting mist here on Amazon as well. It&#x27;s not necessary, but I live in Florida (mad humidity) and I like it. Mineral makeup never looks caked on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took out the liquid foundation brush and gave  it to my cousin because she wears liquid foundation and put my extra powder brush in it&#x27;s place. Now I&#x27;ve the perfect set. You can use the liquid foundation brush with minerals, great for sculpting your cheek bones. Just a personal preference of mine to not use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to cleaning, there are many products that spray on to clean and sanitize your brushes between monthly deep cleaning right here on Amazon.  Please remember to look on U-Tube for monthly deep cleaning techniques if you&#x27;re not sure how to do it. When cleaning your brushes  with spray on cleaner, wipe  brush on a paper towel or soft cloth from side to side, never swirl or buff as that could damage any brush during cleaning. You can swirl and buff when applying makeup all you want but the brush needs to be dry (With the spray cleaner they dry right away) . When deep cleaning make sure to lay your brush sideways to dry. I gently squeeze out  the extra water, fold a hand towel twice, make sure I&#x27;ve put brush back in original shape and lay the brush on its side on top of the folded hand towel with brush part hanging over but not touching the counter. As long as you take care of your brushes they&#x27;ll take care of you.  I usually do the deep cleaning in the evening so they&#x27;re ready for the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I went into a great deal of detail but I find when I&#x27;m shopping for something it helps to know as much as I can and to fully understand how to use what I bought.  Had I known what  I&#x27;ve just shared I wouldn&#x27;t own so many brushes, I would have just bought this kit. Hope this helps. Very fast shipping. I received before estimated date of arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The price of one Mac or Sephora brush can be more than this whole set. I&#x27;m not knocking those brushes, just saying, when you&#x27;re on a budget why pay more.essary, but I live in Florida (mad humidity) and I like it.

    <li> very smooth and good quality products. Easy to clean off the colours and reuse and it feels good on the skin. Will definitely recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing these brushes..and what I read was that these brushes were pretty good..but I completely disagree. I thought they were going to do a  decent job at leaving the product of makeup on the face. but they are just okay...if you want brushes don&#x27;t buy these.Invest your money elsewhere..</li>
    <li> Came very quickly and love the case!</li>
    <li> The product is good. But, I was disappointed when I received my package because this set was suppose to carry a powder brush (flat top style) instead they had packaged 2 foundation brush. I would have returned it and asked for a replacement. But, this was a Christmas gift and had no time to return it. I was disappointed!</li>
    <li> Good price but as far as cheap makeup brushes go , I prefer real techniques or costal scents forsure</li>
    <li> There were a few too many small brushes. But the price was good and the other brushes I use a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic set for the price! I&#x27;ve owned E.l.f. brushes before and have found that they are committed to quality at an affordable price. This was actually a gift for a friend which she loved. I own the same brushes (but bought them individually) and even though they are cheap, the set offers even more savings. I wish it came with a spoolie brush, though, to tame eyebrows. It&#x27;s got the brushes necessary for applying concealer,  contouring and highlighting your face, filling in your eyebows (with powder), and applying (also smudging) eyeshadow/liner. She really appreciates the bag, too, to keep her brushes organized. They are very soft on the skin, lightweight, and comfortable to hold. HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great and very useful.&lt;br /&gt;I love the softness of these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I am concerned about is the case.&lt;br /&gt;Because just right after I took off the plastic packaging of this product, there were a strong smell of plastic coming from the case.&lt;br /&gt;I have exposed the case in my garage for a day and the smell is going away.&lt;br /&gt;But the smell was still too unpleasant in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;Other than this problem, everything else is great.</li>
    <li> Okey, lets get something straight. This is not professional.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it fits for anyone who is just starting in the make up world. The brushes are very soft, they do not shade, and they are strong and resistant. They are lovely for doing smokey eyes and they fit my everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;They came in time, the package was perfect, nothing broken and very well protected.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recomend it.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of new brushes, and saw that ELF had this very affordable set.  Having good experiences with other ELF products, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  The pros are that the brushes are very soft and pick up a good amount of product (most of them).  The cons: the set comes in an extremely cheap plastic case, the concealer brush is a little on the short side, and the blush brush doesn&#x27;t pick up as much blush as I would like it to.  However, the complexion brush and powder brush are great.  For the price, this set is pretty high quality and very useful. Plus, you can always change out the plastic casing (which I did). I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> i love these. I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to feel so soft and so sturdy and so nice for such a low price. I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> If you starting out in make up i will definitely recommend these brushes.Its affordable you get variety.A sleek case for traveling.You just cant go wrong with this purchase.I gave it 4 stars because i have sensitive skin and they are a bit rough on the skin.</li>
    <li> good brushes, but I got 2 contour brush, it took the eyeshadow brush C, I had to buy separately. I heartily recommend this product but em like I had sent that I needed</li>
    <li> The brushes are beautiful and I love the number of them for the price but they break very easily. The handles have become loose on nearly all of them but I love the shapes of them so much that I deal with it.</li>
    <li> bought these for my daughter for christmas at her request..they seem to be a good brand and have served their purpose..thank you</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.. they are very affordable for the quality that you receive. Minimal shedding unlike several other sets i&#x27;ve had. I read a few other reviews where there brushes were stiff or loose- I have not had that issue with any elf brush yet. However, for the price it&#x27;s not a big deal in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that anyone interested in buying this set- check out their website!! I got my set for $2 when they had a promo going on.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! They are such a wonderful texture. I usually use MAC brushes to apply my cosmetic products but someone told me about these and I decided to give them a try since the whole case cost less than one of my MAC foundation brushes alone. This is such a great buy. I&#x27;m happy with them! They are such quality brushes!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great and for this price even better. I really love them they&#x27;re good quality and the packaging is great for traveling. Don&#x27;t regret this purchase :)</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and I love how they are labeled with an identifier saying what brush it it. Great buy and good for a beginner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting out in the make-up world and I thought this would be a good starter set. After about 2 weeks of using the brushes 2 of the heads came off, I just glued them back together no big deal really but, I was hoping they would&#x27;ve been a little more durable for a while. I know ya get what you pay for. They actually hold product well and dispense evenly. I do like the set very much though just wish I didn&#x27;t have to fix them so soon.</li>
    <li> I definitely am pleased with this brush set. There&#x27;s a brush for just about every makeup application.  I haven&#x27;t used them all as yet, but my favorite so far is the flat top powder brush which I use to apply my liquid foundation.  That brush is so dense yet soft and excellent for buffing in product.</li>
    <li> After several months of having this set, all of the large brushes have fallen apart (the bases from the brush heads). Cheap construction.</li>
    <li> Awesome top quality, soft brushes! I&#x27;ve been using them for about 6 mos now and still in perfect condition. Get even softer after a wash. The case is also handy for daily organization &amp; travel!</li>
    <li> I love this set of brushes. I think they really great for a beginner, like me and they feel soft on your skin. Also, they delivered quite fast. Only took like 3 days and I chose the super saver free shipping.</li>
    <li> This brush kit has got everything a person could need at a great price.</li>
    <li> I got this item as a Christmas gift for my sister. She loved it. It was exactly what she wanted. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Some of the best brushes I have ever owned. They work amazing and are super soft! I Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> This product works for me. I use it every day... even my friends come over for me to do their makeup now..</li>
    <li> this is the best deal for makeup brushes without getting crap quality. the line elf makes that is cheaper really stinks and falls apart but these brushes are so soft, easy to clean, and dont fall apart. i have had it for about a year and they still look brand new and the case is handy also.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set!  Much more reasonable than Sephora, Mac, etc. products.  And the quality is great!  I would recommend this brush collection.</li>
    <li> These are good quality, I&#x27;m always surprised when it comes to e.l.f. products.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. They&#x27;re affordable and do the job. Very soft with synthetic hair, which is a plus. I wish it came with the stippling brush.</li>
    <li> excellent very happy with the product really recommend it 100% excellent quality and 100% original brand really excellent very good product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these after rcving a gift card, some of the brushes I really like and some...not soo much...I use the giant powder brush to put on foundation and I like it because it&#x27;s flat accross the top and absorbent so you don&#x27;t end up with cake face, worked better than the beauty blender sponge.</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of the quality and affordability of e.l.f. studio line brushes for a while now. I am very happy with this set for the price. While I really do wish it came with the stipple brush, it is still a very nice set for the price. You will not find better quality for such a low price.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with my purchase of these brushes. They work very well and are of great quality. Great bang for your buck,.</li>
    <li> This set is a great starter set. The quality is good and you get pretty much any brush you would need. I like the fact that each brush is labeled and it also comes with a little cheat sheet that explains each brush and what it does. The case is also great for when you need to travel or just want to store them away in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell that other reviewers mentioned is definitely there. When I first opened the box I wanted to check out the brushes but I wasn&#x27;t able to. The smell was so strong that I ended up getting a headache. After airing them out for a day or two the smell disappeared though.</li>
    <li> I really love this brushes, they&#x27;re what I was looking for. Good quality and excellent price. I wouldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected, good quality.</li>
    <li> They are  not &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; brushes, but they are ok for my purposes...  This kit has the most usefull brushes, at least the most necessary brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review in November 2013. I purchased these products in February of 2012, so well over a year ago. Before this I never used brushes, always a user of fingers and sponges haha. So I basically bought these as a beginner. These brushes are still perfectly in tact. I have zero problem with shedding. They wash clean very easily. I love the eyeshadow c brush. Applies the color beautifully and precisely. All of the brushes are great especially for a cheap price. And perfect for someone who is just beginning to start a brush collection. As I said, I had NONE and have continuously added to this elf collection, but these brushes are still my everyday core brushes. Definitely recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> I simply love this brush set !!!!!! Its very cheap as in cost but very high quality :D Thanks so much , i really did appreciate the little tag note saying : &amp;#34;thank you :) &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I really do recommend you to buy this set if you&#x27;re a make-up lover like me or you&#x27;re just a beginner ... its cheap &amp; Very Good Quality !!! :D</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my Mom. She has mentioned numerous times that she loves them, and these are now her favorite brushes. I have the e.l.f brushes that aren&#x27;t the studio version, and I am happy with them but I am tempted to get myself these brushes too since my Mom likes hers so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with my set is that the tops don&#x27;t stay on the handle so I am looking to get new brushes. My mom says that her brushes don&#x27;t do that. Also, she says that the so far none of the brushes have left stray brush hairs on her face.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed, the handle does not come off when washed, it feels sturdy, and it&#x27;s definitely worth paying for if you are on a budget.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Only thing is that the bottom piece separates sometime but crazy glue will have it working again.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes and use them every day. the stipple brush is alone worth the cost of the set, and the case is very nice. the only brush i&#x27;m not super fond of is the foundation brush, i prefer my sephora professionals round one.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re definitely unlike Mac brushes but they&#x27;re are good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Thursday, it got shipped Friday &amp; I just received this in the mail today. So of course, item came earlier than expected &amp; I&#x27;m very happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brushes, I do own  2 single e.l.f. studio brushes (flat power brush &amp; contour brush) &amp; I love them both. But I bought this set because I didn&#x27;t want to have to go back into Target &amp; buy the brushes that I don&#x27;t have yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a beginner in makeup, I&#x27;m just a brush hoarder lol. But I do definitely recommend this set to beginners. Great brushes at an amazing price! I&#x27;ll add a picture of the set soon so you can get a good look at it :)</li>
    <li> Tthese brushes are fantastic and cheap compared to brand name brushes, makeup comes up great with this brushes, though they should incliude the angle eye shadow brush in this set instead of the fan brush so you will have all the needed brushes for a great makeup, yet as it is is great.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! I bought for my daughter for Christmas and she approved! That says a lot!  I liked that it told what each brush was used for.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use these brushes almost everyday. I have previous brushes from Bare minerals and Lancome that I like but this price was much better. I have washed these a couple times already and they dry well overnight. I love the case as well. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love the brush heads. Bristles stay in place even after a few washes. 1 week after use, my first brush head detached from wooden handle. Since then, about 4-5 of my brushes that I use everyday have completely detached. Great buy if you dont mind constantly super gluing the heads back to the handle. For this price, they should be manufactured better.</li>
    <li> works well no problems&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean and the case is easy to fold and store&lt;br /&gt;definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> The price is attactive for the variety of brushes that you get.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes do not shed.&lt;br /&gt;The blush brush doesn&#x27;t hold blush as well as my old one...&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good purchase</li>
    <li> My Mary Kay brushes were in bad shape. I bought this set and the stippling brushes from E.L.F. at half off on sale. Yesterday the brushes arrived the smell was weird so I cleaned the brushes like I do all my synthetic brushes with a specialized brush cleaner. The angled brush came bent and no amount of rebending would shape it back. Then three of the handles broke off from the brushes....I did not get the handles wet I know better. The brushes are not dense at all. Honestly I have better brushes from the dollar store. Save yourself the $ and invest in anything else. One the bright sided they did not shed!</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these to replace my set of BareMinerals brushes which were old, rough, and not-to-mention expensive! I ordered these not expecting much, but am pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost 3 months of daily use and they&#x27;re still soft as ever! I use a tea tree oil/alcohol mixture to disinfect daily and a makeup brush shampoo once a month. These brushes have held up great so far and I think they will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten pretty into makeup and I decided I needed better brushes than the cheap kit I bought at Target. I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about 6 months and they are fabulous. They pickup the makeup well and I&#x27;ve had no shedding. They&#x27;re fairly cheap but highly effective. I&#x27;ve been following a bunch of beauty gurus on YouTube for a while and they all swear by more higher end brushes, but I found one YouTuber who recommended these brushes and gosh, I&#x27;m glad I tried them out. The case is also nice for travel.</li>
    <li> This is so great. I have been looking for a decent brush collection &amp; expecting to pay MUCH more for it. These are perfect - just the right range of options &amp; enough quality that I know they&#x27;ll last long enough I won&#x27;t be upset. I could&#x27;ve paid 5x&#x27;s as much and had a product that would last maybe 2 years instead of over a year, but these are worth buying again in a year if necessary.</li>
    <li> Good quality of brush set from drugstore. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> the brushes are very good, sturdy and soft. I definitely recommend them . if you want a set of brushes for a reasonable price , then this is the set for you.</li>
    <li> Was Christmas gift and the recipient really like it.  Says the variety was good and the quality was good too.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. I highly recommend purchasing from Pure Sun. I received my purchase with tons of other e.l.f goodies because my purchase took a little longer to ship out to me than it was expected. They have great customer service and a kind heart. God bless them! ❤</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes!  They perform at a level far above their purchase price. Each brush is individually labelled, so it&#x27;s a no brainer to figure out what brush to use for what!  I&#x27;ve had a \\&quot;few\\&quot;  expensive brushes in my time and these can compare  (in quality and price) to far more expensive brands!  So save your money and purchase these instead!</li>
    <li> These are the first makeup brushes I&#x27;ve owned. I previously used whatever applicator came with my makeup. I&#x27;ve been using these for a few weeks now and they&#x27;re working great. The brushes are soft, pick up product well, and seem solidly constructed. The case is decent too. Enough brushes are included that I haven&#x27;t even used them all. My makeup looks better than it used to and I&#x27;m glad I switched. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me? Only 6 out of the promised &amp;#34;11 Piece Brush Collection&amp;#34;!!! This is just ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set; most of the sets that are decent in price are split into either eye makeup brushes or face makeup brushes, this set includes both and all of the brushes are good quality - I haven&#x27;t had any brush &#x27;shedding&#x27; problems after use or cleaning either. The case the set comes in is made of a soft material and the brushes are held in place in their own slots with elastic; I prefer storing brushes in their own case rather than one of those open top brush holders that one keeps on the bathroom counter - the case is easy to bring when traveling, keeps stuff from getting onto brushes, and I dislike having cluttered bathroom counters anyway.</li>
    <li> After looking into buying a very expensive ($250) Sephora set I am glad I decided to check other options on Amazon. I found this set. It is perfect for me. Love it!</li>
    <li> Too cheap.  I bought it, used it once and then decided to spend a bit more on real supplies.  It looks and feels cheap to me.  Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  But- if this is for a teenager- they probably wouldn&#x27;t mind the lesser quality.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about my make up brushed.  I have M.A.C. and Chanel brushes, but these are just as good and hold up just as long.  I have e.l.f. brushes for everyday, too.  Just needed some quality makeup brushes to take on vacation that were not make for a child.  These are shorter in length, but the bristles are as fluffy and nice as my good everyday brushes.  Great price, Great Brushes, Bonus case.</li>
    <li> I got this brush set for$3.50 during a promotion from E.L.F. website.They were practically giving them away with any $25+ purchase so I expected throw away quality.Brush case is ugly cheap looking and stinky but brushes are excellent-soft, versatile,no shedding at all. Love them all and recommend this set to anyone who can not afford Sigma or MAC.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Nice and soft! Great value.</li>
    <li> The brushes are perfect and looks exact as the picture!!! The service was also great! I just can&#x27;t complain ..</li>
    <li> I was in need of more makeup brushes but didn&#x27;t want to buy separate and expensive ones. So I researched these against the other brands and took the chance. They aren&#x27;t the cheapest available on Amazon but I watched a YouTube review and the girls said they were soft. They came about a week after ordering, case had bubble wrap and plastic wrap around it, showing it was new and unused. The others reviews talked about paint smell and yes! There was a strong scent but I washed the brushes and noticed it was the travel case it came with. Although with the price and how soft they are I can ignore this until it goes away. The reason why I love this product is because the brushes really are soft, I have sensitive skin, rosacea, so these really help with packing makeup on. My other brushes are from target so I haven&#x27;t known of any other soft ones, I do have a Sephora blending powder brush but it is too rough for my skin but so far these are my favorite brushes. I also like how many brushes it came with for the price and with a case. I like the variety, the color and they aren&#x27;t too long. The case also has room for more brushes to hold which is a plus, the brushes are labeled, came with brush cases to keep in shape and it came with a manual on which brushes are for what. I kinda wish I paid a little more for the 18 set but the only negative is the smell. I would recommend this product for anyone.</li>
    <li> Great value for money $30 for 11 brushes which is awsome. Some of the brushes I would say are on par with sigma brushes especially the powder brush and some of the eyeshadow brushes. However, some of the brushes I would never use and are quite stiff and wouldn&#x27;t give you a flawless finish. Overall, quite content with the brushes and I would recommend them to those wishing to invest in cheap okay quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes for a great price. The price had me worried but after using them for two months I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> The product just arrived. The 11 brushes seem decent enough, but there was no case whatsoever! Buyer beware - if you want a case, this is not the product for you!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes hesistant after reading the reviews. They were very mixed however when my product arrived I was pleased with the result especially since I didn&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg. I washed the brushes as instructed and once they dried there was no fall out of the bristles and the brushes stayed intact. I&#x27;ve been using the brushes for about a month now and still no fall out. They are very good quality and this package gave a perfect variety. I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> These are the softest brushes I have ever used!! No funny smell! The bristles do not break and not left all over your face!! So many brushes for so cheap!!! Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> This I thought was a bad purchase, I was wrong it is very nice and my daughter loves it, so I guess Mama did good. Got here on time and I would buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this brush set! It is the Perfect collection of all the shapes and sizes you should ever need!</li>
    <li> Its high quality and makes my morning routine (putting on makeup) fun!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are long enough and the brush itself is great quality. You are definitely getting your moneys worth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while but my brush set is still kicking. The fan brush head separated from the handle but I hardly used it. I treat my brushes roughly and this was up to the task. Loving it.</li>
    <li> Great brushes!  Ordered my first set from target, then found them cheaper here.  I love the variety and how well they work.</li>
    <li> I have had around half a year to use and review this brush set. I am absolutely in love with it. Trying to find an affordable brush collection that has everything you need is challenging enough, and add to that task, finding a cruelty free set. This set is everything I was looking for, and more. Synthetic bristles [from a cruelty free company as well], affordable, and a brush for almost every need. This set is great for travel, and can easily fit the needs of any makeup enthusiast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleek black design of these brushes makes this set look like it should cost 3x more than what you pay for it. The bristles are synthetic, and super soft, and the brush handle length is perfect for every day use. After several cleanings, I still have not had any bristle fall out. The set comes in a black case that is easy to wipe clean, and is about the size of a normal book, so it will easily fit in a purse or bag for on the go use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a more comprehensive look at what the set includes, check the actual e.l.f. website. They have detailed descriptions of each brush, so you can see exactly what you will be getting.</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes!  Great starter brushes! I even went out and purchased the E.L.F. stipple brushes as well!  I&#x27;m not a fan of the fan brush but I&#x27;m sure I can find another use for it!  Definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap high quality brush set! ;)</li>
