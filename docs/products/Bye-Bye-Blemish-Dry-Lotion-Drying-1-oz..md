<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Im a 30-something with pale (dare I say see-thru)skin. When I get a blemish, it is totally noticeable and quite annoying/embarrassing--I mean come on! Wrinkles AND Pimples?!? I digress. I grabbed bye bye blemish at an online drug store about 4 years ago when I was suffering thru a particularly bad outbreak. It works like a charm. There is a trick to it though. You will be immediately tempted to shake the bottle to incorporate the pink goo at the bottom &amp; the clear liquid on top. Do not shake it like a polaroid picture! When you receive this, you won&#x27;t even be able to use it for a day, because the shipping will have shaken it. Just let it sit out &amp; I assure you, the product will correct itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;Before I head to bed, I cleanse my skin thoroughly and apply any serum/moisturizers Im using at the time. I dip a q-tip into water and clean off any spots I want to treat with BBB. Take a new q tip &amp; dip it into the pink gooey sediment at the bottom of the bottle &amp; dot the zits. (Make sure to use a new q tip for every dip!) Then I will set my hair dryer to super low to dry my face, otherwise, you might end up with a pink pillow. When you wake up, if the offender isnt completely gone, it is greatly diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give it an A+. I only recently ran out of my bottle, so it is really a great cost effective way to deal with nasty breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lazy Girl Tips:&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t wear this out in public during the day. Dont try-you will look like a nutball. It basically looks like little dots of Calamine Lotion all over your face. Not sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too much is really too much. It will dry your face out in sensitive areas with excessive use, so just keep it to the once nightly application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will inevitably forget you have this on and your husband will look at you like you are an alien the first time you use it. Best to prepare a snappy comeback before exiting the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have been plagued by pimples for years.  Washing, spot treatments, exfoliating, never worked till I tried this.  The instant you see a pimple forming, dab this on and it&#x27;s gone the next day.  Why suffer?  Get this stuff, it really works.</li>
    <li> I use before bedtime just dabbing on any pimples as needed with a q-tip and It works wonderfully. It will be a little drying. I use a fantastic skin cream called collagen recovery cream by new dermagentics that works well to clear up dry skin and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product last May 23. I was so excited when i got this item because I&#x27;ve read a lot of good comments on this product but sad to say, It darkened my face instead of eliminating my pimples and some blemishes on my face! It&#x27;s a waste of money! Really!</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well!! I have been using it for years and swear by it. It works great on small and large pimples. You must try it !</li>
    <li> This may work for some people, but it did not work for me. I wanted to use it for the occasional large, resistant blemish. I followed the instructions carefully, but this product had no discernable effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bye Bye Blemish for years, and finally I found it on Amazon! Great price, fast shipping, wonderful experience! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is essentially calamine lotion with sulfur added.  They have also added tons of alcohol, which makes it dry out your skin further.  For those of you that have found that Bye Bye Blemish dries out your skin too much, you can achieve better results using plain calamine lotion every night and applying a sulfur mask (such as the one by Acne Free or Proactiv) 2 or 3 nights per week.  That way you won&#x27;t have to deal with the excessive drying effects of too much sulfur and added alcohol.  Overall, Bye Bye Blemish is a decent product, but it&#x27;s not something to be applied to your whole face nor should it be used everyday if you have dry or combination skin. It seems that it might work well for someone with oily skin, but I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
    <li> For the last two years I&#x27;ve had horrible breakouts.  The kind that starts with one zit and then ten million form right around it.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products with minimal results.  I was looking for something in Ulta when I ran across Bye, Bye Blemish.  I had never heard of it before but for only $10 I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.      All you need to do is take a Q-tip and dab it into the bottom of the bottle.  Then dab the pink residue on your break out.  At first my skin did dry out some like the packaging warned and I used moisturizer.  Over time, my skin must have gotten used to the product because my skin is not dry now.    While Bye, Bye Blemish doesn&#x27;t work (for me) as quickly as the box says it will, but it does work.  It shortens the life span of my break outs and seems to help keep new ones at bay.  A new zit may last only three days before it dries out.  I will definitely be buying more of Bye, Bye Blemish.      There are only two downfall downfalls to this product, which are minor in my opinion.  One is that the product stinks because Sulfur is the active ingredient.  I can deal with that though.  The other is that you can&#x27;t put this on under or over make up and go out because the product is pink.  It looks like you&#x27;re wearing calamine lotion or pepto-bismol on your face.  My mom saw it on me and called it my \\&quot;war paint\\&quot;.  This is a definite night only/stay at home treatment.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  It is drying so you may have to go easy with it if you have dry skin.  My skin is oily, so no problems with over drying.  You can spend more money on the high end stuff but my advice would be to try this first and save your money.</li>
    <li> I have occasional adult acne \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; and usually have pretty dry skin otherwise. Using most acne medication dries my skin out, doesn&#x27;t really &#x27;kill&#x27; the pimples and basically makes my face flake. Yeah, not attractive.  I decided to give this product a try, since I wanted to avoid salicylic acid.  I remembered how soft and gorgeous my skin was after bathing in natural sulfur springs...  The product comes in a small glass bottle with heavy pink sediment on the bottom and clear liquid above. You dip a q-tip into the sediment and apply pink stuff to your problem areas. It dries pretty quickly, within 5 min.  The only drawbacks are the (1)sulfuric smell (very mild) and (2)powdery residue it leaves on the sheets at night. It is a night-time only product in my book, since it is pink, very visible and smells a bit.  Other than that, this product works very well to dry out break-outs and make skin soft and it appears to be very gentle. I have had no flaking of the skin, redness, irritation or dryness.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this. No more drying, burning salicylic acid for me.</li>
    <li> this was for my granddaughter.  She is using it and it is helping with blemishes</li>
    <li> This works really well for me. I feel like basically what it does is dries my skin out and that makes my acne go away, but it doesn&#x27;t get too dry. I don&#x27;t think my skin is oily or dry, it seems just right, but the next morning I can see that if I had some acne it looks dry, but my face looks great after I put on my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get it you will see that there is like a beige paste in the bottle but then there is also like a clear watery substance in the bottle as well. The first time I got this the person that gave it to me told me if it runs out of the clear stuff put rubbing alcohol in it, well I spilt it of course and added rubbing alcohol and it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I want to mention, this is really not a lotion in my opinion. It is definitely different... but I don&#x27;t know how to explain what it is like, possibly like calamine lotion? I think that is what it is called. You have to use a Q-tip to apply; you are not supposed to shake the bottle.</li>
    <li> It blends well with my skin color and I think it&#x27;s really helping with breakouts. It has a camphor smell. Some people wouldn&#x27;t like that, but I think it smells good.</li>
    <li> Okay product, I haven&#x27;t seen amazing results</li>
    <li> Instead of getting a concentrated amount from the bottom of the bottle, with a Q-tip, I prefer to shake it and apply a thin layer all over my face. It isn&#x27;t too drying for me. It leaves a very fine, powdery-dry surface. It&#x27;s pinkish-white, so for going out, I finish with some flesh-toned mineral powder. Sulfur is one of the best topical treatments for acne that I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m allergic to internal sulfur antibiotics, like Sulfa, but the topicals are great for me.</li>
    <li> I have been a Licensed Practical Nurse for almost 20 years, as well as suffered the juvenile and occasional adult acne problems. I came across Bye Bye Blemish by accident. I have tried the usual products with Salicyclic acid and Benzoyl Peroxide, both of which are drying, create redness, and take forever it seems to treat acne. Normally, in my experience they make the problem much worse before better. Bye Bye Blemish is made with Sulfur. It has a pink sediment at the bottom of the bottle and an alcohol mixture at the top. You DO NOT want to shake the bottle and mix it EVER!! Wash your face with a gentle cleansing soap, such as Cetaphil (another wonderful product!) or even DOVE soap (very gentle on the skin...and non-drying!) Both, recommended by my personal dermatologist as well. Next, take a q-tip and place into the bottom of the Bye Bye Blemish bottle, ensuring you get the pink sediment on the q-tip and place on the pimple. you want to do this as soon as you notice a red area, soreness, etc. before you get a whitehead if possible. If so, the Bye Bye Blemish will work that much faster! Also, if you use it before getting a whitehead, the pimple will not get as sore and come to a head at all! It will simply dry up over the next 24 to 48 hours and go away!! Another key to keeping the skin clear is using a good moisturizer, such as Oil of Olay. Even if your skin appears to be oily, it may actually be dry! A good moisturizer will help balance the skin&#x27;s PH level and maintain a nice, smooth, young looking appearance! If your Bye Bye blemish bottle begins to run low on the clear top and still has plenty of pink sediment, I add some alcohol and continue to use it until the sediment is gone. It still proves to be as effective for me. This is the best product I have ever used for acne and it does work! I have recommended it to hundreds of people during my years of nursing. i have no problems telling people what products work and which ones don&#x27;t! Trust me, this will be the best money you have ever spent on an acne product!est money you have ever spent on an acne product!</li>
    <li> ...to clear up a blemish!  It is pink when put on the blemish, so it is a lotion one would want to use at nighttime when they will be going to bed.  Who wants to walk around in the day time with pink dots on their face?!  But, it sure does work well!</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using it for about a month now and at first I thought I saw some clearing up but I don&#x27;t see that anymore.....Not sure about this product :(</li>
    <li> This product worked ok for me.  I have Severe nodular acne on one side of my  face and when I put the product on it did shrink the size of the pimple but nothing dramatic.  when I would get a pimple on my neck area I will put the product on it at night and the next morning it will still be there.  So it helped on my face but not on my neck.....weird!  I think this product might work on people that get the occasional pimple.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this product online.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using all the time or anywhere near mouth or eyes, but great for spot treatment.</li>
    <li> I think it works on me I have a plan to go another country, so I even bought two  !! This is must item for me</li>
    <li> Over all a good product, smells kind of funny but does bring a pimple to surface rather quickly and helps heal faster. With that I guess that means it does it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;ve already recommended to friends. I have isolated pimples here and there and this works great for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like I thought it would. It&#x27;s not really clearing up my acne. Kind of saddens me, because I thought this was the solution to my acne problems...</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all for me,everyone makes it seam like it can work magic but the truth is it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 and have had acne since I was 14. I have tried everything under the sun. I stear clear of benzoyl peroxide products like proactive as I have sensitive skin and ruined countless sheets towels and shirts. I tried this when I was searching for a sulfur mask (I was using DDFs) and thought that this product was better priced than the other similar surfer lotions at 3x the price.  24 hours later the deep painful pimples were smaller and didn&#x27;t hurt. The next day the blackheads were gone. Third day I only had tiny whiteheads left. I got greedy and tried to get rid of those and woke up with dry skin. I over did it. Works great on almost all my pimples but the tiny ones were unphased. The clear liquid goes faster than the sediment but there are some good suggestions to consider in the other reviews worth trying.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but I was kind of disappointed after all the hype I&#x27;d heard about this product.  The first time I used Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Advantage Acne Spot Treatment, my pimples went away almost overnight; this stuff has improved my acne, but I&#x27;ve had to use it for over a week to see any real results.  I&#x27;m almost unsure if it&#x27;s working or if the zits are just improving with time.  Also, Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s formula went on clear and was hardly noticeable; this stuff leaves noticeable pink spots where you apply it.  I will probably try to finish the bottle, but after that I&#x27;m going back to Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
    <li> So I brought this product on a whim. I started looking up products to help clear blemishes. I came across this product and read a couple of reviews and decided to purchase it. After moving from Austin, TX (dry climate) to Baton Rouge, LA (very humid) my skin went crazy. I had some breakouts that were stubborn and hard to treat. I bought this product because I have oily, blemish prone skin. After the first two or three applications my skin started to improve drastically, let&#x27;s also take into account that my skin had started to improve on its own given the fact that I had been here for a couple months. It does an EXCELLENT job treating acne before it actually occurs. If you feel sore spots on your skin but there is no raised bump yet, this is perfect for that cause they&#x27;ll never actually erupt into a breakout if treated with Bye Bye Blemish. Even though I have oily skin I ONLY use it once a day and at night. It can cause excessive drying but I have FOLLOWED the directions so I have not had this problem. It has faded my blemishes also, but I believe that its strength lies in treating acne. It can prevent breakouts and with proper moisturization your skin can heal and you can prevent blemishes from occurring. Also, I do not use the product everyday because it can cause extra drying when used properly. I use an oil free moisturizer daily and sometimes I will give my skin a day off so that it can heal on its own between treatments.  Some reviews discussed how the product smells. It&#x27;s not bad at all. The most important aspect of it all is that it actually WORKS. All you need to do is follow the directions and create a reasonable regimen that works for your skin.</li>
    <li> Have tried several other products, but this is the first one to really work.  Great Product!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This a not a miracle product for me. I am using an acne skincare line, too, &amp; I don&#x27;t know if the Bye Bye Blemish helps or not. If it does help diminish a blemish, it&#x27;s definately not overnight.</li>
    <li> This is honestly one of the quickest working blemish products I have ever tried. I don&#x27;t have bad acne and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone that did, but I do get the occasional blemishes. I put it on a night and by the morning it is either come to teh surface or is gone. It does smell because of the sulfer but you should get past that because this product does exactly as claimed.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing for tiny bumps on the forehead, i promise!!!!! only thing i don&#x27;t like is that when i left it on overnight, some would get in the eye area and it would burn so bad in the morning! however, it works great. i literally saw bump reduction in one single night of using it. i am not lying! u can email me if u want me to vouch for this item! it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
    <li> Really does work! Its pink tho so I apply it at night. Do not shake the bottle. I apply it with a qtip. I do reccomend it! I need to buy more!</li>
    <li> I bought this product right after I had contracted ringworm (on my face of all places) and after getting put on a medication that dried out my skin horribly I was having to slather moisturizers on just to remove the tightness of my face which eventually had me breaking out. Quite honestly I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference even with continuous uses. I know nothing works overnight (even if it advertises it does) so I wasn&#x27;t skeptical off the bat. But even with uses after my breakout from the moisturizers on the occasional acne I&#x27;d get it still didn&#x27;t do much. Would I buy again? No, but this could be a product that works for some people and not others. Who knows?</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT -- nothing else ever worked (not even Proactive), but this did!</li>
    <li> I first tried this product about 8 years ago and I will swear by it to this day.  I never have to freak out about a break out or one huge vile zit because I know all I have to do is put a dab of the sulfer drying lotion on the affected area before bed and in the morning its either gone or has shrunk to an un noticeable size. It does sting a bit if you have sensitive skin.  It also has an unpleasant smell but its well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this product to everyone!!! IT IS A LIFE SAVER!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with much hesitation, thinking it was another &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; item.  However, it ACTUALLY WORKS!!!!  Put this stuff on a blemish, and it shrinks/eliminates it overnight!  I love this stuff, and it is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for people who get break-outs!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I will not be using it again. I am allergic to sulfur, and while it did shrink my pimple it has made me INSANELY itchy. My nose hurts from itchy so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely would recommend this UNLESS you&#x27;re allergic to sulfur or sulfa. IF ALLERGIC TO SULFUR OR SULFA AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.</li>
    <li> I had a pimple for over a month that would not heal. After 3 days using this, it was GONE!</li>
    <li> i think it really good item.  but if you have sensitive or dry skin I do not recommand it to you...</li>
    <li> This is not a dupe for the Mario Badescu drying lotion.  I threw this out and bought the original again.  Just buy the real thing.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  Helped eliminate blemishes on my teenage daughter.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used the popular over-the-counter acne products over the years as well as the prescription Retin-A and had little to no results.  I found this product in my local pharmacy and had doubts but I decided not to spend money on products that I&#x27;ve already used and was disappointed with.  I was shocked to see the results!  I am 52 yrs old and still get blind pimples on my face that are a bear to get rid of as well as some on my upper thigh - a very weird spot.  This product is the bomb and either the pimple is gone the next morning or it draws it to a head - no fail (sorry, TMI). I thank the reviewer that says to replace the upper liquid with alcohol when it is used up - I&#x27;ll try it when that time comes.  The bottle lasts a long time as you only need to dab a little with Q Tip.  It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty but but it&#x27;s not offensive to me and once it dries, the sulfur smell goes away.  That is the ingredient that works, btw. Clearasil, Oxy 10 etc. should take the clue and add the sulfur to their products to make them effective.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything... waste... thanks for nothing tv... it also stings when you put it on and you look ridiculous with pink spots all over. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  As an adult, this covers redness and clears up the acne within a couple days.  Be sure to keep the lid screwed on tight after opening, as it will dry out the whole bottle quickly.  I have continued to buy this product for many many years.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is the only thing that works for me, I love it! But you have to use it with other face treatment. For me I use Neutrogena face wash and they work perfectly together. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Initially started using this product when I was about 19, and I try other brands, and I always keep coming back.  Because it&#x27;s the best for my skin</li>
    <li> I came across this product a year ago and when I went to buy it again, it was nowhere to be found in our local stores!  What a relief it was to find it still available online. It&#x27;s a great product--works fast and far more effectively than all those other blemish products.  Great to know that I can get it quickly and easily online.</li>
    <li> This is simply a mind blowing product!  I don&#x27;t get pimples very often, but when I do, I need something that works effectively and fast.  Each time that I have used this product, it has delivered amazing results.  I simply apply it to the pimple as soon as it erupts and usually with an hour the zit is dried up or gone.  NO JOKE!!!  This stuff works!!</li>
    <li> This product worked on one pimple on my chin, but then when I applied it to other pimples, it caused me to break out with tiny bumps all around the pimple I put it on! Like Heat Rash bumps...I figured it was bringing out toxins, but it continued  so I stop. Besides an occasional pimple here and there , my skin is in great condition, that&#x27;s why I purchased it, for the overnight drying since I dont break out much... I really wanted it to work for me, the reviews were great...but it did&#x27;nt.  : (</li>
    <li> This helps my husband&#x27;s blemishes but doesn&#x27;t do much for mine.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, I guess.</li>
    <li> Bye bye blemish is the best I have ever found to dry your pimples up fast. As I have gotten older I get more of the hard cist type bumps, this is the only product that clears them up in a day or two.  Its great !!!!!</li>
    <li> It works... But leaves a horrible dark scar where the pimple used to be.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product since is a Google search showed it to be a dupe to the Mario Badescu Drying lotion that I had a sample of and loved. But MB&#x27;s drying lotion is pricey ( $17 bucks a bottle), so I opted for the Bye Bye Blemish, based upon reviews that is was close in performing as the other and it was cheaper. The first time I used this product it did nothing to dry out my small blemish on my face, in fact I was about to write it off, when I decided to give it another try. By the 2nd Day the drying lotion did appear to be working and by Day 3 my blemish was barely visible. Moral of the story, give it a few days, the product does work and doesn&#x27;t leave any dark spots after use, there maybe some dryness where the blemish was previously, but a little moisturizer will clear that up.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I decided to try this product and I have been using it daily for 2 weeks now and I can tell you that it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL! It didn&#x27;t even reduce the swelling and definitely didn&#x27;t take away any pimples. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years. It is the best spot treatment I have ever used and will clear your zit in a few days. If the zit hasn&#x27;t come to a head this will make it come to a head as well. It can be a little dying and you look kind of silly with it on, but I will continue using this product in the future! Recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Rite Aide because I wanted a sulfur product for my acne. It has been a great addition to my arsenal. I place it on pimples overnight and it will help shrink size over days. I think it helps to prevent others as well because my breakouts have decreased. I would suggest you try this, I use it as spot treatments but also place it over problem areas ( cheeks). I say it&#x27;s worth a try. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Very good, I like it very much, it is very good.Quality didn&#x27;t have to say...And description of..., very satisfied. Very good</li>
    <li> One of the better acne products for quick results and relief.  I used it long ago too and it still works better than most acne products!  Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is not a miracle cure but definitely speeds up the process.</li>
    <li> I buy Bye Bye Blemish for my grandkids who are teenagers and they just love the results they get using this product.</li>
    <li> THIS IS REAL GOOD! CAN I DO NOT SPEAK SO MUCH? I JUST WANT SAY VERY GOOD! THAT&#x27;S IT A</li>
    <li> This has helped. It took about 7-10 to clear all of the blemishes on my forehead. 10-15 at a time. Most were nodular and hurt very badly. This is much better than anything else I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I use the murad acne collection currently and use this at night. It is drying. So once your face gets better take a day off every now and then.</li>
    <li> It works better than imagined. I have hormonal acne and get bad breakouts around my jawline. The moment I feel one of those hard bump under my skin, I put some on that night and the next morning it&#x27;s barely there. This is the only spot treatment I&#x27;ll ever need. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works</li>
    <li> Love this. Ordered after reading many reviews and it really does the trick! I&#x27;m used to having cystic acne and needed something to lessen the severity of some bumps. This product helps the bump reduce in size overnight and it&#x27;s awesome! Glad I have it when I get some bad bumps! Sometimes it does sting and you do look like you have pink lotion all over but hey it works!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. He uses it when he gets a blemish and he says it makes it disappear over night.</li>
    <li> I will never really need to buy the more expensive versions of this drying lotion from Mario Bedescu or Kate Somerville - this is pretty much an exact dupe for those and SO MUCH CHEAPER!</li>
    <li> This product is a wast for me. I was so excited to get it after readying all the reviews.  I applied it to the areas that needed it,  and it does nothing for me. I don&#x27;t see any difference the next day, or even the next couple of hours aftering applying it, nothing. Wast of my money.</li>
    <li> In my youth, I was certainly blessed to have clear skin.  I never had teenage problems with pimples; I just never got any.  Now in my later years, problems with acne have been a constant battle.  Without a history of treatment, I literally tried everything on the market....always with dissatisfaction and frustration.  Then I purchased my first bottle of \\&quot;Bye-Bye\\&quot;.  What a revelation!  My pimples disappeared after only a few short days of treatment.  They just dried up and went away.  I am hooked and will never again use another product.  Bye-Bye is my blemish dryer of choice.  Hurrah!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of products, including a few benzoyl peroxide based ones. None really worked. This product dries most of them in in a night. The only con is that my whole face gets dry too, even though I apply it on certain spots mostly on forehead.</li>
    <li> Worked excellent on my face, but caused my allergies to flare up like crazy.  I couldn&#x27;t breathe out of my nose after using it.  I think I&#x27;m allergic to something in it, possibly the sulfur as I have the same reaction to other  sulfur-containing products.  I can ignore it for the sake of nice skin, though.</li>
    <li> Use as directed and it works really well. Reduces redness and shrinks pimples over night!</li>
    <li> I honestly felt like I was just putting water on my acne. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes at all and would gladly return it if it cost me more and if I still had the box.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the Mario Badescu drying lotion for a while now and when I heard bye bye blemish was a dupe, I decided to try it out. This works just as good if not better. It dries up the zit quickly BUT, my only complaint is that it can be a little too harsh so you have to be careful. I was able to use the Mario Badescu one on recently popped zits but not this one. This one will make an open sore worse and painful. But I would rather save money and work with this one instead. Probably shouldn&#x27;t be putting anything on open sores anyway. Oops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this before and I&#x27;ll say this... it works great! But only buy them one or two bottles at a time. Any more than that, you&#x27;ll risk the formula losing its strength by the time you get to the third one!</li>
    <li> The product works really well...Just after couple days using it, my pimples are fading away...I love it</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by an actress who could not afford to have breakouts on shooting days.  I wish this had been available when I was a teenager.  It dries things up and stops breakouts on their way.  Take a q-tip, dab it on when you go to bed, the next day your skin is usually cleared up.  It&#x27;s amazing and it&#x27;s the only thing that has ever really worked.   Try it.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd of 4th time buying this. It works pretty well; and of course I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff starts working over night. It dries up a single blemish very quick. Just remember don&#x27;t shake the bottle when applying. The price is very good. Try it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> This is a great dupe for the EradiKate drying lotion that costs $24 a bottle. It really shrinks spots overnight, even deep cysts. It smells a little medicinal, but it&#x27;s not noticeable once it dries down.</li>
    <li> Really good! Works good on my problem skin and helps a whole lot. Try it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It has the same ingredients as the Mario Badescu drying lotion, and it works just as well. It&#x27;s not overdrying (at least for my skin). My only issue is that even though it&#x27;s meant to be worn overnight, it can dry and then rub off in your sleep unless you lay on your back without moving. Overall, an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, most times just overnight!</li>
    <li> This review may be a bit premature but I&#x27;ve used BBB twice and it seems to have worked like magic. A few weeks after I received this I felt a sore spot under my skin, which is the sensation I get when a pimple or cyst is festering. I dabbed the sediment on the area and the next day, soreness gone and no redness (which is usually next), no nothing. Same good result twice in different locations. Sometimes these things will go away without erupting, so I cannot prove it was BBB.  I will see if these good results continue or if it was just coincidence. I can update the review later after more use. **Update:  It has been a while now and I have used BBB on a few pimples that appeared with little warning. Applied it at night and by morning blemish is just about gone. Hard to believe it works so well. I think it&#x27;s great stuff. :)</li>
    <li> This works similar to the Proactiv sulfur mask for me. I dip a q-tip down in to the liquid and then cover my zit(s) with a pretty decent layer of it.&lt;br /&gt;Over a day or so it definitely shrinks them down a bit.</li>
    <li> This product dried out my face and had a very strong scent to it</li>
    <li> Some of my pimples do not want to cooperate. But in general, it helps dry out pimples faster than normal. Love this, need to buy a new bottle.</li>
    <li> It did give some improvement overnight to a pimple, but no where near what the product said it would. This is a knock off if a more expensive product. Go with the more expensive one.</li>
    <li> dries up those spots quick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years for adult acne blemishes.  I used to buy at a local drug store and just found out when I was almost out that they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  I HATE it when stores do that!  Was VERY happy to find it on-line.  Nothing works better for me than this product.</li>
    <li> This burned my face and left a huge, peely dark mark that took weeks to go away. Tread lightly!</li>
    <li> This really does shrink massive cysts. Sometimes it doesnt work for small pimples and red bumps but it does work for those white headed pimples. Use it overnight n you&#x27;ll wake up with smoother skin :)</li>
    <li> Wow! this is great stuff for a better price than the Mario Badescu brand. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this is probably the best spot medication I have ever used, I I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin</li>
    <li> Arrived much sooner than I expected, and works well.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed that this has helped my acne much, though applying it while I&#x27;m around the house does remind me not to pick or pop pimples and leave them alone.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s claims and costs a lot less than a very similar product I purchased from one of the home shopping channels. This is an excellent bargain and when I put it on at night my problem has disappeared by morning. It&#x27;s a simple product that works when needed.</li>
    <li> This blemish lotion does not perform as it is advertised.</li>
    <li> This is the only spot treatment that I have found that works on pimples, and it&#x27;s a much cheaper version of the Mario Badescu brand which is about $18. Granted, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it greatly reduces the size and inflammation. It lasts me a long time. Hopefully, you live alone or with someone who doesn&#x27;t judge you for having pink dots all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion I would make would be to get this product directly from a store if you can because you are not supposed to shake it, so when it&#x27;s shipped it may come mixed together. I know that they also sell this at Ulta and Walgreens.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me and made my acne worse</li>
    <li> It helps to dry out certain types of zits and in certain areas of the face it works better. If you toss and turn at night and you have it on your chin it is more likely to rub off. I used it in the middle of my forehead and it seemed to work well but when I used it on my cheek a lot rubbed off (as I lay on my side). Also, a lot of people say it is hard to get the &amp;#34;pink stuff&amp;#34; out but I have had no trouble when using a q tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am kinda neutral at this point. For about $8 it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> too expensive, too messy, so much hassle for nothing. already finished the entire bottle with no improvement.</li>
    <li> This seems to work well.  It definitely dries up the pimples.  The only thing I hate about it is the color.  Pretty unattractive to wear to bed if you share that bed with someone else!</li>
    <li> Works great, love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> i just started using this product! the acne does subside after applying it for 2-3 days. really helps me when i apply it as soon as i see the acne breakout, it doesn&#x27;t let it get worse for sure!!! i will surely keep using this on my hormonal acne in the future...</li>
    <li> It works, and clears your zits but not fast enough for me. It also dries out your skin like crazy so I recommend using a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> excellent product, was sent very fast and in excellent condition. I would recommend buying this product for anyone who gets either the occassional blemish or frequent ones as the lotion works very fast to heal and maintain healthy looking skin</li>
    <li> I have teenagers who are breaking out like crazy. This stuff seems to be the only thing that works fast and consistently on all there acne issues and they actually are willing to use it on a regular basis which is half the battle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen high end skin are brands which offers the exact same thing fir double the price. I&#x27;ve  tried both brands and got same results so I&#x27;m sticking with this one and keep the savings safely in my pocket</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product to deal with an active breakout.  It dries it up and it goes away much faster than if you were using other products.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve had tiny breakouts for about 2 years and this quickly helped to dry out the pimples. I want to also recommend something that&#x27;s going to make the skin healthier once the breakouts are calmer. This is what I use:  http://amzn.to/1dy30OA  Many acne sufferers have used it and have seen faster and better results! It&#x27;s important to know how to use it  to achieve the maximum results. You can also try this sulfur soap  :  http://goo.gl/fg3ttb  to help calm the breakouts. make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to sulfur before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;When everything looks calmer, meaning less inflamed, less red, then you can use this:  http://amzn.to/1dy30OA  to help speed up the healing, to exfoliate the dead skin, and to clear up all the blemishes. Good luck and don&#x27;t lose hope! It will be better soon! :)</li>
    <li> It truly does the trick. Dried up my blemish overnight. It doesn&#x27;t make them disappear, but it helps minimize them.</li>
    <li> I started to break out horribly after mc ... so the acne was hormonal... no OTC product was helping me... was suffering for almost a year without any solution... I came across this product... used it... it works great for the emerging pimples. If you are lucky they will not emerge at all or they will be real small... heals existing pimples in couple of days... yet there are some pimples which takes its own good time to heal... this product will not help them ....i don&#x27;t blame this product... those pimples sit comfortably on your skin for 2-3 weeks &amp; won&#x27;t heal no matter what you apply.... Product doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.... I use it everyday... smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all... if you let the product to dry &amp; then go to bed.. product won&#x27;t come off....In short I recommend this product to all those who are fighting with acne... I&#x27;m on my second bottle... works great with blackheads also....</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I&#x27;m glad I tried it. It works better than any of the big name store brand pimple treatments out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing all the great reviews, I&#x27;m glad to see it work with everyone else I only wish I got the same results. I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 nights on the SAME pimple and it&#x27;s STILL there. Waste of $8 bucks</li>
    <li> I have some what of an acne problem. They are not actually acnes but little bumps that sometimes turn into acne or otherwise sink back down. But during the last couple of months they would not go away so I would tend to scratch it off which is a really bad habit. I read a review of this product on another site and I thought why not. It&#x27;s pretty strong so it sometimes burns your eyes and dries your skin but it does the job. It got rid of my bumps in no joke 4 days. There are still abit left but I&#x27;m going to leave my skin for a couple of days since my skins reallly dry now. I really recommend it, I&#x27;m really surprised it works.</li>
    <li> It works just as good as the Mario Badescu drying lotion and 1/2 the cost!</li>
    <li> Works great for normal acne..it will take longer for cystic acne though (a few weeks/mo). Cleared normal pimples overnight as advertised. Be careful on biracial skin though, will lighten it pretty significantly and leave you with white patches if using on large area of face.</li>
    <li> Seems pretty good, like a Mario badescu product I got a few years ago and it works on some zits, but not all. Container should last a really long time because it just takes a dab from a qtip for each spot. For the price difference between products I would definitely get this again.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this isn&#x27;t working for me.  It came VERY HIGHLY recommended by a friend.  I hope it works for everyone else the way it works for her.</li>
    <li> Works, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I usually do not write reviews on products, but I had to comment on Bye Bye Blemish. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and already have significant improvement. I had some pesky little whiteheads that just wouldn&#x27;t go away, and after using this for a couple of days they are gone and a huge pimple I had on my check is down half it&#x27;s size. This was a lot better than I was expecting!! I have tried everything and this has seemed to work the best. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have adult acne and nothing really slows it. The bottle says overnight but I have found it takes 2-3 nights. But really keeps the redness down and keeps my ace under control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days but I&#x27;m already convinced of its effectiveness. Had a huge pimple forming on my chin the night I got it, applied a dab with a qtip, and the next morning it was down to nearly nothing! It really works, so I highly recommend it to anyone who battles breakouts!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a holy grail product that will prevent you from ever having an acne blemish, but it is a good spot treatment that will either help prevent blemishes that haven&#x27;t yet come to a head to shrink and keep them from from surfacing and forming a whitehead, or help clear up acne that has already surfaced more quickly.  I highly recommend products that contain sulfur as the active ingredient, as opposed to the many benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid based products -- while this does contain alcohol and salicylic acid, I don&#x27;t find that it dries out my face as much as the many other spot treatments I have tried.  When spot treatments are too drying, for me, they cause scabbed areas that are really difficult to conceal.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with this product, even when I use it on the same area repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I have been applying a thin layer on my nose each night before I go to bed.  I have had a &amp;#34;chronic&amp;#34; blackhead problem with the pores of my nose, and I&#x27;m finding that this is helping to draw the dirt out of the pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have tried the similar Mario Badescu product, and I find this to be a very comparable product at a much more reasonable price.  I highly suggest this product from anyone who suffers from acne!</li>
    <li> It speeds up the process of getting rid of acne. Works better than many spot treatments I have used. I have used better, but this does good stuff.</li>
    <li> This product really works on acne. I love it and in 24 48 hours my acne is clear and no scars.</li>
    <li> I use to use Acne Spot Dry, but couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  I had been looking around and finally found this.  Spot Dry used salicylic acid as the active ingredient, but this is sulfur.  Used the exact same way~even looks the same.  It cost me about 4 times as much for spot dry, but this does the same thing for a much more reasonable price.  I&#x27;m glad I found it and will continue to use it as needed (cystic acne-yuck!).  This was a treasure find for me. :)</li>
    <li> This was going great for me at first... But then after a few days, I noticed a NEW pimple on my face.. this was a pimple that isn&#x27;t even in my T-zone, where I get the most of my pimples. Plus, this drying lotion cannot get rid of all your pimples. In fact, blemishes are still visible after using this. So I say, trying something else first.</li>
    <li> If you want to get rid of your zits almost overnight this is the product for you, it works every time, seriously! I used to be able to buy it at Walgreens but they stopped carrying it in the store so I buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Does work but takes few days</li>
    <li> 49 and still break out occasionally, it starts working just like it says...&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product !! It really does what it says!!</li>
    <li> I had moderate cystic acne on my cheek.  Not even fancy medicines could treat my face.  I bought this stuff because of the elements it contains, Zinc and Sulfur.  Just like the mud at the Dead Sea, it kind of smells like Sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on over night generously, and it dried up most of the cysts in one treatment.  I have a beard, and had to shampoo my beard three times in the shower in the morning to strip off the Sulfur smell.  It was well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I am stressed and get cysts on my face, I slap this stuff on overnight, and they significantly recede or dry up all together the next day.  Just make sure you shower it off - not just wash.  Simply sink washing didn&#x27;t get the smell off (may be the beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use a natural moisturizer a couple days after - your face may still be quite dry.</li>
    <li> It is the first product I&#x27;ve used that really works great on blemishes, as well as prevents wrinkles.  I have used it for years, and have no wrinkles on my forehead where I use it often.</li>
    <li> I am obseseed with this stuff. i have my friends, boyfriend and family using it too! In sign of a breakout, this overnight will greatly reduce or even make the breakout disappear. Make sure you dont put on open sores though, it stings!</li>
    <li> Works well, just wish I could find something that makes me not get my cystic acne in the first place.  But it does work quickly, especially on the smaller ones.  Easy to use, and great price.</li>
    <li> What people have said is correct...this stuff really works! All you need is a Qtip &amp; this little bottle of pink magic pink and your pimple will be gone in no time. Found this by chance couple years ago at Biggs and tried it since nothing else worked that well. I thought the box looked a bit like a AS SEEN ON TV gimmick so thought I&#x27;d give it a try...WOW! It worked better than I thought, but then Remke bought Biggs so it disappeared and now I can only find it online and can&#x27;t find it in any store in Ohio and anyone I tell about it has never heard of it. The company should hire me, I&#x27;d sell for them since I really believe in it...lol!</li>
    <li> Love this. Been using it for awhile and it really works.</li>
    <li> Terrific value! This seems to be the exact same formula as Mario Badescu&#x27;s Drying Lotion which costs lots more.  I&#x27;ve been using the MB version for years, and this is saving me tonnes!  Just dip a cotton bud into the pink, lift it out, blot excess off against the inside rim and dab on blemishes before bed, by morning your pimple is gone, even if it hadn&#x27;t come all the way up to the surface yet!  When i&#x27;m hormonal and my t-zone is a little oilier than usual i swipe some over my nose and chin and it helps absorb oil and even out my skin tone too.</li>
    <li> Besides the drying effect it has on your skin afterwards. but other then that it&#x27;s a really product i recommend helps with acne cysts too.</li>
    <li> way better than proactive!! At least for me, or any cream... Just absorbs the pimples, has a pretty damn bad sting but if you can tough it out this stuff works like magic.. Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> After reading multiple positive reviews I was very hopeful that this product would work. I&#x27;ve had great skin for years but all of the sudden have been breaking out in awful cystic acne around my jawline, chin, and lower cheeks. The pimple itself takes a month to go away and the mark it leaves behind 2-3 more after that. I was hoping this product would help diminish them when they start to pop up, shortening the time of the pimple itself, and the red mark left behind. I&#x27;ve had no luck whatsover on the multiple cystic pimples I&#x27;ve tried it on. Waste of money for me unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Works eventually but not as quickly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim after reading other amazon reviews, and it actually has worked great. I only get occasional pimples but I&#x27;ve been putting this on at night as directed and everytime, the zit is significantly less visible by the morning. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have dropped too much money on other blemish products, including some &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; ones. This product is better than any of those. You can expect blemish reduction overnight without over drying. It is definitely worth the small amount of money to spend to save tons in the future.</li>
    <li> I put this on before bed after I wash my face. It does a pretty good job of drying up pimples.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.  I&#x27;m a 28-year-old guy and I&#x27;ve never had acne, but I do occasionally get these massive red cysts on my nose.  (I&#x27;m cursed, I swear!)  When I say massive, I&#x27;m not overreacting -- we&#x27;re talking the circumference of a dime here.  Something that large pushing through a pore in your nose has a habit of making your entire nose red!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this lotion about ten years ago and had forgotten all about it until recently.  I got one of these aforementioned monsters on my nose about 3 weeks ago.  This past Monday, it was still as big, as bright, and as hideous-looking as it was a week earlier.  All the Benzoyl Peroxide on the planet was not making a dent in this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my local Rite Aid and there was one bottle of this left.  I immediately remembered the product from years ago and cursed myself for not having a bottle at my house.  I put it on and within two nights this swollen monster was almost completely deflated, it had come to a head, and it was perfectly dried out.  Two nights!  I remember when I was using this a long time ago, it would dry out a forming pimple overnight.  Every. Single.  Time.  This one took an extra night or two because it was already fully-inflamed.  But if you get giant cyst-like pimples occasionally like I do, this stuff is much more effective than Tea Tree, Benzoyl, Salicyclic, ice, heat, or whatever else you might be doing.  Take my word for it, this is a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another bottle for me and I&#x27;m shipping one to my mom as well.  Buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  The people that negatively rated this product most likely have acne.  Based on what this product is, I don&#x27;t think it will work for that.  This is meant to dry out an occasional, particularly offensive pimple.  If you&#x27;re using this all over your face all the time, you WILL dry out and it will probably exacerbate the issue.</li>
    <li> Works ok but takes time....just like many other products. Nothing special</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it, nor did I feel like it did anything.  My face is already dry from the arid air in Utah, and drying the pimples further didn&#x27;t see to cause them to disappear any faster.  In fact, making sure my face is well cleansed and well moisturized did more for breakouts than this product did.  It&#x27;s inexpensive, so worth the try if you&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing has worked - but for me, I wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
    <li> For years I purchased Serious Skin Care&#x27;s Dri Lo, which is very expensive.  Bye Bye Blemish works just as well at half the cost.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work.  On some &#x27;situations&#x27; it works overnight and other situations it may take one to three days - and that&#x27;s still not a long time.  I had a pimple or two that popped while washing which was an accident.  It ended spreading into a few more pimples and I think it became infected.  It looked just horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate for something stronger to put on it.  I read about Bye Bye Blemish and majority of the reviews were good.  To my surprise, that situation on my face looked better within a few hours.  Overnight, it looked even better.  Within a couple of days it was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it was infected because as the BBB was drying it out, the pus would really ooze out.  It was disgusting.  After all of the pus finished oozing out within a day or so it just dried up and shrunk away.  I was so happy. I&#x27;d never seen anything like it.</li>
    <li> I put this on before I go to bead and when I wake up it&#x27;s gone. When it dries, it dries as a powder which is why it doesn&#x27;t stay on. It&#x27;d be unrealistic to expect it to stay on but maybe some modifications should be made so the lotion stays on for a bit longer. I don&#x27;t see how the lotion could help shrink pimples when it only stays on for less than two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this works best with pimples that already have a white tip. Put it on when you get home from work so it can work on your blemishes as you&#x27;re up and about.</li>
    <li> This product works so well. Dab it on at night and blemishes of all sizes are reduced or eliminated by morning. I&#x27;ve had a friend tell me she thought it burned but I have very sensitive skin and have never had a problem. Where was By Bye Blemish when I was a teenager?</li>
    <li> Love the product. Most blemishes are gone by morning if you apply at bedtime. I originally used the serious skin care product, which I also loved, but tried this one because it appeared to have the same ingredients. It&#x27;s the same product but for less than half the price &amp; no delivery charge if you belong to prime. I&#x27;m an older woman but I gave a bottle to my nephew too. I will buy this regularly. Great product!!</li>
    <li> this is crap, doesn&#x27;t work and leaves a mess on your face.</li>
    <li> This product really didn&#x27;t do much for me. I didn&#x27;t have terrible acne but the acne I did have, it did nothing. Weird smelling pink product was just so so.</li>
    <li> A teenagers life saver!</li>
    <li> Fast results even overnight!!!  Will buy again n definately recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the drying lotion of the more expensive brand that in sure people are familiar with. This is one of my favorite products for acne ever. Like ever. But this. Do not shake the&lt;br /&gt;Bottle!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything to a whitehead.  Major disappointment. They offered to take it back but wasn&#x27;t going to spnd 3 bucks to do so...save your money</li>
    <li> Did not do anything to my face it only dries it cant see any results after months on it. do not waste your time and money of this does not work.</li>
    <li> Only product that works to dry out acne practically over night!</li>
    <li> Been using this for one week. So far i do like it. And i have purchased the second bottle to spare. I can see my acne been dried up overnight. This is an overnight acne treatment. So you can only use it at night. You can use it at day time if you are not going anywhere (stay at home). I have actually recommended to few of my friends about this product. I used this product along with sulfur acne soap. Followed by neutrogena acne toner. Aubrey acne moisturiser. On top of that byebye blemish.</li>
    <li> I have had sensitive skin with blemish problems all my life &amp; nothing seemed to work long term. I tried this product &amp; noticed a huge difference. All you need to do is apply a dab to any blemish (or soon to be blemish) before bed &amp; you should notice the difference in the morning. Do not use everyday or it will notice flaky dry skin. I have been using this for years now &amp; my blemish issues have decreased by at least 75%.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product. Instant results.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fairly well on my child&#x27;s face as nothing else has.  It does smell up the pillow case and blanket on the bed after repeated uses but washing takes out the smell. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Simply put, the stuff works. : )</li>
    <li> Works overnight on small spots, over a few days on larger spots, but I think its still better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all, even if you use it several times over a day. Also lasts forever.</li>
    <li> In general I like this stuff. It seems to do a good job.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Work very well.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff after having great success with Mario Badescu and I regret the decision.  Mario actually stops my acne literally overnight.  The bye bye product seems to have the same ingredients but they must have different proportions.  The bye bye product would dry to a flaky mess that would just fall off as soon as it dried. And I felt no tingling whatsoever.  Not even after I applied it on a zit that had already popped.  Try that with Mario and you feel the burn!!!  After a few tries, I threw this knockoff in the garbage and placed an order for the real stuff; Mario Badescu.</li>
    <li> This is the miracle pimple cure I&#x27;ve been searching for! I&#x27;ve tried every product out there...this one actually works...OVERNIGHT!!</li>
    <li> i love this product for blemishes and bites.  it clears anything up over night, and instantly.  i use it to speed things along and it&#x27;s the best.  lets you skin breath and heal quickly too.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending $17 at Nordstrom for the similar Mario brand of this type of lotion.  So, thought I&#x27;d try this.  This looks the same but does not perform.</li>
