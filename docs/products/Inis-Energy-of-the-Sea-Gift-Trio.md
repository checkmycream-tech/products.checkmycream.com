    <li> Loved the fragrance, anyone could wear it....</li>
    <li> I discovered this fragrance eight years ago, when I was shopping at TJ Maxx. I fell in love with it the moment I opened the bottle to see what it smells like and wheather it&#x27;s worth getting it. I&#x27;ve been using it since then and still love it. I was so happy to find it on Amazon for such a great price! Also, shipping was super fast. I am absolutely happy with the product and Amazon service!</li>
    <li> my sister inlaw  realy loved it thank</li>

    <li> When I didn&#x27;t receive the product, I was a little upset.  The seller responded to me, and reshipped the product very promptly.  I received the product in just a couple of days.

    <li> Having purchased this before, I knew what to expect.  The transaction was flawless, the product was as described.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, amazing packaging, and a remarkably fair price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Inis cologne for quite some time and just love the scent, so clean and fresh. The lotion makes my skin feel so silky and with the shower gel and cologne I feel and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance...many compliments..&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
    <li> When I wear this, I can close my eyes and imagine myself in County Wicklow near Glendalough.  It is fresh and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Really a lovely soft fragrance, delicate, not heavy and light, smells clean and fresh. This is a nice set and the bath gel is wonderfully scented and produces lots of silky lather. The Lotion is a nice non greasy type and absorbs quickly and leaves skin scented with this beautiful fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Inis Cologne by a friend. Loved it so much I decided to order some for myself. I was very happy to see that shower gel and body lotion were also available, so the trio pack was just the right thing for me to order. And the shipping was extremely fast as well.</li>
    <li> Great fresh sent. Can be used unisex.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and love this product!</li>
    <li> I gave this set as a gift to my mother and to my boyfriend&#x27;s mother for Christmas.  This was my boyfriend&#x27;s mother&#x27;s second set since she loved the scent so much.  She used the lotion in under a month! My mother loves it too and already got compliment on the scent from a co-worker :)</li>
    <li> Received product quickly. Love it. My only wish is that the lotion is in a pump instead of squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> love this very clean fragrance - remind me of the ocean and is not overpowering or intrusive...the lotion is super and absorbs well- no sticky feeling...fragrance lasts pretty w ell and I have been complimented many times on it.  The bath gel is very potent- you need VERY little and it soaps up into a really good lather.  The oil is great for a fast spray an to relieve dryness ...enjoy.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for her birthday as she loves the perfume. This seemed like such a good deal boxset of the perfume, but also for a chance to try some of the other products and she loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very refreshing without being over powering.</li>
    <li> Fragrances seemed diminished. Not what I received as a gift. Old stock?</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful ocean breeze sent without being overpowering. It has been a signature fragrance for me for awhile, I continue to receive compliments and inquiries on how to find it. I have also gifted inis a number of times, back before Amazon when it was much more hard to find in the US market.</li>
    <li> Could not ask for more!  I was tickled about the Inis Energy of the Sea Trio.  It was well worthvthe money.</li>
    <li> Great, clean smelling fragrance.  I get many compliments every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Want to order more for my daughter for Christmas before uses all of mine up.</li>
    <li> Such an amazing scent, you&#x27;ll feel the wild Irish coast ocean when you wear this.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was recommended to me.  I bought it as a gift for my wife, who is Irish.  It is fresh and feminine and subtle.  The buying experience was excellent.  Men, if you&#x27;re lookingfor a fragrance for your girl, Irish or not, you can not go wrong.</li>
    <li> A wonderful fragrance, crisp and clean -- and this set includes smaller versions of the shower gel and body cream, a big plus and a great price!</li>
    <li> I got this for my grandmother for christmas,and HOLY CRAPOLI does it smell awesome! I didn&#x27;t even open the box...you can smell this oceany and beautiful scent right through the box. When she told me about this Inis brand,I knew I&#x27;d like it,too...looks like I&#x27;m getting myself one of these,or something similar as well. Well-worth the money many times over so far.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance- it is my signature scent- very fresh.  I purchased this size for traveling.  It is not too small for a couple of weeks of use- but not too big for packing!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this smell! Get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is the best of any I know, no matter what price you are talking about.  Light, refreshing, yet sexy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lady for whom I gave this as a Christmas gift just loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find any of these &amp;#34;Inis&amp;#34; products, I was so happy to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance!!!  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it!!!</li>
    <li> consider it my signature scent. not too sweet or flowery. I get a lot of compliments when I walk by</li>
    <li> Tried Inis twice before purchasing. Both times the scent lasted till the next day. Unfortunately this lasted only 3 hours.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with the spray but the lotion and body wash were a pleasant addition. I&#x27;m sensitive to many fragrances but this is light enough for every day</li>
    <li> My new summer fragrance - I just love this clean, fresh scent.  It does remind me of time spent at the ocean!  If you want a very light summer fragrance this is it.  I would recommend the set so you can layer the products so the scent lasts longer!  Love it.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is fresh and clean. I really like wearing it in the spring. It is strong so I mist it into the air and walk into the mist or I squirt it in the palms of my hands and gently dab it on very lightly and it isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
    <li> This is a nice clean scent.  To me, the shower gel seems stronger in scent than the cologne.  The shower gel smells a bit more manly to me, but all could be used by male or female.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my Niece by request but I can say I liked the fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and people around me like it too.</li>
    <li> My wife spent several weeks wandering around the Irish Countryside.  This scent makes her feel like she is right back there.  And I like it on her too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful set - a great gift for any occasion!</li>
    <li> Great value for this product.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance.  Definitely worth the price I paid.</li>
