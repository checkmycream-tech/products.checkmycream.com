<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing Product! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Smells great- leaves skin really soft and clear</li>
    <li> Great product! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Smells divine! And now my face is baby soft. Great costumer service to boot.</li>
    <li> I have purchased powdered Ghassoul in the past and made my own paste for mud masques, but this is so much more convenient, neater, and it smells so pretty. The rose water is just divine. I use this on my t-zone to keep my pores looking more refined. I also use it on the occasional break out to speed up the healing process and it seems to work nicely for that too.</li>
    <li> I like this mask. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and the first time after using it I got a few random spots of acne which I&#x27;m assuming means it&#x27;s deep cleansing and bringing my acne to the surface. After using it on my hair, my scalp has stopped itching due to dryness, but the mask is hard to wash out completely. I only put a little bit and rub it all over my scalp, but afterwards my hair feels dry and hard to brush. Instead of making my hair silky smooth like I hoped it has made my hair feel a bit clay like. Will prob stick to using it just on my face.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm....still working with this product. It dries awfully fast... like cement.  Yep...my skin certainly in glows after using this clay, but perhaps because I have to scrub do hard to get it off.  I&#x27;ve limited the use to my face, because trying to use it on the feet created such a mess.  At the end if the process I had to wash about 5 towels, wash cloths, sponges and sponges.  My bathtub looked like my six cats and dog had diarrhea attacks at the same time. What a mess to clean up ! Result:  Didn&#x27;t work on my very light calluses at all !  I&#x27;m not putting myself thru this anymore.  Back to salon !&lt;br /&gt;Oh....one more thing.  No way am I putting this in my hair.</li>
    <li> Used this product once on hair and skin... both were noticeable softer although I had to use a lite moisturizer as both hair and skin were slightly dry after use. I give product and seller both 5 stars as it is a good product and I had a good experience with seller. I definitely would recommend product &amp; seller.</li>
    <li> Smells like roses and leaves skin soft. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> I was originally looking for a very expensive Charlotte Tillbury mask and instead this and other masks came up in the search. I decided to go with this mask instead and I am so glad I did. All the five star reviews are really accurate. This mask is amazing! After using this mask for about a week I looked at a photo of myself taken that day and compared to the other recent photos and my skin looks more radiant and refreshed. I am thinking wow it must be the mask. My skin feels so soft also and as others have stated that feeling stays. As far as the hair it also is wonderful. My hair looked like the hair of models in hair ads with the added volume. The pumice stone is also very effective in the bath for feet. Awesome products.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and has a cleansing &amp; tingling feeling</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it as a deep conditioner for my transition from relaxed to natural hair and it works great! The customer service from this company is equally outstanding!</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous product.  Thus far, I have only used it as a facial mask (not as a hair treatment), but the effects were positive and immediate.  Superior ingredients, lovely packaging - including a special gift item, excellent customer service.  I plan to reorder.</li>
    <li> Mehh- it&#x27;s alright. Not quite sure it&#x27;s worth 50 for the size of the jar. Can&#x27;t say I felt like my face felt great after. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not the best clay I&#x27;ve purchased - sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once but I did see some results. I have to use it some more to let you know how it really works. I love this, it does get a little dry but that is nothing, you just have to wet your hands or face to apply and it moves/slides on.</li>
    <li> Fast ship, good communication, lovely product. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> It was a little dry when I got it...do I just added a little water.</li>
    <li> Just received. Too soon to tell if will be a good product for me</li>
    <li> This combination of clay and rosewater really deep cleans my skin as it sloughs away the dead skin cells. It makes my skin feel smooth, clean and refreshed afterwards. The clay is a bit tricky to completely wash away, but that is a small price to pay for this wonderful mask.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, product was slightly covered in sand.</li>
    <li> It has some itchING sensation.  Not sure if that&#x27;s how it should be.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling fabulous!</li>
    <li> Its really nice and it feels good in the Skin.&lt;br /&gt;But I think the price is to high.</li>
    <li> Used this both on my hair and face.  Hair is silky smooth now and my face has been hydrated.  Shipped very fast and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful feeling left after each use. And the smell is amazing! It gives a great silky smooth feeling to both your hair and face!</li>
    <li> I loved the results from this product! I used this product several times and each time is worked wonders on my skin. I used the pumic stone that came with it, on my feet, and then used the clay, and it made my feet soooooo soft!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Sucks out all of the impurities from your skin.</li>
    <li> I really LOVED the scent but the clay was very thick and was very difficult to spread evenly. Also, it was more difficult to wash off than other clay masks I have used. The pumice stone was great and if the formula could be made easier to spread, I would buy this product again in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> I like the product and it arrived as promised. Best clay mask I&#x27;ve use. It really cleanse out my pores and leave the skin smooth with a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Packed with a volcanic stone. It smells lovely and softens my hair, body and face. Love it. Thanks for the great delivery</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product and found it amazing. I love the way my hair felt and how soft my face was after using. it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and is easy to work with. I found since I have long hair to add a bit of water does make it easier to spread. I highly recommend this product. thank you for letting me review</li>
    <li> I love how this gift is packaged. It felt like someone wrapped it up just to give it to me. The pumice stone was placed on top of the jar, which was wrapped in clear cellophane, with a pretty bow on top. This would be great to send to someone as a gift in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;This clay smells great. As soon as you start unscrewing the jar, the scent is released. The smell of roses surrounding you in your own home. Again, perfect gift to send to someone! I tried it as a face mask, and it was a little heavy. I would add a few drops of water to it, or maybe coconut oil. It was easy to take off, and my skin felt great after.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try it in my hair. I imagine that it will make my hair soft, and if it leaves the scent of roses in my hair, I will be addicted!&lt;br /&gt;If you are away from any special woman in your life; Mom, wife, sister, best friend, this is the perfect gift to send. It can be applied all over, and includes a volcanic pumice stone. While the mask is on, feet can be soaking. This way your special woman can treat her entire body, and truly relax. Elbahya goes above and beyond to make this a special product.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> What a great addition to Mother-Daughter Spa night! I have had mud masks in the past, but never one like this. The fragrance is amazing. The smell of Tea Roses permeated the air making everything that much more pleasant. It was easy to apply with a thick yet pliable consistency. The coverage was smooth and even. Removal was even better. I&#x27;ve never had a mud mask that was this easy to remove. I simply got a washcloth wet with very warm water and placed it on my face for about 30 seconds. That was enough to loosen the mud into easy to remove flakes. And what was left washed off quickly with the wash cloth. There was no scrubbing at all. My face felt wonderful afterwards. Not dry, not oily. And I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to wash with soap to get the residual mud off. And as an added bonus, my bathroom smelled like roses.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;surprise gift&amp;#34; is a pumice stone so we added pedicures to our Spa Night. TRULY a treat!</li>
    <li> I received this item yesterday and must say the packaging looks so pretty. I the the fact it&#x27;s 100% organic It&#x27;s very easy to use just place on face or hair and leave on for 10 to 15 minutes. Once it dries wash it off and enjoy your complexion or the feeling of silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes. All reviews are 100% my own opinion.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using a facial or hair clay, and after using this product, it will not be my last!  I am very pleased with this product.  The packaging was appealing and I felt like I got a little gift for myself, as it was wrapped in neat packaging with a little earthtone ribbon.  Packaging may not seem important, but I believe that the right packaging sets a tone for the experience.  I was wowed by the scent of the clay.  I was not expecting much, being earthy clay.  As soon as I opened the jar, I noticed a lovely, but not overpowering smell of roses.  The pleasant earthy smell blended nicely to create a very welcoming aroma.  The texture of the clay was pretty neat. It was not sticky, yet not grainy either.  It is quite hard to describe, but it is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this both as a facial mask and scalp treatment.  I have a very dry scalp that tends to itch and have irritation.  I used this product for the directed 15 minutes on both, then showered.  It was very easy to use. My scalp and face felt so fresh and amazing after I used this product. My skin felt very soft and sooth. It was a very lovely spa experience. This jar seems like it will last for quite a few applications, which makes this beauty product a great value.  I look forward to trying other products, such as the black soap, from this vendor.</li>
    <li> smells so amazing! this was a really nice treat for my skin! really brought out the impurities in my skin! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! left my skin feeling amazing and smooth.  my hair also fell silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!!  Love how my face feels after using!!!  Love it for sure!!!</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box, you could smell the roses. Immediately puts you in spa mood. As others have stated the packaging is great, it’s like a little gift just for you. Now on to the product! It is AMAZING; I placed a little of the clay in a small bowl and added about a tsp of water to it, mixed it up and applied. Since I have sensitive skin, I was hesitant to leave it on for 15 min. So once it dried, I only left it on for 5 min, jumped in the shower and removed it. Came off easily and left my skin feeling so soft and refreshed. I’m looking forward to my next “spa treatment”</li>
    <li> This is a Big WOW product. I love how it makes my skin so smooth, soft and clean. It doesnt leave your skin dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used the clay once on my face. I like the consistency of it. It also smells great. The jar is small for the price. I wash my hair with clay, but I probably won&#x27;t use this on my hair because it costs too much to use the amount I would need on my hair. So I will continue to make my own clay wash for my hair. This company also has great customer service. Before the product arrived, I received an email entailing how to use the product. Upon the products arrival, I received another email to see if I had received my product and if I was satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love it. It helps my skin smooth and less dry. It is a great product. :)</li>
    <li> This product really made my skin smooth. It also lessened the amount of acne that my son had. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Having tried the Elbahya black soap, and being delighted with it, I decided to order the clay as well.  First, it comes very nicely packaged. Then there&#x27;s the amazing rose fragrance when you take off the lid.  Next is the great way it makes my hair feel - so soft and strong, and it makes my skin feel very nice as well.</li>
    <li> Arrived super quick! Good quality product! Love the ease of use and results</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with it. It leaves my skin super soft and works really well on my hair. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wow!!  When I got this home, the first thing I noticed was the fantastic packaging!  Came with a pretty little ribbon and an extra gift on top, a Pumice Stone.  It would be a GREAT gift!!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am in my late 40&#x27;s, and I haven&#x27;t used a mask on my face since I was early 20&#x27;s, so I was REALLY excited to use this!  The first thing I noticed was that it smelled like roses!  (My favorite flower, so that was a big hit with me right off the top!!)  I applied a thin layer on my face and could feel it working IMMEDIATELY.  It felt all tingly and I could feel the tightening in my skin.  I left it on for the recommended 5-10 minutes, washed it off and my face felt softer than it has in YEARS!!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this mask!  I feel like I have a spa treatment that I can give myself at home, on a weekly basis.&lt;br /&gt;There is enough in the jar , that it&#x27;ll probably last a good 6 months or longer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FANTASTIC CLAY MASK!!!  Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Was not sure what to think at first, but after using it I am sure I will use again. Left my face soft and smooth, and my hair felt good too.&lt;br /&gt;The application was a little odd but it did the job well.  It smells good also.  When using it on hair my hair was wet, I focused on my scalp as I have really long hair.  It left my hair soft, even with my thin hair it made a difference in the feel.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask - my skin and hair feel and look amazing.</li>
    <li> Love it. I tried it in my but that was a no go. Love it for my face though. It also smells good. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC!!!!! I had recently damaged my hair with a straightener and had tried nearly everything to avoid having to cut it.  I was ready to give up when I saw this product and decided to give it a try.  I am sooo glad I did, not only did it repair the  damage, but my hair has more shine and softness than ever before and as a bonus my scalp, that is normally dry feels WONDERFUL.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Moroccan beauty treatments for years for my GF and ex wife. This particular cleanser/mask is fine... a little expensive on the retail side. I would not have purchased if it was not on promotional discount.</li>
    <li> This mask is made from finest natural ingredients. At first I was reluctant to use it because this is very dense , but then I used it and liked how my skin felt after I used it for multiple times. I received this mask to review. I would recommed this,</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair a yesterday and it feels amazing this morning! It feels healthy and has a very nice shine to it. Im excited to try the product as a face mask later. Aside from the slightly unpleasant smell, the product works perfect. I would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re still unsure about buying it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS! It made my face silky smooth and felt cleaner than it has with any other face mask i&#x27;ve used and I have tried many! I received this complementary but I only endorse products I believe work! I plan on ordering more once my jar I have now runs out its that amazing!</li>
    <li> nothing instantaneous or dramatic as usual but wonderful smell and tightening experience leaves skin moisturized and nourished for sure... lovely</li>
    <li> I love this product.It left my hair feeling really soft.I would only recommend that you add water to make it easier to smooth through your hair</li>
    <li> I have used dozens of masks. This is by far different from all others. It has powerful extracting and softening&lt;br /&gt;properties for your skin and hair. It is the only clay mask I will use in the future. So glad I found this.</li>
