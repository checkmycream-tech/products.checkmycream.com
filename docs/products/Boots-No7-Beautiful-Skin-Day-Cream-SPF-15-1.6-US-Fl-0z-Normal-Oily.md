    <li> This cream is very nice and easy to use.  I would buy my Boots products too.</li>
    <li> My wife had been purchasing this product at some of the exclusive cosmetic stores at a much higher price.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! I have oily/acne prone skin. It is light but moisturizing, it also has SPF 15. Keeps my face matte all day. I use the night cream from this line, and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I have used Boots No7 Restore and Renew Night Cream for a year and I LOVE it.  It&#x27;s the best skin cream that I have used in several years.  I shall happily keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using No. 7 now for about 2 months and I love it.  I&#x27;ve been a Oil of Olay user for over 25 years and I wanted to try No. 7 since I heard so much about it.  I made a great choice. A bit more expenseive than Oil of Olay but I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, for my skin, not too oily.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  She lives in Las Vegas and finds this to be just the right amount of moisturizing and the always needed SPF.  Would highly recommend.</li>

    <li> Great cream! I love all boots No7 products!!</li>
    <li> I have been using number seven moisturizer for quite a while. It is a great product and I feel that it has made a difference in my skin. I took it on a weekend vacation and forgot it at the hotel. I got on my iPhone and ordered it from Amazon as we were leaving, and it was waiting on me at my home when I arrived. Amazon is the best and I recommend this moisturizer.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Daily Moisturizer for years. I thought it was the best of the best. Boy, was I wrong. Boots No7 is way better. It is more calming to my skin, and I don&#x27;t find myself blotting oil away as often. I feel like it goes better in combination with my liquid foundation too. I would definitely recommend this product and buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have been using Boots products now for about 5 months.  I love the day cream, goes on silky not greasy.

You can&#x27;t beat the price and the results!</li>
    <li> I love this face cream...i used to use Aveeno and thought I loved it, but I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing out on with this. It&#x27;s so light, hydrating, and just feels healthy for my skin.</li>
    <li> NO BREAKOUTS!  super moisturizing, but does not cause me to break out.  That is a miracle.</li>
    <li> Personal taste - did not care for the smell of this product.  Since it goes on the face, you are forced to smell it all day - yuk!</li>
    <li> This cream leave my skin so smooth and soft. It really does seem to be improving my complexion. I am going to try one of the serums next.</li>
    <li> I bought this product while visiting family in London. I am pleased with the product. Good price!</li>
