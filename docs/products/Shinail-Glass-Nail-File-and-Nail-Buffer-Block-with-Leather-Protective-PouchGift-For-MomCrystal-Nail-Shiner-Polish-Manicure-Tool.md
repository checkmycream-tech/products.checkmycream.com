      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>How much better can a nail file be?</li>
      <li>But the quality is really top-notch, so I make do without a case, tucking it into basic cosmetic bag.</li>
      <li>This Pfeilring nail file works very well and gives great results.</li>
      <li>My wife said this works better than any nail file she has ever used.</li>
      <li>This is much better quality than the &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; nail files I have been buying at the pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>Love this metal nail file.</li>
      <li>This is working out just great for fast repairs.</li>
      <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>ok...</li>
      <li>Love these way better than those glass ones.</li>
      <li>I guess that something and since Amazon would like a review, how say that this nail file works as well as any nail file of ever owned and suspect you too will be satisfied with your purchase.</li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>Anyway, has to purchase something more durable</li>
      <li>so far, so good!  </li>
      <li>So far, so good!  </li>
      <li>It files more cleanly, and faster, because the surface holds more dust, I guess.</li>
      <li>Very good for filing your finger nails and strong enough even for your toes!  </li>
      <li>Other than that I am very happy with the product and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>be warned: they&#x27;re quite easy to lose.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>This nail file works very quickly and efficiently.  </li>
      <li>You can shape your nails and smooth them off.</li>
      <li>Fantastic nail file.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find that particularly comfortable.</li>
      <li>Forget cheap files which do not work and get this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, Pfeilring Sapphire is great, especially in the ease of shaping the nail while filing.</li>
      <li>Very well pleased and will order more for my car, etc.  </li>
      <li>Also, I find the point to be a plus on cuticles -- it gets under them and removes the excess effectively, you just need a steady hand.</li>
      <li>This file does a very good job of paring them down.  </li>
      <li>I had not remembered who made that file, but one day I accidently came across Pfeilring on the internet and was I ever excited.  </li>
      <li>Many years ago, I bought my first of these nail files at the airport in Geneva, Switzerland.  </li>
      <li>I like the clean look of it.</li>
      <li>This file works so smooth and quick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a nail file - nothing special</li>
      <li>Pfeilring Sapphire Nail File was one of the products offered during an Amazon special promotion.  </li>
      <li>Shorter than I expected, but great file.</li>
      <li>Both sides file cleanly and quickly</li>
      <li>is a good color for a male person, like myself, who does not mind being seen using them.</li>
      <li>Full message enclosed.</li>

      <li>This file makes quick work of filing your nails, and the embedded diamonds do their job.</li>
      <li>Cuts quickly.  </li>
      <li>side isn&#x27;t labeled any more... but the \\&quot;fein\\&quot; side IS marked, so you can easily tell which side is which just by looking, and  you can certainly feel the difference.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Handy purse size. Wish I could tell by  looking which side is the finer one or if both sides are the same.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and it works well</li>
    <li> GREAT nail file.  Love these way better than those glass ones.</li>
    <li> These work well and small enough to carry</li>
    <li> This nail file seems durable and feels like it will \\&quot;hold up\\&quot; for a lifetime.  I like the extra space (size of a penny) of the smooth handle because it makes its use easy on the fingers and its white color is a good color for a male person, like myself, who does not mind being seen using them. The reason why I use a nail file is because I have a neuro-muscular disease, called Friedreich&#x27;s Ataxia (FA), which is supported by MDA.  My hands are so weak and uncontrollable that I can only file my nails instead of just using a nail clipper in bed; I&#x27;m also bedridden.  For the many years I have had this disease, MDA has done nothing for FA victims - not even a simple treatment! My physical problems get worse over time - at the moment, it even took me gruelling hours to type this message!  So now, I can only file my nails.</li>
    <li> My wife said this works better than any nail file she has ever used. And cut her file time in half.</li>
    <li> Substantive, nice quality, good size.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for 2 days but so far it files my nails much faster than the emoryboard nailfiles I get from my mom. I am handicap and do not have ability to  properly use nail clippers so like the other reviewer I am limited to just filing my nails. In addition, I agree that the file does appear to be durable and will last a lifetime of use. I also like the neutral color which is appropriate for guys like us who can only use nailfiles. The package it comes in can even be used to store it when not in use.</li>
    <li> Works ok...tip is very sharp and tends to dig into the nail</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist so I have to file my nails extremely short daily. This file is perfect for me. It also works well if you use jamberry nail stickers since it doesn&#x27;t tear them like other styles of nail files can.</li>
    <li> My nails will split in a moment. I needed to have a nail file that I could keep with me at all times. This is working out just great for fast repairs. It has a good filing surface that hopefully will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was buying Revlon brand files at Walgreen&#x27;s. How much better can a nail file be? Revlon is only about $5 and this was is closer to $20. But, it&#x27;s totally worth it. It files more cleanly, and faster, because the surface holds more dust, I guess. It feels nice to hold, and is easy to maneuver. I bought one for my mom and she loves it, too. If you file a few times a week, why not turn a chore into a nicer experience?</li>
    <li> Just as I was in the market for a new nail file, the 13cm Pfeilring Sapphire Nail File was one of the products offered during an Amazon special promotion.  A manicurist suggested that rather than using cream cuticle removers or nippers, I push back my cuticles and then smooth the dry excess with a good nail file.  I found this worked quite well, but needed a new metal file to accomplish the task; I prefer a glass file, which is too thick for this task for my nails.  The 13cm Pfeilring Sapphire Nail File has worked quite well for my purposes.  The thumb indent on the handle is a particularly nice feature and makes holding this file a pleasure.  Nevertheless, there are several factors which kept me from rating the 13cm Pfeilring Sapphire Nail File as a 5-star product.  The tip of the file is pointed, rather than rounded.  The \\&quot;blade,\\&quot; at only 3\\&quot; long, is less than the length of pointed items on the TSA-permitted list.  However, I prefer not to have my luggage searched and would hesitate to include the 13cm Pfeilring Sapphire Nail File in my carry-on.  The grit is identical on both sides of the file.  For my personal use, this is not an issue.  However, if I were using the 13cm Pfeilring Sapphire Nail File on my nails, I would have preferred a shaping grit on one side and a finishing grit on the other.  There is no slipcase included with this file.  The file&#x27;s brittle plastic packaging can be used as a case, but it will likely crack and have to be discarded; it is not as compact or convenient as a slipcase would have been.  I expect the 13cm Pfeilring Sapphire Nail File to last; it is well made and seems to be of excellent quality.  However, the above mentioned drawbacks resulted in my deducting a star from the 13cm Pfeilring Sapphire Nail File&#x27;s rating.</li>
    <li> Fantastic nail file.  Great design for holding easily in the hand and files quickly and well.  A great nail file, best I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> OK. I had some old Revlon files -- very old, and wearing out. Got one in drugstore -- had no grit whatever on most of one side, what there was on the other lasted about half of one hand. Got another, grit lasted about one and a half filings before falling off. Got 3 Pfeilrings and use them on finger and toenails and they&#x27;re like new. Pretty, too -- though I don&#x27;t find that the finger pocket (or whatever it is) helps hold it all that much. I also don&#x27;t find much, if any, difference between the two sides on the Pfeilrings I have, or had -- 9cm &amp; 13 cm. (The new ones seem to have more difference between fine &amp; coarse sides--) Both sides file cleanly and quickly so what do I care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pfeilring files are made of steel -- not stamped from tin cans like other files-- and are wonderfully thin and strong. They get under my distorted big toe toenails almost as well as the [[ASIN:B001B80FTQ Body Toolz Ingrown Toe Nail File]] and they file much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like this type of file, by all means grit your teeth and spring for the Pfeilring grit, once anyway. It&#x27;s cheaper than buying 4 or 5 other mineral grit files for every 10 times you file your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be warned: they&#x27;re quite easy to lose. The files do come with a case of sorts: the packing sleeve has a flap that folds in, but this \\&quot;case\\&quot; is an awkward wide rectangle. Seems to me for the price it wouldn&#x27;t kill Pfeilring to add a ten-for-a-penny sleeve like the other brand has!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may be shorter than you&#x27;re expecting. The measurement is file plus handle: the 13 cm file is about 5 1/2 inches overall and the grit surface is about 3 inches long. They&#x27;re so efficient that small is fine, but longer is quicker. The 9cm is great to keep somewhere for emergencies, like the car glove compartment (just don&#x27;t drop it between the seats).</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected from a German company--top quality and no BS.  Prompt receipt also.  Very well pleased and will order more for my car, etc.  (No, I am not German:  Norwegian and English.)</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark. One can see it a little bit in the dark mainly because it&#x27;s white.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this item. It works great on my nails. And remains sharp. The thumb holder is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> This is a decent nail filer but when I received it the end was already peeling off when I took it out of the package. I will probably look for a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> This is much better quality than the &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; nail files I have been buying at the pharmacy.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This file has a nice grip and it does the job.  Easy to use and the tip is a plus for cleaning nails</li>
    <li> Great file for trimming fingernails or toenails!</li>
    <li> And perfect travel/purse size, although no protective case comes with it, which is unfortunate. But the quality is really top-notch, so I make do without a case, tucking it into basic cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m OCD and one of my quirks is that I cannot clip my nails since they don&#x27;t come out perfect.  Traditional emery boards have the same problem.  This nail file is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.  I wish I was kidding.  If you&#x27;re crazy, need your nails to be laser-precision perfect, and plan to file every nail just a little bit every day to keep them all the same, this is the file for you.  For the record, I only use the fine side.</li>
    <li> I bought this file along with the longer (18 cm) file.  I gave a review of that file which pretty much says it all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This file actually files my nails AND doesn&#x27;t have to be thrown away after one use.  It has both a fine side and a coarse side...just like they USED to make nail files several years ago.  I can&#x27;t understand why these types of files were discontinued - but the replacements that are found in local stores are just useless (far too expensive when you consider they&#x27;re only good for one use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a file that works, that you can use over and over again - THIS FILE IS GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I carry filers with me at all times. I have them in every room. I cannot STAND a snag or chip in my nails. OCD much, why yes, yes I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This file is the BOMB. It gets in all those nooks and crannies, and files fast and efficient. I love it. This one stays in my purse!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Fits nicely in my hand.</li>
    <li> This nail file is just so, so. Would not buy again.  Wish it had been a little wider and longer.</li>
    <li> Was fine on first use.  The next time I went to use it the tip was peeling back a think layer of the metal on it.  waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I bought my first of these nail files at the airport in Geneva, Switzerland.  I loved the file, and it has remained in excellent working condition for years and years.  The newer version I just purchased from Amazon it slightly different from my older one.  On the new ones, the fine side (marked \\&quot;fein\\&quot;) is not quite as fine as my old one, and it is the only side that is labeled (the grittier side on my old one was marked \\&quot;grob\\&quot;).  Contrary to what another reviewer said, new one does have two different grits -- it&#x27;s just that the gritter (\\&quot;grob\\&quot;) side isn&#x27;t labeled any more... but the \\&quot;fein\\&quot; side IS marked, so you can easily tell which side is which just by looking, and  you can certainly feel the difference.  While the newer version is not as perfect as the old one, it&#x27;s still wonderful enough to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Shorter than I expected, but great file.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this nail file. The same day I received it, the tip of the file separated so the file portion began to pull away at the tips. I only cleaned the nail bed once! Anyway, has to purchase something more durable</li>
    <li> I bought these to because they look identical to my old Hoffritz nail file, which I&#x27;ve had for many years but the grit has slowly been wearing out.  The file doesn&#x27;t have a coarse and fine side like the old one, but that&#x27;s OK with me.  Time will tell how well the grit holds up.    UPDATE:  The grit has held up very well.  Although expensive, this nail file is clearly a high quality item and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> in the 1960&#x27;s I had purchased a manicure set with a Pfeilring nail file included.  Several years ago, my nail file went missing.  I have purchased about ten different files trying to get the same feel and results of the original one I had but to no avail. I had not remembered who made that file, but one day I accidently came across Pfeilring on the internet and was I ever excited.  It is pricey, but am SOOO  VERY  GLAD  I purchased it.  No other files seem to come close to the speed and smoothness this file gives.  If you purchase it, you will not regret it!!!</li>
    <li> File has the perfect amount of grit to do the job and fine tune.  Seems as though this one will last.</li>
    <li> Good well made brand.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best fingernail file ever. I had my last one for over 20 years and would still be using it today had my aunt&#x27;s dog not chewed it up. Kind of expensive, but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought this to have a relatively long life solution for filing toenails. Turns out - for me at least - this file is a bit too short for the toenail application. This file DOES work great for fingernails, however.</li>
    <li> I expected much more for the price. I would not purchase another.</li>
    <li> Pricey but this is the perfect size. I used it on a tough job for one nail and it performed better than I thought. As one reviewer said, it is a BIT bendy so you may find yourself applying pressure on top of the file with your finger but really this thing is sharp enough that you don&#x27;t need to press it so hard against your nail that the file itself begins to bend. You can relax a bit - the sapphire WILL work its way through your nail, even thick nails.</li>
    <li> This nail file is very effective. I was able to file my toenails down fairly fast, and it didn&#x27;t shred up the nail at all, very smooth. My only complaint is that the metal is a bit thin, and easily bends as you are using the file.</li>
    <li> Perfect nail file. Well-made and sharp, I expect it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works very well and lasts.</li>
    <li> I had one I bought 40 years ago that finally wore out.  It&#x27;s not as good as that one was but I have bought worse.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail file. My ten year old file still work but wanted a different shape. Would recommend this brand. Great for shaping your pet nails after cutting too.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  This nail file works very quickly and efficiently.  There&#x27;s no \\&quot;bite\\&quot; on your finger using either side.  I&#x27;m giving it a 4-star since it is a bit&lt;br /&gt;pricey, but ... so far, so good!  Try it.</li>
    <li> The best file I have ever owned.  Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> this  file  is  very  easy  to  manage and  small  enough to  be  versatile for even  filing  the  tightest of spaces from  hands  to  feet.I we tell  anyone  that  asks that  yes  this  is a good buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a nail file - nothing special so it&#x27;s a bit pricey but not worth the bother to return it.</li>
    <li> This Pfeilring nail file works very well and gives great results. The length is ideal for a manicure, and so is the convenient depression for the thumb - makes for a better grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to another reviewer&#x27;s assessment, this file does have two different sides - one coarse, and one fine. It even says so (in German though) on the one side - \\&quot;fein\\&quot;, which means \\&quot;fine\\&quot;. I for one can definitely feel a distinct difference in filing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I am not fond of and which is the reason for the 1 star deduction is that the handle is not rounded but square. I don&#x27;t find that particularly comfortable. It is not a really big deal but I would have preferred a rounded handle. At this price, the file should be perfect. Other than that I am very happy with the product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a longer file like this for 10+ years and I needed another one for my travel case.  This one is perfect.  These files are by far the best I&#x27;ve seen.  Easy to grip and stays sharp.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it, great file, expect a long life, bought the other sizes. length indicated is total length including the handle</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a teeny tiny nail file............not the normal length pictured..........It must be returned.........Full message enclosed. need postage paid envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem with this return?  Geraldine Keane 206 659 4688........  (my Amazon critique name.........Jane Bond)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this nail file a couple of months. It looks and works exactly as the description claims. I guess that something and since Amazon would like a review, how say that this nail file works as well as any nail file of ever owned and suspect you too will be satisfied with your purchase.</li>
    <li> Perfect file. I even use it my dogs nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t buy manicure items often, but I had a nail file that came with the kit for 10+ years. I always hated it and I needed something stronger and something that files quicker. I finally went on amazon and checked reviews, because that&#x27;s the only way you can predict if you will like it or not. This file works so smooth and quick, I really like it. I&#x27;m happy now.</li>
    <li> This file was a little more expensive, but way more effective than what I am used to.  The handle is a little bit uncomfortable.  It would be nice if that feature were taken care of.</li>
    <li> I have small hands for a man, yet I find the handle to be  too short and thin for a comfortably firm grip; it also has square corners that push against the skin of the hand. Revlon&#x27;s handle is definitely better on both counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Pfeilring Sapphire is great, especially in the ease of shaping the nail while filing. Also, I find the point to be a plus on cuticles -- it gets under them and removes the excess effectively, you just need a steady hand.</li>
    <li> This will destroy your long nails. As a guy, I appreciate the ability to keep them in check.</li>
    <li> Love this metal nail file. I could have gone with a smoother grit but it is great.</li>
    <li> This a nail file that every girl should have. It files great and doesn&#x27;t leave straggly edges on your nails. You can shape your nails and smooth them off. It stays sharp enough to do the job every time.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was tired of her buying the stuff from dollar store.</li>
    <li> Just the right size and it has lasted quite a while.  Easy to use, high quality, beats other nail files I bought at same time.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail file.  It was the best quality for the price that I could find on Amazon.  She uses it all the time and loves it.  Santa got some major points this past Christmas!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is the smaller of two versions, only 13-cm long or a little over five inches. The other is two inches longer but this is just fine. It appears that the sapphire grit is more coarse on one side than the other but both give an incredibly smooth result, equal to that obtained on the good old fashioned emory boards. There was nothing said in the product literature on the base material but I suspect it is chromed steel. I hope it does not rust over time.  My order arrived on time as expected with Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> Sharp.  Cuts quickly.  Double sided, fine and coarse.  It should last for many years.</li>
    <li> I like this file very much.  Works great!</li>
    <li> A very tough nail file that doesn&#x27;t break!  Finally!  After some disappointing experiences with a crystal files, I was a little bit hesitant to actually buy this fearing that this too would break on me or not be as effective.  I was glad to be proven wrong.  Very good for filing your finger nails and strong enough even for your toes!  No more jagged corner nails!!  Yes, you will pay a little more than your average nail filer, but I truly believe this was worth the price.</li>
    <li> It does what I need it to do. Is well made and of a proper size. I would buy aother if needed</li>
    <li> Had a sapphire nail file for years -- and then lost it.  It&#x27;s good to have one around again.</li>
    <li> It does a good job even if you forget to rinse it between uses.  My nails grow very fast and are as hard as nails (the carpenter type).  This file does a very good job of paring them down.  I do wish it were a tad longer.  The useable surface of my metal file was twice as long, so it took a few times to get comfortable with this file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Things I Like:  It&#x27;s fast.  There is a heavy grit on one side for grinding, a lighter grit on the other for smoothing.  The point is sharp and does a good job of cleaning under the nail.  I like the clean look of it. And it has a protective cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I Wish Was Different:  The protective cover is pretty flimsy. I would not want to carry this file in my backpack or a purse with heavier items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this file goes to The Great Scrape Heap In The Sky, I will buy another one.</li>
    <li> Works well and does a good job with easy handling.  Would purchase another.</li>
    <li> Finally, a file that works like the ones from years ago. This file makes quick work of filing your nails, and the embedded diamonds do their job. Forget cheap files which do not work and get this one. It will last and eventually turn out to be less expensive than the cheap ones. The size is perfect for carrying in a purse or travel case.</li>
    <li> So good, I ordered the folding travel version as well....</li>
    <li> This file is exactly as described.  I think it is a little pricey but it does the job.  It&#x27;s sturdy and seems like it will hold up well.</li>
    <li> Not at all worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used Pfeilring products for over 50 years and would never consider changing to another brand.  Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> The material on the blade is very good, takes off nail material quickly.  However, the end is way too pointy and sharp, and I&#x27;ve stuck myself in the finger with this file several times already. It needs to be rounded off like most other quality nail files.  I won&#x27;t be ordering this style again.</li>
