<ol>
      <li>Best mascara out there!</li>
      <li>Best mascara ever!!!!!</li>
      <li>And will happily sign a petition to Maybelline.</li>
      <li>But I have ordered on line for it twice and its still working great.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
      <li>I am SOOO  HAPPY.....</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find my favorite mascara on amazon.</li>
      <li>and I believe it is a good product</li>
      <li>a good purchase would never order again</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many mascaras over the years and this is the one that works best for me.  </li>
      <li>I love how the style of this brush works, its truly amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>(I use soap and warm water).</li>
      <li>By far the best mascara that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>The mascara arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s all in good condition.</li>
      <li>I love it and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
      <li>favorite mascara in the world, but Maybelline d/c&#x27;ed it.</li>
      <li>I. LOVE.</li>
      <li>but I love this line.  </li>
      <li>I feel that I should get more out of this then 3 weeks .</li>
      <li>This was my favorite mascara</li>
      <li>It has been discontinued so it was nice to get nice new products.</li>
      <li>The seller was right on with great, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Maybelline quit making this product many years ago and those of us who loved it looked everywhere to buy the last ones.  </li>
      <li>After buying probably hundreds of dollars worth of mascara to try (and return thanks to Walgreens and CVS return policy) I finally found a drug store mascara that delivers the awesome length, lift, and fullness without clumps that Lash Stylist did.</li>
      <li>I love the comb  as it really picks up the lower lashes</li>
      <li>But was overall very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>The comb is fine enough that it goes on easily</li>
      <li>one I received was kind of dry and clumpy</li>
      <li>Very disappoinment!</li>
      <li>The product was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>The product drys up to fast</li>
      <li>the black was not dryed out much better product</li>
      <li>This statement is mainly due to the wand, which I have not been able to find a similar style or knock-off anywhere.  </li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s not that working out for me</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s 5 years old inside the tube.</li>
      <li>There is no guarantee its not dried out inside.</li>
      <li>Pretty much lasts all day but by evening I notice little flakes around my eyes so therefore the 4 stars.</li>
      <li>Can only get it on line and it scares me wondering how old they are????  </li>
      <li>This mascara is my favorite because it makes your lashes long and dramatic.</li>

<li> So expensive online since there are so few left, but I keep coming back for more</li>
<li> - it doesn&#x27;t have big clumps here and there like other products.</li>
<li> cause I really liked it the 1st 3 days.  :{</li>
<li> this mascara makes my eye lashes soooo long!!!</li>
<li> guess this item is discontinued and the few left are therefore  </li>
<li> Even the brownish black color I ordered was dark enough and cheaper than the very black options.</li>
<li> are not right off the press ..</li>
<li> And I agree that if you didn&#x27;t tell me it wasn&#x27;t black, I wouldn&#x27;t notice.</li>
<li> Just wish the comb teeth were a little longer.</li>
<li> The product is dried out!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
<li> I am only sad that they won&#x27;t reissue this wand.</li>
<li> not sure why.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not totally easy to remove but it isn&#x27;t difficult either</li>
<li> please bring it back maybelline :(</li>
<li> Hard to find this style of comb on the market and sad they have discontinued it.</li>
<li> The worse mascara I ever used....</li>
<li> So ladies, dump Maybelline (because I&#x27;m sick of them discontinuing my mascaras) and dump buying this old, dried up, over priced, online crap and run to Walgreens and get the L&#x27;Oreal Butterfly Mascara.    </li>
<li> I used to use it all the time till it got discontinued sadly.</li>
<li> Not happy with it !!!!!</li>
<li> Thin consistence and bad quality!</li>
<li> So I just had to have it and was so disappointed with the product itself that I took the 2 out of 3 that I bought and gave them to her at CVS.</li>
<li> very disappointed</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re selling it for outrageous prices.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Some time ago, I came across this comb [by another maker], then it became a hard-to-find item.&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of COMBing the mascara on my eyelashes, rather than brushing.</li>
    <li> The mascara arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s all in good condition. I&#x27;m just so thankful I can find this stuff somewhere because it is my all time favourite mascara and you can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore...not sure why.</li>
    <li> By far the best mascara that I have ever used.  This statement is mainly due to the wand, which I have not been able to find a similar style or knock-off anywhere.  I&#x27;m open to suggestions...... And will happily sign a petition to Maybelline.</li>
    <li> This mascara is my favorite because it makes your lashes long and dramatic. Even the brownish black color I ordered was dark enough and cheaper than the very black options. Hard to find this style of comb on the market and sad they have discontinued it.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s not that working out for me but I hope eventually it will and I believe it is a good product</li>
    <li> caused a reaction to my eyes. caused swelling and itching. very disappointed cause I really liked it the 1st 3 days.  :{</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find my favorite mascara on amazon. I am only sad that they won&#x27;t reissue this wand. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not totally easy to remove but it isn&#x27;t difficult either (I use soap and warm water). I definitely like the wand - it doesn&#x27;t have big clumps here and there like other products. And I agree that if you didn&#x27;t tell me it wasn&#x27;t black, I wouldn&#x27;t notice. Pretty much lasts all day but by evening I notice little flakes around my eyes so therefore the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Someone at CVS recommended this to me, now discontinued. So I just had to have it and was so disappointed with the product itself that I took the 2 out of 3 that I bought and gave them to her at CVS. Not the seller&#x27;s fault, just the product itself.</li>
    <li> I have used the maybeline stylist comb before for my lower lashes then it was not being sold anywhere so I found it online at amazon .This one I received was kind of dry and clumpy so I have been using it with a different maybeline mascara guess this item is discontinued and the few left are therefore  are not right off the press ..I love the comb  as it really picks up the lower lashes so I will just have to use it with a different mascara as that does the same job .</li>
    <li> The product is dried out!&lt;br /&gt;Not a good purchase would never order again the black was not dryed out much better product</li>
    <li> Best mascara out there! I wish it was not discontinued!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many mascaras over the years and this is the one that works best for me.  I know each woman is different but I love this line.  Can only get it on line and it scares me wondering how old they are????  But I have ordered on line for it twice and its still working great.</li>
    <li> Wish they still carried this mascara in the store.  I love it and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  The comb is fine enough that it goes on easily</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever!!!!! please bring it back maybelline :( this mascara makes my eye lashes soooo long!!! I used to use it all the time till it got discontinued sadly. I cant find one with a brush thats even somewhat close to this one. I love how the style of this brush works, its truly amazing!</li>
    <li> After buying probably hundreds of dollars worth of mascara to try (and return thanks to Walgreens and CVS return policy) I finally found a drug store mascara that delivers the awesome length, lift, and fullness without clumps that Lash Stylist did. It&#x27;s L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly mascara. It comes with a very similar comb brush. I. LOVE. IT!!    So ladies, dump Maybelline (because I&#x27;m sick of them discontinuing my mascaras) and dump buying this old, dried up, over priced, online crap and run to Walgreens and get the L&#x27;Oreal Butterfly Mascara.    You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I wanted.  It has been discontinued so it was nice to get nice new products.</li>
    <li> The worse mascara I ever used....In short time after covering crumbs of mascara under your eyes...Thin consistence and bad quality! Very disappoinment!</li>
    <li> Like it. Just wish the comb teeth were a little longer. But was overall very pleased with my purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite mascara but this ha been discontinued for 5 years. I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re selling it for outrageous prices. I know it&#x27;s sealed &amp; all but it&#x27;s 5 years old inside the tube. There is no guarantee its not dried out inside. I wish Maybelline would bring this mascara back.</li>
    <li> For years, I used comb on mascara and then one day i could not find it any where.  The brush just doesn&#x27;t work for me, it never has.  I am SOOO  HAPPY.....</li>
    <li> Not happy with it !!!!! The product drys up to fast I feel that I should get more out of this then 3 weeks .</li>
    <li> Well gals, I think our time has run out.  Maybelline quit making this product many years ago and those of us who loved it looked everywhere to buy the last ones.  We have been held hostage by people charging a lot of money for this product because they knew they could.  I think the shelf life has run out on this product.  I purchased two tubes from this seller and there is not enough useable mascara in the tube to show up on my eyelashes.  I guess it is time to cut my losses and look for another brand.  The seller was right on with great, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> favorite mascara in the world, but Maybelline d/c&#x27;ed it. So expensive online since there are so few left, but I keep coming back for more</li>
