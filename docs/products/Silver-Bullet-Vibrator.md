      <li>It was great for the first day...</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Cute.</li>
      <li>nice size bullet, smooth non scratchy material.</li>
      <li>This item is my favorite of all times:)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want my parents or whoever receives my mail knowing what I buy:)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap and affordable!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how wonderful this mini silver bullet is.., buy it.</li>
      <li>That blows cuz I really liked it at first!</li>
      <li>Loud but amazing!</li>
      <li>Wow this thing is powerful and it works great.</li>
      <li>Also putting batteries in the one that they sent to me is a b*tch you have to fight with the thing in order for the batteries to fit in it.</li>
      <li>TO EVEN TURN A LIGHT SWITCH ON</li>
      <li>This is by far her favorite one, if she chooses, this is the toy she reaches for EVERYTIME!</li>
      <li>This item carries a normal sound, but there is more friction with the vibrations.  </li>
      <li>It was great the first time I used it but wouldn&#x27;t even turn on the second time.</li>
      <li>This cute little bullet may seem like a good deal</li>
      <li>You can get an orgasm so quick with this within 2mins.</li>
      <li>Ok so the first few times I used it, the thing was AMAZING!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite thing.</li>
      <li>Powerful.</li>
      <li>But considering the cost , it was worth the money .</li>
      <li>, it gets the job done for me on the lowest setting but can also be set to a pretty powerful vibration, and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it.</li>
      <li>When I first got didn&#x27;t think it was going to do the job.</li>
      <li>&quot; You&#x27;ll release that tension over and over again with this product ;)</li>
      <li>Nothing wrong with it at all, just a very nice product!</li>
      <li>Uses two Double A batteries, easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that is intense, keep shopping, because this isn&#x27;t what you want.</li>
      <li>The power system has lasted me longer than other eggs that cost a lot more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quiet, multi-levels of vibration and compact and very handy&lt;</li>
      <li>batteries last for a decent amount of time.</li>
      <li>but it is the complete opposite.</li>
      <li>Some things are worth spending a few extra dollars on.</li>

<li> Some things are worth spending a few extra dollars on.</li>
<li> Did not live up to the hype.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t like this at all, it broke almost immediately and required a rubberband to hold the battery case closed.  </li>
<li> I have bought a few different items for my partner and i to play with.  </li>
<li> Isn&#x27;t what at all what I expected .</li>
<li> I have used other similar products in the past and this does not come close to them.</li>
<li> Never a let down.</li>
<li> i did end up replacing this thing less than 2 years after purchase</li>
<li> It takes u to heaven in less than 3 minutes..</li>
<li> It has ridiculously long battery life (I&#x27;ve been using it for probably 8-9 months now, at least 4 times a week, and I&#x27;ve never once had to change the batteries)</li>
<li> but every few months the wire goes to hell</li>
<li> DO NOT BY THIS ITEM WASTE OF MONEY !  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on those 30$ or even 20$ toys, this does the trick!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just as powerful as those bullets that are outrageously priced.</li>
<li> The speed was very slow.</li>
<li> not even the one in photo, this thing SUCKS piece of crap waste of cash unhappy would not buy again</li>
<li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
<li> It  is uncomfortable to use....</li>
<li> The material was made very poorly.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t b disappointed. .</li>
<li> These are horrible</li>

    <li> Excellent product. Thank You so kindly. Great Service!!! Will buy again in the future.</li>

    <li> Isn&#x27;t what at all what I expected . It needed to go faster . But considering the cost , it was worth the money .</li>
    <li> This item is my favorite of all times:) It&#x27;s cheap and affordable! Nothing wrong with it at all, just a very nice product!</li>
    <li> Decided to grab one of these as a replacement to another bullet that had died and well, they do say you get what you pay for.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that is intense, keep shopping, because this isn&#x27;t what you want.</li>
    <li> This does not work like it said in the reviews. I have used other similar products in the past and this does not come close to them.</li>
    <li> not even the one in photo, this thing SUCKS piece of crap waste of cash unhappy would not buy again</li>
    <li> OMG!!  This is a GEM.  If you need a quickie, this is it.  I use it all the time. Get it!!!</li>
    <li> Ok so the first few times I used it, the thing was AMAZING! But then all of a sudden it just stopped working! That blows cuz I really liked it at first!</li>
    <li> Wow this thing is powerful and it works great. You can get an orgasm so quick with this within 2mins. I perfer bullet than my rabbit lol. The price is great you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have bought a few different items for my partner and i to play with.  This is by far her favorite one, if she chooses, this is the toy she reaches for EVERYTIME!</li>
    <li> The item in the picture i have been using for years! but every few months the wire goes to hell &amp; i always have to reorder. When this silver bullet got to me it in no way looked like the one that i have been using for years &amp; looks nothing like the one that is in the item description picture... that bothers me. Also putting batteries in the one that they sent to me is a b*tch you have to fight with the thing in order for the batteries to fit in it. Shipping also took forever! but it gets the job done &amp; that is the only reason why it got three stars lol.</li>
