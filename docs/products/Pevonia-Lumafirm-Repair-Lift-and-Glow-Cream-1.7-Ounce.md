      <li>It&#x27;s odor free and not greasy.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s brighter, smoother, and looks more fresh.</li>
      <li>I smooth this cream all over my face</li>
      <li>face feels tightened and smooth and</li>
      <li>Easy to use container and an adequate amount to let you feel like using the product generously and not running out after a couple of applications.  </li>
      <li>kinda cool.</li>
      <li>it absorbs in quickly</li>
      <li>like the old stuff better</li>
      <li>Makes my skin super smooth and not oily and dry like most skin product.</li>

      <li>Fabulous product for mature skin.</li>
      <li>This is the second Lumafirm product I have tried, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>BUT, I received my Amazon order and was for the first time thoroughly</li>
      <li>We most likely will purchase this again</li>
      <li>Very small amount needed and does a great job with firming and wrinkle reduction.</li>
      <li>his would be fine for a younger girl who doesn&#x27;t need as much intense hydration.</li>
      <li>This stuff works really well to tighten skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old and feel like this Lumairm is worth the dollars.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!!!!My</li>
      <li>This was recommended by my aesthetician and I really like the lightweight feel</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>While it was new it worked well however after a couple of months is had evaporated to the point</li>
      <li>Lumafirm Repair Lift and Glow was new to me.</li>
      <li>I have spent much more on other creams, but this one consistently out performs.</li>
      <li>Many people comment about my youthful and firm skin!</li>
      <li>but recently felt I needed a boost in certain areas...namely neck and and around the mouth and chin.</li>
      <li>my skin texture have&lt;br /&gt;improved considerably.</li>
      <li>-I don&#x27;t see dramatic results so far, but between it and the serum, my skin tone does look nice.</li>
      <li>, Seems like a little goes a long way! :)</li>
      <li>It has definite firming action and absorbs completely into my skin.  </li>
      <li>Once applied, which is a breeze, it makes my getting to be droopy old lady skin feel a bit tighter and mysteriously look brighter...</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for women with dry oily skin</li>
      <li>If a product promises you the sun, moon and stars, beware, I have seen no difference when using this, Expensive, and could use coconut oil and whipped egg whites for better results , both which cost less and isn&#x27;t full of thing</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this cream can really fill in all my wrinkles, but I do like the slight glow my skin has after I put this on in the morning.</li>
      <li>Very pricey product with little longevity.</li>

<li> It is a very slight tint to it</li>
<li> Not sure this product lives up to the recommendation....</li>

<li> Terrible product, feels like I just rubbed glue on my face, hence exaggerating every fine line.</li>
<li> at least that is how it felt.</li>
<li> Goes on thick feels think and shows on the skin</li>
<li> I have used Pevonia products for years and they have seriously saved my skin.</li>
<li> this is my secret.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a tad expensive.</li>
<li> NOT happy!</li>
<li> it was a dime sized lump of rubber-like substance that became useless.</li>
<li> was very thin cream.  </li>

    <li> This is the best of the best...from the very first use, my skin is firmer and younger looking.  I have tried several other products, and this is the only one that I would recommend.  Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> Haven,t been using this very long, but I feel like it has made an improvement on the way my makeup goes on, Seems like a little goes a long way! :)</li>

    <li> i love this cream!makes your skin feel so smooth and glowing.I will definately get it again.Pevonia have a great products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m familiar with this product and love it! BUT, I received my Amazon order and was for the first time thoroughly disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a bit go I unwrapped the packaging, unscrewed the lid, and the foam covering over the product was glued on... at least that is how it felt. I could not get it off! I peeled two small pieces off, then tried to get a bigger piece off and my photo below speaks for itself. Those product splotches are at least ten uses of this product since you need so little of it for face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor... you best be emailing me about this. NOT happy!</li>
    <li> This was about my third jar.  I would not be without it anymore.  I&#x27;m 66 years old and feel like this Lumairm is worth the dollars.</li>
    <li> I use it faithfully, a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m over 60 and people can&#x27;t believe my skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Makes my skin super smooth and not oily and dry like most skin product. Highly recommended for women with dry oily skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks. It seems to be working. I like that it absorbs in quickly but sometimes I use Pevonia Power Repair Firming Marine Elastin Cream on top of it.  I have used  the Marine Elastin Cream for years and love it but recently felt I needed a boost in certain areas...namely neck and and around the mouth and chin. I&#x27;ve researched other products but usually go back to Pevonia because there are no chemicals and I&#x27;ve never had any reactions. If I plan to use makeup over the Lumafirm, I just use a tinted moisturizer and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.After I use my hyaluronic Acid serum I smooth this cream all over my face and I&#x27;m ready to go!!!!My face feels tightened and smooth and alittle glow goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Best face cream I have used. I have spent much more on other creams, but this one consistently out performs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this cream can really fill in all my wrinkles, but I do like the slight glow my skin has after I put this on in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product is $30 cheaper than at my spa and it works the same. I love it and will order it over and over!</li>
    <li> love it , fast ship&lt;br /&gt;trust which is very great business relationship with customers.&lt;br /&gt;buyers need to trust them  and buy it because i have great positive feel with them.</li>
    <li> I am not too happy with this cream. it leaves you a little sticky.</li>
    <li> I have used Pevonia products for years and they have seriously saved my skin. Lumafirm Repair Lift and Glow was new to me. It is kinda odd...when you open the container the cream is tinted! I didn&#x27;t expect that. Once applied, which is a breeze, it makes my getting to be droopy old lady skin feel a bit tighter and mysteriously look brighter...kinda cool.</li>
    <li> This product is lightweight and non-greasy.  I use it on top of my vitamin c serum.  I just started using it a week ago-I don&#x27;t see dramatic results so far, but between it and the serum, my skin tone does look nice.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of my skin; feels plumped up.  I am 65 and it is as good as it gets for me.</li>
    <li> Terrible product, feels like I just rubbed glue on my face, hence exaggerating every fine line. Boo!</li>
    <li> Product always works well</li>
    <li> I will never go without this product. I didn&#x27;t have to wait months to see an improvement. It literally took days.</li>
    <li> was very thin cream.  like the old stuff better</li>
    <li> Great product.  Pevonia is a wonderful line and when I get compliments over my skin I let them think it is just because of good genes...this is my secret.</li>
    <li> I like Pevonia products, they are made with good quality ingredients and do what they say. This stuff works really well to tighten skin. Smooth, smells nice, not greasy. It is a very slight tint to it so I use it at night or if I&#x27;m going out with no make up on.</li>
    <li> This is the second Lumafirm product I have tried, and I love it.  It has definite firming action and absorbs completely into my skin.  Thanks, Pevonia, for another great product!</li>
    <li> While it was new it worked well however after a couple of months is had evaporated to the point it was a dime sized lump of rubber-like substance that became useless. Very pricey product with little longevity.</li>
    <li> To water based for me.  I am 51 looking for more of a line corrector.  his would be fine for a younger girl who doesn&#x27;t need as much intense hydration.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream for the first time an applied in the evening before bed.  I woke up in the middle of the night all swollen and red beneath my eyes.  Im not sure what ingredient caused this but I cannot use this.  I had night hopes too.</li>
    <li> In one word &amp;#34;terrible&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m 24 and have noticed such a difference in the appearance of my skin- it&#x27;s brighter, smoother, and looks more fresh. Will definitely repurchase this again. It&#x27;s just a tad expensive.</li>
    <li> Along with the eye Contour cream, I use this face cream regularly with great results! Many people comment about my youthful and firm skin!</li>
    <li> If a product promises you the sun, moon and stars, beware, I have seen no difference when using this, Expensive, and could use coconut oil and whipped egg whites for better results , both which cost less and isn&#x27;t full of thing I can&#x27;t pronounce</li>
    <li> Not sure this product lives up to the recommendation....After using the entire jar I did not notice any lift or glow</li>
    <li> Goes on thick feels think and shows on the skin</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful foundation or concealer.  Easy to use container and an adequate amount to let you feel like using the product generously and not running out after a couple of applications.  We most likely will purchase this again</li>
    <li> This cream definitely helps plump wrinkles and make them less noticeable.  It also helps with dry skin.  It&#x27;s odor free and not greasy.</li>
