      <li>I would still highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Nothing else had actually made my hair feel so soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>For years, I purchased Abba Moisture Sensation shampoo and True Mint conditioner at a local hair salon or beauty supply.  </li>
      <li>I live in FL so it is always humid.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is also really nice and leaves my hair just really soft and clean feeling without over drying the ends or being so heavy that it makes my scalp oily after a few hours.</li>
      <li>I have lots of  long fine hair and the extra weight &amp; moisture is a pain.</li>
      <li>I have had EXTENSIVE testing of products over the years, and without a doubt this is the pinnacle of hair care, if you have dry hair or dandruff there is simply NOTHING better out there.</li>
      <li>Hair feels and looks better than ever, hardly any frizz &amp;</li>
      <li>It could be that I am protein sensitive and this has quite a bit of protein in it.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so natural using this product.</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair and it works well for my curls.</li>
      <li>I use this product all the time makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
      <li>As a note, even a little amount of shampoo creates a rich lather, so don&#x27;t over squeeze.</li>
      <li>so I had wash first with a name-brand dandruff shampoo, which helped my scalp but left my hair feeling like yarn, and follow with a second wash of moisturizing shampoo to get rid of the first.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to snyone with dry hair..</li>
      <li>I have long hair which tends to be dry, and mild dry scalp/dandruff/eczema issues as well.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for over 20 years and when I tried other options once it wasn&#x27;t available in store anymore, I was never able to find anything comparable.  </li>

<li> I have dry frizzy coarse hair.</li>

<li> Eventually my local vendors stopped carrying it and moved on to newer (not better) products.  </li>
<li> Actually made my hair feel hard and brittle.  </li>
<li> I have slightly dry, fairly thick combo curly/wavy/straight hair.  </li>
<li> I usually can&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair with other shampoos but with this knee you already  feel your hair being moisturized.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried using moisturizing shampoos and conditioners but they always end up making my hair too oily and heavy feeling.</li>
<li> ABBA products have been getting hard to find in salons</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really difficult for me to find a shampoo and conditioner that keep my hair in check.  </li>

    <li> It makes your hair dry.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  I have no clue why.  I&#x27;m a guy.  But she thinks this is the best place to buy it so save money.  I can identify with that.</li>
    <li> Item as described,fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product, I havent found anything that makes my hair feel and behave as well.  ABBA products have been getting hard to find in salons so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> soothing to the scalp, makes the hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my hair after the disaster DermOrganic made my hair. DermOrganic made my hair a birds nest and then Abba came along to repair the damage. Just amazing. Already recommended to friends</li>
    <li> I never heard of this product. I saw it in Healthy Living magazine. Best shampoo ever! I have dry frizzy coarse hair. Hair feels and looks better than ever, hardly any frizz &amp; There&#x27;s  no harmful ingredients</li>
    <li> This is really the best moisturizing shampoo&amp; conditioner I ever tried. Used them for more than a year. Nothing else had actually made my hair feel so soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Great service wonderful product</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and condition. I have natural curly hair and it works well for my curls.</li>
    <li> For years, I purchased Abba Moisture Sensation shampoo and True Mint conditioner at a local hair salon or beauty supply.  Eventually my local vendors stopped carrying it and moved on to newer (not better) products.  I have long hair which tends to be dry, and mild dry scalp/dandruff/eczema issues as well.  Abba was recommended to me by my stylist and it worked wonders.  I was often complimented on how my hair shined &amp;#34;all the way down&amp;#34; and asked what I used on it.  After I could no longer purchase these products locally, I tried a variety of different brands from beauty supply stores and department stores over a long period of time and was never really happy with any of them.  No one product did everything I needed it to do so I had wash first with a name-brand dandruff shampoo, which helped my scalp but left my hair feeling like yarn, and follow with a second wash of moisturizing shampoo to get rid of the first.  Finally I decided to look for Abba online and, while the products/formulas have changed a bit from what I was accustomed to, I&#x27;m so happy I tried them.  Abba&#x27;s Pure Moisture shampoo and conditioner have helped me love my hair again and I&#x27;ve been able to do away with the dandruff shampoo entirely.  Love the minty scent and the refreshing tingle on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Love the minty smell and it works wonders... My hair feels so natural using this product. I am sold ere</li>
    <li> I have been using ABBA pure basic/complete for 10+ years. Since they no longer make it, I have tried different kinds. I have dry scalp, so thought this moisture shampoo would be a good choice. It sure does what it says with providing moisture. After I wash my hair it feels very heavy &amp; will not completely dry. I have lots of  long fine hair and the extra weight &amp; moisture is a pain. But like I said it delivers on what it&#x27;s supposed to do, so I gave it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I could notice the growth of my hair in two weeks.  I not crazy about the pepper mint smell but that&#x27;s ok. I love how it makes  my hair feel healthy.  Very great product l will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I have slightly dry, fairly thick combo curly/wavy/straight hair.  It&#x27;s really difficult for me to find a shampoo and conditioner that keep my hair in check.

    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner.  It has the cleanest and most wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Nice moisture content for my dry hair.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  Actually made my hair feel hard and brittle.  It could be that I am protein sensitive and this has quite a bit of protein in it.</li>
    <li> Other shampoos and conditioners leave my hair weighed down and clumpy, especially when it is humid. I live in FL so it is always humid. After using these refreshingly minty smelling products, my scalp feels tingly and my hair is shiny and light. If you have thin hair, you&#x27;ll really like it beach each individual strand will not stick to another. Definitely makes your hair thicker. I let my GF try it whose used countless shampoos/conditioners and she was amazed. Buy it and you&#x27;ll never want another brand!</li>
    <li> The BEST shampoo and conditioner IN THE WORLD!  Have been using it for over 20 years.  Now my son has discovered the magical properties.  My dry, coarse hair loves it.</li>
    <li> Great product and prices. Quick, delivery.</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying I&#x27;ve been a barber for 16 years I have had EXTENSIVE testing of products over the years, and without a doubt this is the pinnacle of hair care, if you have dry hair or dandruff there is simply NOTHING better out there. I recommend this to all my clients who have those issues, and I am a long time user myself. Plain and simple... short of a horrendous medical condition, you will never have flakes if used as directed. The smell is great and it is 100% natural and vegan.</li>
