### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!  </li>
      <li>This makes it perfect for applying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
      <li>One of my best friends and her mother both swear by this product and the moisturizer, so it may just depend on your skin.</li>
      <li>Hyaluronic acid, soluble collagen and algae extract; what a great combination!</li>
      <li>The serum itself is wonderful, but the bottle leaves something to be desired.  </li>
      <li>Great Seller!  </li>
      <li>Whenever I use this product faithfully, people always comment on my beautiful skin (two people in one week in fact) and I&#x27;m 46.</li>
      <li>and I am quite happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>My skin is gorgeous when I use it.</li>
      <li>but this is good for the price.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>This is a reasonably priced wonderful product.</li>
      <li>It has a nice grapefruit-ish scent.  </li>
      <li>Best Hyaluronic Acid Firming Serum out there as far as I am concerned.</li>
      <li>I feel it was worth the price and a good value.</li>
      <li>Had better</li>
      <li>I really love the smell of this hyaluronic acid gel.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!!.</li>
      <li>Being able to press my palms on my skin and lifting really does seem to plump up the skin as they showed me at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, but that is about it.</li>
      <li>I find it also helps smooth and plump  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly and is absorbed easily.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product that leaves your skin smooth and &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; and  a bargain compared with other, similar products.</li>
      <li>and I prefer a more sustainable option, even if it costs a few pennies more.  </li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s plastic</li>
      <li>I have used this product since November of last year and love it.</li>
      <li>but at least it feels nice and is light on my skin.  </li>
      <li>the skin on my forearms that I have noticed becomes &amp;#34;old looking&amp;#34; especially during the winter months here in the White Mountains of AZ where the humidity is quite low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply somewhat sparingly and follow with a good moisturizer... I often use coconut oil.</li>
      <li>Very considerate seller.</li>
      <li>I really like.</li>
      <li>Seemed to help both light and deep wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Really makes a difference in skin&#x27;s elasticity - seems to tone and make skin firmer.</li>
      <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
      <li>If you put too much on your makeup won&#x27;t go on as well over it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The serum itself goes on pretty smoothly as far as serums go.  </li>
      <li>Have used product in the past and liked it.</li>
      <li>My skin is more toned, character lines are less noticeable and I like the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>My cheeks and neck are still tight and dry, even though I put it on damp skin and use good</li>
      <li>have purchased 9 bottles so far and shared them with friends who also rave.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell if it helped to firm my skin but overall, my skin looked better.</li>
      <li>Also, wrinkles seem to smooth out and become less deep.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not greasy and if anything could seem drying - I use it in the morning only and always follow with either the Now moisturizer or 100% Pure tinted moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It IS cheap, and while my other serum worked really well on my combination skin by hydrating the dry parts and not making the other parts oily, this one does @#$^</li>
      <li>It may be an incompatibility issue with other substances or that I applied too much...</li>

<li> The gel base is soothing.</li>

    <li> Very considerate seller. Have used product in the past and liked it. Seemed to help both light and deep wrinkles. I couldn&#x27;t tell if it helped to firm my skin but overall, my skin looked better.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that leaves your skin smooth and &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; and  a bargain compared with other, similar products.</li>
    <li> Had better but this is good for the price.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t seem like the same quality i got from the spa which&lt;br /&gt;plumped my skin. this does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;i guess you get what you pay for and i wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this hyaluronic acid gel. I will definitely buy it again I feel it was worth the price and a good value.</li>
    <li> This serum is so lite. I use all the Organic NOW products. Not tacky at all!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend enough</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It has a nice grapefruit-ish scent.  The serum itself goes on pretty smoothly as far as serums go.  I use it in the morning under my make up and I am quite happy with the results.  My skin is more toned, character lines are less noticeable and I like the way it makes my skin feel.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I am 59 and although I don&#x27;t have wrinkles on my face, my neck and hands were showing my age. This has smoothed out both as well as vastly improving the nasolabial fold lines. I use it all over my face, neck and hands. I find it also helps smooth and plump  the skin on my forearms that I have noticed becomes &amp;#34;old looking&amp;#34; especially during the winter months here in the White Mountains of AZ where the humidity is quite low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply somewhat sparingly and follow with a good moisturizer... I often use coconut oil. There have been a couple of times where this has started to slough off after applying cream or oil over it. It may be an incompatibility issue with other substances or that I applied too much... I will test it at some point. However, if it happens I just wipe it off with a tissue and reapply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer a glass bottle with a dropper but I really haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the pump it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased 9 bottles so far and shared them with friends who also rave. I will definitely buy again and again and again...</li>
    <li> I really like. Thanks!!!!. I will be ordering  yet!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really makes a difference in skin&#x27;s elasticity - seems to tone and make skin firmer. Also, wrinkles seem to smooth out and become less deep.</li>
    <li> The serum itself is wonderful, but the bottle leaves something to be desired.  First, it&#x27;s plastic and I prefer a more sustainable option, even if it costs a few pennies more.  Second, the pump doesn&#x27;t always work properly and it&#x27;s difficult to get the last bits of the serum out of the bottle.  The product itself, though, is terrific!</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably priced wonderful product. It dries quickly and is absorbed easily. I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT IT.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid, soluble collagen and algae extract; what a great combination! Whenever I use this product faithfully, people always comment on my beautiful skin (two people in one week in fact) and I&#x27;m 46. It makes your skin glow, smooths the wrinkles so they aren&#x27;t as noticeable, and firms it as well. My skin is gorgeous when I use it. I shake it well and don&#x27;t put too much on, just a little goes a long way. If you put too much on your makeup won&#x27;t go on as well over it. I like to wash my face and leave it damp to apply the serum. This makes it perfect for applying.</li>
    <li> Best Hyaluronic Acid Firming Serum out there as far as I am concerned. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I ran out of my other Hyaluronic Serum from the spa. Thinking, they are probably all the same anyway why not buy the cheapest? Noooooo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS cheap, and while my other serum worked really well on my combination skin by hydrating the dry parts and not making the other parts oily, this one does @#$^&amp; all. My cheeks and neck are still tight and dry, even though I put it on damp skin and use good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also not sticky or tacky, which in my book is a BAD thing. Being able to press my palms on my skin and lifting really does seem to plump up the skin as they showed me at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, but that is about it. I have been using it for 10 days without improvement. So there you go... not all the same. Maybe I have just been spoiled</li>
    <li> Had used this product in the past, seems to have changed in consistancy - is thinner.  Works great!  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still making up my mind on this product.  In my 30s and trying to combat forehead wrinkles.  Not sure this is doing anything but at least it feels nice and is light on my skin.  It&#x27;s definitely not greasy and if anything could seem drying - I use it in the morning only and always follow with either the Now moisturizer or 100% Pure tinted moisturizer.  One of my best friends and her mother both swear by this product and the moisturizer, so it may just depend on your skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since November of last year and love it. I have ordered again and will continue to do so. The 1oz cylinder will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff works over time. It is not a permanent fix but lessens deep wrinkles and almost completely removes small ones. Have tried other hyaluronic acids and they didn&#x27;t work as well. The gel base is soothing.</li>
    <li> Item was just as described and shipped promptly!  Great Seller!  I highly recommend!</li>
