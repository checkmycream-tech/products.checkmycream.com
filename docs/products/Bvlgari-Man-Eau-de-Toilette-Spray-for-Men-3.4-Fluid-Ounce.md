      <li>Nice perfume with a cool scent....</li>

      <li>shipped so fast and smells good</li>
      <li>Clean, light scent straight out of the box and good for daytime use.</li>
      <li>If it’s for yourself – then it’s fine</li>

      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>The smell isnt what i expected, it was more of strong alcohol smell.</li>
      <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING AND</li>
      <li>I really like this cologne!</li>
      <li>I decided to check Amazon after getting home and was really glad I did because in the store this same bottle was $80.  </li>
      <li>You should have this one because womans really like the smell!</li>
      <li>Was on time with shipment, as described, and exactly what I wanted at a food price.</li>
      <li>Personal preferences aside, Bvlgari is my all time favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
      <li>Every time I wear this I get compliments and just the other day got hit on and told I smelled amazing.</li>
      <li>It is not too strong or masculine but definitely has the presence of cool manly scent.</li>
      <li>Just love wearing this when going out, as it&#x27;s suitable for work, casual, or just a fun night out .</li>
      <li>Seller shipped fast.</li>

      <li>This item has a little strong smell, I like it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s distinctly masculine &amp; not overpowering.</li>
      <li>We looked around for a salesperson but it was near closing time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a whole lot less here and is exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>Sweet, dusty, “old closet-y”, and kinda ‘candy shop meets scented candles isle in supermarket’ type o’ deal!</li>
      <li>Very soft, extremely desirable fragrance.</li>

<li> And does not last long.</li>
<li> The smell dosent last long, the bottle was leaking and so the perfume spills out each time i spray it.</li>
<li> Bvlgari Man Eau de Toilette has a very specific smell… clearly, not for everyone.</li>
<li> it arrived in less than a week - far earlier than I expected</li>
<li> Although, if it’s gonna be a present for your friend or a co-worker… be very careful, he may not like it at all!</li>
<li> I am not satisfied with this product at all, doesn&#x27;t even have any smell, I use this product before.</li>
<li> I have just used the perfume for a few weeks, and noticed its a fake.</li>
<li> that I’ve disappointed my friend with this present!</li>
<li> and you will see what I mean!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s VERY subtle, but it&#x27;s there...</li>
<li> Made in Italy - how can you go wrong?  </li>
<li> A fake product.....</li>
<li> I am so disappointed in Amazon for selling a fake product.</li>

    <li> I got this for my husband and it&#x27;s my favorite cologne. Smells so good. Will be getting another when he runs out.</li>
    <li> So many compliments for this smell!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite &amp;#34;everyday at the office&amp;#34; fragrance. I am planning to stockpile it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original. And does not last long.</li>
    <li> love this smell! got it for my boyfriend for christmas. he loved it.</li>
    <li> It is non-existent after an hour or two.</li>
    <li> Great scent great presentation....</li>
    <li> my husband love it and i love it too :)</li>
    <li> Bvlgari is a handsome fragrance for a gentleman.</li>
    <li> todo lo que es bulgari es bueno esta fragancia me encante pueden comprarla sin ningún temor cada vez que me lo pongo alguien me pregunta el nombre de la fragancia perdura todo el día en el cuerpo y la ropa tengo mucho tiempo usando bulgari en las diferentes versiones</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Was on time with shipment, as described, and exactly what I wanted at a food price.</li>
    <li> I see the same bottle at Macy&#x27;s and instead of spending $82 (not counting taxes) This is way better cheaper and it LEGIT!!</li>
    <li> If it’s for yourself – then it’s fine, I hope you already know what you’re getting, right?! Although, if it’s gonna be a present for your friend or a co-worker… be very careful, he may not like it at all! Please, don’t make rush decisions based on reviews and comments. They’re mostly biased and misleading, truth to be told! (and again, unless you’re 100% sure, that your friend likes that scent!). Bvlgari Man Eau de Toilette has a very specific smell… clearly, not for everyone. Sweet, dusty, “old closet-y”, and kinda ‘candy shop meets scented candles isle in supermarket’ type o’ deal! Yeah! And I regret it big time, that I’ve disappointed my friend with this present! (He didn’t say a word though, but his wife did!). Hey, I ain’t questioning Bvlgari fragrance quality and whatnot, but still…</li>
    <li> This is great cologne.  Feel free to buy a bottle and send it to me at any time.  Rich.  Sophisticated.  So what if the &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; in Bulgari and Man aren&#x27;t the same!  Its olfactory poetry.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic! It&#x27;s long-lasting and I get nothing but compliments.</li>
    <li> Personal preferences aside, Bvlgari is my all time favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  The fragrance is fantastic. Many of my friends and co-workers really like it!</li>
    <li> My husband loved the scent of this! It is not too strong or masculine but definitely has the presence of cool manly scent. It also stays throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great Buy!!! Don&#x27;t pay the mark ups of the big retail stores! Shop around and you will see what I mean!</li>
    <li> Just love wearing this when going out, as it&#x27;s suitable for work, casual, or just a fun night out . Has a sophisticated, manly scent that gets noticed.</li>
    <li> Every comment was, &amp;#34;That is so fresh, and clean,&amp;#34; or, &amp;#34;What is that?&amp;#34;  I classify this as a &amp;#34;Must Have!&amp;#34;  A welcomed addition to the lab!</li>
    <li> The product is very good, and the price was fantastic. I totally recommend this item for men, I like the fragrance very much.</li>
    <li> Clean, light scent straight out of the box and good for daytime use. It&#x27;s distinctly masculine &amp; not overpowering. But scent does dissipate quickly and I am okay with it. Better to be light rather than over the top with cologne anyway. Seller shipped fast.</li>
    <li> smell is perfect and nice, I really like it. you got to buy, you will not regret for it x</li>
    <li> The price was good and it can quickly!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel fully dressed when I go out for the evening unless I&#x27;m wearing my Bulgari Man cologne.  I get compliments on the fragrance almost every time I wear it.  It&#x27;s VERY subtle, but it&#x27;s there... just right.</li>
    <li> The smell of this cologne is really good and it attracts people.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have purchased this for my husband. It is very classy and not overpowering. He has received many compliments from other people when he wears it. I highly recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice perfume with a cool scent....Happy I got it for less from Amazon</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in Amazon for selling a fake product. I have just used the perfume for a few weeks, and noticed its a fake. The scent was good at the beginning, but now it has absolutely no scent. A fake product..... please do not buy.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good spray. i like it.</li>
    <li> The smell dosent last long, the bottle was leaking and so the perfume spills out each time i spray it. The smell isnt what i expected, it was more of strong alcohol smell. I will advice you contact the seller before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this I get compliments and just the other day got hit on and told I smelled amazing.</li>
    <li> I wandered over to the mens fragrance counter at an upscale department store while my wife was shopping for an outfit.  The lady showed me this product and gave me a sniff.  I really liked it but told her I needed my wife&#x27;s ok.  Later we both returned and could find no one there to help us, but the sampler bottle was still on the counter.  After my wife got a whiff she wanted to buy it on the spot.  We looked around for a salesperson but it was near closing time and we couldn&#x27;t find one.  I decided to check Amazon after getting home and was really glad I did because in the store this same bottle was $80.  It&#x27;s a whole lot less here and is exactly the same.  It came in a sealed box in record time.  Made in Italy - how can you go wrong?  Could not be more pleased.</li>
    <li> shipped so fast and smells good but I still love TOUCH by burberry! My husband is happy with this one,too! I guess depending on person</li>
    <li> Very soft, extremely desirable fragrance. I have been complimented several times by people I have hugged. Mmmm....you smell good.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle, my husband loved it...amazing price</li>
    <li> This has been my scent for years.  I love it!  It lasts all day and I get compliments all the time about &amp;#34;you smell great!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it arrived in less than a week - far earlier than I expected</li>
    <li> Great men&#x27;s purfume. My husband and son love it.</li>
    <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING AND JUST WHAT I WANTED TO GIVE AS A GIFT. THE PRICE WAS GREAT!</li>
    <li> I really like this cologne! You should have this one because womans really like the smell!</li>
    <li> This item has a little strong smell, I like it.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with this product at all, doesn&#x27;t even have any smell, I use this product before.</li>
