      <li>and it is perfect;</li>
      <li>the price, I&#x27;d call this a \\&quot;best buy.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>goes on great</li>
      <li>it prevents chipping and has great shine I would buy this again</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Great product for amazing price.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with how quickly this top coat dries.  </li>
      <li>This is THE best clear polish I have found, even way better than OPI.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for many years and have had no problems with it at all.  </li>
      <li>Love it and such a great deal!...</li>
      <li>it is what is says, TOP COAT.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>So, I went to Target and purchased this top coat.</li>
      <li>I ordered this nailpolish #271 which is supposed to be a TOP COAT</li>
      <li>It works a lot better with their brand too.</li>
      <li>Avoid at all costs, their nail polishes are better than this top coat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more.</li>
      <li>The only thing this top coat is good for is if you want your nail polish to chip off within 24 hours.</li>
      <li>I used this top coat for the first time and it cracked within 8 hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using NYC&#x27;s &#x27;Grand Central Station&#x27; as a top coat for months, not realizing that it wasn&#x27;t really a top coat...</li>
      <li>Considering how incredibly low priced this top coat is it&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and shiny and is fine applying, but makes bubbled and cracks in polish, and causes even dry nails to get nicked and smudged easily.</li>
      <li>I looked at many top coat reviews prior to purchasing the NYC brand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a product do this so quickly.</li>
      <li>It was super shiny upon application.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
      <li>I do recommend the &#x27;Grand Central Station&#x27; clear polish as a top coat though...lasts for weeks and looks fantastic!</li>
      <li>Even without a top coat, regular nail polish lasts longer than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am who wants a nail polish that cracks up and peels off as soon you put it on.</li>
      <li>In about 30 seconds my nails are dry to a light touch.  </li>
      <li>It is very shiny but, my entire manicure cracked and fell off within the first hour.</li>
      <li>This top coat made my nail polish chip in less than 24 hours after putting it on and I was so disappointed because my nails looked great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s harder to remove, but that&#x27;s a good thing because it will also last a long time.</li>
      <li>it was a clear polish.</li>
      <li>This does nearly the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to do, making the entire polish peel off my nails within a day!&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention despite how evenly I apply it, it gets huge airbubbles inbetween coats which further damaged and cracked the polish beneath.</li>
      <li>but they sent me #138B which is a clear nail enamel.</li>
      <li>Please do not waste your time or money purchasing it.</li>
      <li>It is very shiny on application, however by the second day it is closer to matte.  </li>
      <li>My nails aren&#x27;t as shiny as the &#x27;Grand Central Station&#x27; made it, and my polish started cracking and chipping within a few hours!</li>
      <li>It chips easily and is already gooey and hard to apply.</li>
      <li>Applied a THIN coat of NYC shiny top coat</li>

<li> It chips easily and is already gooey and hard to apply.</li>
<li> Applied a THIN coat of NYC shiny top coat</li>
<li> When it finally does dry it chips and destroys your nails.</li>
<li> Bought this from Target for cheap, and its the worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
<li> I did a french manicure on my nails using Sally Hansen extreme wear in white and Essie ballet slipper.  </li>
<li> I wanted shiny and long wearing.</li>
<li> It is a little harder to remove, but it is so durable that is likely the reason.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product has gotten so many bad reviews.  </li>
<li> This is the WORST top coat ever!!</li>
<li> I agree with whoever said regular nail polish lasts longer without putting this awful &amp;#34;long wearing&amp;#34; top coat on!</li>
<li> worst top coat I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
<li> Was a good price, but the quality is so horrible</li>
<li> I bought this about a month ago and it is THE WORST top coat I have used.</li>
<li> It also got thick after a few months.</li>
<li> I am upset I got the wrong product and secondly that this product is absolute crap.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s gummy and hard to remove.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smear or remove the color polish on your nail (OPI does) and leaves a thick, shiny, protective coating.</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> If you lay the polish on very, very thickly, it does crack when it dries.</li>
<li> As another reviewer mentioned, it is way cheaper to buy locally--don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so expensive online.  </li>
<li> this nail polish is worthless and chips off almost completely in less than a day!</li>
<li> It has never cracked, chipped, or performed badly in any way.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Horribly disappointed.</li>
<li> Do not use this product as a base coat...</li>
<li> I am going to try again, using a base coat, a color and then NYC.</li>
<li> I brought this about a month ago and have been hating the crap out of it.</li>
<li> I may have forgotten the base coat.</li>
<li> did another manicure; used an opi base coat.</li>
<li> It looks horrible and is now chipping off.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s horrible!</li>
<li> What a horrible product!</li>

    <li> This is THE best clear polish I have found, even way better than OPI. It doesn&#x27;t smear or remove the color polish on your nail (OPI does) and leaves a thick, shiny, protective coating. It&#x27;s harder to remove, but that&#x27;s a good thing because it will also last a long time. I do NOT, however, recommend buying this online. You can get this for a dollar at Target and don&#x27;t have to pay 5 dollars for shipping, which is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous product, though! Love it!!</li>
    <li> its okay but it yellows and cracks after about a day.</li>
    <li> Considering how incredibly low priced this top coat is it&#x27;s actually pretty good. I bought it almost a year ago and have been using it since. Good product.</li>
    <li> This does nearly the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to do, making the entire polish peel off my nails within a day!&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention despite how evenly I apply it, it gets huge airbubbles inbetween coats which further damaged and cracked the polish beneath. I guess I got what I paid for..</li>
    <li> worst top coat I&#x27;ve used by far. It goes on nice and shiny and is fine applying, but makes bubbled and cracks in polish, and causes even dry nails to get nicked and smudged easily. Was a good price, but the quality is so horrible I&#x27;d rather pay more. It also got thick after a few months.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST top coat ever!! Please do not waste your time or money purchasing it. It does not make your polish last longer. It makes your nail polish chip the very same day!</li>
    <li> I ordered this nailpolish #271 which is supposed to be a TOP COAT but they sent me #138B which is a clear nail enamel. I tried it on and it CRACKED up and peeled off like in one hour. I am upset I got the wrong product and secondly that this product is absolute crap. I am who wants a nail polish that cracks up and peels off as soon you put it on.</li>
    <li> I looked at many top coat reviews prior to purchasing the NYC brand. I wanted shiny and long wearing. It is very shiny but, my entire manicure cracked and fell off within the first hour. I am going to try again, using a base coat, a color and then NYC. I may have forgotten the base coat. It was super shiny upon application.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I did another manicure; used an opi base coat. Applied a THIN coat of NYC shiny top coat and it is perfect; 3rd day and still shiny. Do not use this product as a base coat...it is what is says, TOP COAT.  5 stars. Great product for amazing price.</li>
    <li> I did a french manicure on my nails using Sally Hansen extreme wear in white and Essie ballet slipper.  I used this top coat for the first time and it cracked within 8 hours.  It&#x27;s been 2 days and I haven&#x27;t had time to remove it.  It looks horrible and is now chipping off. I&#x27;ve never had a product do this so quickly. What a horrible product!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with how quickly this top coat dries.  It&#x27;s not advertised as a fast-dry polish, but it works that way for me.  In about 30 seconds my nails are dry to a light touch.  I purchased my bottle from a big box store for under a dollar and have had zero problems with cracking or peeling off.  If you lay the polish on very, very thickly, it does crack when it dries. It is very shiny on application, however by the second day it is closer to matte.  It does not stand up to repeated hand washing without some dulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, I&#x27;d call this a \\&quot;best buy.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This top coat made my nail polish chip in less than 24 hours after putting it on and I was so disappointed because my nails looked great! I agree with whoever said regular nail polish lasts longer without putting this awful &amp;#34;long wearing&amp;#34; top coat on! I will not buy again and DO NOT recommend</li>
    <li> I brought this about a month ago and have been hating the crap out of it. It&#x27;s gummy and hard to remove. When it finally does dry it chips and destroys your nails. Seriously. Avoid at all costs, their nail polishes are better than this top coat. It works a lot better with their brand too.</li>
    <li> Love it and such a great deal!...goes on great it prevents chipping and has great shine I would buy this again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product has gotten so many bad reviews.  I have been using it for many years and have had no problems with it at all.  It is a little harder to remove, but it is so durable that is likely the reason.  It has never cracked, chipped, or performed badly in any way.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is way cheaper to buy locally--don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so expensive online.  If you want to try it, buy a bottle locally for about $1 at Walmart, CVS, or any place that sells NYC products and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> IMMEDIATELY took the color - nail polish - off my nails!!!  The color/nail polish transferred to this product&#x27;s brush!!!</li>
    <li> The only thing this top coat is good for is if you want your nail polish to chip off within 24 hours.</li>
    <li> this nail polish is worthless and chips off almost completely in less than a day! i guess you get what you pay for, i am going back to Wet &amp; Wild.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month ago and it is THE WORST top coat I have used. It chips easily and is already gooey and hard to apply. I am NEVER buying this again.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Target for cheap, and its the worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried. The nail polish cracks almost instantyy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using NYC&#x27;s &#x27;Grand Central Station&#x27; as a top coat for months, not realizing that it wasn&#x27;t really a top coat...it was a clear polish. So, I went to Target and purchased this top coat. It&#x27;s horrible! My nails aren&#x27;t as shiny as the &#x27;Grand Central Station&#x27; made it, and my polish started cracking and chipping within a few hours! Even without a top coat, regular nail polish lasts longer than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horribly disappointed. Threw it away immediately. I do recommend the &#x27;Grand Central Station&#x27; clear polish as a top coat though...lasts for weeks and looks fantastic!</li>
