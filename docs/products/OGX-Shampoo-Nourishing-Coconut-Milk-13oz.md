<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Leaves my hair feeling squeaky clean and smelling like a tropical island.  My hair is also a lot more voluminous because it&#x27;s not weighed down by anything heavy in the shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to stick with this shampoo for a looooong time.</li>
    <li> Will buy again.  Works great and has a good scent</li>
    <li> Terrific smelling, great lather.  Good quality.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I usually use the WEN Fig Cleansing conditioner and ran out. I have wavy, blonde, highlighted hair that requires TLC so decided to give this product a try.  I was drawn in by the \\&quot;organic coconut milk\\&quot; and \\&quot;whipped egg whites\\&quot;.  I was hoping for and expecting silky soft hair but what I got instead was a matted mess of straw.  I used both the shampoo which left my hair extremely rough and tangled followed by the conditioner. I was hoping the conditioner would help detangle my hair, but it did not.  I had to raid my daughters bathroom for her condtioner and shampoo and re-wash my hair just to get a comb through it followed by hair shine.  My hair was a frizzy mess.  It DOES smell great but this isn&#x27;t much help if your hair does not look great a well.  I guess you get what you pay for. I will be going back to my Fig WEN.</li>
    <li> I personally am a big fan of all things coconut and this shampoo is amazing! It cleans really well and my hair feels dry when i wash it out but when my hair dries its very silky. i do have to use it along with the conditioner because i have really thick hair but i definitely would recommend!!</li>
    <li> Best smelling shampoo I have ever had. Once you coconut milk you don&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> Got it on a friend&#x27;s recommendation - never again.  Strips my hair of all oils - much more frizzy than before.</li>
    <li> LIGHT WEIGHT AND HAS HELPED WITH SPLIT ENDS</li>
    <li> this is definitely my favor!!</li>
    <li> Been using the product for about a year now and I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, isn&#x27;t stripping or drying, and doesn&#x27;t fade-out my highlights. I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> The Organix product line is the best out there by far! I have extremely curly frizzy hair and this is what I call a miracle hair product. I don&#x27;t understand why others are posting negative reviews because they think it is organic? Nowhere on the label does it say the product line is certified organic if people would just read it, you can&#x27;t just assume. I recently went from naturally dark hair to almost platinum blonde, I bought this to help repair my hair and my hair is now softer than before I started bleaching. A MIRACLE!</li>
    <li> I always thought coconut milk is good for you on your hair. Just started using this, so far I like it. Only issue is the consistency, very thick but not a deal breaker. Would wait for few weeks to update my review.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find an organic, sulfate-free, cruelty-free shampoo that smelled like coconuts.....my favorite scent!  How disappointing when I washed my hair for the first time only to discover this delicious smelling shampoo had turned it into straw!  I washed 4 more days, hoping it was a fluke.  Nope - dry and frizzy...gross!  For reference, I have fine hair - but a lot of it and its color-treated.</li>
    <li> This product smelled really good but thats the only good part. I have long hair and when I got out of the shower it was in a huge rats nest, even after I brushed it before getting in the shower. I sprayed tons of leave in conditioner on it and still hard a hard time getting a brush through it. After it dried it was limp and gross feeling. Do not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get fooled by the name of the company - Organix.  Ingredients include:  DISODIUM LAURETH-3 (skin &amp; eyes IRRITANT)  SULFOSUCCINATE (SOMETIMES USED AS PESTICIDE  Cocamidopropyl BETAINE: POTENTIAL allergen  Dimethicone: silicone oil  alcohol: no comment  PANTHENOL-DL  Polyquaternium-10 PEG  DISTEARATE PEG-23  Stearate Dmdm hydantoin  Make informed choices. Check cosmetics ingredients on the EWG&#x27;s skin deep website.   Bad for your- bad for your hair.</li>
    <li> first off I bought this shampoo because of NO Animal Testing.  Loved the smell and found it mild enough to use as a body wash. Worked fine on my straight hair, not too heavy . My SO accidentally knocked the bottle over in the tub and left it.not sure how long it was on the tub but Wella ! it had removed the iron stain from our hard water . I poured some out and sure enough the orange stain was gone . I can not stand harsh chemicals so I just leave the build up. Ugly orange tub is now splattered with pure white. I have to go buy some more and do the entire tub. This result was obtained without even scrubbing. I kid you not!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I love the smell but it leaves my fine hair feeling a bit weighed down and oily.  Would probably work better on other hair types.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and makes my hais soft and shiny.  I ordered 6 bottles the first time and I will order more soon!!!</li>
    <li> I did not purchase  this from Amazon, but locally so this is no reflection on the seller, nevertheless...please read.  I am not really one to leave reviews, but in this case, I hope to help someone avoid a potential hair disaster.  I have never had such a terrible shampoo experience!  My hair is long and thick and generally in very good condition - thick, shiny etc...  I was drawn in by the coconut scent.  As reviewed by others, the smell is indeed fantastic, however even in the shower I discovered that something just was not quite right.  Squeaky-clean is generally regarded as a good thing, BUT not in this case.  I could slightly detect a bizarre &#x27;waxy&#x27; texture.  After shower, when drying, my hair felt waxy/sticky and just not like it had been cleaned.  Drying it is a whole other thing.  Dry and stripped, tangly and not the least bit silky smooth.  Left like a bale of hay and the shine my hair usually has is gone! - replaced by a dull matte finish along with that weird waxy layer.  Not a desirable combo.  I am now in full-on repair mode trying clarifying shampoo, conditioning and even trying a remedy recommended - using DAWN DISH SOAP.  Mind you, this was after just ONE use.  I just hope I can find a cure and not have to wait until my hair grows new.  PLEASE, think twice before being lured by the nice coconutty smell!!!</li>
    <li> Finally got a miracle shampoo it makes my hair smooth and shines</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 11 months ago because it was sulfate free, then stop using because of a few negative comments, in favor of a more expensive product...my hair was pissed at me for that. I couldn&#x27;t seem to maintain growth as much as I had while using this product, so after an expensive search I gave up and went back to it a couple of months ago, and have held on to a couple of extra inches of hair. And the ph is 4.5 which is perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> Sounds like most people love the scent but that&#x27;s it!  I am also a Coconut Milk \\&quot;Junkie\\&quot;, if you will, the shampoo feels good and love the way it lathers, but since I use a different organic conditioner, it leaves my hair perfect.  However, when I&#x27;ve used the Organix Coconut Milk conditioner, it does NOT soften my hair at all, it leaves it actually dry and hard to comb through.  So, the shampoo gets a 4, though I wonder if all ingredients are as natural as they claim, since they do not sell it at Whole Foods or other organic stores. There may be a preservative or fragrance that is not allowed there but we definitely love the smell and the paraben/sulfate free concept!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair soft and shiny. Also a lot of  definition to my waves. Will recommend this product in the future.</li>
    <li> While it smells good at first, the smell lingers and quickly becomes over powering. It made my scalp itch and dried my hair. Read and heed the excellent review by the lady who lists the shampoo&#x27;s toxic ingredients. Really sorry I purchased it. Should have done more thorough research on it.</li>
    <li> I took this shampoo, and the coconut milk conditioner, on vacation thinking it would be a nice scent when vacationing. It was. The scent is lovely. That&#x27;s it, however. My hair has never been drier or more unmanageable. I thought it was because I was in the sun and ocean every day, and bought a deep conditioner, but nothing would bring my hair any moisture while using this shampoo (even putting the deep conditioner on at night and not rinsing it out ). After using it for 2 weeks, my hair is beyond repair. I have medium-long color treated hair, and have never had any issues with &#x27;summer dry hair&#x27;. I had to get 6 inches cut off of it today to bring it back its old luster. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I indulged myself with this shampoo thinking that it would be good for my hair to get some t&amp;t after being stressed. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair or use a flat iron but this shampoo dried out my hair beyond belief. After less than a month my boyfriend wouldn&#x27;t put his arm around me because my hair was to rough, whenever I wore it down it frizzed out, and I couldn&#x27;t stop itching my head, I&#x27;ve never had such a problem with my hair before. Eventually I had to cut off 5\\&quot; because it was to damaged to be saved. I changed to another shampoo for dry and damaged hair to help save it so I didn&#x27;t have to cut off more, it worked, but eventually I did have to cut off the rest of the damaged part of my hair, luckily it&#x27;s grown out now. I gave it to my boyfriends dad to use on the dog. Definitely not worth the hassle or the pain for 5 minutes of fancy smelling hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product will definitely order again</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner were on super sale and I bought into all the hype of it being \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and it&#x27;ll make my hair miraculously beautiful or something. I have blonde hair and during the winter with the dry air my hair just needs a bit more TLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought the Moroccan oil version of this shampoo and conditioner... After a week or two my hair was feeling straw like. It got to the point where shampoo wasn&#x27;t even lathering in my hair which I thought maybe the salon damaged my hair so I kept using the moroccan version in hopes it would restore my hair. Well half way through the bottle i went and cut off half the length of my hair because it was so unmanagable. Of my 28 years of existence I&#x27;ve never felt my hair be this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after that I just started using a new shampoo/conditioner after my visit to the salon. I recently found the coconut one under my sink so with it now being summer I was excited. Two uses in I&#x27;m throwing it out!!! My hair quickly turned to awful and had this rubbery dry texture to it. It&#x27;s this entire brand!!! It&#x27;s a horrible product! The instant I started using my normal shampoo my hair became soft smooth and light.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo, it leaves my baby fine hair so smooth and shiny without weighing it down.  I like to know I am using a more natural product.  I was using Samy Fat hair for years but now have changed to this.  I also ordered this for my Mom who recently went through Chemo that dried her hair horribly this is help her hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Organix shampoos for years, and love them all. I&#x27;ve tried the coconut, teatree mint, acai berry avocado, cherry blossom ginseng, and vanilla. All have been great. I have hair that is fine but thick, long, and slightly wavy. It&#x27;s not chemically treated. I&#x27;m picky about shampoo, since I wash it everyday, and don&#x27;t want to dry out my hair and I hate any residue, as it makes my hair very oily. These are the best shampoos though, as I&#x27;ve found that they really clean my hair without being overly harsh. I also like that they don&#x27;t contain parabens.   In terms of each type, I&#x27;ve found a few small differences. The coconut smells fantastic, but feels like it leaves more residue than the others. This isn&#x27;t really an issue, my hair just feels a bit more oily than with the other types.  Teatree is excellent for balancing scalp/hair, so I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone with mild dandruff. It also smells great, very refreshing and minty.  The acai berry avocado is pleasant, very fruity. The cherry blossom ginseng really smells like cherry blossoms, and the vanilla is great. I found that all of these seemed to work about the same, leaving my hair clean and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> Still trying to figure out how a product containing coconut milk, coconut oil and egg white proteins can leave hair dry.  You would think that with those ingredients it would leave your hair on the oily side.  Not so with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color treated hair comes out dry and in desperate need of a leave in conditioner.  Even after using the matching conditioner, you will still need to seek out a leave in variety just so you can comb through and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product that I do not think I will be using again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to BioInfusion Hydrating Shampoo a great product for softness, shine and volume.</li>
    <li> I would like to start this off by saying I first bought this at CVS not seeing reviews or anything, so i got online as soon as I could to read on this stuff because it seemed (and smelled) awesome. WOW there were so may horrible reviews I was almost ready to just take it back with out trying ( that would have been a huge mistake). I also saw GREAT reviews. I went with the positive reviews and gave it a try.    SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS STUFF!!!! If you are only going by the reviews, then that might be your mistake, you can only know when you try for yourself.      When I first applied the shampoo the smell was GREAT!!! I massaged it in my hair and its was so creamy and thick!!  Next was the conditioner, that was even better! I left it in my hair for about 3-5 minutes while I washed the rest of my body. When I rinsed it out my hair felt so soft, but I wanted to wait til my hair was dry, that is the real test. I have very curly long hair, so my hair tends to dry out very easy. I allowed it ti dry with NO other products, and I havent felt my hair this soft in so long, its not the next morning, and its still so silky. I LOVE this stuff, I WILL try the other scents they have.     HOWEVER I WILL SAY THAT from reading reviews, this product can either be a hit or miss with your hair. From reading other websites and reviews I have noticed that this shampoo/conditioner works well with curly hair, maybe not so much straight hair or thin hair, many of the girls who described their hair as such says it was harsh on their hair. Many with curly hair said that it worked wonderfully, and I am one of them, so hopefully that helps.</li>
    <li> Purchased both Coconut Milk Shampoo &amp; Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;@ Target before seeing these reviews (both priced under $6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING smell...I have long (mid-back) fine, thin, colored, wavy-curly hair &amp; I air dry ...it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down...(use both Shampoo/Condit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being sulfate/paraben free...no allergic reactions, no scalp tighness, no red/hot/burn/itchy scalp....scalp feels soothed.&lt;br /&gt;Ends smooth... Doesn&#x27;t seem to be pulling out haircolor- yeah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell stays -- lots of compliments; live in a very dry climate/high altitude- still keeping waves, curls...&lt;br /&gt;Keep playing with my hair...running fingers through...seems great!</li>
    <li> love it... makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> To be fair, I tried this product after years of using Matrix Biolage (a REALLY good product used in salons), so chances are I wouldn&#x27;t have liked most other shampoos. But I wanted to try something different and save money, and this product smells so good that I gave it a try.    Never again. Like other reviewers with straight, fine hair, I found that my hair feels like straw after using the Coconut Milk shampoo just two times.  I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner because I haven&#x27;t for years. Also, I air-dry my hair, don&#x27;t use curling irons and my hair isn&#x27;t colored or permed.  I thought this shampoo would be less expensive than Biolage, too, but it&#x27;s not.  The 13-oz. bottle of Organix cost just under $7 locally, and a 33.8-oz. bottle of Biolage is around $20. The Biolage is concentrated so I use less and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner. Lesson learned!</li>
    <li> I used this on me and my daughter&#x27;s hair and I had to have more of it! Walgreen&#x27;s ahd a buy one and get the other free. I also learned that this product has the only thing that can penetrate african american hair (natural). The repair serum was the best thing they ever came out with. I have to have vats of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much, I loved it.</li>
    <li> good deal and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love this shampoo. It smells so great. It&#x27;s wonderful on my hair. I am so glad a friend of mine told me aobut it. I definitely recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I usually like to review after a good use so after 8 months using this I think I&#x27;m more than ready to write a well documented review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly LOVE it! After going through several brands I finally feel like I find the right product for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I come from Venezuela where our water system doesn&#x27;t contain bleach and other chemicals so treat water. The downside of this is that we cannot (or shouldn&#x27;t) drink from the tap but is great for our hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;When I moved to the States 3 years ago, my skin and hair suffered a major damage due to the chemicals in the water.&lt;br /&gt;Went through several brands but my hair kept getting dryer and falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: is basically a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; hair, no dyes, light wavey, oily in the roots and dryer in the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended me this brand and I was hesitating due to the price. But I could see changes since the first time of use...my hair is softer, very shiny and is way easier to comb and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can spent a decent time of period without a haircut and the ends of my hair still looks great. My hair also stopped falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommed you to use the moroccan oil after the shower or blowdry, it helps to protect and hydrate your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I go to the hair salon I get compliments of how healthy my hair looks. The biggest trial was going to bed with my hair still wet (if I do that, I usually wake up with a huge messy afro) now I can do that and my hair is still very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the only downside is that my hair gets oily a little bit faster than usual, obviously due to the coconut oil. What I do now is apply the conditioner only below my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see myself using another brand in a long time, unless the professional expensive hair salon brands, gets a little more accesible for the public in terms of price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add a photo of me so you can see how shiny and healthy, my hair looks. I blowdried myselfealthy, my hair looks. I blowdried myself</li>
    <li> OK... doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as nice as some of their other products.  Wish Amazon sold the Brazilian Keratin Therapy kind.</li>
    <li> My favorite smell, now i can wear it.</li>
    <li> I never take the time to write reviews for anything, but my experience with this product was so incredibly negative that I felt the need to share it with others as a warning. I bought the Coconut Milk Shampoo to switch up my routine and I, like many others, was lured in by the smell. I used the shampoo and conditioner, then let my hair air dry and started running a comb through it, at which point CLUMPS began falling out. I combed and combed and combed, but I couldn&#x27;t run my hands through my hair without an alarming amount ripping from my scalp and coming out on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw the whole bottle away right then and there, but a month after ONE USE my hair is still dryer than normal and still knots and tears out more easily. So many strands have broken off that my hair looks uneven when tied back and I&#x27;ve considered getting a pixie cut (from lower-back length) to get rid of the damage and start over. After a single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stress enough that you should stay away from this shampoo; they must make it with battery acid. I&#x27;m going to a stylist this month who&#x27;s going to try a moisturizing treatment to save my hair, and I really hope the damage from this horrible shampoo isn&#x27;t permanent.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo quite a bit.  I have color-treated hair and I shampoo every day, so it tends to dry out.  Dry hair plus Georgia summer humidity equals frizz.  And after using this for a few weeks, I really do think the condition of my hair is improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels clean after using this.  I find that it gets out oil, sweat, etc.  (I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of packing of heavy items as well as cleaning a new house I&#x27;m getting ready to move into, so I&#x27;ve definitely tested the shampoo&#x27;s cleaning capacity.)  It is a little bit difficult to rinse out completely, which I attribute to the egg white proteins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this contains egg white proteins, it is not vegan.  (It also contains hydrolyzed milk protein and silk amino acids.)  You can scroll down the product page to see the ingredients list.  This doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates (some of the ingredients *sound* kind of similar but are chemically distinct) so it is good for color-treated hair.  (My color still looks pretty good and I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now.)  It lathers pretty well despite the lack of sulfates.  It does contain one silicone-derived ingredient, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, if you are not bothered by any of the ingredients I&#x27;ve mentioned, you may find that you really like this shampoo.  Once I work through my shampoo stash, I&#x27;m considering getting more of this.  I also like the accompanying conditioner.</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel soft and smooth. Smells so good-like coconut, no artificial smell.&lt;br /&gt;No sulfates! Feel good about using a shampoo with less chemicals.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes your hair really soft!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it makes my hair so soft. Ive been buying this same shampoo for a while now and i haven&#x27;t bought another brand.  It arrived very quickly too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Used the shampoo and conditioner twice. After the second time, I noticed my hair looked like it had a lot of split ends, While using the shamppo I thought it felt like smearing lard  on my head . Rinsing out the shampoo and conditioner was almost impossible. I was fooled into thinking coconut milk was going to be really good for my hair and now realize I have wasted my money for sure. My hair feels like straw and I hope I have not done permanent damage with this horrible product. I am just grateful that they do not test this product on animals!</li>
    <li> If paired with matching conditioner, your hair may become dry and hard to manage due to protein sensitivity or protein overload. Both the shampoo and the conditioner have protein, which can cause your hair to feel dry and not soft. This brand of haircare products do have the same ingredients that other commercial brands have, and only a few of products that are not harmful and artificial.  You&#x27;ll know whether or not this is true when you read and investigate the ingredients, and maybe test the organix products for yourself. I had purchased together the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner from a drugstore about three years ago, and because of my dissatisfaction of these products, I still have them. I did like the conditioner more because of the slip factor it gave my hair after the stiffness my hair had after I had used the shampoo.  So, now in hopes of using it up, I either use the shampoo or the conditioner as the only protein product I put on my hair while cleansing my hair with other brand of hair products that don&#x27;t contain protein.  I had also informed the organix company of my dissatisfaction but no response on their part.  I say if you desire to try this brand or any brand of haircare, know your hair--what its needs are and how it responds to the ingredients in products.  Taking this step can ensure and empower you with the knowledge you need as a consumer so you won&#x27;t be duped by so many companies that try to lure you in with commercials, pop culture and lies.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo. I love it. It leaves my hair feeling soft and silky without weighing it down. I have fine hair so I&#x27;m particular about what shampoo I buy and keep on hand. This is one of them. It smells like coconut and best part is that it contains coconut milk and oils. Best part of this one is that it is free of sulfate and Paraben.</li>
    <li> This NOT ORGANIC!&lt;br /&gt;With real organic products out there clearly and TRUTHFULLY labeling themselves as such, I would never buy this product again</li>
    <li> has never been this soft until after using this produch with the conditioner. It&#x27;s wonderful and it kind of makes my hair smell like donuts when I&#x27;m in the shower. lol love it!</li>
    <li> https://youtu.be/bMs35QLmOyw</li>
    <li> I love this product! Works great and smells really good as well! Makes my hair smooth and soft! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin/hair.  I am a Caucasian 25 year old female.&lt;br /&gt;This dried my hair out so badly.  I used the shampoo &amp; conditioner together, &amp; then yelped as I threw $20 in the trash after 2 more uses.&lt;br /&gt;After my 3rd &amp; final use, I knew I couldn&#x27;t put my hair through any more.  It strips your hair of all moisture like hair stripper!!!&lt;br /&gt;These products are NOT organic.  What a cheap marketing ploy by giving it the name Organix.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing, but not worth having a head of straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just as I said in my review of the conditioner, I love the OGX brand shampoos and conditioners. I have baby fine hair and all the OGX shampoos and conditioners make my hair feel good. I use this one to make my hair feel soft and silky without being weighed down.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but it dries my hair out a lot. Loma is much better.</li>
    <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t order this off of Amazon. I live at home with my parents and my other sister, and my sister swears off the stuff. I searched this product on Amazon to see whether anyone else was experiencing the same problems after using this product or something else is drying out my hair and it looks like I&#x27;m not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, I really hate writing negative reviews. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel good at all, so I&#x27;m willing to give the product the benefit of the doubt because it might just be my hair type not reacting well with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, I destroyed my hair by changing its colors too much - from jet black to blonde and back and vice versa experimenting with semi-permanent dyes. By the time I settled on a color, my hair was unmanageable and snapping right off. It lost about a foot of its natural length. After I began using Mane n Tail, my hair was finally on the verge of recovery. It was growing and my hair was feeling silky smooth again until roughly last month, but when my sister brought home this conditioner my hair was as unmanageable and frizzy as it was before I stopped dyeing my hair. I&#x27;m returning to the conditioner I had been using before I used this one and hope it&#x27;s just the conditioner doing this, but like I said, my sister really likes it, so I wouldn&#x27;t advise to NEVER buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have always prided myself in having luxuriously thick hair, but not after using this product.  About a month ago I purchased this shampoo thinking it would work on my hair.  It said it was organic and nourishing, so what could go wrong?  I started to notice a few more hair in my brush but didn&#x27;t think it was from the shampoo.  But then I noticed big and I mean big chunks of hair coming out and while brushing my hair I had to clean the brush 3 times at one sitting.  I went to my hairdresser and he was shocked of the condition of my hair!!!! He wasn&#x27;t sure if he should cut it real short due to the patches of no hair would show.  So he trimmed the hair and gave me a restorative shampoo to help my hair.  So far it is working.  I will Never use this again and will tell everyone I know not to use it either.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a coconut shampoo and conditioner and this set works wonderfully. I have thick, dark hair and I am always searching for products that actually do what they claim. I love this set because the ingredient list is pretty simple and the coconut scent is absolutely divine. I really like the conditioner best, as it makes my hair very soft and manageable. It does not tangle and I don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;set\\&quot; or comb it as I do after using garnier products. Overall, a good product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great and makes my hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> I started using organix a yera ago and i this by far is my favorite one! I love how soft my hair is and it doesnt seem to leave any build up. I love the smell, i sometimes combine the shampoo with the coconut water conditioner, and the combination works well.</li>
    <li> As others have already pointed out, this shampoo is NOT Organic like the brand name &amp;#34;Organix&amp;#34; suggests. It does, however smell fantastic. I love the smell of coconut milk. After one use my hair was already considerably softer.</li>
    <li> When I first got started using Coconut Oil I fell in love with it.  As time passed I slowly replaced all my household cleaners with natural cleaners containing mostly Coconut products.  When I saw this Shampoo I had to give it a try.  I was worried it would not clean the hair but it adds a shine and makes my hair feel thicker.  I have fine thin hair.  It is nice to be rid of all the toxins found in commercial shampoo products.&lt;br /&gt;I still love my Coconut Oil and Coconut products for It has been almost 2 years since I first discovered the Oil.  My house is almost toxin free thanks to it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have wavy, really pain in the butt hair to deal with.  My hair doesn&#x27;t like most shampoos I try, but this shampoo works great for me.  Hair is smooth, soft, healthy looking and manageable. And one of the best things is it does not weigh the hair down at all. It feels very clean and actually does appear nourished. I hope they keep making this shampoo and do not fiddle with the formula.  For all the bad ingredients it&#x27;s suppose to contain is sure does an amazing job. Oh, and it smells really good too!</li>
    <li> Love this! It smells really good and it lasted me a long time, plus it was a little cheaper than it would have been in the store!</li>
    <li> what do i say? wonderful stuff!!</li>
    <li> Cleans your hair of product build up. After shampoo either use the conditionair or intensive conditionair. Then use either of the coconut milk products. It works like a wrapping leave in conditioniar. The coconut milk line products are the best products since relaxers an the pressing comb. It extends your relaxer. Give natural hair styles new meaning. It protects moisturize and gives your hair a great smell without over powering intensiveness of perfume products.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the great lather this shampoo produces! It smells really nice too! The conditioner is also great. I find that I use way less of this than traditional shampoos.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and I loved how it didn&#x27;t leave my hair or my little ones hair too oily.. We both have thick hair &amp; we have been using it for about two months.. I&#x27;ve been noticing my hair falling out more than what usually falls out and notice as I brush my daughters her hair is really thin.. My hair now is so super thin it&#x27;s horrible there no more volume in it...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no longer using this product and will not recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Rinsing the shampoo and conditioner off right away makes your hair feel tangling. Seriously takes me forever to brush my hair and I have never had that problem with any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used. Smells great but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> OGX makes the best products!  I love every single one of their sulphate free shampoos, conditioners and oils.  They are salon quality at drugstore prices!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!! And I especially love the fact that it&#x27;s Organic and Sulfate Free!! Yummy smell, rich lather, and healthy for my hair. I also use their body wash. Excellent quality!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo because it seems to clean the hair without the usual repeat.  I like coconut smells, but this is very faint, so if you want a shampoo that has a strong coconut fragrance, get something else.  It was worth the money to me and a nice deviation from my usual shampoos.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo so far. Got it for my girlfriend, but it turns out it is good for guys as we&#x27;ll :)</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and the matching conditioner, because it said it provided weightless moisturizers. While the shampoo has an amazing smell, and it did provide the moisturizers they were not weightless by any means. My hair felt heavier and incredibly greasy after using it, I did continue to use it for about two weeks to see if it would improve but it did not. So overall I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something new so I bought the Organix coconut shampoo, conditioner, and the leave in split ends meander. The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner. My hair was literally in knots as it dried which forced me to get a nice haircut. The shampoo makes my hair really hard, dry, and rough. It really feels like straw. The conditioner makes my hair somewhat softer. These products smell great but its drying out my hair. I&#x27;ve only used it twice but do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews on this drying hair out. Maybe I use shampoo just to clarify and clean. I use the conditioner to do just what it says, condition. My hair loves this shampoo and conditioner line. I get amazing silky results.</li>
    <li> ... but not great. Was expecting it to be sulfate free. Anyhow, I am using it up then I&#x27;ll order something sulfate free.</li>
    <li> It smells good in the bottle.  Thats about the only good thing.  This made my hair so dry and hard to manage.  I have long curly hair, but it&#x27;s usually soft and easy to brush.  THIS made my hair feel brittle, took away the shine and didn&#x27;t even make my hair smell good.  The smell disappears once it&#x27;s in your hair.  The conditioner does nothing to help with the dryness.  Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I was in safeway looking for a decent hair product that could manage my dyed and fried hair. My hair is bad enough that letting it air dry leaves it a poofy frizzy unmanagable mess. I&#x27;ve tried all the cheaper ones(4 bucks and under) to no avail, most left my hair in worse condition then when I started.    I saw this was on sale buy one get one and figured it was worth a shot. I did not have high hopes. I picked up the shampoo and conditioner, and having been using it for two days now. My hair is already softer, less frizzy and shiny. I&#x27;ve also already noticed far less breakage.     I picked up the anti breakage serum tonight and am trying that out. For the price this is an amazing product one i will for sure be keeping in my house from now on.</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!! My hair starting falling out from this shampoo and I stopped using it 2 weeks ago and my hair is STILL falling out!!!!! I am mortified!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Soften hair, smell good, works well. Recommend.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t care about hazardous chemicals getting absorbed into your body while using this product, use it, because it does work well.  Most people see that it is \\&quot;Sulfate Free\\&quot; and they assume it doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals.  That is an incorrect assumption!</li>
    <li> I never had bought or tried it, but I knew from reading ingredients that it has cones (silicones) it is easy to find out if you goggle asking does the certain mane of it has cones and then you will know wheter cones end with cone, -conol, or -xane  the most known cone is dimethicone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going through a coconut obsessed phase, so I decided to try this product when I came across it in the store. The product smells amazing, but that was the only thing that kept me using it. I have thick wavy hair, its usually very soft. While washing my hair with this it made my hair feel like it had a ton of tangles in it, and off course after getting out out of the shower it did have A LOT of tangles in it. My hair has never been prone to tangles so it was quite weird. Since I have switched to another shampoo and conditioner of the organix brand, the brazilian keratin treatment one and I love it and no longer have the problems with the tangles :)</li>
    <li> I was attracted by its coconut scent. But was very disappointed after the first use. It is just a cheap shampoo. Leaves your hair dry and hard to comb. It&#x27;s a waste of money! Fekkai is much much better for my damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I like to think that I have normal hair that is neither too oily or too dry. This shampoo paired with the conditioner strip my hair of all oils. My hair became very brittle and would break upon extended use of this product. I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great and, since it&#x27;s sulfate free, my hair color lasts longer. I would recommend this to my friends and I will by this again in the future.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a great smell, but it is not nourishing nor will it make you hair stronger.  It will actually break your hair.  I have untreated hair slightly on the dry side and I was looking for a cruelty-free, conditioning shampoo, and this coconut shampoo made my hair extremely dry.  I couldn&#x27;t even run my comb through it even after using a deep conditioner.  I would recommend this shampoo for someone with short and very oily hair.  It&#x27;ll make your hair squeaky clean.  I will use it once a month to get the build up out.  It does lather well and smells like light pure coconut.  I also checked it on the EWG website and was not pleased with the ratings.  A 4 rating is fine, but the cancer level was moderate.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have thick and wavy hair and I bought this because I was told that it&#x27;d help make my hair thicker and used it and still do on my daily basis. My hair got longer and thicker because of its formula. I recommend you don&#x27;t intend to dry your hair with a towel. That&#x27;s when you see the results you wouldn&#x27;t want: dry, fuzzy and tangled. See, drying your hair is a very tough thing to resist--sadly, drying your hair with a towel [coming out of the shower] will make your hair more brittle and loose if you intend to attempt that over and over. Instead, softly damp the sides of your hair like the hairline the back of your hair, sideburns and the roots behind your ears--leave your hair wet and that&#x27;s when you&#x27;ll see better results: thicker, smoother, shinier and easier to run your fingers through with confidence. Rather than that, a good product if you&#x27;re only intending to make your hair longer and thicker--this one will do as a good average one.</li>
    <li> I got this because I was hoping sulfate-free products would help with my dandruff.  It doesn&#x27;t, but I still love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I rinse this out, my hair is smooth and tangle free.  It lathers very generously so I don&#x27;t need to use a lot with my long hair.  The smell is fantastic.  Even when I don&#x27;t use the conditioner my hair feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Recently I went from dark red to blonde and it dried out my hair really bad and I couldn&#x27;t even brush through it. With just one wash with this along with the coconut milk conditioner my hair already feels softer and healthier. I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to be able to run my fingers through my hair again</li>
    <li> It says organic, but it&#x27;s not. ( has some chemicals; as seen in other reviews and the packaging itself.) However, that doesn&#x27;t keep it from being wonderful. I have thinish, naturally wavy hair with a ton of natural volume. This shampoo not only smells great, but it makes my hair very soft (along with the matching conditioner). My hair gets oily after about 5 hours of using other products, but this makes my hair look and smell amazing. Love love love this! Plus I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s cruelty and sulfate free! Love it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this product is making a significant change, but my combination with this included is helping my hair grow and become stronger. I don&#x27;t have dandruff or dry scalp so it cleans out the gunk. I have no complaints, try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant at first since it is sulfate free and i am still new at trying them. I have tried a couple of other s.f. that were organic and it left a residue. But this one felt awesome! I only used a small amt at first and it didn&#x27;t feel good so i used a little more the second time and it felt great! I am really cautious on trying anything on my hair since its fine and i am trying to grow it healthy.This stuff is great and i even got my mother, whose worse than i am on what i put on my hair to try it and she loves it! So i would most certainly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I recently started using this shampoo with the coconut water conditioner and my hair has been a mess! they smell great which is why I want to love the pair, but my hair has been nothing but straw-like, dried out stringy strands. I have very normal hair, a little fine with slight wave, mostly straight. The lather is great! soft and silky, but if I have any product in my hair from the day before I need to follow this with some serious conditioning to soften and de-tangle. It does clean my scalp and leaves it free of residue or dryness, but my actual hair has seemed worse. I am using a different conditioner to make my hair soft and silky again (don&#x27;t try the coconut water one, it does nothing). I want to like this brand, so I might try a different pair. but unfortunately the luring, delicious smell of the coconut was the only added plus for this.</li>
    <li> Love this product! One of my favorite smelling shampoos. I alternate between the coconut milk and the argan oil in blue bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Christmas Tree Shop for 6.99 along with the Keratin Oil Conditioner because I was looking for a good shampoo/conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too expensive. The coconut shampoo made me hair feel so dry and brittle. I was scared to death because it was so hard, I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to comb my hair afterwards... I was upset while washing my hair but still decided to try the keratin oil conditioner. The keratin oil conditioner instantly made my dry brittle hair (from the shampoo) soft within seconds. My hair has NEVER been that soft from a conditioner!!!! I was in the shower thanking the Lord, because I thought I would have to rewash my hair all over again with other shampoo products in my home. I definitely recommend trying different lines of the Organix products. The coconut shampoo was a disaster for me but the keratin oil conditioner was awesome. I will try another Organix shampoo. It just depends on your hair, and the products or cheap enough to try. Good luck everyone!</li>
    <li> pro: love love love the smell, it transported me to a tropical oasis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con: I&#x27;m glad to see from the other reviews that I&#x27;m not the only one  who experienced this, thought I was going crazy, it had such potential with all the ingredients that it claims to be in it, my hair was hopeful, but was immediatley let down. I was left with dry brittle, frizzy hair, I tried using a little more, and it just left alot of build up in my hair even with my clarifying shampoo. Its too bad, they need to do some re-formulating</li>
    <li> Let me just start off by saying that my hair is very frizzy and I have combination hair. It&#x27;s frizzy, curly, wavy, and some pieces are straight. My roots are very oily while my ends are very dry. I used this shampoo in combination with the biotin and collagen conditioner, VERY good combination. The shampoo smells amazing, like coconuts! It lathers very well but is a little bit more runny than most shampoos. My hair the next morning feels amazing. Soft, shiny, and very tamable. My roots aren&#x27;t greasy at all!! Also I usually have a very bad shedding problem, so when I take a bath I have a billion hairs on the side of the tub. When I used this, I had none. ZERO. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have used many of Organix shampoos, but the coconut milk is my favorite.  It smells so sweet.  I also like some of their newer product line with keratin oil, biotin, and other moisturizing ingredients.</li>
    <li> Hair type: fine, dense, slightly oily roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching far and wide for a brand of shampoo and [[ASIN:B000RAC7MC ORGANIX Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner 13 oz/384.5 ml]] that will help me grow my hair with as little damage as possible, and unfortunately, Organix Coconut Milk Shampoo is NOT part of this combo for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, the shampoo seems to be more clarifying than anything, and for someone who has relatively dry hair, this is a definite downfall. I only use a minuscule amount of shampoo on my roots every other day and my hair still managed to become crispy at the ends after only a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the Organix products in this line that I have used (shampoo, [[ASIN:B000RAC7MC ORGANIX Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner 13 oz/384.5 ml]], [[ASIN:B000N758A2 Organix Anti-Breakage Serum, Nourishing, Coconut Milk, 4 oz.]]) have silicone-like ingredients in them which seal the hair shafts and keep moisture from penetrating the hair strands, likely causing the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Soothes dry and itchy scalps with some ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Actually does include coconut ingredients instead of just the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Is not ACTUALLY organic (kind of misleading name, but didn&#x27;t concern me much. I wasn&#x27;t expecting actual organic shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;Has questionable ingredients that are often used as short-term band-aids instead of long-term solutions to major problems with various hair types (silicone smoothing hair while simultaneously keeping it from holding moisture).&lt;br /&gt;Dried out my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of expensive for little you actually get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will not be buying this specific shampoo again. Organix may have a shampoo for my hair type, but I have yet to find it.</li>
    <li> I like the cherry blossom from this line much better.</li>
    <li> I had been using the same shampoo and conditioner for far too long...while I liked my old brand, my colored hair was feeling straw-like and needed a change. On my next visit to the drug store to pick up a prescription, I perused the shampoo aisle for something new. I found the Organix Nourishing Coconut Milk shampoo and matching conditioner. I LOVE the smell of coconut and the word &amp;#34;nourishing&amp;#34; looked promising for my dry hair, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With many shampoo/conditioner pairs, the consistency of both products is very similar. Not with this pair. The shampoo is thinner and the conditioner is super thick (I ADORE it, but more on that over in the conditioner review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner both come in a rounded flip-top container. I must say that it isn&#x27;t the most well-designed bottle for use in the shower with wet hands, but I generally don&#x27;t have a problem picking up the shampoo bottle, flipping the lid and squeezing shampoo into my hand (the same unfortunately cannot be said for the conditioner, but more on that over in the conditioner review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of both products is WONDERFUL (if you like the smell of coconut, which I do). Interestingly, while I am very fragrance sensitive when it comes to perfumey scents, I adore natural scents like coconut and vanilla, so while the coconut fragrance is very noticeable, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, while my hair did not undergo any miraculous transformation, it is definitely NOT straw-like anymore and I&#x27;m not having the problems with flyaways that I was having before I switched to these products. I have a feeling that is more due to the conditioner than the shampoo, but who knows!</li>
    <li> Before anyone could fall for cheap brands like Suave or Pantene, Organix&#x27;s coconut milk shampoo and conditioner has the essential ingredients to keep dry and unnourished hair back to life. Most brands promise strong and durable hair, but what we do not see is what actually keeps our hair healthy. Organix provides us the basic vitamins--coconut milk and vitamin E--that our hair must need in order to stay strong, split-ends free and continue to grow naturally.&lt;br /&gt;I was born with curls and ever since I was introduced with flat irons, blow dryer and hair spray, my naturally curled hair was becoming dry, split-ends starts to appear and my hair color changed from black to brown. Then I challenged myself to have my hair permanently straightened so that it&#x27;s less ironing. Bad. My hair stopped growing and the split-ends was twice as worst than before! And of course the only way to give life to my hair was to trust brands that promised, \\&quot;Split-ends free\\&quot; or \\&quot;keeps hair soft and silky smooth\\&quot; because their professionals, why not trust them?&lt;br /&gt; Wrong. Even with famous products that have marked \\&quot;clinically proven,\\&quot; you know more about your hair as much as they do. So before I could pick up another bottle of Garnier shampoo and conditioner, my sister introduced me to Organix Coconut Milk. My first impression was, \\&quot;coconut milk? Isn&#x27;t that we eat?\\&quot; Organic ingredients like avocado and aloe are basic vitamins that our hair needs to able to grow naturally and fully just like how we need vegetables to provide us antioxidant. It&#x27;s part of the basic building block that keeps us strong and healthy.&lt;br /&gt; What makes this brand differ from other brands? When I massaged the conditioner on to my scalp, the liquid was very smooth and concentrated. I didn&#x27;t have to fill up my hand with too much conditioner to get that satisfaction. I simple pour a good enough amount on to my palm and spread it and massaged it onto my scalp and split ends for about five minutes. I let the conditioner sitthere for another five minutes then rinse. As I rinsed the conditioner off my hair, it untangles and soften up every strand on my hair. So by the time I dry and combed my hair, it leaves that soft and smooth feeling that most hair products did not promise.&lt;br /&gt;Whether your hair is curly, wavy, straight, short, oily, etc., always start off with the basic needs like vitamin E, A, D that can be found in foods we eat such as avocado, coconut milk, and coco butter. Even with man made products can not help you. That is why I love Organix Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner. It may not be a famous brand that&#x27;s usually advertised on TV, but the labels on the back of the product are more important than the name itself.  I recommend everyone to buy it and try it for themselves and see the difference between all the other shampoos and conditioner they have used. I guarantee you that it will leave your hair smooth, soft and split ends free after one week of use.</li>
    <li> I love it. I feel my hear healthy and nourishing it is amazing i&#x27;ll keep using and i recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very creamy and rich. Smells wonderful and best of all does not have chemicals and bad-for-you stuff. My hair is usually dry, but this shampoo seems to keep it more moist without being greasy or heavy. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical and has decreased my flat ironing time by 80%. The keratin smooth kind works even better. I can&#x27;t believe how long I was frizzing out my hair with alcohol laden shampoo.</li>
    <li> It contains dimethicone copolyol, which is a kind of silicon, wrapping your hair and skin with plastic for better glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot understand how this company says that their products are safe.</li>
    <li> I was using Jonhson baby shampoo since i was born. I am 23 years old now. So, 2 months ago I decided to try this shampoo and MY HAIR STARTED TO FALL!!! It started to fall in big pieces, like im sick or something!! If i can i would put zero in rating!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;Rinses well&lt;br /&gt;Hair soft and fluffy after washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greasy hair next day&lt;br /&gt;Buildup next day&lt;br /&gt;Hair is heavy next day&lt;br /&gt;Hair is difficult to brush after blow-drying&lt;br /&gt;Overall drying effect on hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Finance love it... that all I can say about it... she won&#x27;t use anything else... so I guess that speaks for itself...</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells great. I take showers before I go to bed at night and my hair still smells like coconut the next day.</li>
    <li> This is our new standard!</li>
    <li> Smelled wonderful. Used for a few weeks and my hair started falling out, badly. I stopped using this product and my hair stopped falling out within a week. Several ingredients are &amp;#34;toxic,&amp;#34; will never use again.</li>
    <li> This brand of shampoo gave me a terrible reaction itching reaction....I tried the Green Tea version first, and then tried this Coconut Milk version - Both caused my head to itch like crazy.  As soon as I changed shampoo it stopped - I have never had a reaction to any type of hair product, but this was terrible.  I&#x27;m sure other people have a great experience - but this product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> great product for the price! shipped fast, very happy! SMELLS SO GOOD!</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a good substance, smells nice, and seems to be a good product. However it doesn&#x27;t nourish my hair as I hoped it would but the product description.</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker and coarser than my daughter&#x27;s.  Hers is fairly thick, and it works great for her.  I still need a really good conditioner in addition to the shampoo, as well as product in my hair to soften it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 year old son. He has a scalp condition (not dandruff) that causes flakes. This works great. It&#x27;s helping his scalp heal and the flakes are gone.</li>
