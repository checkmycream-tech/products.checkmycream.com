      <li>the light timer works perfectly ,but you have to learn how not to get that nail polish into your cuticles,otherwise it&#x27;s stuck in there .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am writing this as a professional licensed Cosmetologists. Yes, we have seen many people on here who get paid to write reviews. But, this is a true Amazon.com loyal customer. I bought this UV Gel Light to do gels ans shellacs for my clients and for myself. This is a great machine for a great price. You don&#x27;t need to use the Harmony Gelish UV Light just to use their polishes or the CND. This works both ways. This UV Light is great. When you receive one, read the directions on how to install the bulbs correctly. I highly advise everyone to buy this on a budget to do your own gel nails. I hope this helps you all to those who read my view.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see much of a difference between air drying and this piece of junk. I have a nightly routine of watching 1.5 hours of tv. First I give myself a manicure, and then I allow myself time to dry my nails. This piece of garbage takes about a half hour per hand to cure. Keep in mind, I do two coats plus a quick dry clear top coat.  The whole point of a dryer is to speed things up.</li>
    <li> The one I got seemed to be used already.  There was a dark &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; mark on the back plastic.  Hmmmmm. . . .  Works ok but I will definitely upgrade.</li>
    <li> Initially the lamps did not come on for me. I contacted the seller and they told me I had to use more force to put the bulbs in. I was scared I would break it. Once my fiancé got them in, the lamp worked fine. It doesn&#x27;t dry the gel polish as quick as it does in the salon. I don&#x27;t know if it is the lamp or the polish. The timer works great.</li>
    <li> Had a coiple of months nows. Works great just need to figure out how to put the bulbs on carefully cuz they can get a little loose but no biggy!!&lt;br /&gt;It does burn after a while so where suncreen!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it I feel like an expert already&lt;br /&gt;Thxs</li>
    <li> well worth the price is awesome</li>
    <li> Now I can do my own gel nails at home!  Very easy to use and set up.  Great product, saves me time and money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, has worked just fine since i have recived it have had no issuses so far with it i love it.</li>
    <li> Did not cure gel nails well... Also after about 7 months of use it caught on fire.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use to cure Gelish gel nail polish. I tried it last night and it worked great. No problems, no complaints. I recommend this product, and its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.  I bought one for myself &amp; my sister. I would definitely buy one for a gift.</li>
    <li> Great it !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought $ 25.99&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with the price ~today ,i use well :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. The light has a timer and works great. it was a little hard putting in the uv light bulbs but worth it. the price was totally worth it. A+++++</li>
    <li> Love this light! Works great. Love the size so that you can fit your whole hand including thumb in it. Definitely recommend with the gelish polish. Nails last two weeks plus!!</li>
    <li> I just received this product in the mail. It did not come with any instructions. I put all four of the bulbs in, plugged it in and turned it on and nothing happened. I got frustrated trying to figure out what I did wrong. I found the customer service number and called it. Talked to a very nice lady. She said that sometimes you think the bulb is in all the way and it&#x27;s not. She said to push it in a little harder. It worked! I am so happy now! I&#x27;m going to do my nails right now!!</li>
    <li> I like the nail dryer, but it&#x27;s not what i thought it was supposed to be. I thought the dryer had a fan on it because of the picture on here. Turns out that it does not. But the dryer does work and the seller was quick sending the order.</li>
    <li> My niece wanted this for her birthday. She was so excited to finally have one and she used it right away. Her nails were beautiful and now she doesn&#x27;t have to pay someone else to do her nails!!</li>
    <li> One Bull was broke an the Sellerie send me a new lamp without any problems</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother for this past year. She passed away in march of this past year. I don&#x27;t think she ever used it and since I don&#x27;t polish my nails I have not used it either. It does appear to be well built. The bulbs are a little hard to install.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 17 year old she lives it. Came fast and works good. She loves doing nail and it&#x27;s a great price love amazon</li>
    <li> This lamp works GREAT. I&#x27;ve had it for a year now &amp; its still going strong. The price was great as well $23. &amp; change, not bad.</li>
    <li> I love this curing lamp. I am able to dry my regular nail polish and does the job has curing gel. I highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, deal and price.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as expected but would be better if a fan was built into it.</li>
    <li> A light bulb port did not work out of the box. Was not the light bulb. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this light for over 2 years and it still works. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Love the light...works as described. Very pleased with purchase and would recommend. Definitely saves money being able to do my own nails at home.</li>
    <li> Great product! Do not wonder to yourself if it&#x27;s not working because your nails are sticky! Wipe them off with alcohol and a cotton ball after you cure them and your done within minutes! Salon quality! Love this product and the price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, lamp works great, wonderful price, but when I opened the box it looks used. Not shipping damage, but scratches, dents, and some discoloration. It could have been refurbished.</li>
    <li> Omgosh yes, I&#x27;m soooo glad I bought this light. It works soooo well an fast an for the price - it has been the best thing I&#x27;ve bought for a long time lol. I&#x27;M SOOOOOOOO LOVING THIS LIGHT! I want to do nails everyday just to use my light lol!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product! I just received it and it was really fast shipping also and the light bulbs are not hard to put in at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent lamp! It works very good with a powerful light that  dries the gel quickly! Also is cheaper here than regular stores.</li>
    <li> Works great! I would rate this with 5 starts but the bulbs them selfs are dificult to put in.</li>
    <li> I read the comments carefully before purchasing, as I am not a nail technician, and in fact, have never used gel nail materials before. I watched a couple YouTube videos on what products one needs and how to use them, then purchased this UV light for curing. I have to say, besides the fact that I am a TOTAL beginner, and have a lot of skill developing in my future, everything went according to plan and the end result was perfect! I highly recommend this to anyone in the non professional world (I assume professional models are stronger/faster). The price makes it a wonderful value for my fellow DIY types.</li>
    <li> I like this unit and it works just fine. I just wish that it was a bit smaller. I only do nails on myself and my daughter and it becomes a little bit of a pain trying to find enough space for it, specially when the cord is not very long. Other than that it has performed great.</li>
    <li> I love this lamp. It is easy to use. After reading the other reviews I was afraid it would be a horrible product. The lights are not difficult to use at all. The packaging was great and so was the quality of the lamp. The timer works great. I bought this lamp because the Sally Hansen lamp I bought at Walgreens wasn&#x27;t curing my nails fully. They would chip in 4-5 days. Now with this lamp my nails last 2 weeks at minimum. I&#x27;m using gelish harmony polish with this lamp. The sally Hansen gel polish works well with the lamp too.</li>
    <li> Works great! Sets my gell polish perfectly and I love the fact it has a built in timer. Nothing to keep track of. I might buy a second unit so that when my daughter comes over we can speed up the dryer process a bit.</li>
    <li> I have a original CND lamp and theis salon edge one. Of course this one is not that beautiful but it works perfectly! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for over a year, and love it! works fine! have not had any problems. love the timer!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all when it arrived.  None of the lights will turn on and it doesn&#x27;t appear like the timer does anything (can&#x27;t hear it click on and off)  I missed the window to return it so can&#x27;t say if a replacement one would be better.  Judging by how poorly it is put together, I wouldn&#x27;t count on it.</li>
    <li> It works perfect , very fast delivery</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp long, long, long ago. I started out with gelish and the polish wasn&#x27;t staying on my nails. Then I went to cnd shellac and it was still not working. Then I finally found out that the chipping and peeling that was going on with my polish is because my lamp wasn&#x27;t high enough for the polish. I just went and bought a new lamp so my fingers are crossed! Do not buy this lamp if your doing gelish or cnd. Believe me when I tell you it won&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a 10 sec option on the timer, but otherwise it works awesome!</li>
    <li> I love it! I use mine form my nails and toes. I use it with regular nail polish and gel polish. Professional look right in my home.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift almost a month ago and have used it several times since. It works great and I have no complaints!!</li>
    <li> I have big hands and feet, I&#x27;m 6 feet tall, and had no problem drying a gel mani.  I did usually run it a little longer than the product recommended, but only because I was paranoid about it curing correctly.</li>
    <li> So I have enjoyed this product - I&#x27;ve ised it a couple times and it works pretty good. It definitely isn&#x27;t as good as in a salon, it takes me about an hour and my nails are mostly dry. But overall I&#x27;m pleased as it works much better than my previous uv light. Unfortunately one light that came with it was burnt out and doesn&#x27;t work - haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement yet which is frustrating. Other than this , I have no complaints</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. I am not a professional. I&#x27;ve used this lamp since June 2013 to do mine and my friends&#x27;/family&#x27;s nails and toes using builder gel, glitter, and Gelish polish. It has been amazing. I love the 2-minute timer and its size. Yesterday, I realized one of the bulbs has faded, but I am not disappointed because I use it A LOT. If you are an at-home user, please consider this lamp! I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this lamp. You can put your hold hand in at one time this really saves on time. Worth the price and it was delivered very quickly. I had no trouble putting the bulbs in at all. Would order this item again.</li>
    <li> I was concern that it would come damage but didn&#x27;t the bulbs work fine and its easy to use and it come with a kit it would be nice though if it came with a nail polish....</li>
    <li> I have had this lamp for almost two years, and it is still going strong!  No complaints and does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a great UV lamp for the DIYers.  I&#x27;ve had it for quite some time, and it&#x27;s still ticking!  I use it about once a week.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.  The bulbs keep popping out, they are not a tight fit when you fit them in, some are but most aren&#x27;t, they jiggle.  Buy a better dryer.</li>
    <li> I had to open this product to install the lights as they would not push/click in a described. I use for cell phone repairs and my girlfriend likes having it for home nail care and styling. Works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a secondary lamp. It is small enough to position on my work station so I can work both hands simultaneously.  I also like that I have the option to keep it on continuously as I work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year and I love it! It works well and is a great value! I&#x27;d buy this all over again.</li>
    <li> I have gone through two of these. I disregarded the 1 star reviews and figured it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me but it did. The first one i received had one faulty lightbulb, and amazon would only replace the entire unit. The second one i received worked fine when I took it out of the box, but when I went to use it a week later, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  So disappointed and now buying a different brand.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. Bulbs are pushed all the way in, but it will not power on. Bummed, as I had hoped to do my nails tonight. :( Will have to return it now.</li>
    <li> good quality and the price cant be beat. this is definitely salon quality and I was questioning that when I ordered bc of the price. But I was pleasantly surprised. shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I really love this UV lamp I bought two different types of UV lamps on Sally for about $60 each and I had to return them because it was not drying up the gel as I wanted it. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Watts just don&#x27;t seem strong enough, took me 30min to dry EACH coat.</li>
    <li> Works well but way too big. I would get a smaller one if I were you.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Wife, unit is much faster than air drying. Wife loves it and uses often. As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;When she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;am Happy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and polishes for my sister for a gift. She uses it all the time. No longer has to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> Same results as the ones used in salon. Very pleased. I bought this to use with gelish nail polish kit. Excellent shipping.</li>
    <li> very roomy...i have place to put both hands lol...very nice...love it</li>
    <li> I recently decided to do my own nails because I couldn&#x27;t reason paying the $45+ every 2 weeks at the salon.  I use this with Gelish and it&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s like the ones in the salon.  The bulbs were a bit tricky to insert since you can&#x27;t remove the top but with some prayer and delicateness you eventually get it.  It&#x27;s really not that bad.  I found the middle two to be the most difficult which is odd.  It must be the angle.  Also, I wanted to put it on the 2 minute setting but it wasn&#x27;t working when I first started it up.  I found that if you put it on the &#x27;On&#x27; setting for a couple minutes and then switched it to the &#x27;Timer&#x27; mode it worked fine.  This is only on the first time you turn it on.  Then every time after that as long as you keep it on the &#x27;Timer&#x27; setting when you plug it in the light goes on for 2 minutes and shuts off.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was sad! Item received and it didn&#x27;t work. Had to go through the hassle of returning and reordering another. Poor quality control![[ASIN:B006QO4BRM Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp Acrylic Gel Shellac CURING Light TIMER 36 WATT Drying Fan Dryer]]</li>
    <li> Purchased 6 of these lamps.  I now have two left and have transferred the lights from the broken ones to the last two.  I have written 3 times to the company and they have not responsed.  I requested information on where to purchase  new bulbs and no response.  The bulbs are long and they have no secure clamp and they lose connection to the electric source.  CHEAP but not Good.  [[ASIN:B006QO4C1W Salon Edge Top 36W UV Curing Lamp Acrylic Gel Nail Dryer Light TIMER]]</li>
    <li> Great lamp for gel nail polish. Works as well as the lamp they use in salons for the price of a manicure. This is the best beauty investment I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
    <li> I wish this had more than just a 2 minute timer, but it works great. Took a few minutes to put the bulbs in, some were a bit difficult. Once I got them it it worked perfectly! Great for gel polish/shellac. Have only had it for about a week now, but no problems thus far.</li>
    <li> Do Not Buy! It is a cheaply made &amp;#34;box with uv lights inside&amp;#34;. It does not cure the gelish polish weather you sit there for 2 min or a haf hour. Waste of time and money. It is very disappointing! Amazon why do you allow &amp;#34;products&amp;#34; like this to be advertised on your webcite?!?</li>
    <li> I received this right away and in tact! Have not used yet but it is exactly what I wanted for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about the product. It used to take me too long to dry my nails. This UV light works perfect. It dries my nails in a few minutes. Saves me a lot of time. The only thing is when you install the lights to the body part, you have to push them in very hard to click. I did not push them hard enough at the beginning, so the lights could not be turned on and I thought the product was broken.</li>
    <li> I recieved the item I ordered within the alotted time period, and was thouroughly pleased with the contents and the way the product works. No complaints about product, would order from this distributor again!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lamp. Totally worth every penny! works as described, you just need to push the bulbs a little hard.</li>
    <li> this is the best curing lamp for the price. it is fairly large, and you can set it to timed mode or just continuously on. works fast, usually takes about a minute/minute and a half for my nails to be cured perfectly. easy to put the bulbs in, and have had it for over six months with no issues what so ever. would recommend</li>
    <li> I actually bought this to cure UV paint I use in making printed circuit boards. It does the trick - perfect for my needs</li>
    <li> Lamp has better reviews  for price.&lt;br /&gt;Bulbs goes off on there own.&lt;br /&gt;Always have to move bulbs to get bulbs to come back on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a fine UV Lamp. However the one I was sent was &#x27;used&#x27;. \\&quot;WELL USED!\\&quot; These Salon Edge Lamps only have a 60 day guarantee. I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder: \\&quot;How long did the previous owner have it, was it used occasionally or daily?\\&quot;. The back of the unit had obvious large scratches and smears, as if someone &#x27;tried&#x27; to clean it up so it would appear new. It was returned immediately.</li>
    <li> I really like the easy use and it works with ease. Not difficult to set up and I like that it saves space.</li>
    <li> When I got my nails done in the salon it seems like their 3 minute timer did the job. With Salon Edge UV curing lamp the timer goes for 2 minutes. It takes about 3 tries before they are dry, but its no big deal because I can sit in front of my TV and watch the shows I want to watch while my nails dry. It&#x27;s nice and big too.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this curing lamp if you are doing your own shellac at home the only minor problem that I have had with this lamp is the light build staying on but if you just make sure they are put in correctly and handle with care you can still get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I love being able to do a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; manicure at home.  It really lasts and protects my nails.  They&#x27;re actually growing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay &amp; feels like cheap-plastic &amp; big UV bulbs. I&#x27;ve used it only once. Will use it again for my feet, soon. Should&#x27;ve purchased a LED gel lamp. This one cures your gel nails no better than the sun.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how large this dryer was. I do like the timer on it, however after using it for the reccomended time (2 minutues) my nails were still tacky so I doubled the time and that seemed to be good. Overall it works well but not great.</li>
    <li> This is a great uv nail dryer, especially for the price.  It arrives with the light bulbs in boxes, so you need to install the light bulbs.  They are a little hard to put in, gently push hard, and they work great!  I don&#x27;t know how long the light bulbs last, but the bulbs can be a bit expensive depending on where you find them.  All in all, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> The light has timer for shut-off, and each time I&#x27;ve done my nails with Gelish they&#x27;ve cured with this light exactly when they were supposed to.  No problems for me.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the fact that it has the timer.  I had used one a friend had and had to watch the clock.  It works well.</li>
    <li> This lamp works great, does what it is supposed to do. But the bulbs sometimes move out of place and don&#x27;t light up. You just have to push them in tightly to the sockets. I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Gret, super faster, 36 w, so just in 2 min yours nails are done</li>
    <li> Works great, wish it was a tad smaller.</li>
    <li> This lamp has been great for me so far; very easy to assemble the light bulbs, and I really like the timer options.  I&#x27;m curious to find out how long the bulbs will last.</li>
    <li> I do my nails at home and they come out perfect everytime.  I am saving about a hundred dollars a month.  Halleluia</li>
    <li> i think the unit is well made as far as sturdiness goes... however 2 of my bulb sockets dont work.  Major disappointment.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING!! LOVE THE PRODUCT!! EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!! GREAT PRICES FOR THE ITEM! WILL PURCHASE FROM BUYER AGAIN! ONE OF THE BULBS WAS BROKE, BUT IT&#x27;S OK</li>
    <li> I purchased a top coat CND Shellac Color coat with UV3 technology nail polish, and so I was force to make the purchase or the nail polish would not work. Paid to much for shipping. Used it three times only, and then it died. Bought new light bulbs, but it still didn&#x27;t work. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM! &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This dryer does not even dry your nails after having them sit under it for 20 minutes. It was a total waste of money and I would not recommend this to anyone else.</li>
    <li> This is a good one!  Works great and it roomy enough for your hand. Has a shut off when your time is up.</li>
    <li> Does all it says it would. Came with all the specified parts.  I have only used it twice and it has cured the nails on both occasions.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get quite the results I do at a salon obviously, but it is fun to play with.  The colors tend to be expensive.</li>
    <li> cost under half the price of the same one at my local beauty supply and works the same. i use it for curing gel polish and it works great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lamp to cure my gel nails at home. I received the product in a timely fashion, however the box was semi-crushed.&lt;br /&gt;The lamp was easy enough to put together, but the tray that is supposed to slide out does not. It was never cut through the plastic. The was a big bummer.......This was one of the &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; highlighted in the description.The reflective sheet on the bottom of the lamp has crinkles as it was not smoothed out when put together in the factory. The lamp itself works o.k. I was going to return it and I decided to keep it seeing I&#x27;m moving and am to busy to be bothered.</li>
    <li> I love this curing lamp. I use it all the time for my mani and pedi at home and works wonders. Extremely affordable and I would definitely recommend this to all for those who don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds buying from the salon store.</li>
    <li> This works wonderful and I love the timer on it.  I ended up getting rid of all my Gel Nail stuff but this is great buy and works wonderful</li>
    <li> I received the product in great condition. I would recommend to other nail painters. I have used and love this product many times.</li>
    <li> Works great. This is the same device you will find in a salon.</li>
    <li> I just tried it with gelish brand gel system and it worked just like salon system!!</li>
    <li> Had a minor problem with my first Lamp and they went out of their way and contacted me and send me a new lamp. The new lamp is working awesome! TYVM I love this lamp and would recommend it to anyone wanting a 36W UV Lamp. For the price it is a great product!!</li>
    <li> I am torn about this lamp. The first one I had broke after only using it twice, but the seller quickly sent me a free replacement which I though was super. New lamp seems to be working great..better then the first!</li>
    <li> I received the lamp, followed the instructions on inserting the bulbs, and.... Nada. The thing does not work. I ordered it here because it was half of the price that Sally Beauty was selling it. I am sending this piece of crap back and going to Sally Beauty to buy one with no hassle. Do not waste your time with this.</li>
    <li> Works great! Works as described, the timer feature is great too. I would recommend this to others. Easy to use and operate.</li>
    <li> this along with the drill and the glitter makes a good start for someone that is gettting started she was glad the bulbs worked</li>
    <li> Works great and does what it was made for.  Haveing the two minutes gives me time to relax and enjoy my time better.</li>
    <li> Delivery was good except I could not track it even with the tracking number. The lamp works amazing but my nail gel still peels. It is probably due to the cheap polish I use tho.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I decided to get this, after paying 35 dollars every 2 weeks,having some Vietnamese guy tell me how beautiful I am in what&#x27;s my number  this is a bargain . The only thing that I need to do is practice on painting my nails better , using the no chip is nothing like using regular nail polish . I&#x27;ve have this no since Christmas and have painted my nails 2 different times. the light timer works perfectly ,but you have to learn how not to get that nail polish into your cuticles,otherwise it&#x27;s stuck in there . I was hesitant about putting a review on Amazon after reading all of the BS that is online  ,but since I am an frequent shopper I thought people would like a real review from a real person who bought real products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I put 4 instead of 5 ,for if you learned in the past nobody should give you 5 because there&#x27;s always room for improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my granddaughters and my daughter . They said it works as good as the one at the salon!</li>
    <li> bought this thing for my mom and she said it works pretty well.  she does her nails at home -- always -- and says this helps get the job done better.</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING IS AS IT WAS DESCRIBED ON THE PRODUCT INFORMATION, AND REALLY CHEAP COMPARED WITH OTHER UV LIGHTS. I SO RECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> I was anxiously waiting its arrival and after placing the bulbs in I was disappointed that nothing happened when I turn it on.  Thankfully someone else had this same experience and after calling customer service shared a review saying to push the bulbs in further.  That did the trick!  I paid about the same for the lamp and red carpet manicure set as I would pay for two visits to the salon.  I love that I am using a product on my own nails and they are perfectly healthy underneath when it is removed.  So much more cost effective than a manicure every two weeks.  I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t have the same salon results but I absolutely do!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to order the product but The light arrived in good conition and is working great.  I am very pleased with the results.  It actually looks like a much more expensive salon light.</li>
    <li> Since I started doing my own gel nails, this has been invaluable.  so far, so good  The price was one quarter of what beauty supply stores want.</li>
    <li> Just like the salon. I like it better than other UV lights that are being sold in regular stores because it requires no batteries.</li>
    <li> Received it quickly with everything as advertised. Works great.</li>
    <li> LOVES this dryer, works GREAT, with both regular and Gel Polish. I was a little upset with how long it took for delivery but I blame that more on UPS. The dryer is a little bigger than I expected, not as portable as I was hoping. The buttons to turn on and off are a little tough, not as easy as a flip of a switch. This dryer does it&#x27;s job which is to dry nails in a faster time which it does but other than that not very easy to use and not very portable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with about $40 worth of O.P.I. Gel Nail polish (top, bottom coat and a couple of polishes) only to find out that when I put my nails under this light that the polish NEVER DID DRY.  I tried several times only to find that I am going to either have to purchase an new dryer or head back to the nail shop.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I really like this lamp the timer really takes the guest work out of using this lamp and the bulbs was easy to install.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, it works fine, very competitive price for quality item. Would purchase from this vendor again. Comes with 4 9 watt UV bulbs.</li>
    <li> please dont bother witht this product. it looks professional but when you get it, it looks like foil was wrapped in side and the lights dont stay in. it fell apart when i opened it and it doesnt even dry.</li>
    <li> Have had this for a while, works great and even after a year I have not had to change the bulbs. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time I love it it works great!!!</li>
    <li> Works great at such an affordable price, love it!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a big deal or not - anyone else know if ten seconds makes a difference?  Can&#x27;t decide if  should return it or just continue doing what I did the first time I use it (just now) and use the manual mode to go another ten seconds.  If I find out that ten seconds doesn&#x27;t matter then I won&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it worked perfectly as far as curing my gel manicure.</li>
    <li> This is the second light I have owned to do my own nails. The product hardens well with this lamp and the timer is great. For the price I am happy with what I got!</li>
    <li> Love it, the timer is about 5 seconds off but other than that it works great.  It does get a little warm to the touch but not enough to burn you</li>
    <li> This lamp is perfect for what I wanted for at home shellac. Only downside is it has no fan. Still works perfectly. Worth the money to save cash on getting manicured at a salon every two weeks</li>
    <li> I love this light! It works awesome and the price is awesome.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but I kinda wish it was built just a bit better... A couple bulbs have to fiddled with each use to light up...</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this product could be any better. Small enough to hide away in a closet or drawer (I keep mine under the bed) but big enough to spread your fingers inside and even to paint your nails on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;If you do your own manicures, you need this product.</li>
    <li> the lamp works well to set the shellac or gel polish to the nails, but the quality is less than desirable. the bottom of it doesn&#x27;t pull out like i was expecting (although no where in the description does it say it does), the light part where the lights fit into are not tight enough and my bulbs fall out easily, and the overall quality is poor. like i said before, it does that job and that&#x27;s what really matters. it&#x27;s the brand that i am not in love with, Salon Supply Store is great.</li>
    <li> I do my nails at home sometimes now after getting this lamp.  Great price &amp; it works great but it&#x27;s rather bulky. You push the timer each time.</li>
    <li> liked, suoer works well for common nails and Gelish. good for this price. I recommend if you do not want to spend much money.</li>
    <li> This does not work!!!</li>
    <li> This works far better then expected although still not professional quality.  But a great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I wanted, but the price was right and it does work great.</li>
    <li> This cheap box actually works!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this machine and used it for the first time a couple of days ago, and am pleased to say - I pulled off my first gel mani (cha-ching! I can hear my money reverting back to my wallet where it belongs!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My process: I used Gelish and applied 4 layers altogether - a base, 2 coats of color, and a top coat - curing for 2 minutes per layer. As many other reviewers mentioned - the polish feels wet and sticky after curing. This goes away after wiping each nail with alcohol - which I did only after curing the final coat (the top coat). I didn&#x27;t wipe my nails between each layer after curing each of them. MY NAILS LOOK FAB! Just like they were done in the shop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because it&#x27;s clearly a cheap put-together. IT DIDN&#x27;T EVEN COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS! It doesn&#x27;t get cheaper than that! Oh, wait...yes it does. As others have mentioned, the bulbs are difficult to get into the sockets. I did it initially - but the bulbs didn&#x27;t seem to fit &#x27;snug&#x27; and the machine didn&#x27;t work. I had to get the hubby to do it. It worked after that and I did my mani, but later a bulb slipped out just by my moving the box from one table to another. Cheap, cheap, CHEAP! However, if it survives for just a few mani&#x27;s (some reviewers say that it&#x27;s worked for them over a year) than it pays for itself - so for that I gave it 4 stars. Because my entire goal is to save time from having to drive to and sit in nail shops, and of course to save the salon cost!</li>
    <li> it does not due what i thought it would do i was hoping it would prevent my manicure from chipping at least 5 days not so.</li>
    <li> I have used its about 4times, no problems with it. Buy this one. Save $ do them your self. E-z open it put the lights in run it about 2minutes, n your ready to do ur nails....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I have the hang of doing gel nails at home.....they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as they are supposed to.  They actually lift and peel off (no need to use a remover)  But that is not the fault of the dryer,  It does exactly as it should do.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I love to enjoy girly days together and pamper ourselves with beautiful nails, but it&#x27;s become a luxury we can&#x27;t always afford or find time for.  I bought this light along with a starter kit of various gel nail products and was absolutely thrilled with the outcome. Beautiful gel nails for a fraction of what we paid in the salon and we can do them anytime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I purchased this light because it was less expensive than most and had planned on moving up to a more luxurious model if we were pleased with doing our own nails, but there is absolutely no reason to replace this light.  It works GREAT!  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.... IT IS A SCAM , THEY WILL WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.... THEY WILL NOT REPLACE OR REIMBURSE YOU FOR PRODUCT THAT DOES NOT WORK</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain about this lamp! Everything works great. Just need to make sure the bulbs click into place like the other comments state.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to, but I recommend a led lamp because it cuts off so much drying time... I had to replace this model with an led one after only a few months because I&#x27;m too impatient</li>
    <li> This is very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> I received the lamp a couple of weeks ago and it was packaged really well and securely.The bulbs were securely wrapped as well. I didn&#x27;t use until last night to do my gelish set. Worked great and cured my nails just fine. Fits one hand including thumb. Satisfied Customer. So far I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> No issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works just as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a timer makes it so much easier. No guessing or fudging on the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope polish comes down in price soon, and that more colors become available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the polish stayed on 2 weeks without chipping (I wasn&#x27;t careful about what I did, either!),  2 weeks was too long to have the same color on, without changing. At the end of 2 weeks my nails had grown out so far I was embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of peeling the polish off my nails, rather than taking the time &amp; effort to soak polish off. It trashed my natural nails. (I won&#x27;t make that mistake again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few minutes to apply the different layers, and then set the layer with the light. But when you&#x27;re done, you are really done! No having to avoid everything for hours and hours afterward, while the polish dries. The end result is very nice, and very shiny! Doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced within 2 days. Nails seem stronger (as long as you don&#x27;t peel polish off!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> It would be a great product... if it all worked all of the time. Note: you get what you pay for. If you mess with it a bit you can get most of it to work. Not the quality I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I love my UV lamp! It was cheap and definitely worth it! You get what you payed for! I recommend it to everyone!</li>
