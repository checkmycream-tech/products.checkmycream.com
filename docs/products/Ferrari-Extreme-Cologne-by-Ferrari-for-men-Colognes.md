### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I am impressed.</li>
      <li>This is the best of all time cologne made in Italy!</li>
      <li>Almost perfect customer service.</li>
      <li>this is a great buy!</li>
      <li>Great delivery and seller!!</li>
      <li>It is a perfect cologne.</li>
      <li>the packaging was in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>Its a very good smell.</li>
      <li>It is VERY good.</li>
      <li>Ferrari perfumes without discussion are of great quality, Ferrary Estreme maintains that statement.</li>
      <li>Great value for money.</li>
      <li>great smell.</li>
      <li>Great</li>
      <li>The scent of this Eau De Toillet is very pleasant and great for any kind of situation.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells amazing!  </li>
      <li>Altogether I&#x27;m very happy with this bottle (and again, it&#x27;s competing in a field of many hundreds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was a pleasant surprise to me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean, in-your-face, FLOWERS!!!</li>
      <li>Good perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still extremely good.</li>
      <li>Good ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the scent very appealing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting more!</li>
      <li>My girls love the scent of it!</li>
      <li>Great and smooth, just what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest wearing this cologne from a brand called Ferrari I was weary.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Extreme&amp;#34; is an apt name.</li>
      <li>(If I wanted to be kind, I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;lime peel&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>hinted at some sweet type stuff and a hint of powder, but the basenote is a blaring, awesome, just barely sweet floral melange.</li>
      <li>I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity.</li>
      <li>So men buy this and go out there and get those ladies, and if you have a fine women already impress her with your scent!</li>
      <li>I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals.</li>
      <li>The top note did have some alcohol and mids</li>
      <li>the smell is sexy &amp; manly.  </li>
      <li>Ferrari makes a few colognes, all of which smell good, but this one is the best in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>For a man getting the ladies is huge and this helps a lot.</li>
      <li>There is no other scent that i love more.</li>
      <li>And it smells amazing on my 21 year old nephew, and on my husband, and on my dad.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not a knock-your-socks-off, super-unique fragrance when considering the full field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
      <li>In my rating system, a 5-star fragrance is something bordering on exotic, so special and unique that it would place, in a &amp;#34;top 25&amp;#34; list in my wardrobe, completely regardless of price.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is normal :)</li>
      <li>Its very subtle, light, happy, sexy.</li>
      <li>the bottle is cut nicely and feels solid to hold.</li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t far out of the top 25.</li>
      <li>There was a holographic Ferrari logo on the side, but I&#x27;m not too sure whether its authentic or imitation.</li>
      <li>4 stars, for me, means that it&#x27;s good enough that I will gladly buy another bottle to replace this one when it&#x27;s nearing empty, assuming they still make it.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it has  a strong manly smooth ,but something not clear..</li>
      <li>So I will be sure to ask him about the item later on.</li>
      <li>exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I do say this is the first time I have purchased an Eau De Toilette online</li>
      <li>(I posted a review on Ferrari red - it is a medium-intensity, elegant and persistent daytime scent I&#x27;ve used for 22 years+.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I get so much out of the experience when I spray this in the right places ;)</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something in the under-$50 range only, this is easily a 5-star bottle for you.</li>
      <li>my only criticism is of the spray - it doesn&#x27;t come out in a fine mist, but</li>
      <li>Holograph doesn&#x27;t look very authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>bought for a gift &amp; it is very presentable &amp;</li>
      <li>fast shipment.</li>
      <li>in a heavier straight stream ~ but don&#x27;t think a guy will mind.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>If you know what a \\&quot;green cardamom\\&quot; smells like (known as \\&quot;elachi\\&quot; in some countries), then that&#x27;s kind of what this fragrance smells like.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The most disappointing thing then, is how quickly it fades - about 10-15 minutes after applying, most of the scent will be gone.</li>
      <li>But for now, its a decent item.</li>
      <li>I might have to stick with this particular scent for a minute.</li>
      <li>Men&#x27;s fragrance with a high level of permanence in the body.</li>
      <li>I gave it a four star instead of five because I am not the one who is using it and not sure if my friend is still enjoying it .</li>
      <li>(Which is a good thing due to the floral and green nature...</li>
      <li>theme too far here.</li>
      <li>I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
      <li>There are several Montales, Creeds, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, Serge Lutens and Amouage fragrances filling most of those spots, as well as a few from Kenzo, Issey Miyake, and Succes de Paris (i.e., Fujiyama).</li>
      <li>This one comes highly recommended and I&#x27;ll confidently buy a few other Ferrari fragrances to see what else they&#x27;ve done in their line.</li>
      <li>I think this one stays on for a little lesser time than &#x27;Red&#x27; which also smells a bit better too.</li>
      <li>It has an above-average spray, in terms of volume, dispersion, and general feel.</li>
      <li>My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;.</li>
      <li>so this bottle (Ferrari Extreme) also appears to be a pretty solid buy on &#x27;value&#x27; grounds.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ferrari perfumes without discussion are of great quality, Ferrary Estreme maintains that statement. Men&#x27;s fragrance with a high level of permanence in the body.</li>
    <li> The scent of this Eau De Toillet is very pleasant and great for any kind of situation. Great delivery and seller!!</li>
    <li> A brief blurb to place my fragrance sensibilities: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances. My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;. I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity. I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber. Things often called &amp;#34;Desire&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34;. I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals. Good ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a pleasant surprise to me. It&#x27;s a supple, sappy, over-the-top floral scent that to me is highly reminiscent of Kenzo Power, another fragrance I also enjoy immensely. The top note did have some alcohol and mids hinted at some sweet type stuff and a hint of powder, but the basenote is a blaring, awesome, just barely sweet floral melange. I&#x27;d have to try it again to see if I can identify any specific floral scent, but like Kenzo Power, that may be beside the point. It&#x27;s clean, in-your-face, FLOWERS!!! Good grief. &amp;#34;Extreme&amp;#34; is an apt name. Kenzo Power seems to have gone up in price quite a bit in the years since I bought it so this bottle (Ferrari Extreme) also appears to be a pretty solid buy on &#x27;value&#x27; grounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box and bottle were extremely neat, well-put together, tightly wrapped. the bottle is cut nicely and feels solid to hold. It has an above-average spray, in terms of volume, dispersion, and general feel. Altogether I&#x27;m very happy with this bottle (and again, it&#x27;s competing in a field of many hundreds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My four-star rating comes from no fault of this fragrance itself. If you&#x27;re looking for something in the under-$50 range only, this is easily a 5-star bottle for you. In my rating system, a 5-star fragrance is something bordering on exotic, so special and unique that it would place, in a &amp;#34;top 25&amp;#34; list in my wardrobe, completely regardless of price. There are several Montales, Creeds, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, Serge Lutens and Amouage fragrances filling most of those spots, as well as a few from Kenzo, Issey Miyake, and Succes de Paris (i.e., Fujiyama). This one isn&#x27;t far out of the top 25. It is VERY good. But it&#x27;s not a knock-your-socks-off, super-unique fragrance when considering the full field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 4 stars, for me, means that it&#x27;s good enough that I will gladly buy another bottle to replace this one when it&#x27;s nearing empty, assuming they still make it. It&#x27;s still extremely good. This one comes highly recommended and I&#x27;ll confidently buy a few other Ferrari fragrances to see what else they&#x27;ve done in their line.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price or swanky name fool you!  This stuff smells amazing!  Ferrari makes a few colognes, all of which smell good, but this one is the best in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband some years ago, and got hooked. There is no other scent that i love more. Its very subtle, light, happy, sexy. And it smells amazing on my 21 year old nephew, and on my husband, and on my dad. It is a perfect cologne.</li>
    <li> exactly as described. fast shipment. thank you</li>
    <li> I do say this is the first time I have purchased an Eau De Toilette online and I am impressed. This smells all sporty, handsome, manly, and expensive. The bottle shown is a little different in person, it is black not gold tint but its not a problem. For a man getting the ladies is huge and this helps a lot. So men buy this and go out there and get those ladies, and if you have a fine women already impress her with your scent!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is normal :)&lt;br /&gt;it has  a strong manly smooth ,but something not clear..its also have not ..Sustainable smell..&lt;br /&gt;i think its not a original,its like something china..</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Almost perfect customer service. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its opening is a little stronger than Ferrari black and red, but once it settles down it gets more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for casual wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest wearing this cologne from a brand called Ferrari I was weary. I didn&#x27;t want to be a jersey shore type. But after all the compliments I&#x27;ve been getting since I started using this cologne. I might have to stick with this particular scent for a minute. And yes I was assured by many people that wearing this brand doesn&#x27;t make you a jersey shore moron.</li>
    <li> Good perfume. Great value for money. I give a star short because in comparison with &#x27;Red&#x27; this one scores tiny bit lower.I think this one stays on for a little lesser time than &#x27;Red&#x27; which also smells a bit better too.</li>
    <li> great smell. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great and smooth, just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> this is a great buy! my only criticism is of the spray - it doesn&#x27;t come out in a fine mist, but in a heavier straight stream ~ but don&#x27;t think a guy will mind. the smell is sexy &amp; manly.  it&#x27;s warm/spicy with a citrus quality. the packaging was in perfect condition. bought for a gift &amp; it is very presentable &amp; the scent very appealing.  there is nothing about the scent i can imagine undesirable, it&#x27;s very masculine, not too heavy, not at all too perfume-y, certainly not cheap smelling.</li>
    <li> If you know what a \\&quot;green cardamom\\&quot; smells like (known as \\&quot;elachi\\&quot; in some countries), then that&#x27;s kind of what this fragrance smells like.

Holograph doesn&#x27;t look very authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sending this, and the other fragrances I bought, overseas to my dad. So I will be sure to ask him about the item later on. If there is anything fishy, I might have to contact Amazon. But for now, its a decent item. And i would recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t used to having \\&quot;elachi\\&quot; around.</li>
    <li> I bought this colone as a gift to a friend and he seems to like it. I gave it a four star instead of five because I am not the one who is using it and not sure if my friend is still enjoying it .</li>
    <li> As a devoted user of &amp;#34;Ferrari Red&amp;#34;, I gave this re-iteration a try and was rather disappointed. (I posted a review on Ferrari red - it is a medium-intensity, elegant and persistent daytime scent I&#x27;ve used for 22 years+.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this starts off with a blast of intensity, they have taken the &amp;#34;gasoline fumes&amp;#34; theme too far here. Mixed in with that is an overpowering fake-floral chrysanthemum smell, as well as sharp, green &amp;#34;Vetiver&amp;#34; types of aromas. (If I wanted to be kind, I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;lime peel&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most disappointing thing then, is how quickly it fades - about 10-15 minutes after applying, most of the scent will be gone. (Which is a good thing due to the floral and green nature...)&lt;br /&gt;It seems the heart and base were dialed back compared to e.g. the &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34;, because hardly any cedar remains. What you are left with is a weak scent not unlike floral soap with a dash of after-shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting more! This is the best of all time cologne made in Italy! My girls love the scent of it! It gets me laid every time. I get so much out of the experience when I spray this in the right places ;)</li>
