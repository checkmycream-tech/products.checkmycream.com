### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Otherwise Its great..</li>
      <li>Very nice.  </li>
      <li>she loved it.  </li>
      <li>Good construction.  </li>
      <li>Good mirror.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is robust and with very good quality lightning, which is easy to set.</li>
      <li>I love this mirror!</li>
      <li>Very good mirror that offers superior lighting</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am very happy with the natural lighting effect and settings.</li>
      <li>My beau purchased it for me to use in his house when I stay over, and I like so much better than the Conair I&#x27;ve been using in my apartment, that  I&#x27;m buying myself one to use at my home.</li>
      <li>My wife is delighted with this elegant and sophisticated mirror, which is neither too large or too</li>
      <li>The 10x magnification side is concave - if you have your face close to the mirror, part of your face will not be &amp;#34;lit up&amp;#34; by the light.</li>
      <li>I loved my old Conair 10x mirror which I had since 2006, why Conair would so redesign</li>
      <li>I would be even more impressed if there was somewhere to store the cable out of sight when not using the light, but overall the product is high quality and worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it just still trying to get use to the  changes from my old one.</li>
      <li>It does get hot when the light is on for more than 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>this gets really hot , hope it is ok</li>
      <li>lighted mirror has a gentle, adjustable glow (brighter white to dimmer warm glow to brighter warm glow).  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews before i purchased the mirror and had mixed feelings when i placed my order, but i was very pleased when it arrived.</li>
      <li>Love the extra magnification circle!</li>
      <li>The intensity of the fluorescent light ring in my previous mirror was too strong for my eyes</li>
      <li>The stem of the stand is very  &amp;#34;squat&amp;#34; and not something I would want on my vanity.  </li>
      <li>Magnification is very distorted.  </li>
      <li>But, then she realized much she needed it and was using it every day.  </li>
      <li>The only thing would have made it five stars was the size of the mirror, I would liked it to be 2 to three inches larger.  </li>
      <li>Too high of magnification, my wife says, she has to get her face too close to the mirror.</li>
      <li>This mirror does the job although the little area on the bottom of the regular strength mirror is totally useless and the metal on the exterior of the mirror gets pretty warm to hot when the light is on.</li>
      <li>I surprised my sister with this mirror.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The small magnifying inset can be positioned at the top or bottom of your mirror simply by flipping mirror left-to-right and top-to-bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Would have given five stars, but when you raise the mirror up, it will not stay even when tightening the post.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! My beau purchased it for me to use in his house when I stay over, and I like so much better than the Conair I&#x27;ve been using in my apartment, that  I&#x27;m buying myself one to use at my home.</li>
    <li> I surprised my sister with this mirror.  Initially, she didn&#x27;t think she needed it.  But, then she realized much she needed it and was using it every day.  We are both on the other side of 50 so the eyes aren&#x27;t what they used to be.  I use mine every day to apply makeup.  My husband even uses it to remove unwanted facial hairs.</li>
    <li> Magnification is very distorted.  I returned the mirror.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror as the one I&#x27;ve used for years finally broke.  This mirror does the job although the little area on the bottom of the regular strength mirror is totally useless and the metal on the exterior of the mirror gets pretty warm to hot when the light is on. All and all I&#x27;m pretty happy with it just still trying to get use to the  changes from my old one.</li>
    <li> The intensity of the fluorescent light ring in my previous mirror was too strong for my eyes (The brightness was not adjustable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lighted mirror has a gentle, adjustable glow (brighter white to dimmer warm glow to brighter warm glow).  The knob acts as a dial for graduated control, rather than clicking into pre-determined settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small magnifying inset can be positioned at the top or bottom of your mirror simply by flipping mirror left-to-right and top-to-bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the natural lighting effect and settings.</li>

    <li> Love the extra magnification circle!</li>
    <li> How can Conair get it so wrong?  The 10x magnification side is concave - if you have your face close to the mirror, part of your face will not be &amp;#34;lit up&amp;#34; by the light. The styling of the mirror is awful!!  The stem of the stand is very  &amp;#34;squat&amp;#34; and not something I would want on my vanity.  The knob is hard to turn (for anyone with the slightest bit of arthritis).  I loved my old Conair 10x mirror which I had since 2006, why Conair would so redesign it is beyond me - it&#x27;s going back!</li>
    <li> she didn&#x27;t like it, sent back</li>
    <li> Too high of magnification, my wife says, she has to get her face too close to the mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas....she loved it.  I have one that I like too.</li>
    <li> I like the mirror i just wished it was wider.</li>
    <li> My wife is delighted with this elegant and sophisticated mirror, which is neither too large or too small.&lt;br /&gt;It is robust and with very good quality lightning, which is easy to set.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Good construction.  The only thing would have made it five stars was the size of the mirror, I would liked it to be 2 to three inches larger.  Otherwise Its great..</li>
    <li> this gets really hot , hope it is ok</li>
    <li> Very good mirror that offers superior lighting</li>
    <li> Good mirror.  It does get hot when the light is on for more than 10 minutes.  I wish the magnifier spot was just a bit smaller in circumference.</li>
