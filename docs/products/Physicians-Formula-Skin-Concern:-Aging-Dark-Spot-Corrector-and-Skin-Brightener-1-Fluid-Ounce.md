      <li>This may be good for the light spots you have, but does not work well with someone who has serious melasma / hyperpigmentation.</li>
      <li>Additionally, it smells pretty neutral (though it is not fragrance-free....</li>
      <li>I can see this working the first week...</li>
      <li>This was surprising because I use quite a few physicians formula products.</li>

      <li>Used as suggested for the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement.</li>
      <li>I originally found this at WalMart, but the price is similar online.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products for dark spots caused by hangers.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv dark spot corrector, and this worked better.</li>
      <li>I returned mine to the store for a full refund the next week.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my husband to correct some of his dark spots and out of all the other products we have tried this was by far the one that was not only the best but actually worked quickly.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>But to be fair...my skin is more than a little damaged.</li>
      <li>After a few weeks I noticed that I was more even tone.</li>
      <li>I purchased some Neutrogena to clear my dark spots and it worked way better.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t help but did make my skin more uneven.</li>
      <li>I almost never try anything new b/c if I end up being allergic</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>the Clinique dark spot correcting serum is far superior, but way more expensive.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m not able to use any products which contain benzoyl peroxide or any benzoyl derivatives - which is what most correcting creams contain.  </li>
      <li>like the feel of it so far!</li>
      <li>the scent of this reminds me vaguely of red wine, actually) and it makes my skin feel really smooth and soft,</li>
      <li>Based on what the reviewer who stated it worked for her after a two day use I may use it for another 24 hrs to see if I too have such positive results but</li>
      <li>but my spots are like special dark chocolate.  </li>
      <li>have really sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>my face was completely covered in scars.</li>
      <li>What else can I say, I am 19 years old and still in the break-out period of my life.  </li>
      <li>Now my natural skin tone is not like Alex Wek the model</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have used for 2wks and so far the spots are lighter.</li>
      <li>Id say another bottle of this stuff and ill be good.  </li>
      <li>Tons of scars, active adult acne, large pores and the whole deal.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 5 days (2 times a day) and have already noticed significant fading of my dark spots!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this project, especially for African-American skin.</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes, but nothing.  </li>
      <li>Either way, it is far less expensive than department store brands and not as effective - but worth the price if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
      <li>especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I had been using the Clinque serum for dark spots since it first came out</li>
      <li>I am also using all their other products that I really like that I do feel work together in a uniformed manner</li>
      <li>I was skeptical, to say the least, because so many products don&#x27;t live up to their claim, but this product REALLY works!!  </li>
      <li>it didnt do anything much about my dark marks</li>
      <li>I was surprised and asked him if he was using it correctly because it hadn&#x27;t been that long since we ordered it.  </li>
      <li>This was the only other dark spot product made by a company that had been friendly with my skin in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I who never had dry skin or pimples developed both.</li>

    <li> I have used for 2wks and so far the spots are lighter. I am also using all their other products that I really like that I do feel work together in a uniformed manner so give them a try also.</li>
    <li> My husband made a very disappointing discovery this morning.  He came in and told me his bottle was empty.  I was surprised and asked him if he was using it correctly because it hadn&#x27;t been that long since we ordered it.  He said he wasn&#x27;t sure but that I should unscrew the top and stick a cotton swab down the bottle.  The cotton swab only went half way down the bottle!!!  It never occurred to me to unscrew any of the products that I have purchased.  I guess I always assumed they were sealed.  But I will be doing that very thing from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchase a bottle of something, I expect to receive a full bottle.  I just checked my bottle and the cotton swab only goes half way down the bottle.  Then it hit the bottom of the bottle!  This reminds me of some slight of hand problems that beauty products used to have.  But I thought that problem had been corrected.  THE INSIDE OF THE BOTTLE IS NOT THE SAME SIZE AS THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOTTLE.  SO BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every dark spot corrector on the market (Ambien, Clinque, you name it) and some tend to fade them over time but never completely gotten rid of my spots. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and it&#x27;s fantastic. I&#x27;ve seen my dark spots get visually lighten and in some spots completely faded away. I highly recommend this project, especially for African-American skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent of this product and didn&#x27;t see any result.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes, but nothing.  I wanted it to work - but no - So my advice is don&#x27;t waste your money and just get a cover cream.</li>
    <li> I am a 38 year old black female. I have been told I look good for my age ( 28- 32) ( especially after 70 pound weight loss) I have suffered with acne all my life. EVEN NOW! I have tried skin bleaches. They work but after a while the tube expires and then it burns your face and your acne scars get worse. Right now I have a acne scars and I get 3 big acne pimples every month. I saw physicians formula at a pharmacy drug store on sale ;buy one get one and it had a coupon on one of the bottles. So I tried it.    It works. After a few weeks I noticed that I was more even tone. I put it all over my face, not just the dark areas. Now my natural skin tone is not like Alex Wek the model and I am not light skinned, maybe a tad darker than milk chocolate but my spots are like special dark chocolate.  The physicians  formula has given me a glow. Can&#x27;t explain it, but a beautiful peachy/orange glow that DOES compliment my skin color. Now the dark areas are lighter, not gone but lighter and easier to cover with makeup.  I stopped using it for a while when $ got tight and the darkness came back so it is something you have to continue using.  I have started it again and within a week, there&#x27;s a difference.  I bought the resurfacing  cream and the firming cream to help with acne scars and the major weight loss to firm up loose skin and prevent aging.    Oh and I stopped breaking out</li>
    <li> I love this product. I saw this at Ross for about 5 bucks and figured why not try it. The picture is my results from 3weeks of use. This product will probably last you a good 6 weeks but it&#x27;s totally worth it! In my opinion, I feel like in order for any dark spot cream to work or for ppl to see results, you must exfoliate the area that you&#x27;re using it on. Target has round facial buffing pads that I use every other day with the pink grapefruit cleansing gel. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> In my particular case, I was using the product on the whole of my face (as opposed to just a few small spots or areas).  It required two &#x27;pumps&#x27; of the product to dispense enough product to cover my entire face.  Due to this, the product only lasted about 2 weeks...and, naturally, I saw absolutely no difference whatsoever in my complexion.  For the cost, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This did not work with my complexion. The smell is just awful!!! I purchased some Neutrogena to clear my dark spots and it worked way better.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any improvement. I was fastidious about use,following directions,  but didn&#x27;t see change in dark spots. ..</li>
    <li> I actually like this product a lot, but it would be misleading to other shoppers if I gave it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive skin. I&#x27;m allergic to 80% of the most common/popular products - not just skincare &amp; cosmetic products, but also laundry detergents, dryer sheets, dish soap, body creams, shampoos, hair styling products, air fresheners &amp; so on. I almost never try anything new b/c if I end up being allergic my eyes swell shut and I get full on bumpy hives all over. I had good luck with their eyeshadows since I was a teenager so I crossed my fingers and decided to try this product. Big leap of faith!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll tell you why I got brave....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a wreck. Tons of scars, active adult acne, large pores and the whole deal. I had been using the Clinque serum for dark spots since it first came out &amp; I really loved it...but I got so sick of paying $60 for an ounce! So expensive! So I was in the market for a less expensive alternative. This was the only other dark spot product made by a company that had been friendly with my skin in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fragrance free, as in, fragrance hasn&#x27;t been artificially added. It does smell. it just smells like one of those fancy ingredients I guess. the smell is fine, it fades right away and it&#x27;s not an unpleasant odor at all. It feels really nice on my skin. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. I have all sorts of different acne products and they all tend to dry my skin. I keep this on my night stand and I put it on my face when I get in bed at night. It really helps counter act all the moisture loss that treating acne causes. It has never caused a reaction on my skin &amp; it doesn&#x27;t sting if it gets on broken skin. It&#x27;s worth $19 just for that (to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my last few pumps of serum as we speak &amp; unfortunately I have not seen a reduction in dark spots or skin brightness. But to be fair...my skin is more than a little damaged. I&#x27;m not certain it does what it claims to do, but it does enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - the Clinique dark spot correcting serum is far superior, but way more expensive.</li>
    <li> I faithfully used this morning and evening for 1 month now and see no change or fading what so ever!  So disappointed and a waste of money!  It isn&#x27;t cheap either!!!  I would not recommend it to anyone!  Try something else!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews about how this helps with dark spots, but I have been using this product every day and night for about 4 weeks now and I am sad to say I don&#x27;t see a difference. Maybe this just is not for me :/</li>
    <li> Price is great. Works, but takes time for results so be patient! I originally found this at WalMart, but the price is similar online. Either way, it is far less expensive than department store brands and not as effective - but worth the price if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
    <li> I had to return it.  I who never had dry skin or pimples developed both. It also smells awful.  This was surprising because I use quite a few physicians formula products.</li>
    <li> Both my mother and myself tried this product and neither one if us were imoressed. She is starting to get age spots and used this religiously to try to get results but they didn&#x27;t get any lighter. I used it on a scar on my face from a pimple and nothing. I applied every night for several weeks then gave up. Maybe we just had bad luck and it was wrong for our skin type I&#x27;m not sure</li>
    <li> I picked this item up and thought my prayers were answered because as I get older I found I had a few dark spots. This didn&#x27;t help but did make my skin more uneven. And did nothing for my dark spots. I regret using this product. sadly</li>
    <li> Smells weird and the texture of it on my skin feels like paint . Saw no difference in my skin .It probably meant for other skin types than mine.</li>
    <li> meh- after 6 weeks didn&#x27;t notice any change in my brown spots. Typical over the counter corrector product expectations I guess.</li>
    <li> unbelieveable!!!  I can see this working the first week...the only problem is there is only one ounce and it&#x27;s a little pricey. I am in my mid 60&#x27;s and just the last 2 years started getting brown spots on my arms and hands. I use a sunscreen also during the day.</li>
    <li> wasted my money on this since I&#x27;ve seen no results</li>
    <li> the skin corrector works really well. like all products, just not over use them and the results will surprise you.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do one bit of good on my dark spots.  So, uh uh, don&#x27;t even bother with it, you&#x27;ll just throw money away.</li>
    <li> Used as suggested for the whole bottle. Did not notice any lessening of dark spots.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this and the bottle came in another language made me real unsure if it&#x27;s even the right  item. Has this happened to anyone</li>
    <li> This product helps diminish my acne scars.  It took about a month to really see results.  Id say another bottle of this stuff and ill be good.  One bottle lasts about 2 months if you just use it at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and can all ready see two age spots on my face fading away and 1 on my chest. Great product at an excellent price</li>
    <li> I cannot necessarily review the effectiveness of the product, as the pump gave out after a few days.  I tried unscrewing the top and knocking out some of the product to use but it came out in a big blob.  They need to reassess their packaging...</li>
    <li> This is an ok product. Haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the Clinique Dark Spot corrector.</li>
    <li> I have not used it for the recommended time yet but I actually can see a difference already. I have some spots on my face from an illness and this is helping. The cream it nice and light and not greasy. It blends well with other make-up.</li>
    <li> After using the entire bottle I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference.........I won&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
    <li> This product, unfortunately, did not work for me.  I saw other reviews of the great results, which is one of the reasons why I purchased it.  I used 2 bottles, and applied it faithfully twice each day with no noticeable results.</li>
    <li> This product does help even skin tone but dark spots only fade some.  Great nice moisturizer especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this product I bought it for my mother and it did NOT work i WASTED my money</li>
    <li> This may be good for the light spots you have, but does not work well with someone who has serious melasma / hyperpigmentation. I would not recommend this for those who really want to get rid of the hard to get rid of spots.</li>
    <li> What else can I say, I am 19 years old and still in the break-out period of my life.  Recently after my break-outs, I have started to retain acne scars.  I thought that this would work. It didn&#x27;t.  I used the product as directed and the scars stayed the same.  The darkness and the size were still the same after I ran out of the product.</li>
    <li> it didnt do anything much about my dark marks but my skin was much smoother.Pore refined lines diminished and skin more plump. will buy agian but not for dark marks</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. Many products will make me break out. This one did not. It was also lightweight and absorbed quickly. It smells like sea weed. It did even out my skin a little but it did not erase any spots I already had. You will need to wear a moisturizer over it if you have dry skin. It was mediocre and I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It did appear to lighten the skin all around the dark spot but not the dark spot itself. If carefully applied to the dark spot only, it may help some. I will be trying another brand.</li>
    <li> Acne scars are almost gone! Going to buy some more, the scars started fading the first week I started using this product, I have ayellow undertone &amp; I am very light in the skin so this product helped fade even the reddish darkesh blemish marks  on my skin. I also I have oily skin so this product moisturized my skin, as I put it on my face at night</li>
    <li> I like the product seens I start using it my dark spots loos more clear hope they desapear good product</li>
    <li> Tried it and didn&#x27;t like it.  It didn&#x27;t do as well as I expected.  Not much difference for any of the other dark spot correctors. expensive for the amount you get too</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m not able to use any products which contain benzoyl peroxide or any benzoyl derivatives - which is what most correcting creams contain.  After extensive research I found Physician&#x27;s Formula.  I was skeptical, to say the least, because so many products don&#x27;t live up to their claim, but this product REALLY works!!  After using it for only 2 days, 2 times per day, the dark spots I had have almost completely vanished!  I would recommend this product to any and everyone!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 days (2 times a day) and have already noticed significant fading of my dark spots! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to correct some of his dark spots and out of all the other products we have tried this was by far the one that was not only the best but actually worked quickly. Results within a few days.</li>
    <li> Every year I spend a few weeks on the beach on vacation, this year I came home with dark/age spots on my face. This product does improve/remove the dark spots. I could see an improvement in as little as two week. My skin is also very sensitive to many products but this product did not cause me any irritations. Great product!</li>
    <li> All I can say about this stuff is that it works for me. I have a couple dark spots from old breakouts and so on, that have definitely faded with regular use of this product. Additionally, it smells pretty neutral (though it is not fragrance-free....the scent of this reminds me vaguely of red wine, actually) and it makes my skin feel really smooth and soft, never greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always struggled with my skin, everything from adolescent and then adult acne to extreme dryness, sensitivity, and of course some dark spots. With this type of combination skin and especially the sensitivity, finding a product that both works and does not make one of these issues worse is a challenge. This fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I bought this product because it was supposed to be hypoallergenic dermatologist approved, etc, etc.  Within two weeks my face was swollen, red and burning,with welt-like patches.  I ended up going to urgent care for treatment.  Not a pleasant experience at all.  If anyone has any kind of reaction to any skin products I would caution you NOT to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product smells terrible, which is not apparent when/if you briefly check the scent while still in the store. The smell is very difficult to live with at night while trying to sleep and forget about trying to apply it under your foundation as the aroma stays with you throughout the day and leaves concern that others can smell it as well. Based on what the reviewer who stated it worked for her after a two day use I may use it for another 24 hrs to see if I too have such positive results but that is about all I think I can handle of this horrendous smelling product. You would think a product created snd tested by physicians would have had the good sense to make is scent free. Go figure. I returned mine to the store for a full refund the next week.</li>
    <li> Just started using it! like the feel of it so far!</li>
    <li> After being pregnant and having the worst acne of my life my face was completely covered in scars. I&#x27;ve only ever had good experiences with physicians formula and decided to try this out. I have been using it for two weeks now and my older scars are pretty much gone. The more darker ones have gotten lighter as well. I love this product. It works as promised, with the dark spots and lightening skin as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv dark spot corrector, and this worked better. It took about three weeks, but the spots I had from acne have faded. They are 80% gone. I don&#x27;t think the last 20% is going away. My skin looks so much better I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it every day and night for two weeks ad I&#x27;m still waiting to see fewer dark spots but I like the way it feels on my skin,</li>
    <li> This product has a very slight tint to it. It won&#x27;t replace you foundation or concealer, but it will brighten your skin. It goes on smoothly and has the feel of a moisturizer. For a 1.0 fluid ounce bottle, it lasts a long time. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews.  It seems to help my skin texture and to smooth out some of the acne marks I&#x27;ve had.  I think it also has helped with the dark aging spots.  I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle and see if it helps more.</li>
    <li> I ordered it because of the good reviews it has. I&#x27;ve been applying it to all my face, twice daily for 10 weeks and the sun spots on my cheeks look the same, and the overall tone as well. It has been a bit disappointing but I assume it doesn&#x27;t works the same for everybody.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Has a nice smell and seems to do the job.  I can see where dark spots have diminished.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for dark spots caused by hangers.  My skin is very thin and this is the worst product of many I have bpught and I will pass on this \\&quot;physicians formula\\&quot; like all physicians who are stupid and using the physicians name to make a person think some work went into this product.  Ha.</li>
