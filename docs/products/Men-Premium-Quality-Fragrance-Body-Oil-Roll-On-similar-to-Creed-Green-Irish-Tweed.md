### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>One of the best summer scents out there.</li>
      <li>For the price this is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Like maybe 4 days or so, and it smells real good.</li>
      <li>The aventus is awesome as well.</li>
      <li>The best oil I have ever purchased online and off the street from a vendor.</li>
      <li>The two scents work really good together!</li>
      <li>Great longevity.</li>
      <li>Great buy, get it.</li>
      <li>Great smell, not offensive, longevity is good.</li>
      <li>Very impressed and will buy again :)</li>
      <li>This one is softer and charming.</li>
      <li>This oil is soooooooooooooo amazing.</li>
      <li>I wear this one to work and always have someone ask me what kind of cologne I am wearing.</li>
      <li>A very good interpretation of this classic fragrance.</li>
      <li>Great new scent that is totally unique and is a great blend, try it.</li>
      <li>Please stay in business for along time because I will want more when this runs out.</li>
      <li>but if it smells anything like this, then i&#x27;m sure this oil is a steal for the price.</li>
      <li>woman love it, so i love it.</li>
      <li>seeing as the body of the fragrance and not the opener is what most people find appealing</li>
      <li>I am going to be buy more from this sell.</li>
      <li>I will by more just to have it on hand and some in my briefcase.</li>
      <li>I have gotten some many compliments from all the oil&#x27;s I have purchased from this buyer.</li>
      <li>I love how it smell very lovely and very close to original!</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great, I&#x27;m definitely going to try others.</li>
      <li>The original is classier.</li>
      <li>Its just like the original.</li>
      <li>Great compromise instead of buying the real thing lasts super long although I do have to say that I miss being able to smell it on my shirts even after putting them through the wash.</li>
      <li>I wear it with Cool Water</li>
      <li>I have cool water</li>
      <li>IDENTICAL smell to cool water</li>
      <li>smells good for 30-40min, if that long!!</li>
      <li>This is such a nice smell.</li>
      <li>you like Cool Water, but want a little more sophisticated scent</li>
      <li>your better off buying yourself a bottle of Cool water for the same price.</li>
      <li>The best way to explain the smell is to think of irish springs soap with a slight hint of lemon and spice.</li>
      <li>The sweet, flowery scent of this, mixed with the spice of the other makes a great combination.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>great odor, last long.</li>
      <li>Basically it smells like the Pine opening of GIT with absolutely no transition to that beautiful middle and end of GIT,</li>
      <li>The order got here fast!</li>
      <li>Not sure how close it is to the real thing, but it is a very enjoyable scent.</li>
      <li>I own the actual creed GIT, and i bought this straight up out of curiosity to see how close a clone can get to the actual thing.</li>
      <li>I would say 4-8 hours depending on how much you sweat and your body chemistry...</li>
      <li>This fragrance is very close to the real thing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a a much heavier oil based fragrance.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>AMAZINGLY FAST SHIPPING.</li>
      <li>I get a very soapy vibe out of this one, just like if you are out of the shower.</li>
      <li>and I have to wash it off since the smell really offensive.</li>
      <li>makes the real irish spring seem bland, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I have tried others of Serina&#x27;s oil fragrances (Creed Aventus, Bond no. 9 New harlem) and out of those I would say that the green irish tweed is the best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never smelled Irish Tweed before, but wanted something similar to Cool Water., which has been now watered down to the point of being good for about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>: They actually heard what I were saying and they reformulated it to the original version, now I have an original bottle of Green Irish Tweed 4oz which I bought for 140$ and most of the time  use this body roll on fragrance instead.</li>
      <li>Similar to Cool Water at the start</li>
      <li>Totally better than original Green Irish Tweed.</li>
      <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: One day I rolled this on over some Old Spice, by accident, and guess what?</li>
      <li>And so you don&#x27;t think I work for this woman, I live in Los Angele&#x27;s and the package was sent from South Carolina.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to do a blind comparison, but I used to wear GIT for years, recently I haven&#x27;t been able to justify purchasing it.  </li>
      <li>It smells alot like Cool Water, but with other spice scents thrown in.</li>
      <li>Wow wow wow.</li>
      <li>I bought a roll on bottle last year,I really like it, smells like heaven</li>
      <li>The fragrance smelled nice on the broken glass.</li>
      <li>Lets get down to brass tacks: It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap, it must have most of the constituent base and top notes of GIT, they probably just cut out a couple of the more expensive ingredients.</li>
      <li>What happened to the original version of Green Irish Tweed?  </li>
      <li>but the dry down is a little more woodsy.</li>

<li> Green irish tweed-</li>
<li> Its alright, If your expecting GIT, prepare to be let down.</li>
<li> I just put a small amount on the palm of my hand with the roller and place it around my neck.  </li>
<li> The bottle arrived broken, and I had to throw the broken pieces of glass and scent in the trash.</li>
<li> I am just shocked on the quality and scent.</li>

    <li> Green irish tweed- I get a very soapy vibe out of this one, just like if you are out of the shower. I don’t get any powdery woody floral notes in it. The original is classier. It smells like prada pour home to me.AMAZINGLY FAST SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to do a blind comparison, but I used to wear GIT for years, recently I haven&#x27;t been able to justify purchasing it.  This roll on scent smells the way I remember GIT.  Lets get down to brass tacks: It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap, it must have most of the constituent base and top notes of GIT, they probably just cut out a couple of the more expensive ingredients. For the price this is an excellent product. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as a more expensive fragrance, but at this price point you can afford to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I wear it with Cool Water and I like the combination.</li>
    <li> The best way to explain the smell is to think of irish springs soap with a slight hint of lemon and spice. Great smell, not offensive, longevity is good.</li>
    <li> Its alright, If your expecting GIT, prepare to be let down. I own the actual creed GIT, and i bought this straight up out of curiosity to see how close a clone can get to the actual thing. Basically it smells like the Pine opening of GIT with absolutely no transition to that beautiful middle and end of GIT, seeing as the body of the fragrance and not the opener is what most people find appealing id personally pass on this one if thats what your looking for. No one will mistake this for GIT, has none of that signature freshness that creed products have. your better off buying yourself a bottle of Cool water for the same price.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, I&#x27;m definitely going to try others. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice smell. Its just like the original. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but they do</li>
    <li> I wear this one to work and always have someone ask me what kind of cologne I am wearing. I just put a small amount on the palm of my hand with the roller and place it around my neck.  Not too over-powering and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> IDENTICAL smell to cool water</li>
    <li> great odor, last long.</li>
    <li> The order got here fast! Like maybe 4 days or so, and it smells real good. I&#x27;ve never smelled Irish Tweed before, but wanted something similar to Cool Water., which has been now watered down to the point of being good for about 30 minutes. This stuff is a a much heavier oil based fragrance. It has legs! I just put it on and it feels and acts like it will be on for days! Great buy, get it. It smells alot like Cool Water, but with other spice scents thrown in. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: One day I rolled this on over some Old Spice, by accident, and guess what? The two scents work really good together! The sweet, flowery scent of this, mixed with the spice of the other makes a great combination. So, I opened them up and mixed them together. Wow! Great new scent that is totally unique and is a great blend, try it.</li>
    <li> I get compliments almost every time I wear this, from men and women alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Cool Water, but want a little more sophisticated scent, this is for you. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it out.</li>
    <li> Great compromise instead of buying the real thing lasts super long although I do have to say that I miss being able to smell it on my shirts even after putting them through the wash. That&#x27;s the only downside.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived broken, and I had to throw the broken pieces of glass and scent in the trash. I did not receive a return receipt with this bottle so didn&#x27;t know how to return. The fragrance smelled nice on the broken glass.</li>
    <li> Wow wow wow. This oil is soooooooooooooo amazing. I have cool water and this blows it out of the water. I have never tried GIT from creed but I don&#x27;t think I need too after getting this oil. I am just shocked on the quality and scent. It is a masterpiece. The nose behind this fragrance has a true gift. I am going to be buy more from this sell. The aventus is awesome as well. Please stay in business for along time because I will want more when this runs out. And so you don&#x27;t think I work for this woman, I live in Los Angele&#x27;s and the package was sent from South Carolina.</li>

    <li> I have tried others of Serina&#x27;s oil fragrances (Creed Aventus, Bond no. 9 New harlem) and out of those I would say that the green irish tweed is the best. Its stronger and lasts longer. I would say 4-8 hours depending on how much you sweat and your body chemistry...but I put some on in the morning on my wrists and still smell it in the afternoon. I would describe it as a citrus-like irish spring....makes the real irish spring seem bland, and has a pleasant smell. I&#x27;ve never smelled the real creed green irish tweed...but if it smells anything like this, then i&#x27;m sure this oil is a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Thank you! I love how it smell very lovely and very close to original! Very impressed and will buy again :)</li>
    <li> One of the best summer scents out there. A very good interpretation of this classic fragrance. Great longevity. Similar to Cool Water at the start but the dry down is a little more woodsy. (citrus, woody, powdery, floral)</li>
    <li> woman love it, so i love it.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when wearing it. Not sure how close it is to the real thing, but it is a very enjoyable scent.</li>
