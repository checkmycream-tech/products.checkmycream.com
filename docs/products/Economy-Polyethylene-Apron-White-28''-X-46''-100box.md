      <li>Four more words to go.</li>
      <li>Easy on and off.  </li>
      <li>Neat aprons, come in a bag, easy to carry.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more soft and silky-it must be good if my cat sits still on my lap-</li>
      <li>Good protection, covered my whole body and was light weight easy to move around in.  </li>
      <li>it is plenty roomy on me which means it will fit good on any size-it&#x27;s a nice plastic-not like regular plastic-</li>
      <li>/&gt;This works out just fine.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s the only reason they lost a star; however, they worked great for my party</li>
      <li>these have become indispensable to me for brushing teeth and shaving, as i am in a wheelchair every waking hour.</li>

      <li>Sanitary and keeps ones clothing clean.  </li>
      <li>but they are great for crafts, kids and just all around messy people.</li>
      <li>These water proof aprons are amazing, i work in the back of a bakery cleaning trays in the sink and let me tell you water flies!</li>
      <li>These are economical but work as they should.</li>
      <li>i never dreamed when i ordered these how handy and useful they would become, and i urge anyone with my needs or similar to give them a try.</li>
      <li>Everyone had so much fun with them.</li>
      <li>Makes servers look more professional and neat.</li>
      <li>They work well and are well worth the price.</li>
      <li>The seller did include a discount coupon and complimentary classroom first aid kit (</li>
      <li>They were cut on the side and barely went to the waist on most students.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It was really neat!</li>
      <li>folded up in their individual sleeves, they take up remarkably little space; all the more surprising, then, to see how large they seem to unfold.</li>
      <li>light weight and do the trick with minimal clean up.</li>
      <li>What I have received are asymmetrical pieces of plastic with a large hole on one side.</li>
      <li>i use this apron when i brush my cat-it really is 1 size fits all-</li>
      <li>Works very well, just what I needed.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy my box of white aprons.  </li>
      <li>I thought about using cloth aprons for my students, but decided on this very affordable box of disposable aprons</li>
      <li>but the quality is  very thinh</li>
      <li>Really protected the servers clothing.  </li>
      <li>I would have liked an initial refund rather than waiting for the extra defective aprons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast and each apron is wrapped individually.  </li>
      <li>The ties are long enough to fit 3X persons, they are strong, resist tearing and completely covers the front of the person.</li>
      <li>Most of the aprons were torn while opening them and the ties are not long enough</li>
      <li>/&gt;Contacted Amazon and received a full refund shortly thereafter.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend these aprons.</li>
      <li>The loop over the head (around the neck) places the apron at just the right height and the ties make it around my middle and have room to spare for tying.</li>
      <li>i will definitely buy more of these again when my current stocks runs low.</li>
      <li>make sure you get the ones that come individually packed, I think these do, I bought 2 different kinds and the ones that are not individually wrapped</li>
      <li>the size was adequate for all groups and we had 3rd - 9th graders at various times.  </li>
      <li>If the neck was too large we simply tied it up as well.  </li>
      <li>The quality is as you would expect for a plastic apron, works very well for short time use.</li>
      <li>Cover the whole front of cloths and tie in back.</li>
      <li>They keep them dry and they are not to hot to wear.</li>
      <li>I chose this rating because it is fine, I do notice that they split down the middle.  </li>
      <li>They are large enough to cover me, 175 lb female, 5 ft 5&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>They were a little thinner plastic than I expected, but the price was right and they absolutely worked for what I wanted.</li>
      <li>they are in tiny little bags so they are easy to pass out and 100 are contained in a pretty small space.</li>

<li> Was surprised how thick they were.  Very durable.</li>
<li> Apron did meet my expectations; however, I just wish the plastic was a little more durable / heavier and not quite as thin.</li>
<li> As you pull one off to give someone the next one gets tangled - it just slows the line down.</li>
<li> all soaking wet buy with these i am always dry.</li>
<li> saves a lot of mess on my clothing, and though these are correctly described as &#x27;disposable,&#x27; they can actually be used over and over again--in fact, for months!</li>
<li> These are exactly as I expected based on the description.</li>
<li> My students wore them during frog dissections and they worked as expected.</li>
<li> They are a little thinner than expected</li>
<li> They are a bit thin but it does the job for single time use.</li>
<li> Expect a few to break if you pull too hard...</li>
<li> The plastic is thin, but that is what I expected based on the description.</li>
<li> Very very thin material, sometimes the bands just rip open when you try to tie them.</li>
<li> I hardly recommends this product.</li>
<li> However, I would have assumed that the seller would at least look at the quality of the replacement product.</li>
<li> These aprons are extremely thin, almost tissue thin, way thinner than I expected.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The aprons were cut incorrectly; it appears that the cutting method sliced through what should have been the center of each apron.</li>
<li> they were very thin, but kept all of the messy items off of clothes quite well.  </li>
<li> ...just know they are very, very thin...</li>

    <li> My aides use these aprons when giving mea shower. They keep them dry and they are not to hot to wear. Highly recommend these aprons.</li>
    <li> I was ok . but the quality is  very thinh</li>
    <li> Very very thin material, sometimes the bands just rip open when you try to tie them. Othewise ok as disposal aprons.</li>
    <li> Its inexpensive but good for its price</li>
    <li> These are exactly as I expected based on the description. They are large enough to cover me, 175 lb female, 5 ft 5&amp;#34;. The loop over the head (around the neck) places the apron at just the right height and the ties make it around my middle and have room to spare for tying. The plastic is thin, but that is what I expected based on the description. Great product that I will buy again when I finish what I have.</li>
    <li> These are standard plastic disposable aprons. They do the job as you would expect. My students wore them during frog dissections and they worked as expected.</li>
    <li> Bought these disposable aprons for servers to wear at a charity barbeque.  The servers loved them -- one size did fit everyone on the line.  Really protected the servers clothing.  Worked great.  Very economical.  Was surprised how thick they were.  Very durable.</li>
    <li> **Update**&lt;br /&gt;After I contacted the seller, they responded within 24 hours and sent a replacement product. I was very happy with this response. When the replacement product arrived, however, the aprons were still defective. The seller did include a discount coupon and complimentary classroom first aid kit (neither of which did I ask for). However, I would have assumed that the seller would at least look at the quality of the replacement product. I would have liked an initial refund rather than waiting for the extra defective aprons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Amazon and received a full refund shortly thereafter. One star for the seller&#x27;s attempted customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received the product today and will change my review pending seller action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aprons were cut incorrectly; it appears that the cutting method sliced through what should have been the center of each apron. What I have received are asymmetrical pieces of plastic with a large hole on one side. These aprons, as defective, can not be used to cover the space specified because of the resultant hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item did arrive within the specified delivery date range (although, at the latter end of that range).</li>
    <li> These are economical but work as they should. Expect a few to break if you pull too hard...for the money though, worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works well. They are a bit thin but it does the job for single time use. Four more words to go.</li>
    <li> Neat aprons, come in a bag, easy to carry. Cover the whole front of cloths and tie in back. Can be rinsed off in sink and use over and over.  I use them for invalid mother but they are great for crafts, kids and just all around messy people.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described. We used it for a painting event and they worked just fine, disposable and nicely folded. Good price/value combination!</li>
    <li> They are a little thinner than expected but they do the job......protect clothing while eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works out just fine.</li>
    <li> Good protection, covered my whole body and was light weight easy to move around in.  Would recommend it to anyone who needs an apron.</li>
    <li> I purchase these aprons to use for students with disabilities, they did not meet my expectations. They were cut on the side and barely went to the waist on most students.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my box of white aprons.  The shipping was super fast and each apron is wrapped individually.  The quality is as you would expect for a plastic apron, works very well for short time use.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for use at camp.  the size was adequate for all groups and we had 3rd - 9th graders at various times.  If the neck was too large we simply tied it up as well.  they were very thin, but kept all of the messy items off of clothes quite well.  the packaging was nice for our purposes.  they are in tiny little bags so they are easy to pass out and 100 are contained in a pretty small space.</li>
    <li> These water proof aprons are amazing, i work in the back of a bakery cleaning trays in the sink and let me tell you water flies! i used to leave work all soaking wet buy with these i am always dry. i will definitely buy more of these again when my current stocks runs low.</li>
    <li> Works very well, just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Functional, but very easy to tear just trying to put it on.  Five out of eight adults I am teaching tore the apron before using them.</li>
    <li> They work well and are well worth the price.</li>
    <li> these are great for cleaning up, food prep and house keepers!</li>
    <li> Most of the aprons were torn while opening them and the ties are not long enough</li>
    <li> These aprons are extremely thin, almost tissue thin, way thinner than I expected.  Price was good though and they are working for my needs thus the 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I use these aprons in my fifth grade classroom.  I pin my vocabulary words to it and wear the aprons around the classroom.  Students wear them with their vocabulary words.  We are going to be studying the systems of the body and they will be drawing their digestive system and circulatory system on it.  I love that I got 100 of them.  I will be ordering more.  Lots of vocabulary words!!!</li>
    <li> Great idea! I like this product. I thought about using cloth aprons for my students, but decided on this very affordable box of disposable aprons and I like them. I don&#x27;t have to worry about washing aprons and damaging my washing machine with paint. Use it and throw it out. So convenient!</li>
    <li> these have become indispensable to me for brushing teeth and shaving, as i am in a wheelchair every waking hour. saves a lot of mess on my clothing, and though these are correctly described as &#x27;disposable,&#x27; they can actually be used over and over again--in fact, for months! at the low price for 100 of these, i have virtually a lifetime supply. construction is surprisingly sturdy, and the design is perfect to fit the body&#x27;s contours. folded up in their individual sleeves, they take up remarkably little space; all the more surprising, then, to see how large they seem to unfold. i never dreamed when i ordered these how handy and useful they would become, and i urge anyone with my needs or similar to give them a try.</li>
    <li> make sure you get the ones that come individually packed, I think these do, I bought 2 different kinds and the ones that are not individually wrapped are a pain if you are handing out a lot for a group event. As you pull one off to give someone the next one gets tangled - it just slows the line down. The individual packed ones are GREAT! light weight and do the trick with minimal clean up.</li>
    <li> Apron did meet my expectations; however, I just wish the plastic was a little more durable / heavier and not quite as thin.</li>
    <li> I purchased the aprons for my art class. They were as described. Price was great- which allowed me to purchased them to begin with and it came on time. I&#x27;d do business with them again</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my niece&#x27;s graduation party from culinary/patisserie school. We used them for decor and had each guest wear one. It was really neat! Everyone had so much fun with them. They were a little thinner plastic than I expected, but the price was right and they absolutely worked for what I wanted. I would order and use them again for my party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend (depends on what they are being used for)&lt;br /&gt;Quality was so-so...just know they are very, very thin...that&#x27;s the only reason they lost a star; however, they worked great for my party</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it is fine, I do notice that they split down the middle.  But for the price, they serve the purpose.</li>
    <li> Easy on and off.  Sanitary and keeps ones clothing clean.  Makes servers look more professional and neat. I hardly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> The order arrived on time. The ties are long enough to fit 3X persons, they are strong, resist tearing and completely covers the front of the person. These are a great value and quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Great for tye dying when working with a bunch of kids!!!</li>
    <li> i use this apron when i brush my cat-it really is 1 size fits all- i&#x27;m 5&#x27;2 -120lb it is plenty roomy on me which means it will fit good on any size-it&#x27;s a nice plastic-not like regular plastic-it&#x27;s more soft and silky-it must be good if my cat sits still on my lap-we all know how cats love to be groomed !!!!</li>
