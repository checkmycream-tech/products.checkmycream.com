      <li>/&gt; own</li>

      <li>He&#x27;s a nice guy</li>
      <li>The clippers come in a nice plastic box with raised imprint labeled ANDIS on it.</li>
      <li>A haircutting dvd would have been nice.</li>
      <li>I self cut my own hair.</li>

      <li>I had to adjust blade but works nice now</li>
      <li>These are nice for my grandsons</li>
      <li>Nice product; however, it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as I would like and you can&#x27;t do a hair line with the product.</li>
      <li>I wanted a good razor for a good price and that is exactly what I got!  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use</li>
      <li>The Andis Easy Cut 20pc Home Haircutting Kit is perfect for the advanced barber or someone who aspires to be a advanced barber.</li>
      <li>I cut my own hair and these have more than paid for themselves.</li>

      <li>It does an outstanding job.</li>
      <li>And is 29775 Headliner which is much better.</li>
      <li>well I&#x27;m definitely pleased</li>

      <li>He thought they would be better</li>
      <li>Will look for a better product when this one needs to be replaced.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with too many times to return, but I need to cut my hair again</li>

      <li>I have saved a great deal of money with them, and have&#x27;nt to much compromised my appearance, if at all.</li>
      <li>I love the blade length adjuster.</li>
      <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT...</li>
      <li>I am totally satisfied with the purchase..</li>
      <li>it self sharpens the more you use it.</li>
      <li>The lighter weight allows more detail.</li>
      <li>so I decided to give these a try based on the fact I love the outliners and for the lower cost clippers these had pretty good reviews.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend getting Osterizer brand clipper, with the kind of motor that stays cool after usage.</li>
      <li>He loved them cut very well!</li>
      <li>Good clippers for home use, very light weight easy to operate, really like the adjustable blade lever will not slip out of place like most home clippers do.  </li>
      <li>This is light weight, comfortable to hold, has nice cord length and fades well.</li>
      <li>w love it and easy to clean and store away!</li>
      <li>Very nice tool shaves head body an more than enough attachments very lite great looking an I like the protective Storage case</li>
      <li>I love it smooth and quite.</li>
      <li>My cheap Wahl shaver from Walmart does a 10x better job than this one.</li>
      <li>All of the pieces are labeled and easy to read.  </li>
      <li>Already used it once - easy to maneuver, comes with a load of attachments, blade oil included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They got a 4 because of how easy they were to get oil in the motor</li>
      <li>The razor does not pull on my hair and cleans easily.  </li>
      <li>strong motor and easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>Best use would be a quick child&#x27;s haircut, but for a little more money you can get something much better.</li>
      <li>My hair is quite fine</li>
      <li>It does what it suppose to do its cheap</li>
      <li>but they work great and feel solid.</li>
      <li>So I replaced them with these smooth detailed trimmers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If your looking for something that gets the job done and won&#x27;t leave any botches on ya head, this is where it&#x27;s at. Simple and efficient</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his Andis 29775 Headliner because he accidentally cut through the cord. He hated this one. He said it was not sharp enough. I had to then buy him the And is 29775 Headliner which is much better.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller. My son loves it! It does an outstanding job.</li>
    <li> It just works for a black guy like me who wants there hair to cut low and neat. Very please with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price</li>
    <li> These are great clippers!!</li>
    <li> Works well and very affordable. Would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> good enough, but little cheaply built.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have owned for the price...</li>
    <li> I ordered this when I was out of town for a few months for work. I had forgot my other one at home. The first shave was okay, but I noticed it losing power towards the end. Every time I&#x27;ve tried to use it after that, it keeps trying to yank the hairs out of my face and is very painful. This thing is just underpowered, plain and simple. My cheap Wahl shaver from Walmart does a 10x better job than this one.</li>
    <li> First, I would only recommend these clippers for the home/self barber. Secondly, I&#x27;m a black male, and I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, but it is a about average. I bought these from Walmart for $20.00. These clippers have yet to fail me. Surprisingly, they are very smooth. I cut my own hair and these have more than paid for themselves. The cut you get from them is very even, even without many passes. They stay cool to the touch over the entire duration of the cut and are on a higher level than any of the competing wahl clippers at the price. The reason this gets a four instead of a five star is because of the guards. The 0 &amp; 1 guard is kind of flimsy. I have no problem with the guard coming off, but I haven&#x27;t put it passed it. The lever seems weak also, so I cut with caution.</li>
    <li> strong motor and easy to handle.  Once you get the hang of cutting your own hair, you will appreciate the cost savings and convenience of cutting your hair at home</li>
    <li> For the price these are a great set.  Very happy with them</li>
    <li> It works.  I used it the day I got it.  I wished they included a little more oil to clean &amp; maintain the clippers.  The amount in the tiny bottle has me worried I&#x27;ll need to buy more after 2 uses.  The metal plate did get warm, but not hot to the touch.  The closeness could be a little better in my opinion.  Overall, I felt I got what I paid for, but nothing more or less.  I&#x27;ll post another review/recap after a few more uses and some time has passed.</li>
    <li> I use this machine for my facial hair. Pretty much to trim the hair down. I have used it on my head as well it works great!!! I shave my head with a different machine that goes lower then this one so this machine is only for my face. Its very sharp, No need to move the blades closer. It comes with a lot of attachments and other goodies. If your a starter barber or a newbie at cutting get this machine your will not be sorry! Also you cannot beat the price!!!</li>
    <li> I use it for my facial hair and I really like it</li>
    <li> It was good the first two cuts but the motor started to slow down. No happy at all</li>
    <li> I have a heavier version from another manufacturer.  The Andis is easier to use when I trim my own hair.  I&#x27;m happy with the haircutting kit but couldn&#x27;t get myself to &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34;.  I recommend it, especially if you trim your own hair.  The lighter weight allows more detail.</li>
    <li> Good product and great price</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!</li>
    <li> The Andis Easy Cut 20pc Home Haircutting Kit is perfect for the advanced barber or someone who aspires to be a advanced barber. If you are looking for a basic haircutting kit for everyday use. avoid the Andis 75360.</li>
    <li> It works great and there is lil sound to it... I love it!!!! Get this pn now you will be pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great...awesome value. Half way throught the second buzz cut on my son it paid for itself! Shipping  was fast also. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> They do alright for 20 minites then get to hot to hold...plus start making a loud buzzing noise..had em for a month now I cant use em ..wish I  could get my money back</li>
    <li> this share is just what wanted, it cuts hair very well and it as a cooling system that makes it more convenient in cutting hair for as long as you want too and it self sharpens the more you use it. I also like the fact that I can hardly hear any sound when I turn it on, clients like the fact they can&#x27;t hear any loud noise in the ears and thinks that I should recommend it to my fellow barbers, which I&#x27;ve already done.</li>
    <li> works great, not loud and scary, for the young ones perfect!!!...w love it and easy to clean and store away!</li>
    <li> These clippers are running as if it is from europe and l have it on the wrong speed.  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I would expect better from andis but you get what you pay for. I fade my hair extremely short to long and the blades definitely don&#x27;t go short enough. Spend some extra money and get a nice pair.</li>
    <li> GETS TOO HOT after 30 minutes of use</li>
    <li> For the price it is great, so i thought , but once i got it, it definitley disappointed me, the good things about it is it&#x27;s light weight, does not make alot of noise,  the bad things is &amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t cut your hair well&amp;#34; i&#x27;m african american and i brought it to cut my hair very low almost bald-like and i have to rub really hard to get it to even take the hair off. so basically i wasted the money spent on the product and shipping, and now have to turn around and still order upgraded hair clipper to get the results i need. Dont waste your money on this !!</li>
    <li> I think I must have received a bad one. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and this is one of the worst haircutters I have ever owned. I&#x27;ve suffered with too many times to return, but I need to cut my hair again and I&#x27;m not looking forward to it. I will likely toss it out and buy something cheaper the quality won&#x27;t be worse, it could only be better.</li>
    <li> They came in handy for them cleanup jobs &amp; a quick trim down.</li>
    <li> He loved them cut very well!</li>
    <li> The clippers might look a cheap in the pictures but they work great and feel solid. I am a white man with really thick hair and these clippers mow the hair down. No snags or pulls or cuts. The motor is pretty quiet all in all its a great little kit for the money.</li>
    <li> not much power to cut thin hair</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband and he hasn&#x27;t complain... I would guess he&#x27;s loving it! We got it for a good deal too!</li>
    <li> Very nice tool shaves head body an more than enough attachments very lite great looking an I like the protective Storage case</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE CLIPPERS! NOT TOO HEAVY AND GET AS CLOSE AS I NEED THEM TO!</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate clipper to have. I love the blade length adjuster. It locks into each length selection so the next time you cut you can get the same cutting height as before. Another model I have doesn&#x27;t lock with each adjustment so you have to adjust the blade length by eye. This is light weight, comfortable to hold, has nice cord length and fades well.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price and the product works really well I&#x27;m definitely pleased and I will most definitely recommend this product to my friends and family that&#x27;s into cutting hair.</li>
    <li> Cheap and loud, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> good machine and good service</li>
    <li> Bought these puppies to keep my cuts nice and low. Worked like a charm the first cut! No repeated overlapping! One pass is all that was needed for a super clean cut. Very good for saving time, as well as saving wear and tear of product by providing high quality cutting decreasing cutting time. The motor is extremely quiet. And the clippers didnt get hot at all. They come with a gang of accessories. (Cool carrying case, Scissors, Clipper extensions, etc.) and the  product will last for years to come by the build quality. Andis has always been an industry standard in my humble opinion. These are definitely A+ so far for the price. I&#x27;ll see how they do over time. But for now. Watch out! Cause they&#x27;ll cut cha!</li>
    <li> Purchased this Andis clipper, thinking I would have another great experience because I purchased Andis clippers before. At first it was working well, then shortly after while, the motor began to sound as if it was going to stop. It&#x27;s probably just a bad one that slipped through the cracks of quality control. I&#x27;d recommend getting Osterizer brand clipper, with the kind of motor that stays cool after usage.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my brother he Said there ok not what he expected. He thought they would be better</li>
    <li> Great Product with Outstanding Customer Service.</li>
    <li> These clippers shake almost violently and do not cut hair well. These shake worse than 2 pair of clippers we have that are both over 10-years-old.  They do not cut my son&#x27;s hair well and we have to go over the same place multiple times.  These are also not good for any kind of facial or head shaving as the blade cannot be adjusted down low enough.  We&#x27;re returning these and going back to Whal clippers.</li>
    <li> loud motor . worst machine ever</li>
    <li> Have you ever bought a pair of hair clippers/trimmers to meet a specific need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mainly to cut your own hair, since the price of haircuts are a bit costly on a harsh budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest here the price of a haircut is an arm and a leg and them some right?  And most barbers expect you to tip them, it&#x27;s hard out here you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my story begins: I once owned a pair of cheap clippers that rarely cut and I couldn&#x27;t stand them freaks of nature. They got hot each time you used them; so I got tired of them and replaced them. Then I had a pair of the Wahl Precision trimmers and they did cut with such precision but the thing was the motor was loud and it wasn&#x27;t as light in weight. It did a good job up until I had given them to someone whom I choose to let them remain anonymous. So I replaced them with these smooth detailed trimmers. Upon a two day wait for delivery I got embraced by the royal red and beautiful black lightweight Andis trimmer. I call these my baby now. Though I messed up cutting my hair on this one they made my day with a precise cut, they made it smooth and even, very silent compared to the loud motor of other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that if you order these also include to get the Cool Care they compliment the clippers oh so well due to maintance and keeping your top of the line product working like it was it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wish these clippers had included was a DVD to show or demonstrate how to cut your hair if your are a beginner or just want to try a different style but all in all it is a very great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Andis for such a great product. Thank you Amazon for delivering on time.</li>
    <li> Shaved my head like I was back in the Army. Went right through my thick hair. I keep my hair short, 0 on the sides but longer on the top. I clipped the top off to a 2 and feel awesome. Will save me $17 ever two weeks.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad ...and he loves it. I arrived very fast:) and Comes with every thing ...even a case.</li>
    <li> I was afraid of buying this because of the low amount of reviews, this product works amazingly well. All the clips are labeled well with the number and length. Comes with everything you need to cut hair and save money. I will definitely put this to good use in college.</li>
    <li> This is not an OK product and not nearly as good as the cheap Andis I replaced (which lasted about 10 years). This one tends to pull the hair more frequently, and it gets VERY hot (both to hold and touching the blade to the scalp).  Will look for a better product when this one needs to be replaced.  UPDATE:  This clipper started to only partially work after a few cuts.  I returned it to the mfr., and they replaced it promptly, BUT shipping was at MY EXPENSE.  Two stars based on the mfr. being so quick to replace, but I suggest you try another brand.</li>
    <li> If your looking for an inexpensive hair cutting kit, this one is the perfect buy. I have purchased quite a few of the adjustable clippers but none of them compares to the Andis 75360; and to think, I was just about to spend over $200 on a professional barber set with detachable blades to achieve that blending look. This 20pc set is cheep, quiet, runs cool for at least 45mins, and last but but not least, its very light weight. I will definitely buy another set.</li>
    <li> It does what it suppose to do its cheap but it get the job done.</li>
    <li> It seems to work quite well, esp for the price, but there are 2 annoyances:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The set of &amp;#34;clipper combs&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;blade attachments&amp;#34; they shipped had 2 1/4&amp;#34; (#2) combs but no 3/8&amp;#34; (#3) comb&lt;br /&gt;* The instructions say to lubricate the blade before, during, and after cutting, but they ship a _tiny_ (1/4 oz!) bottle of lubricating oil. I&#x27;m hoping I can just use white mineral oil.</li>
    <li> I have never purchased an Andis razor as I have always purchased cheaper razors in the past.  I wanted a good razor for a good price and that is exactly what I got!  The razor does not pull on my hair and cleans easily.  I have had the razor now for about a month and have used it for my weekly head shaving and facial hair grooming, and I could not be happier!  I will never buy a cheap razor again, it is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This a great inexpensive kit for home haircuts.  All of the pieces are labeled and easy to read.  The clippers themselves are a little loud but powerful.  Keep them oiled and disinfected and they should last a while.  A haircutting dvd would have been nice.</li>
    <li> WORKS LIKE A CHARM, GIVES A GOOD SHAVE</li>
    <li> Ok but not great. Very loud.</li>
    <li> It never worked even once. Such a terrible product. I bought it here with the intention of using it when I was abroad, never checked whether it worked before i left. With the convertor connected, it never even made a sound.</li>
    <li> I needed a new pair of clippers to cut my hair every month to 2 months and I have had no problems with this one. It works great.</li>
    <li> Its a terrible machine,,I don&#x27;t liked!!</li>
    <li> So far -- after several months -- this clipper has gone though my thin hair (I semi-shave my head) very effectively and smoothly.  I don&#x27;t use the attachments.  There have been reports that the little plastic arm for adjusting the blades breaks, and so I have been careful about this and have had no issues.  It would be nice if the clipper were quieter, but it&#x27;s not a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using these clippers for just about 4 months now. I self cut my own hair. And these do a great job. I am very pleased. I am a black male, and wear probably what would be considered lower than a crop cut. I try to cut it as low as possible. Actually I&#x27;m getting the cut I tried to get my barber to give me. Either he couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t. He&#x27;s a nice guy so don&#x27;t get me wrong. I have saved a great deal of money with them, and have&#x27;nt to much compromised my appearance, if at all. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I just received my Andis kit and am pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Now admittedly, I do not have experience with clippers except for small battery operated ones, so my impressions have to take that into account.&lt;br /&gt;I chose a power cord unit over battery units because the battery operated ones were weak in performance and lost power quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This Andis unit so far is very adequate for occasional personal use although if I cut hair for a living I probably would use a more expensive, heavier unit.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with numerous accessories for cutting hair to predetermined length, much more than I would ever use.&lt;br /&gt;The factory packaging also included a small oil bottle and brush for maintenance purposes.&lt;br /&gt;The power cord was rather short and could be longer, but proper extension cords remedy this.  The power switch is adequate sized and positive in operation.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a decent sized ding on the clipper housing that suggested that this may be pre-owned.</li>
    <li> I use this very infrequently and am glad that is the case. It does the job, but is nothing like the electric razor I had for years that suddenly died on me. This razor seems cheap; not sure how long it will last. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> In coarse of a year I attend meany Meetings  Assembly&#x27;s &amp; Conventions. I find having these clippers on hand has done much to keep my appearance intact. Along with not paying a barber to cut it. They are quite not to heavy to hold.</li>
    <li> Runs hot, but get the job done. Overall, it was a good buy, but not sure why it gets hot in less than 10 minutes for a small machine</li>
    <li> buy the next model up i bought this on price it works but not close enough.</li>
    <li> I must have gotten a dud. It worked for half the haircut, I let it cool off, then it worked to finish it up. When I got it out the next day for a touch up, the motor when but the blade did not. I cleaned and oiled as directed.</li>
    <li> I bought this from walmart about 4 years ago, and it just died on me. This is the best , lowcost hair cutting tool Ive ever used on myself! I LOVE IT... Dont let the low cost fool you, it works great! As being an african american guy with tough hair, this hair clippers gets the job done everytime!!!!!</li>
    <li> Short and simple, these are the best clippers for the price (I paid under $20).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had quite a few in this price range. Was able to use them enough to come out ahead (vs. going to the barber). However, some pulled a little hair, or bit a little skin, got a little hot, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers cut smoothly &amp; quickly. Didn&#x27;t overheat. Luv them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, I decided to buy a backup set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, considering how much I&#x27;ll be saving in haircuts, even with a second clipper set, I&#x27;ll be way ahead of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Andis &amp; Amazon.</li>
    <li> First let me say that my review is based on my specific needs and for others out there it may not apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the positives:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Brand ( Andis makes great clippers for the most part )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;I have other Andis clippers ( t-outliner which I use for beard shaving ) so I decided to give these a try based on the fact I love the outliners and for the lower cost clippers these had pretty good reviews. I was hoping to make these my lone hair clippers and just using my outliner for beard shaving. The construction is ok, not exactly heavy duty but decent. My clippers had a couple finish scuffs on it upon opening it which shouldn&#x27;t happen when you purchase a brand new in the box product. I like to buzz my hair for the most part and when I do I like a close cut. I must have gotten spoiled by the outliners because soon as I turned these on I could feel the difference in power between the two. I also noticed shortly after opening that the blade distance was significantly greater on these than my outliners. I cut my hair about a week ago with the outliners and my hair was still so short these barely cut any hair. The little they did cut felt like a fairly smooth cut however. So that is a plus for those interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades also get hot really fast unlike the outliner which is common with these lower grade clippers. My hope was that these clippers were a notch above other low grade clipper kits I have used from conair ect..For my needs these clippers are pretty much useless. The outliner gives a cut far superior to these in terms of closeness and ease of cutting. After going with a quality clipper, these just are not good enough. I mean they are what they are, a cheap set of clippers and they cut and feel like they are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me personally I am just going to spend a little more and go with a higher end Andis clippers like my outliner. When it comes to self grooming ect..I am slowly but surely learning that forme, the extra cost is well worth it to get a quality shave whether it be hair cutting or beard trimming.</li>
    <li> I mainly bought it to cut my son&#x27;s hair who is about a year old. I love it smooth and quite.</li>
    <li> Got here fast and my fiancé loves it. My brother has one just like this and has had it for a while. Works great!</li>
    <li> This is a very attractive product and comes in a nice case.  I gave it four stars because I didn&#x27;t think it came with enough instructions.  Thankfully, I chose the correct attachment and my husband&#x27;s hair came out perfect, but he had to help me get the attachment onto the clippers.  It is more light-weight than our previous clippers and makes a lot less noise.</li>
    <li> Reading all the other reviews I guess my expectations were way too high for this item. It really doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful at all. I&#x27;ve got a rechargeable lithium ion trimmer that seems about as powerful as this one. Also the case is almost useless everything just piles up in it.  This item is great for getting a lot of longer hair but it didn&#x27;t do very good up close.</li>
    <li> I Don&#x27;t keep my hair more then about 3 to 4 inches long.Got this trimmer and my wife had some cutting time with the family dog.She did a nice job in minutes!Come with a couple different kinds of combs,about 10 attachments,and some scissors and oil.For 20 bucks fits my needs very nice!!</li>
    <li> These clippers are awesome.The first pair I bought I dropped and they broke easy but other than that they are perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the most basic clipper. Not powerful, very light and the blade gets hot a little fast. Best use would be a quick child&#x27;s haircut, but for a little more money you can get something much better.</li>
    <li> Product is as described, I gave it as a gift and it was well accepted and appreciated. The clippers come in a nice plastic box with raised imprint labeled ANDIS on it. This isn&#x27;t the first ANDIS clipper I&#x27;ve bought, but all the previous ones come in a generic travel size duffle-type material bag.</li>
    <li> This is crap. I&#x27;d spend the extra money and get a conair.. why i took the chance i don&#x27;t know. used it 4 times and it&#x27;s dying already.</li>
    <li> This product was what I expected. I would recommend it at this price to anyone. it is exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I had these clippers and they worked great for a week and starting acting up.  I cut my hair twice and they don&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
    <li> Loud! I had to adjust blade but works nice now</li>
    <li> Frankly I have never even heard of this brand before - but the combination of style, price and appearance made me take the plunge. Already used it once - easy to maneuver, comes with a load of attachments, blade oil included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> These clippers are much lighter than the previous ones we had. It cuts evenly. We do not regret this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> My husband uses Andis as his primary barber tools.. and he loves this one! Looking forward to ordering more Andis products</li>
    <li> I have bought many home haircut kit before, and this is the best - very smooth cut and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Nice product; however, it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as I would like and you can&#x27;t do a hair line with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one time. While the trimmers do a good job, I was disappointed in how hot the hand grip got. My hair is quite fine and I keep it short so I really didn&#x27;t run this very long. After a few more uses I&#x27;ll try and remember to update this.</li>
    <li> As usual Andis clippers perform very well.  I am totally satisfied with the purchase..</li>
    <li> Takes some tinkering with for me cuz i&#x27;ve never owned clippers. Purchased to trim my beard between barber visits. I tried it out today and it did a great job. Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Good clippers for home use, very light weight easy to operate, really like the adjustable blade lever will not slip out of place like most home clippers do.  The price I paid was reasonable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s noisy and it pulled my hair instead of cutting it.  Got rid of it and bought a different brand.</li>
    <li> they do NOT give a close shave at all. Bought this for my husband and trimming his neckline.</li>
    <li> These are nice for my grandsons</li>
    <li> The Haircutting kit is great.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Worst pair of clippers ever!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Oh no! I Know why it is so cheap! I get to buy another one!it didn&#x27;t work good to me!</li>
    <li> In a routine burglary on my house, this was taken after my using it only one time. I wouldn&#x27;t - and didn&#x27;t - replace it. I bought a different much more effective and satisfying product at the same price.</li>
    <li> nice quite clippers.they do heat up after so long even with cool care.still good clippers for cutting your&lt;br /&gt; own hair.but not alot of ppl at once.worth the money</li>
    <li> The clippers ain&#x27;t that bad at all. They don&#x27;t cut that low as I would like , but they they give a good cut nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Works great! comes with tons of attachments and some oil to get you started. Very easy to use and has it&#x27;s own case, comb and scissors to get you started.</li>
    <li> My husband used this product to shape up my hair. He said it really worked well and is much quieter than our old one which was also very bulky and heavy. Has several combs and attachments included. Like the long cord. Oh, and I like the way my hair looks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for a while now and using these do the job in terms of basic cutting.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for using over 20 times a day at a barber shop or something but for family use they are great.  I know the proper way to oil and care for clippers.  One day before I used them I oiled them and they started making this really loud sound as if some oil went into the motor.  There must be a big open space between the blades and the motor.  I called andis and they provided great customer service.  I mailed them in and they sent me a brand new kit out right away!!  They got a 4 because of how easy they were to get oil in the motor so be careful when oiling this device.  I have some andis shape up clippers and I&#x27;ve oiled and used them for 4 years now and never had that problem.</li>
