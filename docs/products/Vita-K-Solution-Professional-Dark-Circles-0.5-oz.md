### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>best friend of ANY aging woman or man 😙</li>
      <li>this product is great.</li>
      <li>Purchased as replacement for loved product no longer carried by Walgreens.</li>
      <li>however it tightens the skin around the eyes amazingly</li>
      <li>and Ive seen the fine lines disappearing!</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff...  </li>
      <li>This does help tighten the skin around eyes and makes them feel a bit better.</li>
      <li>and I let time pass and needed more.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;ll last a good while and the price is great</li>
      <li>Will keep looking for better replacement.</li>
      <li>They lightened up after about a week, still somewhat there but much better.</li>
      <li>I went ahead and bought another product that was supposed to be good at, of course, a much higher price.  </li>
      <li>With the pump you can&#x27;t control it easily, and there&#x27;s no way to get the dregs out.</li>
      <li>and Ive seen a huge difference in my eye area.</li>
      <li>You have to use daily or you won&#x27;t be happy with results.</li>
      <li>Much to my dismay!!!  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of a facial mask that firms your face, but it&#x27;s under your eyes, where most of us need it most!  </li>
      <li>After about a month the bottle is still about full</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly and a tiny dot goes</li>
      <li>This is the first time ordering it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Perhaps another product that has Vitamin K and Vitamin A mixed together would work better.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to Vita-K products by a dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it really works, but watch out that you don&#x27;t get it too close to your eyes - it stings!</li>
      <li>; (no matter how much I paid for it), Vita-K, used regularly keeps the under eye area moisturized and healthy looking, perhaps a bit lighter.  </li>
      <li>In terms of darkness, it is quite the same, but the fine lines which cause bags are fading away.</li>
      <li>If you get too much it gets in your lashes and burns your eyes.  </li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t really expect it to cure the problem.</li>
      <li>It absolutely works.</li>
      <li>But I find under eye circles to be one of the toughest problems to really solve.</li>
      <li>would rather focus on serums/night moisturizers to keep the delicate area under the eyes protected and just use a good concealer.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product for only 3 weeks now, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting the full effect because I don&#x27;t use it in the morning, so I will wait 6weeks to see if any results.</li>
      <li>I have used the retinol products and such and they do work, but cost 4 to 5 times more for about the same amount of product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
      <li>I glad it helps a little though.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s worth the wait for it to ship through Amazon, I certainly won&#x27;t wait any longer for the other product to work as well.  </li>
      <li>Top screws off, but opening too small to dip finger into product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same exact product.</li>
      <li>Found that I must use it everyday other wise</li>
      <li>The skin around my eyes is smooth and tight.</li>
      <li>During this time, I&#x27;ve only been getting around 5-6 hours of sleep so of expect my bags and darkness to be intense, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>I think it works, but being 60 years old, I think I am fighting a losing battle.</li>
      <li>While no product I&#x27;ve ever used has completely eliminated &amp;#34;dark circles&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I have always had &amp;#34;Raccoon eyes&amp;#34; and Freeman Vita K is the only product that works really well and doesn&#x27;t empty your bank account.</li>

<li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars is the bottle.</li>
<li> did not experience any irritation or reaction to the product, but the area under my eyes is the LAST thing that I need to dry</li>
<li> I applied it for several weeks and saw absolutely no difference.</li>
<li> It breaks up the dark circles and the under eye color comes back evenly.</li>
<li> It totally gets rid of dark circles.</li>
<li> This is probably the ONLY under eye dark circle and dark eyelid eliminator that actually works.  </li>
<li> The creme is pretty expensive for a tiny bottle.</li>
<li> *Only use a little drop and dab on with your finger.</li>
<li> It did not clear up any dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
<li> Up until a few years ago this product came in a simple glass jar.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me other than make my under-eye area very dry which made my under-eye makeup flaky.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product.  It instantly firms under your eyes.  **Only use a little drop and dab on with your finger. If you get too much it gets in your lashes and burns your eyes.  It reminds me of a facial mask that firms your face, but it&#x27;s under your eyes, where most of us need it most!  Myself included.  I highly recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> burns my eyes even do no product got inside them</li>
    <li> Used the entirety of this bottle with no results.</li>
    <li> Purchased as replacement for loved product no longer carried by Walgreens. This product seems to work as well, but I hate the pump design. Difficult to impossible to pump out just the tiny amount needed for eye area. Top screws off, but opening too small to dip finger into product. Product, and my money and time, gets wasted with each use. Will keep looking for better replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had under eye dark circles forever, and that is what this product is meant for. They lightened up after about a week, still somewhat there but much better. After about a month the bottle is still about full so it&#x27;ll last a good while and the price is great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for only 3 weeks now, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting the full effect because I don&#x27;t use it in the morning, so I will wait 6weeks to see if any results.</li>
    <li> I did not think this would work... I have severe dark circles and NOTHING seemed to work... This is actually reducing my circles quite dramatically!! I highly recommend this product!!! A+++</li>
    <li> I do like this product &amp; it does help my under eye circles..seems to firm up the skin under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is probably the ONLY under eye dark circle and dark eyelid eliminator that actually works.  I&#x27;ve tried so many expensive high end brands over the years and never get the results I get with this little powerhouse.</li>
    <li> This item did not work at all.  It did not clear up any dark circles under my eyes.  Perhaps another product that has Vitamin K and Vitamin A mixed together would work better.</li>
    <li> The creme is pretty expensive for a tiny bottle. I applied it for several weeks and saw absolutely no difference. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have always had &amp;#34;Raccoon eyes&amp;#34; and Freeman Vita K is the only product that works really well and doesn&#x27;t empty your bank account. I have used the retinol products and such and they do work, but cost 4 to 5 times more for about the same amount of product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this for the dark circles under my eyes. This is the first time ordering it from Amazon. It&#x27;s the same exact product. I must say you have to have continuous use, I ran out and I let time pass and needed more. It shows results within a week. It absolutely works. It breaks up the dark circles and the under eye color comes back evenly.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and it works quite well. I wore glasses since the third grade, then had lasik. For some reason I had really dark brown circles under my eyes along with the usual sleep deprived look I seem to sport, and this has visibly helped. I like that it doesn&#x27;t stick to me like a moisturizer, but it does offer some moisturizer-like benefits. It goes on very smoothly and a tiny dot goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars is the bottle. Why on earth do they insist on using pump bottles for this stuff? Up until a few years ago this product came in a simple glass jar. It was easier to get the correct amount out as well as use the entire contents. With the pump you can&#x27;t control it easily, and there&#x27;s no way to get the dregs out. I don&#x27;t use the pump at all, I just use it like a dip stick until it gets too low then I drain it into a generic cosmetic jar I picked up somewhere. Other than that... this product is great.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Vita-K products by a dermatologist.  They use Vitamin K cream to reduce bruising and swelling and speed healing after surgery.  And it works.  While no product I&#x27;ve ever used has completely eliminated &amp;#34;dark circles&amp;#34; (no matter how much I paid for it), Vita-K, used regularly keeps the under eye area moisturized and healthy looking, perhaps a bit lighter.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> After applying this product under your eyes, it dries and tightens the skin.  Almost an uncomfortable, tight feeling under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any irritation or reaction to the product, but the area under my eyes is the LAST thing that I need to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather focus on serums/night moisturizers to keep the delicate area under the eyes protected and just use a good concealer.&lt;br /&gt;Will not use again or recommend product.</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday morning and I&#x27;ve applied it 4 times (twice a day like it says on the box). Now, I know it said it would take 2 months for your dark circles and fine lines and under eye bags to be at least 45% gone, but I can swear I see a different already. In terms of darkness, it is quite the same, but the fine lines which cause bags are fading away. During this time, I&#x27;ve only been getting around 5-6 hours of sleep so of expect my bags and darkness to be intense, but it&#x27;s not. Maybe because of this product? Will be updating in 2 months. Let the journey begin!</li>
    <li> Yes, it really works, but watch out that you don&#x27;t get it too close to your eyes - it stings!</li>
    <li> Works so well!!! Will buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years! It totally gets rid of dark circles. I&#x27;m 55 and have dark circles under eye, as well as dark area on sides of nose (people thought was caused from sunglasses) but it wasn&#x27;t. I use at night instead of during the day. Just takes a tiny drop. You have to use daily or you won&#x27;t be happy with results. I can tell if I skip any days.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 yr. old son for dark circles under his eyes from allergies. He used it as directed for a several weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any change at all. He finally stopped using it. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me other than make my under-eye area very dry which made my under-eye makeup flaky.</li>
    <li> This product works for me.  My dark circles have lighten up and  the area around my eyes are smoother.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last two years and recently, both Walgreen&#x27;s and Walmart have stopped stocking this item.  Much to my dismay!!!  I went ahead and bought another product that was supposed to be good at, of course, a much higher price.  Ladies, don&#x27;t waste your money buying the other more expensive stuff!! This product delivers what it says and within a very short period of time!  Although it&#x27;s worth the wait for it to ship through Amazon, I certainly won&#x27;t wait any longer for the other product to work as well.  It was a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from dark circles. So I cannot tell you if it works on that aspect however it tightens the skin around the eyes amazingly, I even apply it in between my eyebrows and Ive seen the fine lines disappearing! The skin around my eyes is smooth and tight. Ive used countless creams for a year and Ive seen a huge difference in my eye area.</li>
    <li> I think it works, but being 60 years old, I think I am fighting a losing battle. It does seem to make the dark circles a little lighter</li>
    <li> This does help tighten the skin around eyes and makes them feel a bit better. Be careful and don&#x27;t get it IN your eyes because it does sting for a little while if you do.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...  best friend of ANY aging woman or man 😙</li>
    <li> It is difficult to gauge this product because it does not cure my under eye circles, which are quite dark. But I don&#x27;t really expect it to cure the problem. I think it helps diminish the darkness. When I stop using it, I always return to it. But I find under eye circles to be one of the toughest problems to really solve.</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes, the doctors call them allergy shiners.  This product does seem to help a little.  Found that I must use it everyday other wise it looks just like before.  I glad it helps a little though.</li>
