      <li>My dental hygienist compliments how good my gums are during my semiannual cleaning visits.</li>
      <li>I do not use this to &amp;#34;stimulate&amp;#34; the gums, rather, it is very good to use to clean around the gums after you brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need any more handles!</li>
      <li>That said, it is a great device for massaging your gums and for breaking free debris and plaque below the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also liked this product because it matched the colour of the handle I have.</li>
      <li>With warm water and a couple of attempts I got it.  </li>
      <li>So I was beyond thrilled to find it on-line.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>good price And good product making  message and cleaning the gum more easy than I can imagine</li>
      <li>Top quality tips, very easy to replace and use.</li>
      <li>These fit perfectly and provide the joy of a sharp tip again.</li>
      <li>None carried it any more.  </li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy this item at the supermarket or drug store.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice they make the replacement tips available.</li>
      <li>I just love these stimulators.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not a lot more to say about it.  </li>
      <li>I would gladly do business again.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing quite like a gum stimulator after flossing, for those who DO love dental hygiene.</li>
      <li>So glad to find these on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It would be even better if shipping was cheaper.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for these in the store and was so glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>BUT they don&#x27;t fit the handle!</li>
      <li>Been using GUM refills for at least 10 years and am extremely happy with the excellent results.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find this product.  </li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>My mom had most of her teeth when she passed away at 90</li>
      <li>Great value to replace the G-U-M Stimulator, rather than having to purchase a new one each time.</li>
      <li>They are cheap and more environmental.</li>
      <li>these handy replacement tips help keep the tool useful for years</li>
      <li>Thanks to this product I have all my wisdom teeth and get better check-ups!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, the replacement tips are just as strong at the original tip on the Stimulator.</li>
      <li>I have lots of crowns so this tool helps keep gums clean and strong.</li>
      <li>The GUM Stimulator Refills are great because of how much money you save by replacing the tip of the GUM Stimulator instead of buying a new one.</li>
      <li>Originally recommended by a dentist, I&#x27;ve been using them for years.</li>
      <li>There was no noticeable difference from the original.</li>
      <li>In our throwaway world, it&#x27;s rather unique.</li>
      <li>Replacing rubber tip tricky until you read and follow instructions to use hot water to make it more flexible.</li>
      <li>GUM stimulators should be on everyone&#x27;s list for things you clean your teeth with.  </li>
      <li>Above is the title we proposed for our own movie after watching Must Love Dogs (or was it Cats?).</li>
      <li>My family using this robber tips to clean plaque under gum every night before go to bed.  </li>
      <li>It is useful to both clean between teeth and massage gums.</li>
      <li>All of a sudden, I couldn&#x27;t find this refill in any local stores, I found it at amazon.com and am very very happy to help on Nov. 27th.</li>
      <li>I have had these stimulators for many years and needed new tips.</li>
      <li>These are great, but takes a little effort to replace.  </li>
      <li>After using them for a month they worked much better than my old worn out tips.</li>
      <li>the price is definitely right with amazon also.</li>
      <li>and they came very fast.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.  </li>
      <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m at the point now that I can&#x27;t go to bed without first using the gum massager, flossing and brushing.</li>
      <li>helpful for the gum, shipment was fast!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t not find the refills though, so I did a search and sure enough Amazon carried them</li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I installed the first rubber tip on the handle</li>
      <li>Should have just checked  with you first.</li>
      <li>However, it is the best way to get to the back of my mouth since it is hard to floss there.</li>
      <li>In truth, all THREE dental items could easily have been shipped in one package, even the same size package used to ship each one separately, without costing much more than each package individually.  </li>
      <li>Thanks again for keeping the product in circulation and at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Very reasonable cost as they were purchased from Amazon with a total order of $25 so to get free shipping.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the rubber tips and have enough for several months having purchased 2 packages.</li>
      <li>but I finally did and it is working just fine.  </li>
      <li>They work very well around the gum area</li>
      <li>It takes a while, but after a couple of weeks of gum stimulation with moderate to light brushing, the gums heal.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Very satisfy with them.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast and I received as many as I ordered, though they were packaged three together instead of inside individual clear pockets as shown in the ad photo.  </li>
      <li>I was already familiar with this product, which can no longer be purchased at local pharmacies or supermarkets.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall having this problem in the past, but with this simple workaround, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty basic dental health product, so not too much to say about it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been spending a fortune on new stimulators.</li>
      <li>these tips are easy to replace every few months to keep the tip pointy and highly functional.</li>
      <li>Both getting the old off and the new on.</li>
      <li>These replacement tips each last as long as the original.</li>
      <li>Buying the complete stimulator and handle is wasteful.  </li>
      <li>The only real difference is that these three replacement tips are cheaper than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>would not believe how much soft plaque it removes even after brushing, flossing and rinsing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My handle is old</li>
      <li>I use this product with original handle everyday after brushing my teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m unsure how this actually helped, but the tip has stayed put since and now works normally.  </li>
      <li>Searched for this dental item (new tip for gum massage pick) in a variety of local stores.  </li>
      <li>daily dental hygiene would not feel complete without using the stimulator.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After using the GUM for two months, my hygienist says that tartar control is improved.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years when for reasons unknown it disappeared from store shelves. Happy to find it at Amazon. Availability, price, &amp; quick delivery mean that Amazon has become the only source that I need for this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product with original handle everyday after brushing my teeth. Removes the plaque that the brushing missed. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great value to replace the G-U-M Stimulator, rather than having to purchase a new one each time.</li>
    <li> impossible to find this item in stores.  the price is definitely right with amazon also.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping ALL your teeth</li>
    <li> Use them all the time, can&#x27;t find around here.</li>
    <li> Searched for this dental item (new tip for gum massage pick) in a variety of local stores.  None carried it any more.  Happy to find a good reliable source.</li>
    <li> For me 3 per package is a waste of packaging materials. Product is good, and I wish I could still buy it in a pharmacy.</li>
    <li> This is not an actual rating.  I don&#x27;t know if you put this on here by accident.  I&#x27;m thinking my husband ordered it because I didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Had been looking for these in drug stores. Should have just checked  with you first. Very pleased with the rubber tips and have enough for several months having purchased 2 packages.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for these in stores (i.e. Walgreens, CVS, etc...) and had no luck.  It was a relief to have found them online.  Very satisfy with them.</li>
    <li> Nearly impossible to find in retail stores.  Buying the complete stimulator and handle is wasteful.  Received promptly and as advertized.</li>
    <li> eventually the rubber tips get soft or come loose from the gum massager tool.  these handy replacement tips help keep the tool useful for years</li>
    <li> good price And good product making  message and cleaning the gum more easy than I can imagine&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> The GUM Stimulator Refills are great because of how much money you save by replacing the tip of the GUM Stimulator instead of buying a new one. Typically, three replacement tips are cheaper than one actual GUM Stimulator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about the actual benefits of using the GUM Stimulator, but chances are if you are looking at purchasing the replacement tips, then you already are using the GUM Stimulator. That said, it is a great device for massaging your gums and for breaking free debris and plaque below the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the replacement tips are just as strong at the original tip on the Stimulator. These replacement tips each last as long as the original. There was no noticeable difference from the original. The only real difference is that these three replacement tips are cheaper than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cheers!</li>
    <li> GUM stimulators should be on everyone&#x27;s list for things you clean your teeth with.  I highly recommend them.  And the nibs do eventually wear down, so the extras are great.  The wands will last for decades!  Just replace the nibs.</li>
    <li> It is what I ordered, and it came expeditiously.  There&#x27;s not a lot more to say about it.  I was already familiar with this product, which can no longer be purchased at local pharmacies or supermarkets.</li>
    <li> This is a good product from Butler. Difficult to find in the local stores, so it&#x27;s nice to find it on Amazon. It would be even better if shipping was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these in the store and was so glad to find them on Amazon. Service was great from supplier</li>
    <li> Top quality tips, very easy to replace and use. Extends use of gum stimulator winth the ease of a tip.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find this product.  The drug stores in my area no longer carry the refills.  I didn&#x27;t need any more handles!</li>
    <li> Excellent gum exercise tool that seems to reduce bleeding and improve gum health over time.  It takes a while, but after a couple of weeks of gum stimulation with moderate to light brushing, the gums heal.  My regimen now includes brushing and gum stimulation after every meal.</li>
    <li> These are great, but takes a little effort to replace.  Both getting the old off and the new on. Too bad CVS or Walgreens don&#x27;t carry them.</li>
    <li> I use these in addition to a tooth brush and floss. Originally recommended by a dentist, I&#x27;ve been using them for years. For some reason they&#x27;re getting harder to find in the stores. Thankfully we can still get them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist. I have lots of crowns so this tool helps keep gums clean and strong.</li>
    <li> So glad to find these on Amazon. They have disappeared from pharmacy shelves and I used them regularly. My dentist can see the difference when I have my check-ups.</li>
    <li> Could not find another product, the Butler Gum Stimulator, anywhere in our shopping area.  Found that item at Amazon.com, saw these refills, and decided to buy them at the same time.  The refills are FINE and would have rated them 5-Star; however, I was not happy with the company&#x27;s policy of charging shipping &amp; handling separately for EACH item AND having to sign a statement that I okayed the separate fees.  It was a RIP-OFF, but I wanted the items so agreed to it.  In truth, all THREE dental items could easily have been shipped in one package, even the same size package used to ship each one separately, without costing much more than each package individually.  So, I rated it a 1-Star.</li>
    <li> my gums are now properly stimulated again, without having to lay out excessive funds to do so. I also liked this product because it matched the colour of the handle I have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice they make the replacement tips available. In our throwaway world, it&#x27;s rather unique. Oh--and it saves me money!</li>
    <li> All of a sudden, I couldn&#x27;t find this refill in any local stores, I found it at amazon.com and am very very happy to help on Nov. 27th.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know you could just buy the tips.  I&#x27;ve been spending a fortune on new stimulators.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy this item at the supermarket or drug store.  Now it is nowhere to be found. So I was beyond thrilled to find it on-line.&lt;br /&gt;This simple rubber gum stimulator should be a must in your dental hygiene protocol.&lt;br /&gt;You would not believe how much soft plaque it removes even after brushing, flossing and rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;My daily dental hygiene would not feel complete without using the stimulator.</li>
    <li> My mother was thrilled! We have been looking for this product for quite some time, out in the open market.  Thanks again for keeping the product in circulation and at a very reasonable price. Kudos!</li>
    <li> Perfect for gum care.  Replacing rubber tip tricky until you read and follow instructions to use hot water to make it more flexible.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty basic dental health product, so not too much to say about it.  It does its job!</li>
    <li> Been using GUM refills for at least 10 years and am extremely happy with the excellent results. My dental hygienist compliments how good my gums are during my semiannual cleaning visits. Very reasonable cost as they were purchased from Amazon with a total order of $25 so to get free shipping.</li>
    <li> I was starting to see some receding gums and remembered my mom using this product every day.  I went to Rite Aid and found the stimulator and started using it. My gums tingle afterwards.  My mom had most of her teeth when she passed away at 90, I&#x27;m hoping with continued use I will also. I couldn&#x27;t not find the refills though, so I did a search and sure enough Amazon carried them so I bought 2 packages.</li>
    <li> The local Walgrens stopped carrying the refills.  I was happy to find Amazon has them.  If your dentist is worried about your gums, this is good for cleaning between the teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for. After using them for a month they worked much better than my old worn out tips. And Mr. Medical shipped them the same day I ordered them and I received the items in two days. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> excellent what was ordered</li>
    <li> good product - great price</li>
    <li> Want to prevent periodontal disease?  Add this tool to your daily dental regimen and save lots of money and dental office visits.</li>
    <li> These G-U-M Stimulators used to be on almost all kid&#x27;s toothbrushes made and now you cannot find a toothbrush with it on them.  I do not use this to &amp;#34;stimulate&amp;#34; the gums, rather, it is very good to use to clean around the gums after you brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One will be amazed at how much junk is left after flossing and brushing your teeth for a long time!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to keep its sharp pointy head for long, but it does the job well. I&#x27;m at the point now that I can&#x27;t go to bed without first using the gum massager, flossing and brushing.</li>
    <li> They are cheap and more environmental. BUT they don&#x27;t fit the handle! Every time I use them, they fell off!</li>
    <li> Above is the title we proposed for our own movie after watching Must Love Dogs (or was it Cats?). There&#x27;s nothing quite like a gum stimulator after flossing, for those who DO love dental hygiene. Trouble is, the metal handles are expensive and the replacement tips are loose and wobbly. Eureka! These fit perfectly and provide the joy of a sharp tip again.</li>
    <li> helpful for the gum, shipment was fast! Love it!</li>
    <li> if you are not using a gum stimulator before bed, you likely have a colony of bacteria under your gum line. these tips are easy to replace every few months to keep the tip pointy and highly functional.</li>
    <li> They work very well around the gum area</li>
    <li> Had a little trouble getting it on my handle but I finally did and it is working just fine.  My handle is old so I thought maybe it had changed since I bought it but apparently not.  With warm water and a couple of attempts I got it.  Thank you very much.  I just love these stimulators.</li>
    <li> I have had these stimulators for many years and needed new tips. Seems they don&#x27;t make them anymore. However, it is the best way to get to the back of my mouth since it is hard to floss there. Thanks to this product I have all my wisdom teeth and get better check-ups!</li>
    <li> Very good price and they came very fast. They appreciate your business.  I would gladly do business again. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> For people like me with bad gums the Butler gum stimulator is really helpful. It is useful to both clean between teeth and massage gums. But the rubber tip part eventually wears out, and the product reviewed here is a pack of three replacement rubber tips. Can find nothing to complain about, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> One cannot purchase them at the pharmacy.  So, they are offered at Amazon, and that&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Patricia P</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these rubber tips anymore at the local drug store, so I ordered online through Amazon.  Delivery was fast and I received as many as I ordered, though they were packaged three together instead of inside individual clear pockets as shown in the ad photo.  No big deal, but I had hoped not to touch the unused tips until I needed one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I installed the first rubber tip on the handle and when I used it, the tip worked its way off the handle, which was odd since this is the same brand I&#x27;d been using all along.  To make it stay on the handle, I put the tip back on and ran hot tap water over the tip for a few seconds -- thinking that this might soften the rubber -- then a minute later I ran cold water over the tip -- thinking that the tip might then mold itself to the shape of the handle.  I&#x27;m unsure how this actually helped, but the tip has stayed put since and now works normally.  I don&#x27;t recall having this problem in the past, but with this simple workaround, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> My family using this robber tips to clean plaque under gum every night before go to bed.  Such use protects mouth from cavities on roots,  gingivitis or paradantoz.</li>
    <li> simply cannot beat this price.  These refills are very difficult to find locally, AND they are more expensive.</li>
