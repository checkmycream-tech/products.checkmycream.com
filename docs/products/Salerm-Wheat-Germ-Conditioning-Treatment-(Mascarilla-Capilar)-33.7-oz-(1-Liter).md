<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hate the price of this product but it is well worth the money. it keeps my hair hydrated, shiny, manageable and smelling wonderful! Great for the once a week deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Delivery takes a while :( and price</li>
    <li> It good for my body i like i ileke. it is used all time in my home and in my boat</li>
    <li> This conditioner is an absolute miracle worker. It will take hair in its absolute worst condition and transform it to moist, soft, shiny and swinging every single time. I am so addicted to this conditioner that I use it for co-washing, baggying and deep conditioning. I will say it works best with the most stellar results the longer you leave it on. When I baggy my ends with this and rinse it out in the a.m., I have the hair of a lifetime. When I apply this to DRY hair with a conditioner cap and allow it to soak in for hours then rinse, my hair is absolutely unbelievable. As a co-wash, it helps maintain the results you get from those deep conditioning methods. ONE CAVEAT: The smell is absolutely overwhelming. While I have gotten used to it, I know that it is trailing behind me everywhere I go so I am going to test out another wheat germ conditioner as a co-wash and reserve this for once-a-week treatments. If Salerm would change, remove or lessen the fragrance they would have the holy grail conditioner. Oh well, you can&#x27;t have everything!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, and Love Mascarilla Capilar Conditioning Product by Salerm.  The product leaves your scalp tingly clean, hair feeling silky smooth and smelling wonderfully refreshed.  The longer you leave the product in your hair the better the treatment will work.  I&#x27;m 100% sure your customers will find the product a must for their hair.</li>
    <li> I use several Salerm products and my favorites are the leave-in conditioner and this wheat germ treatment.  It is THE best moisturizing product for my hair. My hair is thick, medium coarse and dry, especially during summer (from sun) and winter (from dry air). Nothing is as effective as this product. It moisturizes without weighing the hair down, a rare and treasured feature in conditioners. Though it smells slightly odd in the bottle, it does not transfer to your hair. This will remain a staple in my hair care kit.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product last week and received it in about 3 days. very fast shipping from this vendor plus i received 2 eye shadow sticks as a gift. FANTASTIC. i finally used the product this weekend. i have natural 4a type hair. i used this product overnight and my hair was sooo soft the next day. i felt stronger but soo soft to the touch. i love love love this product and will try more from the salerm line after i use up my other shampoo and conditioners but as a deep conditioner, this wheat germ conditioner is the only one i can use. i was using elasta qp but the salerm deep conditioner is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner after it was recommended to me by my mom and a friend. It has exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> The best deep conditioner ever!!! The wrapping of this package was great</li>
    <li> As an black woman, I find it hard sometimes to find products that will benefit my hair and not hurt it. Salerm Wheat Germ conditioning definately helps my hair to stay soft, smooth and managable.(By the way, my hair is kind of thin anyway) but it doesn&#x27;t give it a dead feel. It makes it feel healther.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  My hair is normally quite fragile and brittle.  After using this product for the past two years my hair has become strong and very healthy.</li>
    <li> This product does its job. I don&#x27;t like the smell but it wont keep me from buying it. I have to stay stocked with this stiff at all times.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great as an instant or deep conditioner. Always leaves hair super soft and manageable, and your hair smells great!</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning pretty badly and I had a bald spot from hair braiding right in the center of my head.  I got worried. Girl I started going to the Dominican Salon use my herbalife shampoo and conditioner and bring my Mascarilla Capilar you won&#x27;t believe how amazing and quick my hair texture has changed.  You need that Salerm Wheat conditioning treatment in your hair.  I normally don&#x27;t take my time to write any review unless it is damn good.  All I can tell you now is I am worry free and what&#x27;s best about it I already see result in just one month of usage.  Please try this combination and you won&#x27;t regret it. I guarantee that. I really stand behind this product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this hair mask and also I do like the way it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair shinny, smooth and straight. It is great for all type of hair. You have to apply it at hair ends to avoid greasy hair.</li>
    <li> Second time buying it! Good product! I will definately recommend this product to my friends. Salerm is a good brand and here the price is incredible.</li>
    <li> First let me say I am an admitted product junkie. I research, I listen and I watch, but yes, I usually end up purchasing new products to try them out. I don&#x27;t even mind when they are expensive. As long as the product delivers what it claims. Let me say that I have relaxed, coarse, afro-textured hair. This product is awesome. The scent of it is a little different than the usual scent of hair products. It contains wheat germ oil (maybe that is what contributes to the scent?) and is a cocoa brown in color and has a somewhat runny consistency. Having said that, I kind of like the smell of the product. It does linger for a bit even after it is rinsed out, but not strong at all. My hair was soft, smooth, easy to detangle, shiny, and bouncy. I was impressed with this product. I must admit, I didn&#x27;t have much confidence in its claims when I purchased, but I am pleasantly surprised. I have even used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (natural hair) and had great results. In short, I love this product and will purchase again. En Espanol: Mascarilla Capilar es la verdad! Gracias Salerm! (Mascarilla Capilar is the truth! Thank you Salerm!)</li>
    <li> Great Conditioning product for naturally curly hair. It was my first time using this product and I really liked it! Gave my curls lots of moisture. The only thing I did not like too much was the smell. It has a funky earthy smell but it does not smell bad though! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I just purchased my 7th jar of this stuff!! Let me tell you how amazing it is. I started using it about 8 years ago when I was still relaxing my hair. I BC on December 26,2012 and now I&#x27;m all natural. I still use this as my deep conditioner. I recently started using the crece pelo condish--that&#x27;s awesome too--but this is my Holy Grail product. It has never let me down! When I had breakage it helped stop and grow my hair!!! A must try for all hair types!!!</li>
    <li> This product is definitely a 5 out of 5. The only reason I did not rate it as such is because the shipping cost is ridiculous. However, I did my research beforehand, and was unable to find a better deal online and stores don&#x27;t seem to carry this product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a friend bought me this product a few years ago and it worked a miracle on my hair. No other hair-conditioning product has ever been able to adequately hydrate my fine curly hair as does this [not even the shampoo and conditioner from Alter Ego I recently spent $40 each on].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely glad I found this product again. It looks kind of gross and murky, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  It&#x27;s the best hair conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried. Extremely great product. WORTH IT!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  My hair feels very hydrated and is very soft and manageable.  A wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Great price for this size!</li>
    <li> love it, it works, black/asain, with curly hair, damaged from color treatments. My hair get very dry and brittle over the course of the week and after this treatment it feels so smooth. I try to leave it in overnight. The one downside is it smells like tree bark.</li>
    <li> I bleach my hair (mostly roots touch-up) every month to maintain \\&quot;blondyness\\&quot; :)&lt;br /&gt;After 8 years of doing so my hair became dull, dry and fragile. I start using Sarlem Wheat Germ Conditioning 3 month ago (once a week for 10 min). It&#x27;s magical! All the damage is gone, my hair is strong, shiny and silky again. Beautifull! Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Read so many reviews on this product and just had to try it. I am so glad that I did. Ive used it myself and on a few friends and the results were awesome each time. Has a lot of slip, leaves hair soft and moisturized and most of all i luv luv luv the smell and so do my friends.  The best way to describe the scent is earthy, damp green leaves or like pine trees at xmas time. Will definitely be buying again...by the way the instructions say it can also be used on dry hair...i use it every night as part of my bedtime hair care routine (hair is silky soft in the morning).  Yeh yeh yeh...doing the happy dance. Another salerm product that delivers. Also try the Salerm 21 B5 Protein Leave in...works well too</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves your hair feeling and looking healthy. I use to buy it from my hair dresser but for a smaller size for $20 and when I seen how much it was for a way bigger container I just decided to buy more. This is the second one I have ordered thru Amazon I use this product all the time now and it lasted me about 4to 6months.</li>
    <li> Do not care for this product at all! I don&#x27;t understand why this product got such great reviews. It left my hair very dry. After I came home from the salon, I had to add my ORS oil moisturizing lotion to the root of my hair to combat the dryness. I would not recommend this product. There are far more better products out there.</li>
    <li> IT IS GOOD FOR MY HAIR,  MY HAIR COMBS OUT EASILY AND HAIR IS VERY MANAGEABLE, WAS BOUGHT AROUND 3 MONTHS AGO,</li>
    <li> My Brazilian long hair is tough to manage, it can get tangled up and it can be hard to brush without mentioning the split ends, after using salerm wheat germ for the past 2-3 years I can say that it totally changed the structure of my hair and its now silk smooth, you will fill the difference on the first application.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! I&#x27;ve tried lots of expensive hair treatments and so far this has been the best it  gives great moisture without the slippery silicone feel. Hair absorbs it and leaves it feeling soft and full of body....</li>
    <li> Very good conditioner for all types of hair. It leaves you hair feeling soft and smell very good. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product on earth for your hair. It straightens and tames and smoothes and everythings it. You have to try this but yes beware of the smell it is not the greatest but if you have to use a good fan and/ or a well ventilated room but I don&#x27;t have to. It is worth it and its not that bad.</li>
    <li> nice hair mask, leaves hair soft and silky. Its very easy to brush long hair after the use.  Especially if left on for 10 or more minutes. The only negative it does not smell great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner! I was introduced by a Dominican salon two years ago &amp; have been using ever since! Has an odor (I love) some may find a little strong but works wonderfully. Keeps hair feeling &amp; looking soft &amp; manageable. African American texture &amp; when I finish using it I feels silky. Trust one use &amp; you will be hooked!</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different treatments over the years; expensive and inexpensive and I can say this product is wonderful! It helped me maintain my blonde hair!</li>
    <li> IDK if my hair was sensitive to the product ingredients or what but did nothing but dry out my hair. I have thick curly kinky hair and this stuff completely dried out my ends!</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time and I am so impressed by the results!  My hair feel so soft and silky.  I will continue to use this on myself and on my girls.</li>
    <li> Before my hairdresser sold me one and the inside is more darker, it was helping my dry hair but now i don&#x27;t know if its helping i don&#x27;t see the difference. At the picture it shows &amp;#34;CAPILLARY MASK&amp;#34; but when i got the product it said &amp;#34;HAIR MASK&amp;#34; so its not what they are selling you very disappointing for the money i paid. :(</li>
    <li> Great deep conditioner!  I decided to go back to this mask, because after trying different products on my natural 4a culy hair, i realized the salerm mask leves my hair soft and moisturized. Love it and recommend it.  The jar arrived well sealed and tightly packaged, no spills and arrived before the scheduled delivery date.  Im a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I love the option of this coming in a large size.  Thanks for that option.  This makes my hair feel so strong and soft at the same time.  It is a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing. My hair will never b washed unless I hv an ample supply of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and my hair just loves it! I was happy to find it on Amazon because it is not sold where I live.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on my hair. I usually have my hair stylist put this in during a wash and set and my hair always comes out shinny and healthy!!</li>

    <li> Read the reviews and ordered while on vacation in Florida. Lots of SLIP which with my dryish 4b hair I need for detangling and smoothing.  I&#x27;m gladd I purchased this big container!! I love it. just discovered 3 months later you can use it as a leave in or on dry hair.  Yes I need glasses in the shower and I would have noticed that a while earlier!  LOL I will be reordering when I am out.</li>

    <li> Great product!!!! Keeps my hair nice and soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This product was introduced to me at a local Dominican salon. One day I walked into a new local salon (because my tried-and-true was super busy) and asked for a regular blow-out along with the best deep conditioning treatment they had.  Although, I was not told the name of the product or manufacturer I did catch a glimpse of the container and remembered the very distinct (very earthy and natural) smell and color of what was being applied.  During my blow-out I noticed that the other customers were staring at my hair and one other person actually asked, &amp;#34;Can you please tell me what you used in her hair?&amp;#34; after it was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt incredibly soft, had tons of slip and was not weighed down...most incredibly the cuticle of each strand of hair looked very smooth, was not dull in color and this looked credibly brilliant and super shiny (almost as if it was so health it could reflect light of the strands).  As soon as I got home, I Googled this product and purchased it online after seeing other had similar experiences.  Please listen to all the other reviewers, this product has earned a permanent place in my hair care routine as I have not been able to find any other products that compare to its conditioning competency.  If your hair is like mine and grows resistant to products after constant use you will have to switch off between this and some other treatment like a protein treatment.  I do not use this each time I wash my hair and my other product of choice is Rapunzel&#x27;s Protein Deep Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began taking this conditioning treatment to my main Dominican stylist, each time I bring it she tells me how good this product is and its way better than anything she carries in her salon.  This product rightfully earned 5 stars the only reason I did not rate it that high is because over the years my hair seems to have grown a bit resistant to the benefits of this treatment (hence, the reason why I play between two main deep conditioners) and I have not seen the same dramatic results from my earlier use.  Also, you get much better results with this product when its used by a professional stylist.  In my opinion I buy products like this because I want salon quality results every time at home.</li>
    <li> This mask is good for moisturizing hair and adding sheen+body to hair. I used it right after relaxing the hair and it made a huge difference in terms of moisturizing (coz relaxers can really dry the hair).  I recommend wheat germ to anyone with dry hair or damaged hair (due to heat or chemical relaxers).</li>
    <li> The best for my hair my hair is very healthy healthy!!! used a lot  recommend this product especial for hair dry</li>
    <li> I am black with 3c hair and have been using this product for about a year. This conditioner softens and conditions my hair wonderfully. Typical treatment for great results has been 30 minutes under a heat cap or steamer to restore dry, tangled hair to soft, wavy, fluffy hair with wonderful movement.  I also like this product because it can be used as a leave-in treatment as well (it says so on the container).  Used as a leave in, I usually spray my hair with water and then distribute a quater-sized amount of this product on top of the water, and add a bit more if I feel I need it.  I&#x27;ve found that this helps restore life mid-week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another similar mid-week use is to spray hair with a bit of water at night, add this product, detangle, then braid hair and the next day you have a soft, wonderful braid-out.  I do believe that this is an exceptional product.  I rated it 4 rather than 5 stars because I wish it has a more neutral fragrance, but it smells okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******After a couple of years of using this product, I upgraded it from a 4 to a 5 because I haven&#x27;t found a better hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for years and it leaves my hair feeling like silk... My only concern is that the product was seeping out of its &amp;#34;security seal&amp;#34; and raised some concern as I&#x27;ve been using this for over 7 years and this has never happened. Rating it 4 due to packaging.</li>
    <li> I need to have it in my hair stuffs. Excellent to damage and dry hair. It leaves your hair so soft. Excellent mask</li>
    <li> Great product. The  smell can be a little strong for some people, but it is worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this treatment and I always bought this product and I have the same results always. My hair looks bright and silky..</li>
    <li> It is amazing . It reduced breakage on my heavily highlighted hair by the first use .&lt;br /&gt;I am using it about every 10 days. It works.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I order this product often for my 11 year old daughter.  It is great!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife after she requested it. She states that it is the best treatment for her dry hair that she has found thus far. However, the only downside to this is that it has Parabens which I would like her to avoid. I hope Salerm can come out with a similar product that is paraben and phenoxyethanol free.</li>
    <li> I have 4b natural hair for the past two years and I while I have learned a lot about caring for my hair, I am still on the lookout for anything that can make my hair any easier to manage. Now, I am no product junkie and I carefully research anything I am considering purchasing for my hair.  I was actually looking for wheat germ oil and decided to splurge on this product after reading all of the positive reviews.  The day it arrived, I decided to try it out on my dry hair to see how well it worked and all I can say is WOW!  This is hands down the best product I have purchased for my hair since going natural. My hair became instantly smooth and soft to the touch.  I was actually able to comb my hair with ease, no breakage and the cuticles seemed to just lay down at the touch.  Everything about this conditioner is the truth and I can&#x27;t wait to try it after my weekly shampoo.</li>
    <li> Besides Terax Crema, this is the best hair conditioner EVER! The smell is a bit weird, I like it, but some may not. Very wheat germy (not a word, but I hope you get the smell description) I leave it on for about 15 mins in the shower. Shave, scrub up, whatever you have to do, leave the rinsing for the end, and VOILA!!! Soft hair!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It works perfectly to condition my colored 4a hair. High recommend. I order it all the time.</li>
    <li> I like this mask a lot! I also use it after I shower too as a leave in conditioner. I like the smell and it restores your hair luster.</li>
    <li> It came opened and leaking</li>
    <li> Salerm is the Most quality shampoo i ever use.My hairdresser ask my where i get them and she using the salerm for the clients now.</li>
