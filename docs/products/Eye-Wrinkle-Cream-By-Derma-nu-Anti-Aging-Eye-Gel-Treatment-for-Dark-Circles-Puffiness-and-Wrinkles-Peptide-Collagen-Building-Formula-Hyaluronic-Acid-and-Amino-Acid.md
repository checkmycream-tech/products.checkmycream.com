<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried many creams and anti-age potions, but this is the one for me.  My skin has never been softer, or more &amp;#34;less-wrinkled&amp;#34; .  Very pleased with the product.  Will not change brands again.</li>
    <li> I love it. it makes my eye looks bright, less dark circle.</li>
    <li> Hashelped my eyes immensely with beginning crows feet and 40yrs old. I use along with Cereve under eye treatment, purple say I don&#x27;t look close to forty:) will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This eye cream took away the swelling under my eyes and lessened the wrinkles on the sides of my eyes.</li>
    <li> Under eye puffiness is disappearing.</li>
    <li> Love this. High quality. Smells good, feels awesome.  Love the way is makes the skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Amazing Stuff, I dare you to give it a try!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing! It instantly tightens and I have noticed a definite difference with continued use. My dark circles are less noticeable and my fine lines seem to be melting away! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Been using about a month, exactly like instructions say, and I can totally see the difference.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles for many years. After 1 month used, my dark circles is nearly disappeared. It works for me. I want to thank Derma-nu</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it would work very well because there are so many more products that are more expensive. You usually think expensive means better but not in this case. This one works the best ever and took away some of my wrinkles making me look and feel young again. You can feel it working as soon as you start using it on yourself. After about a week of using this product I started to see a huge result.</li>
    <li> I have never used an Eye Cream before, so I was pretty hesitant about using this.  I am a very busy mom of 3 and tend to not get enough sleep and my eyes really were starting to show it.&lt;br /&gt;I was giving the opportunity to get this Derma-nu Eye Cream at a great price and review it.  After a week of using 2x a day, I have noticed that my eyes look less puffy and the dark spots are fading away.  Excited to see the change after 2 or more weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this. It made my skin feel great. I felt refreshed and relaxed after using this. You can use this with confidence that it really works!</li>
    <li> It has a great feeling and goes on very nicely.</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful product.  I was skeptical at first, as I&#x27;ve tried so many eye creams in the past and disappointed every time.  This product has renewed my faith!  The packaging was excellent, and the shipping was lightning fast!  Don&#x27;t let the size of the bottle fool you, a little of this product goes a long way, and the amount in the bottle will last quite a while!  This cream is thick, not watery like others I&#x27;ve tried.  I use just a dab and pat it under my eyes with my ring fingers.  It feels super on my skin.  Smooth!  I&#x27;ve been using for a week, and I can already see such an improvement.  Of course, my eyes do not look like I&#x27;m 18 again, but at 41 this product makes a huge improvement!  I will certainly purchase more when I run out.  I&#x27;ve heard people talk about a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; product, well now I know what they mean :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three weeks and I see no improvement whatsoever.</li>
    <li> My eye have never looked better than they do after using this cream. I really like this eye cream it does not irritate my sensitive skin or leave a greasy feeling on you skin like some cream do it makes my skin feel softer and It has a good smell to it. I am so glad I got to try this product because it works Great!</li>
    <li> Love this eye gel. Gotten to the age where I would like to slow down getting wrinkles. And this product is great in assisting me with that effort :-). Thank you ! Great Seller! Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> So far so good. The only problem I have is that I get flakes from it in the morning but water takes it away. I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product.  If feels great on my skin, I can still apply makeup with no heavy feeling.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have not had any negative reactions.  I like the way it smells and I can see a freshness in my skin.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Um..no, it did very little by take away hope, leaving me looking like an Italian raccoon</li>
    <li> The seller provided this item to me a discount for my 100% unbiased honest opinion and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the Derama-nu Eye Cream for dark circles and puffiness. I like using this both day and night as I always seem to wake up with puffy eyes due to allergies and puffy eyes and dark circles at night after a long day. Wash your face and apply the eye cream immediately to your entire eye -- under. in the corners and the lid. There is no burning or redness. I have very sensitive skin and the Derma-nu Eye cream did not cause me any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product and a little goes along way</li>
    <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m amazed at how well this products work on the puffiness under your eyes and  for the crows feet&lt;br /&gt;i can hardly see the crows feet&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i received this product in return for my review</li>
    <li> I use this, along with the face serum and regenerating cream. I am very happy with all of these products. This Eye Gel is 72% organic! It goes on nice and smoothly. It contains aloe and cucumber and just smells amazing. My eyes aren&#x27;t puffy anymore! It also contains Hyaluronic acid and MSM, both work amazingly on my skin. I am so glad I got to try this great product at a promotional rate! I&#x27;ve also noticed a few fine lines I have seem to have diminished. Thank you for reading my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye cream.  Goes on smoothly and feels great! Arrived quickly, as promised.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> The eye cream for dark circles did really well. I used it in the morning and at night. I really liked it truly helps with dark circles and it plumps up Your face . You can put it all over.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially since they do not test on animals - bravo to you, Derma-nu; will definitely purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products for under eye puffiness and dark circles. I was skeptical because of the reasonable price. I was surprised that this one is been the very best for my puffiness. I even ordered another. It helped the dark circles some, but mine are die to allergies, age, lack of sleep, and heredity. There is only so much that can be done for that, short of going to the doctor&#x27;s office, except using a concealer. I am very pleased with this product. I will continue to use it, and intend to try some of their other ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since May 1, 2015 (two months) and have definitely noticed an improvement in my appearance ...or should I say others have noticed.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the serum for my dark circles but to combat wrinkles, fine lines / crows feet and the beginning stages of sagging lids.  The reason I feel confident that  it works is that since using this product, people are complimenting me on my eyes again; something I had grown accustomed to over the years as my eyes are relatively large and a pretty pale blue (think about the paintings &amp;#34;Big Eyes&amp;#34;).  I had stopped receiving compliments on my eyes about two-three years ago and I attributed it to the lifelessness my eye area and facial skin had developed with age (I&#x27;m 58).  This month, I&#x27;ve received at least 5 compliments from people whom I don&#x27;t know (men and women) about how beautiful my eyes are.  Call me vain but these remarks, while all to familiar to me in the past, were a welcome surprise and something one doesn&#x27;t tire of hearing so I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> No difference noted. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price!</li>
    <li> I have an auto immune disorder that causes me great fatigue.  Because of that, the area under my eye has bags and dark circles.  I have a few light lines as well.  I got this product because I&#x27;m always looking for something to help me look more awake and younger.  I also received the product at a great deal for a review.  The first thing I thought about this product is it is very thick and creamy when it comes out of the container.  I like that.  When I put it on, my skin feels refreshed.  I have been using this for 5 days now at night and under my make up.  The first thing I have noticed is the skin under my eyes feels tighter.  The skin feels smoother already.  I haven&#x27;t seen too much of a change on the dark circles but I&#x27;ve only used this for 5 days.  I am going to continue using this twice a day to see how much of a difference it can make.  But so far, I am really liking this product and I can see that it is helping!!</li>
    <li> My eyes feel fresh and glowing I use this constantly and always get compliments I got this off of the Amazon reviewer this is one of my favorite products on the market !</li>
    <li> I have purchased many, many beauty products.  From $5 to $200 to help prevent and improve aging.  This is by far the best I have every used.  I was a bit unsure as I first purchased at an Arts and Crafts Show but the Seller was so friendly and allowed me to use the product on site.  I felt it working right there! I purchased a set deal that included the eye gel, firming serum, aloe cream, facial moisturizer, and dead sea scrub.  The eye gel only takes a small amount and any excess I pump I use around my lips.  The under eye puffiness has gone away and I definitely see a difference around my eyes. The ingredients are all natural and you can read and pronounce them! I highly recommend throwing out any product you are using and buy this one.  It is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many reviews and good thing about this produ t even my friends recommend this. I swear I doubt it buying this before because I been trying so many eye gel products but this one it make me amazed. This is the best eye gel I&#x27;ve ever purchase. It helps a lot of my dark circles and my moms loving it so much.  and I&#x27;m now sharing it to my mom and sisters.</li>
    <li> i love it . it seem to works around my eyes</li>
    <li> I like it, it feels nice on my skin. It is not fattening my skin. I&#x27;ve just started using it and I don&#x27;t have any issues with it.</li>
    <li> I noticed some improvement, keep using it. Hopes it works.</li>
    <li> Again a great product.  I used the firming serum which I really loved.  I&#x27;m glad the company gave me a chance to try this for review.  I will definately be buying this in the future.</li>
    <li> I honestly didnt see the big deal for this product... it felt like as if i,put lotion on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eye creams recently, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a perfect product. This one is no exception. It does moisturize the eye area, it seems to make my eyes appear my smooth and tight, but I still have dark circles. Depending on what you&#x27;re trying to treat, you might be okay with that. I do like the feel of this cream/gel more than other products I&#x27;ve tried. It isn&#x27;t sticky at all and absorbs quickly and fully.</li>
    <li> It makes the eye area very dry.</li>
    <li> Smells like cucumber.</li>
    <li> What a great eye gel and it really work very well to tighten the eye area and removing puffiness of the eye. I would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> I love the eye gel! It is very moisturizing and works. Not much is needed but a small amount and the results are amazing! I didn&#x27;t even realize that I had under eye puffiness but after using this I have a flatter look under my eyes. My fine wrinkles do not show up either. I am so glad I noticed a discount code for this product and ordered it quickly. I am happy to give a review for this product as it is very good and I would recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and it appears to be clearing up my under eyes. While it is early to tell the full effect, I will continue to use and update the review in the future. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about two weeks. Fine lines are reduced and my eye area seems firmer. I have sensitive eyes and this product is working well and not causing any issues for my eyes.</li>
    <li> So far----GREAT! Only been a couple of weeks, but I love this eye gel. Takes a small amount, seems to really make my fine lines much better after a couple of weeks. Non-greasy I can put on my make up right after application in the morning. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. BTW...I also use at night....did I mention how much I love this product!</li>
    <li> Very soothing eye gel and easy to apply. It leaves my undereye area feeling moisturized and hydrated. The gel consistency is lightweight and cooling on the skin, but absorbs very quickly, with no film left behind. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love my free derma-nu the smell it&#x27;s just so awesome and natural I am usually allergic to everything but it didn&#x27;t create a reaction on my face I just love it</li>
    <li> I have been using the Eye Cream in the evening, for a little over two weeks.  It is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;It firms and tightens the skin around the eye area, and minimizes the lines under the eye.  I will definitely continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is amazing!!  This is my first time using eye gel but I love this.  I love the smell, it smells natural, not chemically (If that&#x27;s a word).  I have been using this for just under a week and I can see daily improvement!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product with a discount and to provide a honest feedback in return.</li>
    <li> Smells like cucumber and refreshing!  Feels nice and is very gentle.  My face feels refreshed in the morning. My fine lines look less apparent in the morning.</li>
    <li> This cream did help my eye area with fine lines. I really liked it. I received this to review.</li>
    <li> This eye gel smells like cucumbers to me and is refreshing to my eyes.  I believe it has helped the area around my eyes.  I use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> I purchased this through Amazon.  It came wrapped very nicely and on time.  I&#x27;m 63 and I really believe nothing is going to cover my dark raccoon circles as I have tried everything.  Also, the same with my wrinkles but I do like the cream and I do like the feedback from Derma-nu.  At 63 one can&#x27;t expect too much but this eye cream is cool to the touch and glides right on without pulling any tissue from the under eye. If I can catch another sale on this I would purchase more.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye gels over the years and I finally found one that works along with my skin routime.  The skin around the eyes is very delicate and this gel goes on so soft and smooth I wish I could use it all over.  I put it on first and then I do the rest of my facial routine.  I  recommend this gel to anyone who wants to soften the lines around the eyes to the point that you no longer see them. Also, the  price for this gel that works so well, is no where near as pricey as others I have used and did not care for.</li>
    <li> love this product feels great!</li>
    <li> **Added to my previous review**  I have dealt with customer service regarding a promo code that wasn&#x27;t working.  The lady was very patient and incredibly helpful in making sure I was satisfied with my order.  Very great company to work with!  I highly recommend you trying out their products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very much enjoying this product I received from Amazon Review Trader and the nice folks at Derma-nu!  I have noticed a small change in my dark circles (I have been using it for about a week and a half, daily).  I would say the only real downfall I see of this product so far is that when it first comes out of the bottle it is very sticky in texture.  Once the product dries on the face it is no longer sticky so I still give it a full 5 stars.  I think it is more of a personal dislike than anything that really has to do with the product itself.</li>
    <li> I feel this stuff really working! I waited to do a review after using it a little bit, but I can say that this stuff really makes me feel better! I love the texture, it is not slimy nor sticky like some other products. It goes on easily and cleanly and doesn&#x27;t have a weird odor like other products do. I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received for an HONEST review.</li>
    <li> It feels good on my skin but hasn&#x27;t eliminated the bags or circles.  It&#x27;s just been a few weeks, though.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel. I&#x27;m using it in combination with the Derma-nu Vitamin C serum and also the Firming serum. I wish I had found out about these products sooner. While I haven&#x27;t been using these products for very long, I&#x27;m already noticing a big difference in my skin, most especially around the eyes, but everywhere, really. My skin is brighter, clearer, plumper, and I&#x27;m not noticing as many wrinkles. I&#x27;m excited to see what my skin looks like in a few weeks down the line. I will definitely keep using these products. Derma-Nu was nice and included a discount coupon for future orders. Thank you Derma-nu! I did receive this product at a bargain price in return for posting an honest reveiew.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job in helping removing black circles&lt;br /&gt;Removes wrinkles around eyes&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness is a goner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove black circles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank Derma for allowing me to test this product at a reduced price!</li>
    <li> This is good products I feel the difference already</li>
    <li> I received this on review and really love this product. It seems to help with my wrinkles and overall complexion. The seller made sure that the product was sent promptly and packaged so that it would not be damaged. I recommend the seller and product.</li>
    <li> maybe it&#x27;s just me - maybe it&#x27;s my skin - but i used this diligently for a few weeks, and I have not seen any changes.  I still have bags under my eyes, and sometimes they look bruised.  I also have not noticed any changes in lines around my eyes.  I am going to continue using, hoping there will be some improvement - but so far I have not seen any, sadly.</li>
    <li> My giving this product only 3 stars has nothing to do with the product.  I have severe allergies and when I apply this product the puffiness  does not diminish.  The product does seem to improve my problem. May try it again later as this is allergy season in AZ at present. Sorry for the negativeness.</li>
    <li> Really drying to the skin and tend to migrate to the lips making them dry also. Quit using it awhile ago but forgot to send it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had puffy eyes. This stuff gets rid of that within minutes. And the cost was affordable, not like other known brands that charge almost $100.00 for the same effect.</li>
    <li> Not sure my eyes are still puffy....  It did despaired But I will continue to use let me see what happens</li>
    <li> I think I need to use it a bit longer, and once I do, I will update my review.  I do have very dark circles under my eyes.  My hope is that with continual use those circles will lessen.  When I used it, it was easy to pump, it did smell like cucumbers (not my personal fav but that&#x27;s me) but one thing I did not like was that it did not seem to rub in well.  After several minutes of having it on, it felt like something was on my skin, so I eventually washed it off.  I do not like that feeling of something just clinging to my skin.  I&#x27;ll give it another try and a few more weeks and see what happens.  :)</li>
    <li> I decided to try this gel cause of all the reviews it had, I tried a couple more over the past months but nothing has given me the results this one did!! I woke up and loved how good my eyes looked. probably kind of tenses the skin a bit due to the components, but even after showering I loved how my face felt! Would 100% recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I truly love this eye gel!  It is so soothing and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like every other eye cream I have tried.  The area around my eye feels hydrated without greasiness from creams and fine lines are less noticeable.  My eye area feels firmer immediately after I use it.  I also use the other Derma-Nu products and love them all!  I especially love the body cream!  These are spa quality products made from natural ingredients without all the chemicals so I feel good about using them.  I&#x27;m hooked and will be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Like it seems to be working</li>
    <li> Really has not worked for me.</li>
    <li> It felt really cool to the touch on my face.I have been using and can actually notice a change.I forgot to take a before photo.I got this at a really good price.I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice jel cream. Makes skin around eyes feel good. I wish it was better at getting rid of my bags under my eyes, still like product though. smells like cucumbers.</li>
    <li> Received this item in exchanged for my review.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a sticky feeling behind but once it dries its gone. do love the fact it has gotten rid of some of the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Derma-nu eye cream has made my face and neck skin smoother &amp; softer, not just for eyes !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream comes  in a pump style .5 ounce container with a clear lid.  With just half a push you get out enough to cover your face and neck.  It is a very light cream leaving your skin feeling refreshed after using it.  It has a light scent, that resembles cucumber.  I received this at a promotional rate to try then give my honest opinion in my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for anyone to moisturize and nourish your skin.  You can use it under makeup which makes it easier to apply your makeup with moisturized skin.</li>
    <li> Started using it right away. Love it. I know it will work miracles.</li>
    <li> very easy to smear on gel. light on my eyes area. great</li>
    <li> Not really impressed at all,  not for the price. If I could return it,  I would.  I expected some serious results after reading the reviews.  I&#x27;m a 36 year old mother with a one year old who commonly lacks sleep.  The consistency is good,  soaks in almost immediately,  and is not greasy at all.  I also bought the firming serum, also not impressed.  I have tried many creams and for the price of this one I wold rather stick to Garnier or Oil of Olay.  I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a bad product,  just doesn&#x27;t hold up to the claims in my opinion. I didn&#x27;t pay full price, but even at twenty bucks, I&#x27;d rather spend it on three tubes of Olay, since to me that&#x27;s what it is comparable to.</li>
    <li> Good eye cream. I noticed that my dark under eye circles are fading as well as brightness around my eyes. Good results so far</li>
    <li> Great product, the area under my eyes is well hydrated with this product. I am very happy with the results . I get up very early and exercise and swim and even the swim goggle marks on my face improve quickly when I apply this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye serum in conjunction with a Derma roller and I&#x27;m very pleased.  I have genetic circles around my eyes and this product works better then anything else I&#x27;ve used so far. Nothing will ever get rid of my circles completely but this works well. as it remains affordable,  im using it.</li>
    <li> Great eye gel, really works well to tighten and firm, I felt it immediately! Definitely recommend this for anyone who wants younger looking eyes.</li>
    <li> This will take ten years off your face overnight. I am thinking of using it on my whole body.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great. I have two young kids, the constant no sleeping gave me very dark circles. After applying this cream for about a week. I can tell my under eye circles and dark circles are disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received the product with a discount and to provide a honest feedback in return</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My skin is very sensitive and I can use very few products. This one not only works wonders, it does so very fast! Will try all the products!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a week and it worked ok for me and that is because i dont have many wrinkles and the few i had this product work ok for them I did not like the smell of the product it just smelled not rite to me but beside that I think the product works ok. I had recieved this product at a good price to be able to do this review.</li>
    <li> I currently am using three Derma-nu products - the eye gel, the firming serum, and the moisturizing cream.  I think all three products are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how little product (eye gel) is needed - a small pea sized amount pumped onto the fingertip goes a long way.  The entire eye area is treated and there&#x27;s enough remaining to lightly cover the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the eye gel completely dry before adding the moisturizer.  I&#x27;m very glad to have found the Derma-nu products.  The suppleness of my skin is the reward for finding the products.</li>
    <li> Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a few weeks, I still have puffiness under my eyes. I will continue to use it until it is gone!</li>
    <li> I can see the difference right away. The lines under my eyes looked filled out and it feels so nice around the ears. Really refreshing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE all the products I&#x27;ve used in his line. Great brand!!!</li>
    <li> Great  eye serum. I noticed results within a few days. It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it didn&#x27;t dry sticky. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> No, it really didn&#x27;t for much the dark circles &amp; puffiness. But I do like the feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels under my eyes! Smells great and feels great too!</li>
    <li> I tried this on myself because im always tired. Seems to work great, i look less tired!</li>
    <li> This product really hydrates my under eye area. I love how it&#x27;s a gel and not a cream, it&#x27;s so unique! I do notice my under eyes look more luminous after application as well. The smell is quite pleasant. I haven&#x27;t noticed my dark circles lightening but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little under 2 weeks. Just for the hydrating and illuminating aspect I&#x27;d recommend this product! I received a discount on this product for a review but that does not affect my opinions.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! Received a discount to try but will be a regular customer. Has a cool feeling when applied and the puffiness below my eyes is drastically better! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Since I have a baby that still wants to wake up at all hours of the night, I look like crap every morning. I&#x27;ve tried different eye creams that all claim to get rid of dark circles and puffiness, and they never really work. I still look exhausted. So when I was offered this Eye Cream for Dark Circles from Derma-nu for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I was excited to try it. It arrived and I immediately used it. Within a few minutes I could see a difference! My eyes were less puffy and not as dark as they normally are! I&#x27;ve been using it day and night and each day I look more and more rested. I have since thrown out all my other crappy creams. I definitely recommend this great Eye Cream for Dark Circles from Derma-nu!</li>
    <li> This eye gel caused dry, irritated, crepey skin around my eyes where I applied it. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Good eye creams are expensive. The $20 prime price here brings this down to a reasonable level. While the product worked well, would never pay the full $70 price for it. That isn&#x27;t saying the product isn&#x27;t worth the $70 but when on a budget, you don&#x27;t want to have to pay full price and will look elsewhere when items are priced too high. The fact that I got it for a promotional price to try and review certainly helped but I&#x27;m good with the $20 price knowing how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough on the pricing though, as far as the effectiveness of the product goes, a little goes a long way. Once you hit a certain age, the eyes get puffier or have dark circles or both, wrinkles, too. Anything you can do to hide the effects of aging helps the appearance greatly. The derma-nu eye cream does a great job of softening/smoothing the skin to get it to look and feel so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect immediate results. You have to give it some time to work its magic. It isn&#x27;t just a coverup but with morning / evening applications, it gets the job done. About the only way I could see an improvement is perhaps an unscented variety. Not a bad scent, but would prefer none.</li>
    <li> I have already left one review but I&#x27;m still being prompted to leave another so here it goes... I have not seen any significant results of the product. I&#x27;m assuming I may have to use it for a few weeks or months before seeing a result. I can say that it feels refreshing when applied.</li>
    <li> Amazing my eyes have never looked so young!!! Amazing amazing amazing!!! Recommend to all my family and friends!!!</li>
