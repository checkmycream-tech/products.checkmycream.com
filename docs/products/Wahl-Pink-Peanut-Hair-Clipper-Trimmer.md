      <li>It works great for those small or tight places.</li>
      <li>The cord is pretty long, too, which helps.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it is kind of loud.  </li>
      <li>And it is just as loud as a larger clipper, so she dislikes this one just as much as the larger cordless one that I have opted to use.  </li>
      <li>Shopped fast, absolutely no probs</li>
      <li>The blade by itself will almost shave your face and you will barely have any noticeable hairs showing.  </li>
      <li>And she really enjoys the pink color.</li>

<li> And yeah, it will heat up, but only under very, very heavy use.  </li>
<li> After about two weeks of use these trimmers started making an unusual noise and stopped cutting hair properly.</li>
<li> I like how its so small and not real noisy.  </li>
<li> I wanted this clipper for my little Yorkie, but the couple of times that I have used it didn&#x27;t work out too well.  </li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t cordless, so the cord gets in the way when trying to navigate the trimmer around her small little face.  </li>
<li> Small and convenient to use.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s small and affordable.</li>
<li> Got the wrong color ...</li>
<li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed at all.</li>

    <li> My GF loved this as a gift. She cuts hair.</li>
    <li> The machine is very cute and is perfect for my daughters hand.  Is very precise and lightweight.  And it&#x27;s pink !</li>
    <li> Wish it had the &#x27;peanut&#x27; shape &amp; texture like the other colors of peanut hair clippers.</li>
    <li> Loveeeeeeee my small mini trimmer very good quality fit for my small hands lol</li>
    <li> trimmer works great and does well to donate to a great cause. Shopped fast, absolutely no probs</li>
    <li> Originally, My dad had one of these and I would always steal it.  Finally, he drove me to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies and I paid $50 for my own.  Let me tell you, it was one of the best investments I have ever made.  He got his years before I did and his still works like new.  Previously, I had bought a few different trimmers at marshalls and wal mart, the Peanut dwarfs the competition.  The blades have not noticeably dulled and the power is still the same.  I have even shaved my entire head with 3-4 inches of hair with this thing.  It is truly a bite-sized beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with lubricating oil, a cleaning brush, and 4 different sized brush guards for different precision styling.  I only use this for my face and for trimming my chest.  The blade by itself will almost shave your face and you will barely have any noticeable hairs showing.  So, if you needed a quick shave but didnt have the time, these are absolutely perfect.  Also, these clippers do not require countless passes over the same area, they cut EXTREMELY well. They are also very easy to meanuever and are able to make those precise cuts in tough to reach spots that larger sized clippers cannot.  And yeah, it will heat up, but only under very, very heavy use.  If it is really an issue (its not for me), then simply give the blade a quick dip in water, dry it, and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you purchase this Peanut, you will never even think about another pair of grooming clippers.  Personally, I will have one of these for my entire life, they are simpy the best.  I highly recommend paying the extra money for this great product.  Do not be fooled by the size or the name, it is a lawnmower of a trimmer.</li>
    <li> After about two weeks of use these trimmers started making an unusual noise and stopped cutting hair properly. I would not recommend these to anyone to use for anything.</li>
    <li> I have always used the wahl peanut for lining up my male clients&#x27; haircuts and doing beard trims. It&#x27;s a very precise trimmer and does great detail work. Will always use!!</li>
    <li> Works great!!! Just remember this does have a power cord. Otherwise, perfect!</li>
    <li> These are my second pair and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;There light weight and the cord is long and sturdy for convience</li>
    <li> We bought these for our daughter to replace another set.  These are a good tool and hold up the expected amount of time with heavy use.  It was nice to get in a cute color.</li>
    <li> my wifes in cosmetology school and hse was needing a small peanut for school and this worked great for what she was needing it for</li>
    <li> things came on time  this was a replacement for what got stollen i am a proffessnal  hairdressor....... love the color pink</li>
    <li> Very nice clipper.  Great price(I checked a lot of websites and beauty supply stores)very sharp and comes with accessories too!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Junk and cheaply made!! Mine broke after one use..</li>
    <li> I wanted this clipper for my little Yorkie, but the couple of times that I have used it didn&#x27;t work out too well.  It isn&#x27;t cordless, so the cord gets in the way when trying to navigate the trimmer around her small little face.  And it is just as loud as a larger clipper, so she dislikes this one just as much as the larger cordless one that I have opted to use.  I do like the color and the little letters are adorable.</li>
    <li> Got the wrong color ... Seller was very helpful and sent the correct color.. I love these... They are so versatile!!</li>
    <li> I found this product to work great.  Small and convenient to use.  Shipping and handling was extremely quick and effecient.</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this item,well worth the money.Made me happy to help out the Cancer society by buying this product.My daughter-in-law loves it also and even owns one.I would recommend this product to family and friends</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses these clippers and I had to have them.  I was even more excited when I saw that they came in pink.  They are great for touch-up&#x27;s and cut very close.  My only complaint is that it is kind of loud.  The cord is pretty long, too, which helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who was a newly licensed cosmotologist.  It works great for those small or tight places. And she really enjoys the pink color.</li>
    <li> A hair dresser at a salon used this on my neck, and I liked it so much that I bought one for myself.  No cuts or scratches on the neck at all.  It&#x27;s small and affordable.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this clipper. I bought it for my daughter for work, she&#x27;s a stylist and make up artist.....loves it!! A++++++++++++++++++++++</li>
    <li> I like how its so small and not real noisy.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a trimmer for your puppies. I like the pink color too.  If you are looking at buying a trimmer, buy this one... you won&#x27;t be disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> Wahl has never failed me and it&#x27;s really a great product cause of its ease of use. There is nothing I don&#x27;t like about it and I would recommend this product.</li>
