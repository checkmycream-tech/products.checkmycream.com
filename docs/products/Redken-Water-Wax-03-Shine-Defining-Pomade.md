<li> Redken apparently has not only changed the White container as seen here to Black, but they have also changed the contents.</li>
<li> and I use it now to piece long bangs.</li>
<li> The White and the Black Containers both say &amp;#34;03&amp;#34;, but the contents is NOT the same.  </li>
<li> DO NOT LIKE THE NEW BLACK CONTAINER  CONTENTS!!</li>
<li> Sticky, not as firm as same product purchased locally.</li>
<li> This is a clear, slick, shine pomade.</li>
<li> I have a small amount of my white container left.</li>
<li> I have very dry, frizzy hair.</li>
<li> Keeps down the frizzy hair on humid days.</li>
<li> Amazon needs to change the product shown in the ad to Black, if that is what the customer is going to receive.</li>
<li> I just threw the jar of Black away that I received with this order.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t miss a day without using a little spot of water wax.</li>
<li> It takes a little practice the figure out the amount you need</li>
<li> The grey container version is horrible -- less actual gel and different formulation than the newer, black container formulation that is sold in Redken stores.</li>
<li> A little goes a looooooong way!</li>
<li> It was a little too thick for my hair.</li>
<li> and this gives it that edgy look.  </li>

    <li> I love how it makes my hair shine and it&#x27;s just the right consistency to hold my curls in shape with no frizz.</li>
    <li> The grey container version is horrible -- less actual gel and different formulation than the newer, black container formulation that is sold in Redken stores.</li>
    <li> Tried and true for nearly 10 years. This is a clear, slick, shine pomade. I used it to chunk my short hair years ago and I use it now to piece long bangs. I love this product!</li>
    <li> was just like it used to be.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  I have very dry, frizzy hair. If you have smooth silky hair this will probably be too heavy. It takes a little practice the figure out the amount you need</li>
    <li> only one my husband will use!</li>
    <li> A little goes a looooooong way!</li>
    <li> Not for me....a bit too heavy for my fine hair</li>
    <li> Cheaper online, wife always complains that Walmart runs out. So bought a years supply, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with supply and demand.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it all the time. Best product for me anyway.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t miss a day without using a little spot of water wax. Keeps down the frizzy hair on humid days.</li>
    <li> I have really short hair and this gives it that edgy look.  Lasts all day long, washes out easy.  Gives your hair a beautiful shine too. I use this every day.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. Nice way to get a sleek look without the wet look.</li>

    <li> Redken apparently has not only changed the White container as seen here to Black, but they have also changed the contents. It is completely different. DO NOT LIKE THE NEW BLACK CONTAINER  CONTENTS!! It has a strong shine additive where the white container did not. I have fine, thin hair and the new product does not work on my hair. Obviously, the white  container as shown is no longer availabe. The White and the Black Containers both say &amp;#34;03&amp;#34;, but the contents is NOT the same.  Amazon needs to change the product shown in the ad to Black, if that is what the customer is going to receive. I have a small amount of my white container left. I just threw the jar of Black away that I received with this order.</li>
    <li> cuts static better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
