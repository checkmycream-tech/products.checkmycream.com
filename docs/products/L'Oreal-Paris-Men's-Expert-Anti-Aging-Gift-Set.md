<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Better buy 4 as it takes a few weeks before I really noticed improvement. The deep sun-burn at the bottom of my neck is dissipating too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results on my wrinkles yet but I like it as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Terrible product package as a second hand item, the box is completely broken but I buy this for a friend!</li>
    <li> My hubby loves it! I ve bought him so many other brand moisturize before. Some are like 3,4 times more expensive than this. He loves this one the best.</li>
    <li> Works good enough for me!And the price is good too...</li>
    <li> effective product. a great well priced retinol A skin cream that doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 3 years. I FLY around the world a lot. There is no better cream for WE MEN....Just to refresh in that&lt;br /&gt;DRY air up at 35 thousand feet!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face lotions, from $20 to $40 to $60+ dollars a small bottle. This lotion truly is amazing, and the only one I continue to buy. The price is competitive with other products skin-care lotions you can find at a pharmacy, but much cheaper than the expensive brands you can only find at spas or expensive salons. Yet I find this works better than those expensive brands. The cream is very thick and rich to touch. You feel your skin soaking it up the moment you put it on your face. I can tell based on the richness of it that it is doing an amazing job of moisturizing the skin on my face. I use it every morning and after every shower to lock in moisture. It also comes in an SPF 15 version which is awesome because you can use it as a daily moisturizer as well. The product is a bit small, so with twice daily use it&#x27;s finished in about two months. I feel it&#x27;s still quite worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 stars!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Strong scent smells like your cheap shaving gel, which is not a good thing. It&#x27;s a lotion, not a cream. So it&#x27;s rather thin and not rich and doesn&#x27;t contain a whole lot of moisturizer. It works just about as well as  Suave hand lotion, and about the same consistency....at maybe 20X the price.</li>
    <li> I got this for dry skin in the winter. Keeps my skin from drying out without being oily</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy,I like it very much!I also like their cleanser quite a bit but for an exfoliator I use Biotherme which I like.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a good product, with a medium masculine fraquence this is the product for you. It has a fragence, not overly manly, but not feminine. The Amazon descriptions above conflict themselves with wether or not SPF is in the product. I recommend the non-SPF product unless you spend a lot of time in the sun from 10-4, which I do not. Recent studies say too much SPF can deprive you of Vitamin D. So a little sun on the commute at 8am and 5pm isn&#x27;t a concern for me. As well the SPF material irritate my eyes. I would not buy this if it had SPF. It takes very little product to cover my face, and the 1.6fl oz container lasted me 6 months. It took me a long time on Walgreens and Target to find a decent product that wasn&#x27;t over-hyped and a recent visit to Walgreens showed the product was gone. So I am very happy to find it here, and  hope it gets back in these stores. I have young childer, and those are the stores we frequent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different lines of men&#x27;s skin products and for the value I think L&#x27;Oreal is the winner. When people start mentioning how good your skin looks you know you&#x27;re on to something good. I don&#x27;t find it greasy at all and my skin absorbs it well. I also like their cleanser quite a bit but for an exfoliator I use Biotherme which I like. I may not look ten years younger but I look good for my age and that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have used that actually works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple mens moisturizing lotions over the years - some very expensive and some like Neutrogena inexpensive.  After two months I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. It has more of the active ingredients that actually help with anti-wrinkling and is cheaper than Neutrogena.  I read a lot about the fragrance but it hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality mens moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Significant improvement in the hydration in the areas of facial skin which had been damaged due to burn in the past.the added advantage is the firmness of the skin and diminishing wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is extremely thick when you pump it out. Some difficulty in applying and absorbing into the skin.  Facial skin feels heavy once the product dries. However it does tighten and \\&quot;fill\\&quot; the small wrinkles and lines.  I wish it were tinted because my skins looks pale once the moisturizer has dried. Easy to use and affordable.</li>
    <li> I read a few reviews and decided to check this stuff out. Nice, light, face cream, that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, isn&#x27;t shiny, and seems to help with the signs of aging - especially right around the eyes. Nice container that squeezes out just the right amount of cream. No more fussing with squeezing tubes. The price is very reasonable and offers good results. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m getting older, I think this cream is nice for the Summer months, but a little too light for the colder Winter months.</li>
    <li> As advertized. Good affordable product.</li>
    <li> without that much  smell. good for men</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing what it said.  Things are looking better, even getting noticed by friends.</li>
    <li> Its  an OK product....</li>
    <li> Good price on a product that at the very least does a great job of moisturizing.  As for the anti-wrinkle claim I can&#x27;t say anything positive or negative.  Makes your skin feel good all day long.</li>
    <li> Warning!! mislead product detail says with sunscreen but it does not have any. i think they are confusing this with another L&#x27;oreal product...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. doesn&#x27;t leave face feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Just got two bottles. Opened one of them, which smells like rusty metal, gosh! Not sure if the second one will be the same. But disappointed anyway.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work OK. Obviously, any moisturizer is helpful to aging facial and neck skin and I suppose this product is as good or better than many others. In order for it to actually penetrate the skin, your face must be not just clean, but abraded, so get a facial brush of some kind. On the down side, it has a strong, not very masculine fragrance. I could understand the developers at L&#x27;Oreal using this fragrance in a product marketed to over-sexed, insecure twenty something guys, but this is an anti-wrinkle and firming product meant for fifty and sixty year old men who have long ago decided what scent (if any) they wear, and at our age it&#x27;s probably not this one!</li>
    <li> My biggest issue with most moisturizers is the way they make my face shiny.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that.  It absorbs quickly and seems to keep my face moisturized all day.  It does have a very strong fragrance, however.  It dissipates within fifteen minutes of applying, so you don&#x27;t smell like it all day, but it is strong and noticeable upon application.  Some people might find it bothersome, but for me, having a shine free face is worth putting up with the fragrance for fifteen minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Moisturizer for a four years and really like it. Excellent work with my skin. Really recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this cream to my face on the morning, and about after 3hours, my face fells dry and white skin fragment appears.</li>
    <li> Many have commented previously, (like it or otherwise) the scent is something that is going to be first thing you will notice. My suspicion is they just repackaged the women&#x27;s version of their similar product with some minor modifications. Having said that it shouldn&#x27;t detract from what the product claims - and it is also less greasy than Neutrogena. Use sparingly and the smell will not be too much of an issue.</li>
    <li> great and great smell</li>
    <li> Smells so clean... Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I think it is expired or something. Remains white like jelly on the face ...</li>
    <li> No more wrinkles baby. A few drops of this stuff in the washer and my clothes come out wrinkle free, and they smell great too. Man the chicks dig me even more now dudes and dudettes.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well.  Wish it was less expensive.  Makes me look at least two to three weeks younger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M USED TO THIS KIND</li>
    <li> I have used other products with Pro-retinol - most recently a combination of face wash and face moisturizer from Neutrogena which the cleanser ended up too harsh on my face and I had no results with the moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using vitalift for about 4 years now and wash my face with L&#x27;Oreal Men&#x27;s Expert Power Clean Anti-Dullness Face Wash, Menthol, 5 oz.  Together with this combination, I&#x27;ve seen the best results.  Firmer and younger looking skin with no breakouts or blemishes.  I&#x27;m a male in my mid-40&#x27;s and have noticed a difference in lines under my eyes and wrinkles around the corners of my eyes.  The bottle lasts a long time too which is nice.  It does not burn or sting, but will at first daily application turn your face a little red and fades away quickly.  No problem putting this on as aftershave in the morning and walking out the door in the morning!</li>
    <li> husband likes it quite well</li>
    <li> Feeling and seeing a noticeable difference. I use this in the morning and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I tried goldbond, but this has a better effect on my face.</li>
    <li> This is the only aftershave cream I will buy. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and thankfully Amazon sellers have it at decent prices. It calms razer burn instantly; smooths out faint lines. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores; and smells great. You only need a very small dab of it and the bottle lasts one month with daily use. Get some now!</li>
    <li> I used this product daily for a few weeks, and I never noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so heavily perfumed/deodorized, you&#x27;ll smell like you slathered Speed Stick all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I need more words? OK: this moisturizer is terrible and your face will smell like your armpit.</li>
    <li> Blah blah........Blah blah blah</li>
    <li> Far cheaper at Amazon than in my CVS drug store. This is a great value.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a couple years, and it seems to help keep my skin looking good. I use it under my eyes before bed each night.</li>
    <li> I liked it because dont leave greasy like other lotions</li>
    <li> Great product, and I will certainly purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an FYI, a LITTLE bit does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use what you think is sufficient, then you will be replacing the product MUCH faster than what is necessary.</li>
    <li> This product is not your grandpa&#x27;s Goldbond. It works great as an aftershave. You will notice the difference in how your face looks on days when you don&#x27;t use this. I am 25 years old Caucasian male. It makes my skin look tighter and makes me appears more mature (slightly older). Its a good things because i have a baby face and women like a man with a chiseled face. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> It is very nice and cheap. My friend like it so much. He told me he would buy another one.</li>
    <li> NOTHING I&#x27;ve tried has come close to the outstanding results of this products.  I&#x27;ve tried other products and have has some success in stalling the ravages of time.  I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money to get only a fraction of the results I get with L&#x27;Oreal.  I feel that &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; and I know that is working.  I would HIGHLY recommend this to any man who isn&#x27;t going to take growing old without a fight</li>
    <li> Bought this product due to its great reviews. Hope to see the same results as others. I will be updating my review after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 2 weeks and I can see the smoothness on my forehead.</li>
    <li> rubs in nicely into your skin,no greasy residue...this is my new face lotion</li>
    <li> This stuff might work well, but I can&#x27;t tell because I&#x27;m so overwhelmed by the perfume! Just a tiny drop and it&#x27;s the only thing I can smell for hours. And it&#x27;s a heavy cheap cologne smell, so even worse. Terrible.</li>
    <li> Great product good seller no problems</li>
    <li> As we all get older, we all get wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t expect to remove them all but hiding one or two, makes us all feel better.  I only use one a day and I can see the difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this skin care for more than 3 years, and I like it. It is not oily, also it helps with sun protection.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells really bad. it smells like cheep perfume. Why would someone want a strong smelling face lotion.  Also made my face turn red for some reason. Ive never had that reaction before.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased, skin is looking hydrated and firming wrinkles. I will buy this product again. Smells great. Non greasy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
    <li> My husband is not one to use face creams. I&#x27;m pretty sure I bought him the first container of this because it was on clearance somewhere, but lo and behold he used it up and asked for more. In two decades of knowing the man this is the first time he has asked for more of this type of product. He was very pleased that I could find it here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> It was amazing. Kept my face clean clear and moistened the whole summer.</li>
    <li> Verdict still out on this product since it takes time.</li>
    <li> i love it and the price is cheaper,i will buy it next time,i wish the shipper will be faster next time.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve used this product and I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase, highly recommend this skin care product for men.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t rate personal care products and this is one of those off times that I do and I should say this one does work fairly well, has a good fragrance and feels tight on the skin. Others from Nivea I&#x27;ve tried tend to be a bit more greasy...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this produce for years.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t smell. It&#x27;s not perfumed. One pump is enough for my whole face. I actually had someone at work ask what I was doing different because my skin looked so good.</li>
    <li> I hit 46 this year so I decided I had better take a little care of my face. In my search for a moisturizer and sunscreen I found L&#x27;Oreal Men&#x27;s Expert Vita Lift Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Firming Moisturizer. While it says non-sticky on the box, it felt very sticky even an hour after putting it on plus you feel like something is covering your face. One reviewer mentioned that it had no fragrance. It does and is listed in the ingredients. It has a very flowery smell that is not for me. I am wondering if this is simply something from the woman&#x27;s product line repackaged for men?</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years. If I use any other brand or no lotion at all my face brakes out into itchy red patches around my nose and eye brows. This does not substitute medication if you have issues but dramatically decreases the need to us meds.</li>
    <li> i use this product for several years, this product really take effect. especially this one, when you use in the winter it will help you feel smooth and comfortable</li>
    <li> Has an unpleasant scent that lingers. Can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of the product as I&#x27;m not willing to apply it and leave the house due to the smell. Products such as this should be fragrance-free...not everyone wants to smell like their grandfather&#x27;s aftershave all day.</li>
    <li> I have bought this before.  Must be good if I purchased it several times prior.  I never know if the store I usually shop will have it in stock.  This took the guesswork out of that.  Glad I got it from amazon.</li>
    <li> Reaching my 40&#x27;s and I never really took care of my face so decided to start once I started seeing some slight wrinkles which were never there before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a very strong perfume smell, smells like cheap designer imposter cologne.  I only put this on at night so that doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.  What did bother me was the fact that this lotion does NOT go on smoothly.  You smooth it on your face and if you rub too much it starts clumping and then you start to have little clumped up flakes of lotion all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use up the bottle but will not buy this again.  For mornings, I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Age Shield which I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used an entire bottle one and I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable wrinkle reduction or firming.  It&#x27;s lightweight and quick-absorbing, but does not offer sun protection which pretty much any facial moisturizer should have IMHO.  There are better options for a regular men&#x27;s face lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I only wish the container held more! My skin feels great and certainly looks better when I use this on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> The product is great; but do not order from Star Lisa; they are actually in Asia and it took almost 2 months to receive the package.  A total waste.  Stay away from this retailer.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have loved the results. I don&#x27;t know if they altered the formula, or added something to it, but I now find that it now irritates my eyes. Obviously, some of the lotion must be finding it&#x27;s way into my eyes. But, that has always happened without theirritation. I am going to search for a different product. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Quite honestly, my expectations were based on L&#x27;Oreal brand name.&lt;br /&gt;The down side of this product:&lt;br /&gt;-Sticky and slowly adsorbed by your skin&lt;br /&gt;-Smell is quite weird more like chemicals&lt;br /&gt;-It melts under the sun&lt;br /&gt;The plus side of this product:&lt;br /&gt;-Delivers fast enough gas promised by he vendor&lt;br /&gt;-Packaging is safe and carefully protected&lt;br /&gt;-Price wise is low and reasonable for your budget</li>
    <li> I have been told I have great skin for my age 57, but I felt like I would like to try some cream to moisturize and this is great. Very little oder. but pleasant. The biggest like is it is very smooth and non greasy. It just fells great and so far my face feels great and firmer. I suggest this product for a mans first try.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I didn&#x27;t want to look like an old man. I stopped using this product because I didn&#x27;t want to smell like an old man. I recommend using [[ASIN:B000NWBQ5S Neutrogena For Men Age FIghter Face Moisture ~1.4 Fl Oz]] instead.</li>
    <li> I tried this product a few months ago because I have stress \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; on my forehead. I&#x27;m only about 25 years old, and they aren&#x27;t that bad, but they still bugged me.  Over the past few months I saw the lines on my forehead slowly start to fade away, and it also did wonders on my face after I shaved.  I used to have minor acne before using this product, but that, as wells as razor burn is no more.  I use it once a day after I shave, but it does recommend using it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Good, I like this item, i will buy more if i need more. It worth to buy more of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 yrs young. Makes my face look &amp; feel better !!, I have to use it everyday or it won&#x27;t keep working.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than what I paid for similar products in my local chain drug store. I just needed a good brand that will help keep my  youthful over 50 looking face looking good.  I wish it had greater SPF for my trips to equatorial countries.. but I&#x27;ll just add a bit more sunblock then.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Nice pleasant scent, shipped fast, the only gripe I have is that there&#x27;s no SPF.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best facial moisturizer on the market, at least the best within my budget. I have sensitive, dry skin that is prone to acne. This moisturizer does not aggravate my acne AT ALL. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It goes on smooth without being greasy. Best of all, it makes me look a few years younger, which is never a bad thing. My only complaint is that there isn&#x27;t more in the bottle - not really complaint, considering it just means I want more product!</li>
    <li> A fantastic product and great with a lot of potential.  Certainly does wonders for an after shave or night time application.  My husband loves it and recommends it highly - no one believes his age!  This product is actually cheaper than the comparable ladies product so the ladies might want to try it also.</li>
    <li> I liked it but I am not sure if it making a difference on my face</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles with this, however, I also didn&#x27;t expect the product to be a white lotion.  This wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal, except that even though I thoroughly rubbed in the product, it reappeared with various white patches later on in the day.  Not good.  If this was more of a translucent product, it may be better.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> The best men&#x27;s face cream I ever used. more effective in cold weather.</li>
    <li> Have used this produc over one year and my skin on the face has tighten up and most of my wrinkles have asmoothed out.  The price from Amazon is great too!</li>
    <li> Does not work- get the Avon anew. Instant results !</li>
    <li> Different from before I bought, it is not easy to be absorbed by the skin, and always appear peeling phenomenon.</li>
    <li> Dry very fast and perfect moist...</li>
    <li> I use this every once in a while and I&#x27;m not sure that it really does anything other than make your forehead shinier.  I think I would suggest instead of using this product for you to just drink a lot of water and keep yourself hydrated.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I had a reaction to this product after just 2 uses and had to stop immediately. I&#x27;ll never know whether it works or not, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve had that happen. Not expected from a L&#x27;Oreal product.</li>
    <li> It works. Take a photo of yourself, put this stuff on and take another photo. You will be surprised.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, don&#x27;t like smell.</li>
    <li> I think overall this is a good product but it is kind of oily to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if anyone is trying to buy something that moisturize your skin but not too much oil,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this will not satisfy you too much.</li>
    <li> Mediocre product, also seemed to run out very quickly.  Other brands have similar products for around the same price point that I have found to be more effective.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin, and after washing my face, it gets really dry. This can actually make your acne worse. But I use this moisturizer everytime after washing my face, and I noticed it keeps my face well moisturizer all day and night. It also helps in my skin texture and I now have much less acne also.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little stong when you put it on, but it dissipates quickly. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find online.</li>
    <li> I could feel the difference right away.three days after starting to use,my wife commented on how face face looked different.less wrinkles.I didn&#x27;t tell her I had purchased this.Lasts all day.not expensive and who doesn&#x27;t want to look younger &amp; better ?</li>
    <li> I use a C-Pap machine at night and it leaves me with horrible lines in the morning just a few dabs of vitalift and there gone plus it has really helped firm up my facial skin, I never thought I would be using face cream but I had to do something all the girls at work had comments on my face lines so i saw this on the shelf at the commisary, So I said well lets see and WOW I was amazed. the container lasted about 6 months using it once a day so when I ran out I looked to the local chain drugstores for more. No where to be found and when i asked the sales girl&#x27;s what it was I needed they looked at me like I had grown a second head,It is without a doubt a great product for men Just get over it and use it.</li>
    <li> My face looked different after two days of use.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face cream.  I can&#x27;t live without it.  Okay, I could live without it but I would really rather not.  So there!</li>
    <li> Worked well and I could see a difference towards the end. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Not bad, it looks new, as same as the picture, and the price is as good as I bought before.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this skin product for many years. The formula serves multiple purposes. It serves as a good after-shave balm. I also apply the skin lotion before sleeping. It refreshes the skin very well.</li>
    <li> i like this face cream, keeps my face soft all day. I highly recommend it, although wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
    <li> I did not realized that the price was high compared to the Bed Bath and Beyond. . . . .</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found for men&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I picked 5 stars because this is a lot of product packed into one tiny can. I use it twice daily and it lasts 3-5 months. Skin is tighter, feels softer and it wears well.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate and need extra moisturizers to keep my skin healthy.  I have tried various other products design for men which are cheaper, and some that are more expensive.  For me, L&#x27;Oreal makes a great product that does not clog my pores and cause blackheads or bumps on my face like the others.  I recommend this product for men with dry skin and especially for those who are outdoors for long periods of time in the sun.</li>
    <li> smell really bad ,&lt;br /&gt;it may have right ingredient , but smell bad&lt;br /&gt;I used it only once and I throw it in trash .</li>
    <li> Havent noticed anything outstanding yet, but overall a good product</li>
    <li> The stuff really works. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews that call this cream greasy and having a strong odor. It has a mild and pleasant odor and is not greasy at all. I used Nivea after shave balm for years and that had a much stronger odor and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well. I can only assume that these bad reviews are actually for a different product which seems to happen on Amazon quite frequently. Give this a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Started using the Vita Anti-Wrinkle around June 2012 in preparation for my daughter&#x27;s wedding.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I know. But at 47 and not wanting to ruin her pictures, I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say here in February 2014 I&#x27;m still a fan and the results are good. I&#x27;m not looking like a 25 year-old again, but it&#x27;s doing what I expect and that&#x27;s all I ask!</li>
    <li> Outdoor activities like sailing and bicycling can leave my face sunburned and wind-burned.  A moisturizer with built-in SPF is first line defense against skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because:&lt;br /&gt;It is a moisturizer and has built in SPF&lt;br /&gt;It has little to no fragrance&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes if I sweat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like it because:&lt;br /&gt;It relies on a lot of chemicals with unpronounceable names&lt;br /&gt;It is very overpackaged:  A plastic pump can, a plastic lid, a security seal, a cardboard box.  The only thing that is recyclable is the cardboard.  All the rest is nonrecyclable plastic.  I weighed the nonrecyclable packaging: far heavier than the product itself.  The product lasts about 1 month, so each month several ounces of &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; trash ends up in the landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably switch to a Neutrogena product that comes in a simple tube, possibly Neutrogena Men Age Fighter.</li>
    <li> My husband is seventy years old and is often mistaken for someone twenty years younger. Is that a recommendation? He uses it faithfully now!</li>
    <li> This is a great Mens face lotion.  It makes the skin on my face smooth and soft.  I always feel better after putting it on in the morning.  There is a very slight scent to it that I can only smell while putting it on.  It&#x27;s not strong enough for anyone else to smell post application.  I&#x27;ve never had it run into my eyes and cause irritation when I&#x27;ve sweat or gone swimming after use.</li>
    <li> I tried this creme hoping to help my dry skin and help firm it up a bit.  after a week of use I could already feel my skin felt better and looked better (not dramatic, but I could see it).  However I noticed after the first day my eyes were burning badly.  At first I thought I was just experiencing bad eye strain as my work requires looking at monitors for a good portion of the day.  I used eye drops to help alleviate the burning, but it did not work.  By the 2nd week I decided to stop using the creme thinking it may be causing the eye pains (even though I am extremely careful when applying it, and never got it in my eyes).  Within 24 hours my eyes felt back to normal.  Just to test and insure it was indeed the creme causing this, I applied it one last time yesterday.  Sure enough within a few hours my eyes were burning.  I have never experience eye pain from a moisturizer or facial product before.  So be mindful of this when trying it.</li>
    <li> Very good Moisturizer. It&#x27;s smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1- Doesn&#x27;t make your face shiny.&lt;br /&gt;2- Good scent.&lt;br /&gt;3- Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;4- Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;1- I did not notice any firming or wrinkles reduction. However, I must say though that I just tried one bottle. I&#x27;m 37 with very little wrinkles on my forehead and I did not see any difference after finishing one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still bu this product again, but now I&#x27;m going to try something else for comparison.</li>
    <li> Smells faintly of engine oil.  Not using because of it.</li>
    <li> I have never had a slight misunderstanding resolved so quickly, effectively, and forcefully.&lt;br /&gt;Even though i didn&#x27;t feel like dealin&#x27; with it, Julie&#x27;s insisted , and i&#x27;ts now all good</li>
    <li> Great Product!. Excellent work with my skin. Really recommend it! Is easily absorbed and it don&#x27;t left greasy the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for well over six years now.  I highly, highly recommend it!  I&#x27;m in my early thirties, so I cannot say much about reversing the aging process, but I do say it is wonderful when it comes to preventive measures and defense against normal wear-and-tear.  Other reviews mention a strong odor, but it does dissipate quickly and doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.  Your skin will noticeably appear firmer and healthier after just a few days.  I suggest getting the SPF version with pro-retinol.  As I do shave my head bald on a regular basis, I apply to my scalp as well daily to defend against damage but the sun.  This is more expense that other mens facial moisturizers out there, but worth the extra expense</li>
    <li> I buy some expensive stuff, but this is my back up for a quick refresher. Based upon the ingredients, I&#x27;ve a feeling it&#x27;s doing the exact same thing is my other products. It&#x27;s got a terrific refreshing masculine smell, and goes on really nicely. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion as i have tried many !</li>
    <li> why is that smell... and it is pretty strong...</li>
    <li> A friend who spent the weekend before going back North, left this behind.  My lady friend decided to try it...  She says it works and now I buy them for her.</li>
    <li> Fabulous even for women&#x27;s skin - fresh scent and really works to tighten things up! I hope I can continue to find it on Amazon, as it&#x27;s hard to get otherwise...</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t effective as described</li>
    <li> First time using this product and I was very skeptical since I can not stand the feeling of oily skin.  However, very surprised with the after effect that my skin remains mostly dry and there&#x27;s no residue oily feeling after apply thins product.  According to the description it has to be applied twice a day and after 4 weeks I should see some results.  However, I think this small bottle may only last 4 weeks or less.  I will provide an update later once I go through this bottle.</li>
    <li> I am used to using higher priced \\&quot;designer\\&quot; series balms, such as The Gentlemens Refinery, etc.  I was reading on badger and blade somewhere about the Loreal for men line of products and last week I picked some of this up along with another brand.  My skin got irritated from the other brand but this, just amazing.  Use it for just 3 days and you will notice the difference both by touch and look.  Tonight, I just picked up the Loreal for men after shave balm (double the size bottle for a 1/3 less in price) but the balm appears to be slightly different and although I am only one application into it, I think the Vita lift is going to be the best thing.  I just looked to see if it is sold by Amazon in a 3 pack, I would stock up, but they don&#x27;t.  Target sells this for 9.39 so it looks like I will be stock pilling some just in case it should ever be discontinued. Loreal Vita Lift is the best thing on the market at any price point from what I have seen.</li>
    <li> More than halfway done with the bottle and the results are okay. Didn&#x27;t see any dramatic changes, but it does keep my face moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and really like it.  I use it mainly in the morning after shaving and for me it is soothing and absorbs quickly and completely.  I can&#x27;t really say that it has reduced my wrinkles or firmed my face because I never did a before and after picture.  I just know it works well for me.  I also never get the SPF version.  Can&#x27;t stand it.  Smells horrible, and feels just like your putting on suntan lotion.  Not what I want in a aftershave / moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a bit pricey.  I&#x27;ve found it for $10.00 but for 1.6 ounces even that value is marginal.  I keep paying because it works.  A little advice, don&#x27;t use a \\&quot;full\\&quot; pump each time.  It is pretty thick stuff.  I find that doing half a pump, then adding 4-5 drops of water from the sink before spreading between my hands to be applied works great.  It makes the bottle go farther, and doesn&#x27;t feel as thick on the face.  Just my two cents.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer for everyday use !</li>
    <li> Great value for the price !</li>
    <li> New version does not include SPF and it changed the texture slightly. They messed with a great product.</li>
    <li> Used to be good, reformulated with cheaper ingredients, now have some eye irritation.  Especial if sweating and rubbing face/eye at work or play.</li>
    <li> works well and at a good price.</li>
    <li> This cream has a very strong smell, some of the reviewers here don&#x27;t think so , but I am very sensitive to this smell . other than that , its doing its job. I only used it once since I bought it,</li>
    <li> Eh...I still look old and wrinkly. Might tighten crows feet a bit...but it&#x27;s a slight bit if it does. There is better stuff out there I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference at all after a month of using it. Garbage to me.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he hates it.  It flakes after drying on his skin, so I ended up using it as hand lotion.  I wouldnt recomment.</li>
    <li> My guy loves the non-greasy yet ultra moisturizing effect of this brand. He also says he loves the scent. I enjoy it too because it&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t smell like cologne. It&#x27;s a bit hard to find in stores for some reason so we get it here on Amazon. He likes the scent so much more than other male-geared products that he won&#x27;t settle for anything else that he can find on store shelves.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. The best that I have found yet. Never leaves your face shiny or oily.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin look really good. I look like I had a great night sleep. It doesn&#x27;t streak white and disappears quickly and it doesn&#x27;t make your face shiny. I like the scent and it&#x27;s very affordable. I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
    <li> Tried a lot of products over the years and this is (by far) my favorite. Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t cause acne breakouts, great scent, and makes my skin look great.  A little goes a long way and use it everyday on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> They are great, after a long day at work, my face feels so tired, this stuff works just great. I hope they can do something with the fragrance tho. It takes time for it to disappear.</li>
</ol>
