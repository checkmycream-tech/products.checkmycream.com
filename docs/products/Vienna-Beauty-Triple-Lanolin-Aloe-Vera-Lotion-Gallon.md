      <li>I was overly excited.  </li>
      <li>It was love at first use.  </li>

      <li>and it is the best, especially for dry skin.</li>
      <li>The fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>It is our go-to lotion for sunburns, and heals them amazingly quickly - just slather it on at the first opportunity, and again before bed.</li>
      <li>I first discovered it in the nail salons and found that I could purchase it at beauty supply stores and then Amazon.</li>

      <li>I no longer buy 5 he professional size bottles anymore - i buy by the gallon.</li>
      <li>None of us are fond of the smell as other reviewers seem to be, hence the &amp;#34;stinky lotion&amp;#34; appellation, but we all go for it at the first sign of sunburn!</li>
      <li>I mix almond oil in with it to really help with my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>And here is a sentence from a medical journal  &amp;#34;Mineral oil —a common ingredient in many kinds of lotions—</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have eczema and this is the only product I can use on my skin.  Love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Our family refers to this lotion as &amp;#34;magic lotion&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;stinky lotion&amp;#34; depending on our mood. It is our go-to lotion for sunburns, and heals them amazingly quickly - just slather it on at the first opportunity, and again before bed. None of us are fond of the smell as other reviewers seem to be, hence the &amp;#34;stinky lotion&amp;#34; appellation, but we all go for it at the first sign of sunburn!</li>
    <li> Sent quickly and as described</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion and speedy delivery</li>

It&#x27;s non-greasy and it makes your skin feel so smooth and touchable.  I no longer buy 5 he professional size bottles anymore - i buy by the gallon.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion and works well as after shower skin revitalizer. This a good product for year around use.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever light clean scent and best lightweight moiturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
    <li> Great lotion at a reasonable price.  We live in a dry climate and rely on it pretty heavily.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and really relieves the chapped hands and skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years and love it.  It keeps your skin moist but not greasy.  It is the best ever.  It also seems to heal any scratches and irritation quickly.  I&#x27;ve used many different lotions but this is the only one I like and use.</li>
    <li> It is a great base for the Massage lotion/oil combo that I use in my deep tissue- therapeutic massage work.  I was very disappointed in that both gallon containers that I received had leaked into the box and I lost a substantial amount of product into the packing material.  It seemed that it was from nothing more than the lids were loose !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good.  It feels great,smells great and does it&#x27;s job. When you start to age your skin starts to dry out and flake so this works well with the hands, arms and legs.  I&#x27;ve been using this for many years.  I like to save a buck here and there so I purchased this gallon size and bought a gallon pump for it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand &amp; body lotion I have found, it softens our skin, even feet, it smells fresh &amp; it is not greasy (unless you apply too much). We have been using this for about 5 years or more &amp; we will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Once again I&#x27;m thrilled to find a product I love and have used for years here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Whole family has been using triple lanolin for about 5 years.  The local store does not carry the gallon size anymore, so found it online.  We mix it with some baby oil to make it last longer. Great product.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever.  I have tried all others and this is the one.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price</li>
    <li> I loved the feel of this lotion when, after it arrived, I tried it out on my skin.  Then, luckily, I read the ingredients.  I wish I had done that before I bought this huge bottle!  The third ingredient, after water and aloe vera gel, is Mineral Oil, a known carcinogen.  This is not hype: there are scientific studies out there with results to document this.  And here is a sentence from a medical journal  &amp;#34;Mineral oil —a common ingredient in many kinds of lotions— has been linked to at least 23 diseases, including autoimmune disorders and a number of different cancers&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using this lotion, and I hope you make an informed decision before you put this on your skin.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years.  I have very sensitive, dry eczema skin.  This lotion is really cost-effective in terms of how it works to moisturize skin.  It smells great and has a nice texture.  I mix almond oil in with it to really help with my dry skin.  Love it.  Have it all around the house by the hand soaps in the bathrooms and kitchen.</li>
    <li> Hey it came on time but the box was full of lotion because de gallon was broken, let me know what to do, I took some pictures if you need it</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found. My hands chap and bleed in winter and this usually clears it up overnight. It&#x27;s hard to find in regular stores so it was totally worth buying the huge one here.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion.  I can no longer get it at my local Sally&#x27;s because the gallon is discontinued so when I saw that I could get it here I was overly excited.  I will not use any other lotion!</li>
    <li> best lotion does not dry skin out like perfumey lotions do!!! been using it for over 15 years</li>
    <li> I tried many lotions to help with my dry skin so far this has been the best, used it on my hands and feet</li>
    <li> very good service.. keep up the good work. I really like this lotion. Only wish it were less expensive. plan to order more</li>
    <li> Happy I found this! This lotion is the BEST! Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I love that I can get this in Bulk. Thank you!Great product and always consistant.  Do not change your product.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion. A bit on the heavy side but that&#x27;s what I like.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Not much more I can say.  I first discovered it in the nail salons and found that I could purchase it at beauty supply stores and then Amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife has been buying this product for many years.  She feels it makes her (&amp; my) skin softer than anything she&#x27;s tried.  Now, her supplier is not handling it any more.  Thankfully, we found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past but this is my first time ordering through AMAZON.  The delivery came as stated and I was very happy.  Now I have to hide it from my 21-year old son!</li>
