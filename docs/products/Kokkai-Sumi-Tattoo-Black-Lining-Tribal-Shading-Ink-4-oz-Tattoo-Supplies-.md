      <li>Inow have several tattoos with this ink and am very pleased with it!</li>
      <li>I bought these for a friend of mine to help out with his tattoo business,he was really surprised &amp; loved that I did this for him.</li>
      <li>im sure this ink is good for some things.like grey wash.but its like water.so</li>
      <li>I think it was Ur batch because mine is good consistency nice dark lines with one pass</li>
      <li>I wouldnt call it grey wash,but its a great 1st ink for layered shading.</li>
      <li>The ink is good, but my last 2 orders never made it.</li>
      <li>Once the ink finally came it was really good ink c:</li>
      <li>but not a bad ink or buy</li>
      <li>the only thing is i wish it had an expiration date on it, the bottle only say once opened best quality in the year.</li>
      <li>I used this product for the very first time</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go in easy and doesn&#x27;t show up very well...waste of money...</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve had blacker kuro sumi is my first choice always!</li>
      <li>This ink is not the best for outlining because it smudges way to much and is hard to wipe off.</li>
      <li>worth buying and haveing for your owen collection</li>
      <li>well worth the money</li>
      <li>works great though and still black and hasnt turned blue like most blacks i have bought before .</li>
      <li>but its really good for shading its not as dark as the discription says</li>
      <li>She hasn&#x27;t gotten it yet but am sure she will be glad to get this large bottle of black ink.</li>
      <li>First off, I had to get another squeeze bottle to pour this in because it doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle...</li>
      <li>and I personally like Kuro Sumi Ink much better.</li>
      <li>It would probably work better for solid fill ins rather than outlining.</li>
      <li>Will definately purchase more when I run low!</li>
      <li>This is a really good black!</li>
      <li>Pretty decent ink.</li>
      <li>This ink is nice and dark!</li>
      <li>The ink lays and heals up very well.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Straight garbage.</li>
      <li>Other than not being as dark as I would like the product works great.</li>
      <li>it makes the tattoos dark and comes out really clean after they heal they still look fresh</li>
      <li>This is real good ink I haven&#x27;t seen or heard anything bad yet.</li>
      <li>as far as the ink it works the bottle had ink all over it it came fast</li>
      <li>He is leaving the top off for a few hours to let some of the water evaporate from the ink before sterilization hoping that will help.</li>
      <li>my tat turned out great very dark black...</li>
      <li>this ink packs a nice deep black line.</li>
      <li>my bottle of ink was a little thicker then my other black ink it works good for me goes on nice and dark</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great but just a little thin</li>
      <li>its a little thin but does a great job.  </li>
      <li>I am planning on ordering all the colored inks you have here in the near future.</li>
      <li>The only black ink ill use and ive ben tattooing for 19 yrs hands down best ink</li>
      <li>I agree with the others just black water its my first and last purchase.</li>
      <li>He used it on me and him first before trying on a few customers .</li>
      <li>but over all i was not a fan of the ink very watered down.</li>
