      <li>This product is used to basically peel off the top layer of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>sure when intially using any Obagi product not to expect results for many weeks.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you stick with the regimen and</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>what more can I say?</li>
      <li>I always love this brand</li>
      <li>Love this product, my skin looks fantastic!</li>
      <li>The product takes time to work and be sure to wait 10 minutes or so after washing your face or showering before applying any Obagi product.  </li>
      <li>I love using this product, it cleans my skin of dirt and oil and my face feels clean , refreshed and radiant.</li>
      <li>It IS an extremely strong product.</li>
      <li>I started using and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>The bottle was filled with Cetaphil (or some unscented cheap-o drugstore lotion).</li>
      <li>works well, pricey, but helps smooth complexion.  </li>
      <li>and it was fantastic.  </li>
      <li>i love these products the elastiderm tightens up skin under your eyes and gets rid of discoloration the skincare products clear up any blemishes and leaves a nice tone to your kin</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and a much better price than what I was paying.  </li>
      <li>I was scared to use this product once I noticed that it was not the original packaging.</li>
      <li>It is wxpensive but worth it!</li>
      <li>Give it a try, it is worth it!</li>
      <li>The results are worth the effort.  </li>
      <li>have used the Obagi Nu-Derm protocol for more than 10 years, but have always used this product as part of a total regimen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best facial products I have ever used, but it isn&#x27;t for those who can&#x27;t tolerate a beet red face and peeling skin for several weeks of continuing use.  </li>
      <li>It was most definitely NOT the real Exfoderm Forte, a product that I&#x27;ve been using for years</li>
      <li>I had only mild redness when I first started, but none now!</li>
      <li>Love the feel of fresh skin after the peeling of dead skin</li>
      <li>so I know how the real product smells, feels in my hands, etc.</li>
      <li>It helps my skin stay soft and definitely helps the fine lines as well as soften frown lines.  </li>
      <li>It was so obviously not the real product, I had to laugh.</li>
      <li>This is the classic Obagi Exfoderm product - it is NOT a scrub - it is a cream that you apply as part of the Obagi Nu-Derm regime.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t even have to open the bottle, I knew right away that it was really obagi.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the whole line of Obagi skin care to treat my melasma (Foaming gel wash, toner, #3 clear, #4 exfoderm, #5 blender and sunscreen).  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for about seven years, and after the first couple of weeks, my melasma was barely noticeable...</li>
      <li>Most individuals that use this as part of the Obagi system, go for microdermabasion after to get the dead skin off.</li>
      <li>This is too strong for me, I need to go back to the regular Exfoderm.  </li>
      <li>I decided to give this product I bought here the benefit of the doubt and used it every day as I normally do for nearly two weeks.</li>
      <li>So far I have used it daily but not noticing much exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>(Step 1); the Toner (Step 2); CLEAR (Step 3) and Exforderm or Exfoderm Forte (Step 4).  </li>
      <li>The Obagi skin care line FAR exceeds any skin care product I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I think the product was old....</li>
      <li>Try it the complete set</li>
      <li>and you may have redness or sensitive skin for a while even days.</li>
      <li>Do not be surprised if you actually look older as your skin is drying up for it to start peeling.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m female, 56 yrs old</li>
      <li>I had adult acne, uneven skin tone and really oily skin.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as previous bottles that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>

<li> I had used it in the past as part of a set</li>
<li> I had no idea it could be purchased online much less from Amazon!!!</li>
<li> I need to use it only twice a year, so I don&#x27;t have to tolerate this nasty appearance for very long.  </li>
<li> Just be patient and tough it out.</li>
<li> You can never go wrong with Obagi!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using the Obagi system for two years and my skin is in the best shape ever.  Great products!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Obagi skin care regimen for years and am on maintenance at this point.  So for me it comes down to price when I shop for my maintenance products.  This product is Obagi, I just wish I could get the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;blender&amp;#34; on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I love using this product, it cleans my skin of dirt and oil and my face feels clean , refreshed and radiant.</li>
    <li> I have bee using this for years. I see a difference every time I use it. I would tell everyone about it.</li>
    <li> No instructions for the user...terrible waste of money. That&#x27;s my opinion. Don&#x27;t want to write anymore negatives but Amazon is asking for more...</li>
    <li> I loved the product as well as seller! You can never go wrong with Obagi! It is wxpensive but worth it!</li>
    <li> As always, I have great faith in the Obagi products.</li>
    <li> I was scared to use this product once I noticed that it was not the original packaging. This is a replica of the cream. I started using and it works just fine. I will buy again but it must be the manufactured product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years. It&#x27;s the only cream that helps, with my Hyper-pigmentation</li>
    <li> The wife loves this stuff, and you can&#x27;t always buy it locally.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Obagi system for several years now.  It&#x27;s one of the best facial products I have ever used, but it isn&#x27;t for those who can&#x27;t tolerate a beet red face and peeling skin for several weeks of continuing use.  I need to use it only twice a year, so I don&#x27;t have to tolerate this nasty appearance for very long.  The results are worth the effort.  You need to use the 5 step system, including prescription retinol.  Steps 1 and 2 can be substituted with inexpensive drugstore products, but not the other three.  Just be patient and tough it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi for 3 years &amp; love it! I&#x27;ve driven 35 miles every 6-7 weeks to get it from a doctors office. I had no idea it could be purchased online much less from Amazon!!! Obagi Nu Derm system is fantastic &amp; does great things for your skin. I really do get comments quite often that I have great skin!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and a much better price than what I was paying.  I will be ordering other Obagi products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and its great. No more acne problems if you use the whole system.</li>
    <li> I think the product was old.... It smelled like mayonnaise.</li>
    <li> This is too strong for me, I need to go back to the regular Exfoderm.  My skin did not like this at all, I am currently using the&lt;br /&gt;whole Nu-Derm system.</li>
    <li> Great product for exfoliating your skin.  Follow the steps and it will do the rest for your skin.  I would continue using this product.</li>
    <li> The Obagi skin care line FAR exceeds any skin care product I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using Obagi 1,2,3,4, and 6  for  roughly 15 years and it&#x27;s amazing.  I started using it when I needed a prescription from my dermatologist.  Keeps my skin looking younger and #4 just tightens up those por&#x27;s and discolorations every morning for me.  I use #4 with the sun block #6 applied on top of #4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure when intially using any Obagi product not to expect results for many weeks.  The product takes time to work and be sure to wait 10 minutes or so after washing your face or showering before applying any Obagi product.  If you apply it too soon, it&#x27;s rougher on your skin and you may have redness or sensitive skin for a while even days.</li>
    <li> It basically provided no results. Don&#x27;t waste your money, for it doesn&#x27;t provide significance change. Very disappointed, save your money for somethking better</li>
    <li> The consistency was not the same as I already had bought it from my Doctor.</li>
    <li> Works well with all the other Obagi line!! I am a repeat customer! I had only mild redness when I first started, but none now!</li>
    <li> i love these products the elastiderm tightens up skin under your eyes and gets rid of discoloration the skincare products clear up any blemishes and leaves a nice tone to your kin</li>
    <li> Great price.  I have been using this item for quite some time.</li>
    <li> Love this product, my skin looks fantastic! I am hooked and will definitely buy again! Give it a try, it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I received this item very quick and I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The bottle was filled with Cetaphil (or some unscented cheap-o drugstore lotion). It was most definitely NOT the real Exfoderm Forte, a product that I&#x27;ve been using for years so I know how the real product smells, feels in my hands, etc. I decided to give this product I bought here the benefit of the doubt and used it every day as I normally do for nearly two weeks. It was so obviously not the real product, I had to laugh. I don&#x27;t know if the seller knows that they&#x27;ve got some fakes in their inventory or not, but whatever...I learned my lesson - don&#x27;t buy Obagi from people on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as previous bottles that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  Not sure this is the real thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years. People compliment me on my skin. And I&#x27;m almost 60!</li>
    <li> Cream definitely works. Takes a while. Give it about 1-2 months for people to start noticing the change. Just make sure you stick with the regimen and your face will become a delight to you and to others.</li>
    <li> having that pimple that wont go anywhere no head and it hurts? you put this on for a couple of days and it comes to head just to me removed and vanished</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the whole line of Obagi skin care to treat my melasma (Foaming gel wash, toner, #3 clear, #4 exfoderm, #5 blender and sunscreen).  I have been using it for about seven years, and after the first couple of weeks, my melasma was barely noticeable...now it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> The name is misleading. This is the classic Obagi Exfoderm product - it is NOT a scrub - it is a cream that you apply as part of the Obagi Nu-Derm regime.  It is step 4, which you apply only in the morning, after you use the Cleansing Lotion (Step 1); the Toner (Step 2); CLEAR (Step 3) and Exforderm or Exfoderm Forte (Step 4).  This product is used to basically peel off the top layer of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Obagi Nu-Derm protocol for more than 10 years, but have always used this product as part of a total regimen. I have no idea what it would do if used alone.  It IS an extremely strong product. Do not be surprised if you actually look older as your skin is drying up for it to start peeling. Most individuals that use this as part of the Obagi system, go for microdermabasion after to get the dead skin off.</li>
    <li> So far I have used it daily but not noticing much exfoliation.  I had used it in the past as part of a set and it was fantastic.  Maybe the product has to be used in conjunction with its other products for effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I always love this brand and i believe everyone should use Obagi! Try it the complete set and you will be happy about it!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of fresh skin after the peeling of dead skin</li>
    <li> I love them. Thank you</li>
    <li> I use this all the time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi Nuderm system for over a year. I had adult acne, uneven skin tone and really oily skin. Nuderm, recommended by my dermatologist, gave me beautiful skin again, better than it&#x27;s been since childhood....what more can I say?</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have been using Obagi NuDerm system for 4 years.  It helps my skin stay soft and definitely helps the fine lines as well as soften frown lines.  Stopped it for 3 months and saw a difference.  Amazon has the best prices.</li>
    <li> They warned me about buying products on amazon and I learned my lesson. I purchased Obagi Exfoderm Forte and I didn&#x27;t even have to open the bottle, I knew right away that it was really obagi.</li>
    <li> works well, pricey, but helps smooth complexion.  i&#x27;m female, 56 yrs old and I use it with other obagi products (cleanser, skin lightener, balancer</li>
