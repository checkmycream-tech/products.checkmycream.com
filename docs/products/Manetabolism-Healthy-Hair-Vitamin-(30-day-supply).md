      <li>and I can truthfully say nothing worked.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with.</li>
      <li>I ordered a two-month supply with my first order, which I am so glad I did; with these kind of results I don&#x27;t want to have to wait for another bottle to arrive!</li>
      <li>I also follow all of courtney&#x27;s hair regiments on top of taking the pills which includes homemade DC and scalp massage with her oil blends...</li>
      <li>for me, they were clearer, more radiant skin, stronger and longer nails and increased energy.</li>
      <li>SO glad that I ordered two bottles at a time.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product!</li>
      <li>These, however, seem to work even better).</li>
      <li>I will be ording her some more soon.</li>
      <li>she love it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure whether it was from my BC or the vitamins but either way, stick it out if you do get breakouts...</li>
      <li>I have 3 more bottles to go</li>
      <li>And no nasty taste either.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happily satisfied.</li>
      <li>Ordering more</li>
      <li>Better than hairinfinity and biotin alone.</li>
      <li>so I was determined to find products that would lead to healthy hair.</li>
      <li>But I still love these pills</li>
      <li>(ALTHOUGH THAT CAN BE A PLUS :) ), I was on the hunt for stronger hair .</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I was so excited and pleased with my results and by the end of the bottle I was a full Inch longer!!  </li>
      <li>I never had a problem retaining length because I don&#x27;t fuss with my hair and use healthy products on my hair to keep it strong and moisturized.</li>
      <li>You will notice growth even before the month is over many people including me experienced major growth before your bottle is done.</li>
      <li>Because I am ingredient conscious, I decided to give these vitamins a try to see if they would be a great recommendation for my clients.</li>
      <li>so far I am happy with the softer and stronger hair results.</li>
      <li>I have noticed less shedding which is great!</li>
      <li>Tears of joy streamed from my face because I didn&#x27;t think it was possible!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll order one more bottle and make sure to do a before and after on straight hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to update in 3 months and 6 months.</li>
      <li>I am thanking the Most High God &amp; the vitamin creator for this gem!!</li>
      <li>however the breakout isn&#x27;t worth it!</li>
      <li>I love these vitamins and highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>Healthy hair really does start from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hey Everyone, even though I purchased my vitamins directly from the Mane choice site I wanted to give my honest review here on Amazon for anyone who feels more comfortable purchasing the vitamins from this site than directly.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m got my vitamins quick</li>
      <li>Well I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my edges are filling back in very nicely!!</li>
      <li>Shipment arrived quick and my hair grew about an inch in some areas.  </li>
      <li>The mane choice&#x27;s butter is my favorite butter right now for those who want a solid butter blend without all the added water and chemistry ingredients. : )</li>
      <li>I went back and ordered 6 more bottles!  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say it has given me more energy, as I am usually pretty active, but it def made my hair grow and stay healthy!</li>
      <li>But so far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>I Love these pills thus far.</li>
      <li>Even though I have always taken good care of my hair, since using these vitamins and other products by Mane, my hair has grown and thicken up.  </li>
      <li>right from the start</li>
      <li>My roots feel thicker, and considering that hair on average grows 1/4 - 1/2 inches a month, an entire inch is great!</li>
      <li>I love this product I seen major growth and my hair is thicker than ever in just one month.  </li>
      <li>I am a natural hair stylist in that Atlanta area, that is always seeking the best products for a balance between internal and topical hair health.</li>
      <li>I definitely see a difference in how strong my nails are and how quickly they&#x27;re growing.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed more length in the back.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, I want to thank God for allowing me to run across the vitamins.</li>
      <li>By the end of the first month I legit had 1 inch of growth.</li>
      <li>and I have taken them for a month and 1/2, and both got an inch within the first month.</li>
      <li>I have been pretty consistent in using the product..</li>
      <li>Did exactly what it is suppose to do in a month.</li>
      <li>I want to love this product because I have definitely noticed my hair has grown a lot, but I cannot deal with the breakout.  </li>
      <li>I noticed the ingredients in Manetabolism are more concentrated in the essential minerals for hair growth.</li>
      <li>After researching the ingredients,  I ordered my first two bottles.  </li>
      <li>I love this product over hairfinity which I used for several months without these results.  </li>
      <li>I purchased 2 months of the pills, I finished the 1st month with no issues, I got through most of the 2nd month.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have much luck with it.</li>
    <li> Whenever choosing hair vitamins, always compare ingredients! I used to use another brand that worked well, but required taking so many pills and was more expensive. These have everything you need and only requires 2 easy-to-swallow pills a day. I have been taking these just shy of 2 weeks and my hair is stronger w/ less shedding, and my hair is already &amp;#34;bigger.&amp;#34; I won&#x27;t measure until I finish my first bottle, but it is clear that they are already working. I will be reordering for sure! (P.S. The other vitamins I was taking took about 6 weeks before I believed that they were working. They key was continued use, so be patient. My hair eventually grew super long. These, however, seem to work even better).</li>
    <li> I read people&#x27;s reviews on these hair products all the time but after trying Hairfinity and having little to no results, I was hesitant to purchase these vitamins. I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference the first two weeks (I get my natural hair straightened every 2 weeks) but when I had my hair done after 4 weeks, my hair had literally grown an entire inch! These vitamins are amazing! I know early-on the customer service was not great, but they moved into a new warehouse now and have operations running smoothly (I follow them on Instagram). I would encourage you to try them! I ordered a two-month supply with my first order, which I am so glad I did; with these kind of results I don&#x27;t want to have to wait for another bottle to arrive! One other note, I stopped taking my birth control the same time as I started these vitamins (it was making me sick) and I did have breakouts for a few weeks. I can&#x27;t say for sure whether it was from my BC or the vitamins but either way, stick it out if you do get breakouts...it will go away once your body is adjusted! Can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product I seen major growth and my hair is thicker than ever in just one month.  The only negative is my skin broke out badly. But I still love these pills</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have hair thinning in the front of my hair and since buying this product and using it I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.  my hair is filing in and getting thicker.</li>
    <li> These pills did nothing for me and made my face breakout badly. I drank a ton of water while taking them and I still had a horrible reaction, which never happens to me. I&#x27;m extremely upset because on top of skin irritation, my hair didn&#x27;t grow at all. They also have really bad customer service. I tried to contact them to see if this is how the product typically works and their phone number is disconnected.</li>
    <li> I started taking these on May 1st. I have not had any problems. No breakouts, headaches, stomach aches... Nothing.... I have a protective style, braids, so I cannot tell of any growth just yet. Overall, I like this product and I will finish the month out. If I see continued growth I will purchase another bottle because there are no side effect for me.</li>
    <li> The list of vitamins on the bottle are really good so it did no harm to me. My hair didn&#x27;t grow any faster or shed; basically, nothing out of the ordinary happened to my hair while I took these vitamins. I never had a problem retaining length because I don&#x27;t fuss with my hair and use healthy products on my hair to keep it strong and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 months of the pills, I finished the 1st month with no issues, I got through most of the 2nd month. I had about a week left and it went down hill from there. I broke out all over my face, almost hive-like! I increased my water intake, stopped taking the vitamins and I&#x27;m still suffering(3weeks later)....I saw results (2 inches in growth over 2 months) however the breakout isn&#x27;t worth it! I will stick with my coconut oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived quick and my hair grew about an inch in some areas.  I will be ordering again.  I love this product over hairfinity which I used for several months without these results.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Even though I have always taken good care of my hair, since using these vitamins and other products by Mane, my hair has grown and thicken up.  Thanks and yes, I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased these pills with hopes of regrowing my hair quickly after 1year transitioning and a big chop.  Before i had even finished the first bottle I saw growth of about half an inch!  I was so excited and pleased with my results and by the end of the bottle I was a full Inch longer!!  I will be purchasing these again!  However I have a question for you ladies... Did anyone miss a period while taking these?  Well I did and it really scared the hell outta me because I was getting negative preg. test after negative preg. test....  Finally a whole month of being late it came but it was only after I slowed down from taking the pills from 2 a day to 2 every 4 or 5 days.  Did anyone else experience this?</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tracked my progress like I thought I would, but I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or hair loss to report. I have noticed less shedding which is great! I will definitely continue to use this product. The only negative comment I have is that I did skip my period while on it (which caused me to flip out at first) In the future I&#x27;m going to take a break between bottles.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped extremely fast from amazon that I received it before the dates expected. I can&#x27;t say it has given me more energy, as I am usually pretty active, but it def made my hair grow and stay healthy! Will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I am African American with natural hair. I was skeptical at first because I had tried another popular hair vitamin and didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair, but this product was mentioned in a blog of someone that I follow, and she was going to try it for a hair growth challenge, so I thought I&#x27;d try it too. Delivery was quick. I have been taking the vitamin for about 3 weeks now after a couple of weeks, I noticed hardly any shedding when combing my hair in the shower. Before taking the vitamin, I had trimmed my own hair and accidentally cut one side a little shorter than the other, now since taking the vitamin, the shorter side has caught up with the longer side and I&#x27;ve noticed more length in the back.</li>
    <li> Excellent will be ordering more</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! Did exactly what it is suppose to do in a month. *flips hair* I&#x27;m happily satisfied. Ordering more</li>
    <li> I am a natural hair stylist in that Atlanta area, that is always seeking the best products for a balance between internal and topical hair health. Because I am ingredient conscious, I decided to give these vitamins a try to see if they would be a great recommendation for my clients. My intent is not for crazy growth, but for an increased growth to balance out things you may not get on a daily basis with your diet. My co-worker and I have taken them for a month and 1/2, and both got an inch within the first month. I measured again, and after the next 2 weeks, I have a half of an inch more. My roots feel thicker, and considering that hair on average grows 1/4 - 1/2 inches a month, an entire inch is great! I have a sensitive stomach, so the first few days I experienced nausea because I took them first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Once my body adjusted, I have had no issues since and no skin breakout phases, and I take them at night so my body can metabolize the ingredients.  I recommend these to all my clients to help balance out your internal hair health for things you may be missing in your diet. I&#x27;m excited to update in 3 months and 6 months. FYI: The mane choice&#x27;s butter is my favorite butter right now for those who want a solid butter blend without all the added water and chemistry ingredients. : )</li>
    <li> I Love these pills thus far. I have been using it for 30days and my shedding has decreased. I&#x27;m an African American with 4c type hair so its imperative that my hair is strengthened since it is easy for it to get tangled due to the kinky texture. With the decrease in shedding that is letting me know the hair is getting stronger. I also follow all of courtney&#x27;s hair regiments on top of taking the pills which includes homemade DC and scalp massage with her oil blends... so far I am happy with the softer and stronger hair results. They also give me energy and for some reason my allergies have stopped since using them which may be due to the immune support also in the pills, regardless no other hair pills give you that type of combo and Before using her pills I used, Viviscal (which were amazing but broke my skin out), Toji for 2 months, and hairfinity for 6months</li>
    <li> I love these!!!!!! My hair started falling out at the beginning of the year and I was a mess because my hair was pretty, healthy and long. My sister told me about manetabolism and told me to go on Instagram and look at all the reviews. After seeing the results posted from other people, I wanted to try them for myself. I got my hair cut and wanted to see if these pills actually work. My hair has grown an inch and a half after taking these pills for 2 weeks, my nails grew like crazy and my skin has cleared up tremendously! These pills work!!!! My hair is now in a protective style, so I&#x27;ll continue taking the pills while my hair is braided. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results once I take my hair down. I LOVE  MANETABOLISM!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product actually does give me energy. I wear my hair in wash n&#x27; go&#x27;s during the summer so it&#x27;s been hard to tell what kind of growth I&#x27;ve really had. The only way I can see it so far is that my hair is past my ears much more than I remember. When I stretch certain parts, I do notice they&#x27;re longer. I&#x27;ve only had it 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say for sure how much it has helped or if I&#x27;m imagining it. I&#x27;ll order one more bottle and make sure to do a before and after on straight hair. But so far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love It ! Hair Is Growing Fast &amp; Thick . Better Than Hair infinity!</li>
    <li> I experienced a negative physical reaction to this product. I read the ingredients and I am not allergic to any of the listed ingredients. However, after a week of consuming the product my skin broke out and I experienced stomach irregularities. The product also made me nausea unless I consumed it with yogurt. I still felt Ill each time I took it. I suffered through it for 3 weeks in hopes that it would pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying I read a similar review and  wrote it off as an anomaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. Further, it  is not distributed/shipped by Amazon and the vendor will not do you the courtesy of a refund or replacement for another product.</li>
    <li> These pills are really good. Not only are you suppose to take it and drink water. Even if you drink minimal water no headache,pains, or nausea. You will notice growth even before the month is over many people including me experienced major growth before your bottle is done. If you visit their Instagram page @manetabolism @themanechoice you see reviews and progress pictures. Better than hairinfinity and biotin alone. And no nasty taste either.</li>
    <li> My daughter have been taking these her hair and nails is growing she love it. I will be ording her some more soon.</li>
    <li> These vitmins are great they help me maintain my healthy skin and nails! And you see the results within a week!</li>
    <li> Very good vitamins, will be ordering again!!</li>
    <li> I have been using these vitamins for a little over a month and I&#x27;ve seen 1 inch of growth. I have to agree that my hair does not shed as much as it used to and it feels healthier. I have 3 more bottles to go so I will update my review once those are done.  As for the customer service, it is not only a new, but also a small company with only 3 products. I&#x27;m sure that it will improve as the company grows.  I personally like Courtney, she has always been very responsive if you can get in touch with her through her Facebook or instagram page.</li>
    <li> I would like to start off by saying how much I love these vitamins! I am natural and after transitioning I noticed my hair was thinner and constantly breaking. The shedding was ridiculous so I was determined to find products that would lead to healthy hair. As far as vitamins go I have tried over the counter Hair, skin and nails vitamins... didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair, skin, or nails. MSM and biotin, I noticed slow growth. Hairfinity... I noticed growth but it was coupled with side effects and my hair grew in thin. After watching Courtney on YT and IG I decided to try her products when they released. My hair is growing and is stronger, thicker and healthier. I love these vitamins and highly recommend them! (Check out my pictures on IG, @hair_diaries or hairdiariesbysisters.blogspot.com)</li>
    <li> I have bought this product two times and I must say that is the best thing that has ever happened to my edges. It&#x27;s only been two months and my hair is growing like crazy. No complaints here</li>
    <li> I just love it! I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and I&#x27;m glad I started my one month supply when I got braids because I usually have bad breakage around my edges. I can&#x27;t wait to re-order.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been going back and forth on whether I should buy this or the hairfinity pills for awhile now. I went with Manetabolism after comparing ingredients (Manetabolism has 2x amount of biotin). These pills and hairfinity are the same price (If you&#x27;re buying two bottles hairfinity is like a dollar cheaper).  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little while now and I love it. I can already see a noticeable change in my hair. I found them through the owner Courtney&#x27;s Instagram page. They&#x27;re a small business so that is something you have to keep in mind. But over all two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** I had to change my review from five to two stars. These pills caused me to breakout soo bad. Face, arms, legs,and hands! I would NOT recommend these pills to anyone who has sensitive skin. While it will grow your hair it will harm your skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur time buying any of the mane choice products . The owner Courtney Adeleye is a scam artist, cooking up nonsense in her kitchen telling people it will make their hair grow. This product will not make your hair grow. Save your money and but biotin</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and compared these vitamins to others in the market. I noticed the ingredients in Manetabolism are more concentrated in the essential minerals for hair growth. I measured my hair prior to starting and after 1 month I had 1 inch of hair growth!!! I haven&#x27;t had any negative side effects only growth and stronger nails! I would definitely recommend these hair vitamins for thicker and longer hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie L.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. i have been taking it for 2 months now and about to enter into my 3rd and i have noticed lots of changes. right from the start i noticed my energy level had increased. i no longer wake up still sleepy and wanting to go back to bed but rather ready to start the day. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my brittle nails are a lot stronger and healthier as well as a boost in my immune system. i use to always feel like i was getting sick and i do not have that feeling as frequent anymore. and as for my hair i gained about an inch and a half to 2 inches within 1 month. it is thicker and A LOT healthier. way less breakage then before. These pills don&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; your hair. they help your hair and body to become healthier from the inside out so that your hair is stronger and doesn&#x27;t break off and in return it allows you to retain more length. if you would like to see pictures of my hair and progress they are posted on my instagram @ebonycurlz</li>
    <li> Hey Everyone, even though I purchased my vitamins directly from the Mane choice site I wanted to give my honest review here on Amazon for anyone who feels more comfortable purchasing the vitamins from this site than directly. First and foremost, I want to thank God for allowing me to run across the vitamins. I have been a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; natural transitioner for the past 4 years and I can truthfully say nothing worked. I gave up and told God I would give it to him. I would not be a product junky anymore and I would stop trying &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; that websites told me. So I asked God if I could try one last thing which were these vitamins and when they arrived, I prayed over them, and the rest was history. By the end of the first month I legit had 1 inch of growth. Tears of joy streamed from my face because I didn&#x27;t think it was possible! I immediately ordered 2 more bottles because of the small discount advantage of buying 2 instead of 1 and now I am starting my second bottle tomorrow. I will come again after the second bottle is complete to see if I received another inch of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I never do reviews, (you can check my review history to see my honesty) but I wanted other women like me...on the verge of giving up to ask God for help and see if these vitamins are for you!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Saw difference in hair texture and length in days. Join the hair challenge today! Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> When I came across this product I was on the search for a healthier hair antidote.  I was not  concerned with length.  (ALTHOUGH THAT CAN BE A PLUS :) ), I was on the hunt for stronger hair . Well, I am a customer who  never believes the hype.  But, after I researched each ingredient to what the vitamins contained I knew for a fact that it had to be beneficial  . I just finished my first bottle and my new growth is crazy!!!  I went back and ordered 6 more bottles!  I am naturally curly and my little puff from before is now a pony tail that has length to it.  I wish I would have known of this product 4 years ago when I first became natural. I can only imagine how long and healthy my hair would be today.  Since the vitamins I&#x27;ve noticed less shedding and stronger hair . ...  This is an investment that you don&#x27;t want to miss out on!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this. Manetabolism works. I&#x27;ve tried other vitamins before and decided to give this one a chance after seeing the owner&#x27;s hair. I was uber impressed with her hair progress pictures.  After researching the ingredients,  I ordered my first two bottles.  SO glad that I ordered two bottles at a time. (I would hate to run out. I normally order a new bottle once I get halfway through the one I&#x27;m using). I noticed a difference in length in less than a month. Not only has my hair grown longer in the 3 months that I&#x27;ve been using this product, it&#x27;s also gotten thicker. There are side effects, however..for me, they were clearer, more radiant skin, stronger and longer nails and increased energy. Ladies, these work. They really do. I should also add that I drink about a gallon of water every day so I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with. Healthy hair really does start from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the customer service is great. I ordered vitamins during black Friday when they offered a generous discount. It was taking awhile to get the vitamins so I decided to email customer service. I was contacted within a few hours and they explained to me the backlog and that my order would be sent out as soon as it was ready.  Even though I wanted my vitamins, I understood and was appreciative they they actually took the time to respond to me. They already had my money, they could have ignored my email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With manetabolism, a healthy diet and a healthy hair regimen, I hope to have my healthiest hair ever.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I have been using the product for 30 days and I have seen great results. I took hairfinity vitamins and they broke my skin out and I did not see any growth. This product has yielded 1.5 inches of growth in 30 days. I am so pleased with my results!</li>
    <li> I am still on the fence with this product.  I just finished my 2nd bottle and have noticed that I am starting to break out on my face and I NEVER have like this before ( only the normal 1 or 2 during &amp;#34;the monthly&amp;#34;).  I want to love this product because I have definitely noticed my hair has grown a lot, but I cannot deal with the breakout.  I guess I should have been cautious since it is not currently FDA regulated, but seeing all of the results made me want to try it.  This may not happen to a lot of users.. Unfortunately, it did happen to me.  I am going to stop taking them for a little bit and see if I see any difference in my skin.  I will come back and post within the next month or so to see if anything has changed.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> I must admit by the end of month 1 that I was a little skeptical about the quality of the manetabolism because I did not see much growth.  However, my hair grows in spurts... always has.  I am coming up on the end of bottle number two (about 1.5 weeks left and my new growth is out of control)  Not to mention that I also cut and filed my nails completely down due to breaking and peeling and now my nails are long and healthy with no chips and no peeling.  In addition to the manetabolism I was also using Flexinail which is a nail conditioner.  I am naturally rough on my hands and Flexinail strengthens your nails but also makes them flexible enough so that you dont break a nail everytime you accidently hit something.  I did experience some minor breakouts at first but I always do so I can&#x27;t really attribute that to the manetabolism vitamins.  I did read somewhere that 5000mg of biotin is not necessarily healthy and the recommended dosage is 1800mg a day.  So i did cut back on my pills from 2 a day to 1 a day.  Please make sure you look into this so that your health is not at risk.  So for those of you who it did not work for I would suggest giving it another try and complete 2 bottles before you give up.  I think with all vitamins it needs time to absorb into your system completely and it can only do that with consistency.  I purchased a length check tshirt and plan to measure my hair again at the end of the two month supply.  Im hoping that cutting back to 1 pill doesn&#x27;t have a negative impact on my progress.  Good Luck to everyone</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair length. Most people on these reviews say they&#x27;ve noticed long hair after two weeks.. well it&#x27;s been well over two weeks and nothing for me. I have been pretty consistent in using the product.. but my hair seems to be growing on its own. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again. I will trust God for my results.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Not only is my hair growing, it is retaining it&#x27;s length. My edges are thicker and so is my over all hair (I have really thin 4a and MAJOR shrinkage). But I had gotten an acrylic overlay on my nails and had gotten a nail infection. Doctor said it would take about 9 months - 1 year for me to recover and grow my nail out. The infection had my nail separating from the nail bed (last time I EVER get acrylic). I started taking this and I promise within 3 months my nails grew rapidly and they are stronger than before. I praise God that my nails are all very attached to their nail beds as well. This product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I definitely see a difference in how strong my nails are and how quickly they&#x27;re growing.  I&#x27;m not sure of how much my hair grew because I haven&#x27;t check it yet but I do see some growth.  I like this product and will continue to take it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews (although I love to read them).  I am thanking the Most High God &amp; the vitamin creator for this gem!! I lost my edges 5 years ago due to what is called a &amp;#34;quick weave.&amp;#34;  Before that, I always had a nice length of hair, never had problems growing my hair but my hair was long &amp; I wanted a shorter style.  When I took the quick weave off, my edges left with it.  I mean completely bald.  Since then I have went to the dermatologist for steroid shots, taken biotin, etc. Nothing worked.  About 6 months ago, I started using Jamaican black castor oil, I got a little new growth.  Then my cousin told me about these vitamins. Well I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my edges are filling back in very nicely!! I am so thankful because I thought I was going to have to spend thousands on a hair transplant.  Thank you Courtney for this miracle in a bottle.  Many blessings to you on your journey!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m got my vitamins quick and I&#x27;m loving the results! I will be ordering these bad boys again..and again and again lol</li>
