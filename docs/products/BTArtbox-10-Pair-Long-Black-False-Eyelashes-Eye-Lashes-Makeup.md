      <li>They came way before expected and look great!</li>
      <li>I will say they look good with a very well made up eye.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I go through eyelashes soooooo quick since i wear them for work and this soooo beats $5+ per pair. decent quality</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t sturdy well-made lashes.  They are great if you are a one-time use gal.  I like to reuse my lashes sometimes but these are too thin to do so.  The lengths are very long so they&#x27;re not very natural looking either.  But for the price, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I paid for! 10 eyelashes at an okay price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> These lashes are trash. They are so stiff that they do not form to the shape of your eye. Unless you want an eye full of glue don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
    <li> Wont stay no matter what glue i use there to stiff</li>
    <li> Daughter loved these and they lasted her a long time</li>
    <li> I got these earlier than expected, from what I can tell, I am in love already. I haven&#x27;t tried on a single pair yet, but for the money, the quality seems excellent. I will definitely reorder if the seller continues to carry this particular style.</li>
    <li> Its a pretty good product. Especially for a night out or for photography. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the band that hold the lashes are a bit stiff so for those who gets this product just take it out of the package and do a rolling motion to make it for flexible. Other than that, I like these lashes a lot.</li>
    <li> These are too thick to apply properly. I got one day use because they break apart when you try to remove them.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for with these. The quality of the lashes isn&#x27;t that awesome, but they&#x27;re good for a quick glammed-up night out event. I don&#x27;t have huge eyes I guess, so I actually take one lash &amp; cut it half to use on the ends of both of my lashes. The plus side; they last longer, right!?</li>
    <li> WORTHLESS!!! THE LASHES FALL APART WHEN U TRY TO REMOVE FROM THE PLASTIC HOLDER !! Very cheaply made and can not be used --- I TRASHED THE WHOLE BOX !! Will not order them again and certainly do not recommend</li>
    <li> They were just okay. The package was all beat up when I got them. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> They came sooner than I was supposed to get them, although they still took awhile to come in but that&#x27;s okay. These eyelashes are great especially for the price. If you know how to work with eyelashes, then you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues! I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> So far I have purchased three boxes of these lashes and have yet to have a problem with them. My daughter and I have used lashes from all three boxes when getting ready for an event or evening out ,and she&#x27;s a beginning user and she has no complaints what so ever. As far as quality they work just as good as the brand names. Then again I understand if your a label hound!!....Its just a name get over it, but great product.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderful for my Christmas craft. The perfect size and the Company was wonderful to work with</li>
    <li> If you want to look like plastic? That&#x27;s the look you will get, PLASTIC Look. not worth your money but if used for a costume then you will be ok with the outcome!</li>
    <li> Nope just no! They didnt curl at all and kinda just stuck out straight! I would not recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> Awesome deal pretty great lashes for the price. Package was a little smooshed but nothing to crazy and lashes weren&#x27;t damaged at all.</li>
    <li> I received these lashes much sooner than expected. If you are looking for fun dramatic lashes these are great. Maybe not for everyday wear but they are a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty good actually. I just hate how neither side of the lashes are distinct to which side goes in the inner corner. And the packaging is misleading, You&#x27;re supposed to use the two up and down from each other not next to each other. I figured that out the hard way.</li>
    <li> The packaging is great and every easy access to each set. They are very nice, but not of human hair and I did not expect that for the price I was paying. I will say they look good with a very well made up eye. Reusing them has been very easy also. A little washing off of the glue and back in the tray. I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality product, I was very disappointed when I got this because they just don&#x27;t bend much making it very difficult to form to your eyes. I will not be buying this product againmor do I recommend this.</li>
    <li> There hard to stick on. but overall it is good for the price you pay for it.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  Very hard to use. Wont get them again.</li>
    <li> Love them!!!😍😍😍😍 super nice and long.. And the price was great will order another pack soon.. One only thing the should seed you a glue with it...</li>
    <li> Laaaaaaaaaav these lashes!!!!!! They&#x27;re re-usable and looks natural from afar.  Will be ordering more of these soon.  So worth it!</li>
    <li> I love full and crazy lashes. And this was perfect for me. It wasn&#x27;t heavy like I thought it would be, it was actually very light. I will buy more soon!</li>
    <li> Fast service its worth what I paid</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m going to like them I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but they look great  I think I would buy them again</li>
    <li> The lashes are thick and long, the pictures does not do them justice. The lash band is thick enough for reuse but thin enough not to show while wearing them.</li>
    <li> I finally recieved my eyelashes today and they look great! It was nicely packaged and not to mention in a cute box. Although it took almost a month to arrive they are great quality for the price! :)</li>
    <li> I tried cutting them because my eyes are a little too small, the material is too fake. It does not hold in place, I have other fake eyelashes, and I have good glue. These are the only eyelashes that do not hold for long, maybe it is my eye shape. It works wonders for people with round, big eyes. Unfortunately I am not one of those.</li>
    <li> These are too dramatic and dont look very good but they dont rip easily, ill probably end up ripping them up and using them as lashes for my bjds.</li>
    <li> They do the job but are a bit too long and are plastic so they don&#x27;t feel as natural :/ but they are pretty good and at a good price.</li>
    <li> My cheer leader daughter used them sold them to her team mates. Will buy more .</li>
    <li> They were to thick. Maybe works for those that one that dramatic look.</li>
    <li> They came from China and at the time of ordering it did not state it would take a month for them to come. However, they are cheap and as described. I got more then one use out of a set. You must bend them and cut to liking. Package was banged up and boxes were crushed in some spots but what can you do?! Overall I was satisfied with what I got.</li>
    <li> Will buy again ! Totally recommend them</li>
    <li> It should&#x27;ve had more photos. I received it and it was kinda too short so it looked weird on my face considering I like to make my eyes look doll like</li>
    <li> they are a nice long shape but the lashes themself fall off to easily&lt;br /&gt;they look beautiful on the eye.</li>
    <li> Pretty and cheap but very very thick&lt;br /&gt;Think Katy perry&lt;br /&gt;I would look like drag if wore entire strip&lt;br /&gt;I plan on cutting in half and wearing on outer corner</li>
    <li> I was not thrilled with these eyelashes. The lashes themselves were cut well, appeared natural and the length would have been good for me. They looked great in the box but once I tried them on they were difficult to get to follow the natural curve of my eyelid. They were somewhat stiff so that probably contributed to this. I also noticed once I did manage to get them on, they had like a white looking line over my eyelid where they attached. I could not figure this out since there was no visible line or visible plastic on the eyelash itself. I was stumped on that but they were super super inexpensive so I really don&#x27;t want to complain but I must be honest and quite simply I was not thrilled.</li>
    <li> I love the lashes! So easy to use too! Look very natural it is not thick looking like the other lashes.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are amazing!!!! Just got them today...did take almost 2 weeks to arrive, but I&#x27;m in love!!!! LEARN HOW TO PUT THEM ON BEFORE U GIVE BAD REVIEWS ON NOT STAYING CORRECTLY!!!;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye&amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> Loved it!!! Were very long and was able to wear each pair more than once</li>
    <li> They are all different sized and some were bent. Very dramatic not for everyday use some are super thick and I got one that fell apart! Still good though , I use them when I go out at night so no one notices</li>
    <li> These were extremely long lashes, so if you&#x27;re looking for natural, turn right around. But if you are looking for that big dolly, lolita look, these are for you.&lt;br /&gt;the hairs are so soft and so fine, it absolutely gorgeous. I cut the \\&quot;inner corners\\&quot; to an angle for a more natural shape.&lt;br /&gt;remember to add alot of glue to the  inner corners, otherwise they will get loose and hurts like a bitch to blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love these huge goregous lashes!</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t get these eyelashes to fit me or even stay on- for reference I use DUO adhesive.  I&#x27;m an avid false eyelash wearer but these just don&#x27;t cut it for me.  Perhaps with super glue - I&#x27;m kidding of course.</li>
    <li> These lashes are just okay.  They aren&#x27;t the best, but also, not the worst.  They are a little rigid and not pliable to fit any eye shape.  They are sort of generic.  I don&#x27;t wear them much, I&#x27;ve bought several others and still haven&#x27;t used all of these because they are the last ones I consider.  I would buy them if you&#x27;re looking for some back up pairs for emergencies, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them in anticipation to wear them for some big event.</li>
    <li> I really like fake eyelashes and wear them on the daily, but these do not look natural; which is why I dislike them. They look to unrealistic and too exotic for me.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;I loved them!&lt;br /&gt;they arived ontime, they looked great, you can re-use several times,&lt;br /&gt;and water does not damage or morph them~~~&lt;br /&gt;perfect~&lt;br /&gt;will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Great price and nice quality. They came way before expected and look great! Other than having to trim them here and there, no problems! You can re-use them as long as you&#x27;re not hard on your lashes! I would definitely purchase these again!!!</li>
    <li> Theyre a little thick and Not very natural looking but for the price .. i guess its ok. Wish they were a bit longer</li>
    <li> I just received these in the mail today and these particular one&#x27;s are nice but a lil thick but all in all they are legit my sister ordered the natural ones and those are much better for daily use and you can definitely re-use these more than a few times. i would order these again but the natural one not the thick ones unless you like that look.</li>
    <li> I ordered 12 packs of lashes because of the unbelievable price. Ordered them August 6 and 3 packs came in the mail yesterday August 17. They came much sooner then expected. I&#x27;m already wearing a pair right now. I&#x27;m in love with these lashes and will continue to buy them. I ordered a variety of looks. They are very easy to apply if you know what you&#x27;re doing. I believe the ones who give a bad review are the ones who don&#x27;t know how to apply lashes correctly. But I&#x27;m in love and will continue to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty long, and not human hair - then again, I wouldn&#x27;t wear human hair on my body anyways. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I got this bulk pack of eyelashes in the mail today! It came in a long, thin, white box with a clear heart to see the eyelashes in! It even has adorable packaging! I was in the middle of getting ready for my day anyway (I wear false eyelashes everyday) so I decided to throw my older ones away and try on a new pair of these! They&#x27;re sturdy and I know will last a long time! This whole package was the price (including shipping) of ONE pair of lashes from the usual chain stores! I will only order these from now on! I know I will be saving money from these! Thank you so much to this distributor!</li>
    <li> ok, I love these lashes and they stand out!  If you take them off at night you can reuse that same pair! Love the price and the quality!</li>
    <li> These are the best eyelashes to wear I love these so much.. The length is the bomb!!! And the fullness of the lash is the bomb too...Five stars all day</li>
    <li> These lashes are PERFECT! When you put them on the curl is so beautiful! I&#x27;m the type of person who buys expensive stuff but thought i&#x27;d give this a try. MONEY SAVER I love them! If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this for your daughter or for yourself, this is PERFECT, because i&#x27;m a teenager and I absolutely will buy these again and again. It took about 3 weeks to come, but really it was so worth it. The quality is really decent, It doesn&#x27;t look fake, they&#x27;re beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S you will need to buy the glue and applicator separately (:</li>
    <li> these lashes are a little too weak for me I need a little more strength.I don&#x27;t have any eyelashes at all so maybe for someone with lashes they might be great</li>
    <li> These are perfect if you want gigantic, stage worthy lashes but if you want dainty lashes that look natural then keep looking.</li>
    <li> For the low price of the product it is not bad. They took some time to arrive but they were worth the wait. This is my 3RD time ordering them. I CUT mines as they were a little to bulky for my like but other than that they hold well, look great and I was able to wear more than once.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the quality of the lashes or the band. but for the price being payed I shouldn&#x27;t of had a higher expectation. Not sure that I will be ordering these again, although I did like using them for daily use.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes work great for my Fall needle felting pumpkin projects I make at home.  All of my pumpkins get faces made on them and some of the girl pumpkins really stand out with their long curly lashes, very cute.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Downside: These eyelashes are plastic and cheaplooking. Plus, like other reviews said, they came in crushed around the sides. Mine had an extra cherry on the top - someone&#x27;s strand of hair stuck in one of the slots of the eyelashes :S. The eyelashes themselves are rather garish looking, but if you are looking for something dramatic and affordable though not really an \\&quot;investment\\&quot;, then these do their job okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: 10 pair of these &#x3D; the cost of one pair of more expensive and higher quality lashes. If you are looking for quantity over quality, these are for you. If you are looking for a pair of lashes to reuse and invest in, and that will look natural and feel natural, then I&#x27;d recommend Darkness lashes or all-time favorite Ardell.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. When i get it, it was really useless. I couldn&#x27;t do anything with them.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s a bit cheap but perfect for at 1+ iteam</li>
    <li> I ordered this around late October and recieved it near the estimated time. The eyelashes are a bit stiff so you might want to pull on them a little. The eyelashes are very long as well</li>
    <li> These won&#x27;t even hold glue to stick on.  Ridiculous.  At $1.20 though... who cares?  Maybe that&#x27;s there gimmick.  40,000 people at $1 each... no one will take the time to return them or ask for an exchange at $1.20 a pack.  My wife&#x27;s went into the garbage.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Shipping was right, the lashes makes my eyes bigger. I love it! :) The band it a bit thick, but that&#x27;s a good thing! I can re use them.</li>
    <li> I just love these fake eye lashes!!! I love the price and the fact that they are vegan is a total plus in my book.  I cut them in half and use one lash strip for each eye, this way I will have more lash strips left, plus I will look more natural.  If you want a dramatic effect these are the right lashes for you.</li>
    <li> good eyelashes but package was damaged, two of the lashes were ruined</li>
    <li> theyre so pretty and full. they make my lashes look beautiful! i figured out they have multiple use too! awesome :)</li>
    <li> Overall, this product is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The style is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;2. The lashes are pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Came in a wrinkled boxes, and 2 of the individual lashes were ruined, because of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might re-order, but this the style makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> Well Done !! Thy were nice and lasted a very long time ! I&#x27;ll b making another pirchase of these soon !</li>
