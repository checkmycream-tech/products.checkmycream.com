      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many, many years</li>

      <li>wear it both night and day, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the smell too -</li>
      <li>and if I were to put sunscreen over it; it would be way more greasy.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
      <li>and I suffer from psoriasis/eczema all sorts of skin issues and this creme does the trick and even more.</li>
      <li>but I love it as an eye cream.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t moisturize any better than the carrot day cream.  </li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s have decided to raise their prices drastically and discontinue many of their items.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most cream</li>
      <li>So just check the product you receive when you get it, and make sure it is the updated product as advertised on the page.</li>
      <li>and now I soon won&#x27;t be able to afford it</li>
      <li>The scent is very unique and took a day or so to get used to, but I would still recommend this product over anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Very rich without being greasy.</li>
      <li>I use the day cream more as a night cream, as the night version is a tad bit too oily for me, though also pretty good.</li>
      <li>I had high expectations of this product because of the great reviews.</li>
      <li>It feels good, smells good, goes on easy and apparently works because no one believes my age when I tell them.</li>
      <li>Okay, I admit it: I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Carrot Day Creme for more than five years now, and nothing else is as good for my particular skin.  </li>
      <li>This is the BEST moisturizer for Dry skin.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find my old favorite moisture creme.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it and how smoothly it goes on, as well as how smooth it makes my skin.  .</li>
      <li>So strong, even minutes after applying it my boyfriend can smell it.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, it smells exactly like baby food and that stench lingers for a while after putting it on.</li>
      <li>I have been using this ever since it was first produced and along with the night cream (a very greasy but great product)</li>
      <li>This cr&amp;egrave;me is too precious to use as a quick hydration, like hand lotion, which must be reapplied every time you wash or sanitize.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely creme and even gives my skin a nice tint during the wintery, pasty white months :)</li>
      <li>My skin is now smooth, moisturized and radiant again.</li>
      <li>It is light on the skin, not greasy.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizer</li>
      <li>I was going along happily using the Carrot Nutritive body lotion on my face daily.  </li>
      <li>(I ordered it one day and it was there the next day), so the shipping is amazing!  </li>
      <li>Since I started using this years ago, all start of lines, &#x27;crows feet&#x27;, smile lines all disappeared!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this was suppose to be an updated newer product. it states on the page it is 98.3% natural and infused with carrot seed oil, and listed in the ingredients on the page is carrot seed oil, however the one I received must have been older stock because mine says 96.8 % natural and carrot seed oil is not listed under the ingredients and the list of ingredients on the box differs greatly from what is listed on the site. So just check the product you receive when you get it, and make sure it is the updated product as advertised on the page. The newer one is supposed to actually contain carrot seed oil in addition to the beta carotene, smell a little better, and absorb a little quicker.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream! I have a reeeeally dry face, yet try not to get too crazy with using too many products to keep it moisturized, so I pair this with one other moisturizer (for after shower) and then I use the Burt Bees Carrot cream the rest of the day!&lt;br /&gt;Must admit, the smell isn&#x27;t the prettiest, but it does the job for a greasy-free moisturizer. I once forgot to put it on for half the day, and the second I put it on, my face absorbed it in 5 minutes! (again, dry face and all).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small-ish jar, but a little goes a loooong way.&lt;br /&gt;I also pair this up with the night creme as well!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product. I very like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for almost a year now. I cant find it in any stores so when I run out and have to try anything else I end up coming back to this. Its simple, clean, moisturizes and gives my skin a subtle warm glow. Cant beat the price</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It evens out my skin color and preps for my foundation perfectly.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am one of the few that love the smell of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have dry skin and live in a very dry climate, so I crave thicker, richer creams. Funnily enough, compared to a lot of reviewers, I don&#x27;t find this one to be that oily or rich. When I put it on it sinks right in and almost feels more glycerin based than oil based (I don&#x27;t have a list of ingredients in front of me so can&#x27;t verify that; I&#x27;m just talking about feel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, a little does seem to go a long way, and while my skin probably could handle something like this during the day, I have a different preferred daily moisturizing lotion and choose to instead use this at night.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I have used it for many years.  I live in New Mexico and at 42 I am not getting wrinkled as fast as my friends that live in wetter climates.  It is a little \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; so a little goes a long way - a jar will last me months! - but my skin sucks it up and I only feel it on my skin for a couple of minutes.  By the time I get to putting on makeup, it is soaked in.  I like it so well that I use it at night too.  (I&#x27;ve tried the carrot nutritive night cream.  The night cream is too greasy for me, for my whole face- but I love it as an eye cream. I&#x27;ve also used the radiance day cream.  It is lighter, but I don&#x27;t like the fragrance and it didn&#x27;t moisturize any better than the carrot day cream.  I have very sensitive skin and the radiance cream felt different going on- very slightly irritating initially.  I think it is probably the artificial fragrance that caused this.)</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Absorbs nicely into skin and it smells great....like vanilla and carrot cake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and still love it. I often buy it for friends and they become fans too! The formula may have changed a bit over the last couple years but it&#x27;s still a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t clog skin. It&#x27;s a must for winter dryness!</li>
    <li> I am 51 yrs. old and love tis moisturizer.  I have tried everything out there and this product is thick but absorbs very well into the face.  I am Italian and have normal skin, yet I did not find it too thick.  In fact, I purchased several types of Burts Bees day creams and this is by far my favorite.  After I apply it I also see more diminished lines and wrinkles than any other cream I&#x27;ve used.  It also acts like a filler for me,  that&#x27;s only me, but I plan on purchasing it again. Oh, and it smells GREAT! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This creme is the absolute best moisturizer I have ever used. I have very dry and sensitive skin and I suffer from psoriasis/eczema all sorts of skin issues and this creme does the trick and even more. My face never dries out anymore and I saw results after only one day. I recommend this to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> my favorite  facial cream for past five years!!!!!</li>
    <li> Burts Bees Carrot Nutritive Day Creme is the best moisturizer is have ever used, ever.  In winter is handles my very dry wind whipped skin, in summer it soothes sun beaten skin.  My face is never oily, even though I have some patchy oily areas and it works well and compliments my Bare Minerals make up.  Since I started using this years ago, all start of lines, &#x27;crows feet&#x27;, smile lines all disappeared!  Many people have asked me what I use because my face looks so good and keeps looking so good!  I had trouble with acne, cleared up.  Dry skin, no more.  Lines developing, nope. Sun soak in summer, not any more.  And just a dab will do you each day.  One jar lasts a long time.  Hint: put it on and give it some time to soak in before applying make up, as you should with any moisturizer.  Great find. The Radiance line does NOT work at all for me, there is no moisturizing element to it?  Not sure what the deal is with that.  This is the product to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this &#x27;goo&#x27; for several years. I apply to my face immediately after showering. It feels good, smells good, goes on easy and apparently works because no one believes my age when I tell them. They guess 10 years younger.  I&#x27;ve been happy with every Burt&#x27;s Bees product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this creme made my skin so greasy and I think I was allergic to an ingredient as I had a rash on my face from it.  Not very happy with it...</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;d love to go all natural, lots of organic/natural products don&#x27;t agree with my skin. This Carrot Day Cream, however, does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick, and it is orange - it does go on feeling a bit greasy, but a few minutes later my skin has absorbed it and I&#x27;m left with baby&#x27;s-butt-smooth skin that smells divine (I&#x27;d buy it just for the scent, which to me is reminiscent of pumpkin pie). It makes my sensitive skin feel smooth and supple and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it both night and day, and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using BB different products, but this one is I have first tried for winter since I recently found my dried and sun-drenched skin probably from outdoor water sports.  I use it only for cold weather and night time, and it does \\&quot;hydrate\\&quot; my dried skin to smooth out the dried lines.  and I love the carrot-candy-like smell, I only use it once on day time before heading to the freezing water in CA, and my face didn&#x27;t feel dry after the surfing session.  But it seems too much work to put it on &amp; the sun block on, so I only did it once. Over all, it is a great night cream for cold &amp; harsh weather, and i use tiny amount of it for the entire face &amp; neck and feel its \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; just right!</li>
    <li> I used up every bit of this cream. I liked the way it felt on my skin. I have dry skin and it hydrated beautifully and absorbed quickly. It also made a very nice base for my makeup. Everything I put on after the cream -- foundation, concealer, blush, eyeshadow, etc. -- all seem to glide on flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because, frankly, the cream stinks. To be honest, it smells exactly like baby food and that stench lingers for a while after putting it on. The fact that I&#x27;m using it on my face amplifies the problem, because I&#x27;m smearing all around and on my nose. I usually love the herbal scents of Burt&#x27;s Bees other products, but this one seriously fell short in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, it was a great cream in terms of performance, so I would consider buying it again despite it&#x27;s icky aroma.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most cream and I have dry skin. It is one of the few creams I can use that actually keeps my skin moist. It has slightly cocnut smell which the butter could be ingredient but its ok.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! Have used this product for several years.  Then was unable to find it.   Was told it had been discontinued.  That obviously was not correct, cause I found it on Amazon.  I was so happy to find my old favorite moisture creme. It is light on the skin, not greasy. Also, if you are like me and like the natural look, foundation is really not needed with this mositurizer as it gives a glow that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> keeping my crows feet away! I only use this product all over my face while pregnant (I get SERIOUS dry skin). Normally I only use it after putting on my regular face cream (with SPF 30) in the under eye/crows feet area. Keeps the wrinkles away! The only product I&#x27;ve found to hydrate and keep hydrating enough to do this all day/night.</li>
    <li> Only have to use a little bit to get the full moisterizing benefit that Burts Bees day cream offers. Gentle on my skin. You don&#x27;t need a lot at all so I this lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The formula for this has changed, a lot. I don&#x27;t know what they are putting in it now, but its nasty. The old cream was my favorite day cream and I never had any problems, but I had to stop using this when they changed the formula. The last jar of this I had was a nasty goopy cream which would not settle on my face and gave me a bad rash. I think this happened because the company was sold and they aren&#x27;t using the same ingredients. Even the famous BB lip balm doesn&#x27;t work the same as it used to.</li>
    <li> The smell of this lotion is amazing.  It&#x27;s VERY hydrating and gives skin a healthy glow.  Plus it&#x27;s a lot cheaper online than anywhere else.  It only took a day to get to my house (I ordered it one day and it was there the next day), so the shipping is amazing!  It&#x27;s only 2 oz, but it&#x27;s a big container when compared to other face creams.  I vote for this over Oil of Olay any day!</li>
    <li> I like the consistency and fragrance. It provides a lot of moisture when my skin is very dry. I use the day cream more as a night cream, as the night version is a tad bit too oily for me, though also pretty good. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s too oil for me,but I love it ,especially the smell.  It likes Peanut butter,when I put it on my face, I&#x27;m afraid that bees will bite me,hahahaha! It&#x27;s so funny.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer and the one I always go back to.  Excellent moisturizing and never irritates my skin.  I use it every morning before putting on my makeup and while the color and consistency is a bit odd compared to other moisturizers (like yellow clay almost) it is more than worth it because it is truly nongreasy and still works great. I have combination, sensitive skin and this is my dream product.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST moisturizer for Dry skin. It really leaves your face glowing after a few days of continuous use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  First time I&#x27;ve ever ordered it from Amazon.  I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> I use Burt&#x27;s Bees on my face.  I like it because it is not greasy and soothes my dry skin, especially around my mouth where toothpaste residual leaves my skin feeling especially dry.  Lately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores so I was glad to find out I could obtain it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used this a while back and have tried some other brands in between. I was not able to find this in the stores like I had before and therefore tried other things, but there was still a part of me that wanted to go back to the Burt&#x27;s Bees. This batch seems a little more water-based than I remember.  Not sure if they&#x27;ve in fact changed the formula, but it feels like it.  After the initial application and rubbing it in it feels okay and moisturizes effectively for me.  I will probably go back to one of the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried though.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin  Even some high end products can be irritating  This product works perfectly for me  Has been a great help to my skin</li>
    <li> This product felt greasy and heavy and stays on the surface of the skin. Not for hot summer. You have to wash it off because the skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it.</li>
    <li> I used to but this product for my boss at Whole Foods. but they stopped carrying it. SOOOOO glad I could get it through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but u can&#x27;t use it under my makeup because makes my face look greasy. I still love it though! I just use it at night!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Use it at night and in the morning. Nice, light, natural and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, fast delivery, accurate description of what the produce is, this is not the first time I purchased this product and it will not be the last.</li>
    <li> The best natural moisturizing day cream ever!  great price and value!</li>
    <li> Okay, I admit it: I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Carrot Day Creme for more than five years now, and nothing else is as good for my particular skin.  I have rather dry skin and am in my 50s, but have very few lines.  People are shocked by my age because they assume I am at least ten years younger.  This creme is my little secret.  It is a somewhat heavy creme that you can use sparingly.  Some people do not like it because of the initial heavy feel, but it absorbs very well and is not greasy.  My skin also tends to be on the sensitive side, with some rosacea, and this does not irritate my skin at all.  Since this is not found in stores anymore, i am grateful that I can continue to find it via amazon!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works on under eye wrinkles and also for a nice layer on top of my light daily moisturizer I use.  Not a fan of the scent but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> provides great moisure all day long without being greasy or clogging my pores!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing face lotion. Does not leave my face feeling greasy but effectively moisturizes. Makes my face feel wonderful. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I had used it a few years ago, and just needed a thirst-quencher for my skin. I loved one person&#x27;s review that this is like \\&quot;V8 for your skin.\\&quot; I live in TX, and with TX humidity, it would be too heavy for daytime use - it is a thick consistency. I use it at night. I would agree with reviews that say there is an orange color upon application - which makes sense b/c the product is orange. It doesn&#x27;t bug me at night, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with pillowcase staining, etc. but this may be a concern if you&#x27;re looking for a day cream. I use this every couple of days to get some serious hydration, and then stick to a night formular cream with some anti-aging benefits. I love the smell too - it&#x27;s very unique, but a delicious scent :) Oh I should also mention I typically have VERY sensitive skin, and found this is a great product with no adverse reactions or pore-clogging.</li>
    <li> Great product but can only use at night as it leave an orange tinge</li>
    <li> works with my irish senitive skin</li>
    <li> Smells nasty. Totally different product from what I ordered years ago. Spend the 10 extra bucks and buy Origins.</li>
    <li> This cr&amp;egrave;me is too precious to use as a quick hydration, like hand lotion, which must be reapplied every time you wash or sanitize.  I use on my face and feet following a shower to lock in moisture and on my cuticles before bed time to soak overnight.  Very rich without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I had never tried this before, but with such a dry winter, I needed something very rich and effective and a friend recommended carrot creme. This is exactly what I needed and it is worth every penny. My skin is now smooth, moisturized and radiant again. The ingredients are wholesome and it goes on light and fresh. The scent is very unique and took a day or so to get used to, but I would still recommend this product over anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m seeing visible results and my skin feels revived.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees never fails and this stuff is even more proof!!!  Smells so good I want to EAT it out of the jar!!!  Super great moisturizer without being greasy!!!  AAAAA++++++++++++++</li>
    <li> This face cream works well for my skin medium dry and sometimes oily. The smell is not one of the best but the quality of the cream and clean ingredients plus the good price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Love it love it love it. I wish Burt&#x27;s Bees still made it. Thanks for selling it, guys!</li>
    <li> I use this creme daily, and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  inexpensive,  Goes on smoothly, and is very protective.</li>
    <li> The cream has a good texture and a delightful smell. The package is cute, the list of ingredients is reassuring. The container is glass, which I much prefer because there is no concern about leaching from the container into the cream. I have used the cream in the past and had no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and love it. I have normal skin (not oily or dry), so this creme is just right for my skin type. However, I don&#x27;t think it would be great for already oily skin.</li>
    <li> It looks cute with the carrot image but haven&#x27;t tried yet.so at least the size and the appearance is as expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, albeit in different formulas, but I&#x27;ll always use it. It&#x27;s lovely creme and even gives my skin a nice tint during the wintery, pasty white months :)</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff. Awesome moisturizer. Rich but not heavy. I had a hard time finding it in stores and was so happy to find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream I use on my face - it is gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> Used this twice.  Did not like the smell or the texture after application.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this face cream after reading all of the reviews.  Although the smell and feel of the face cream is really great, after about a week of application my face started to become \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; (for lack of better words...).  It felt as if I was developing acne underneath my skin without any redness or irriation.  I stopped using the cream, and the \\&quot;bumpiness\\&quot; went away after a few days.  I&#x27;m assuming that I was allergic to one of the ingredients, but it was a rather atypical reaction.  I have been using the Desert Essence Gentle Nourishing Night Creme instead.  I plan on trying Shikai&#x27;s borage skin care line for my face as well, as the borage dry skin body lotion has done wonders for my dry/eczema-prone skin!</li>
    <li> I was going along happily using the Carrot Nutritive body lotion on my face daily.  I appreciate my skin, I am pretty grateful, but it is sensitive and I would pay more but it seems it like the Carrots.  Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s have decided to raise their prices drastically and discontinue many of their items. They decided to mass produce so they changed their formulas and move away from their philosophy of making products. My carrot body lotion, gone): So now their face products are so similar to every product on the market.  There is nothing new or inventive about Burt&#x27;s Bess new face care line except the price, I have tried it all, don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;As for the Carrot Nutritive Day Creme if goes on thick and feels greasy.  My skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it like the lotion because it is a creme.  So as a day creme I don&#x27;t get it?  Burt were breaking up, I miss you ) ;</li>
    <li> I have been using this ever since it was first produced and along with the night cream (a very greasy but great product) it has kept my skin happy and apparently healthy.  I love the smell of it and how smoothly it goes on, as well as how smooth it makes my skin.  .</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many, many years and I love it.  Be sure you get the carrot DAY creme.  They have night creme too but it is too thick for me.  This product is super.  Gives your skin a nice color, fragrance free and goes on well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations of this product because of the great reviews. This company has definitely changed.&lt;br /&gt;A few words about acne:&lt;br /&gt;Acne is often caused by food allergies and fungal/yeast/candida overgrowth. I discovered that I had a gluten intolerance a few years ago. Scientists say that the gluten molecule is too large to be absorbed through the skin. I say BS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has wheat germ oil in it which made my skin break out horribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, though, my mineral foundation powder looks AMAZING on top of this cream. It was hard to stop using it because my face looked great with makeup on, but was getting worse and worse underneath with every application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Burt&#x27;s Bees is now owned by Clorox. I&#x27;ve returned all the products I&#x27;ve ordered and I am waiting on a refund after a small runaround with the company.</li>
    <li> I have bought this before in the drugstore and I liked it, but this creme is different. I don&#x27;t know why, but it went on my skin very greasy and made my t-zone shiny.  It was not a good look for day!  I primarily use it at night mainly on my neck, but I would not use it as a day cream. It is way too thick and if I were to put sunscreen over it; it would be way more greasy.  I wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate and I have very dry skin.  This product was much thicker than I expected, and it does not make my thirsty skin feel quenched.  But if I apply a lighter, more quenching moisturizer under it, it holds that moisture in all day.  It smells wonderful and applies evenly.</li>
    <li> If you have very dry skin, this is the cream for you. I have been trying to find a cream that will keep my face hydrated all day, with no luck, until I cam across this. It is a little oily at first...but just give it a minute and it&#x27;s fine!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I tend to use it when I&#x27;m not going to wear make up on a particular day. It really moistens the skin and, most importantly, keeps it moist throughout the day. I don&#x27;t recommend using it before makeup application because it is some what thick.  I don&#x27;t think the make up would apply correctly.</li>
    <li> This really helps my dry skin. I Use it every day and have no problems. Really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> So nice and great for the skin the only thing that sucks is that the price keeps going up and up and now I soon won&#x27;t be able to afford it</li>
    <li> Greasy.  Probably good for one&#x27;s skin, and I do intend to use it, but not daily in front of people.  Seems like a lotion mask.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s done wonders for my skin which is on the dry side, keeping wrinkles away!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff, he works outside all day in all weather and this seems to protect his skin from sun/wind etc.</li>
    <li> During the cold Colorado winters my face gets very dry and flaky. I put this on my face before going to bed and it really helps. I have also applied it on my chapped lips and to shaving cuts (once they&#x27;ve scabbed over) and - it may just be my imagination - but it seems to help them heal faster. I used to buy the night creme, but found it left orange stains on my pillow case. I haven&#x27;t noticed that with the day creme.</li>
    <li> Love love love this cream sometimes it can be a little heavy for summer use but it&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizer</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t bring myself to use it anymore.  It smells like baby powder and its a very strong scent.  So strong, even minutes after applying it my boyfriend can smell it.  I will not buy it again.  As far as feel, I think it is just OK.</li>
    <li> The only problem that I have with Burt&#x27;s Bees Carrot Nutritive Day Creme is that when I bought it at a store a month before buying it here the cream was thicker, smelled better and hydrated my skin better then this Burt&#x27;s Bees Carrot Nutritive Day Creme 2.0 version does.&lt;br /&gt;It is still s good product but it has a really hard act to follow up. I don&#x27;t know why Burt&#x27;s Bees decided to change the formula, but I know I preferred the other version better.</li>
    <li> I do not know if I look better; however, this is a creamy lotion, which feels very good on my skin. I use it day and night to keep my face moisturized. I also like the carrot night creme, especially in the winter when my skin is drier. Love the ingredients and no animal testing, the main reason for purchasing.</li>
    <li> I live in Oklahoma .you know where the wind goes sweeping down the plains and drying out my face... This creme keeps my face supple and does not clog up my pores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and will continue as long as they don&#x27;t change the formula. It is great for cold and windy months; it hydrates my skin well and soothes any irritation.</li>
    <li> Experience is very good, worth buying</li>
    <li> The best face creme.  Probably a little heavy for some, but I love how protected my face feels.</li>
