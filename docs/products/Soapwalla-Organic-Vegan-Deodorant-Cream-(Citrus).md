      <li>it&#x27;s nice and light and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>I love everything about this deodorant.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product - have been searching for an alternative to over the counter deodorants - and Soapwalla is sooo much better -</li>
      <li>Pricey for the size but an overall great product!</li>
      <li>im in love</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s not an anti-perspiring and doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful ingredients found in most anti-perspirants.</li>
      <li>Love the original scent, works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>This is honestly THE BEST DEODORANT I have ever tried, and I can tell you this from someone who literally sweats while sitting down..</li>
      <li>I can honestly tell you that I have never been more confident, and even after a hot afternoon run, NO SMELL..</li>
      <li>Most things I&#x27;ve been able to find an easy all-natural, and cruelty free, alternative, but</li>
      <li>def buy more of the original.</li>
      <li>Loving my new Soapwalla Organic/Vegan Deodorant Cream!  </li>
      <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY to me!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have purchased the Citrus scent and it&#x27;s even better than the original.  </li>
      <li>I love Soapwalla deodorant and couldn&#x27;t wait to try the new scent.  </li>
      <li>This is no small feat either as I teach 4-5 year olds in California which means I&#x27;m running around and on my feet for most of my 9 hour shift in our 100+ degree Summer weather.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many natural deodorants over the years.</li>
      <li>I figured that it was probably just some rare reaction.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for making such an amazing product!</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth (just have to get used to applying the deodorant cream by hand), has a refreshing lemon scent, and keeps you dry all day.</li>
      <li>Applying the cream will take some getting used to, but the smell is nice and once the cream absorbs I&#x27;m pretty dry all day.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t experienced anything yet, and honestly I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about this deodorant.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the clean fresh scent of the citrus, it smells like lemons on a summer breeze.  </li>
      <li>lol i went to the gym and worked out hard</li>
      <li>This really works!  </li>
      <li>This deodorant really works!</li>
      <li>Most of them did not work for me at all or required reapplication several times a day.</li>
      <li>But, I would say try crystal first.</li>
      <li>This product has held up during my hot yoga class and during a day of running errands on a hot summer day in Florida.</li>
      <li>This is a first for me.</li>
      <li>thanks Soapwalla!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a few days now, and I am pleasantly surprised with how effective it is!  </li>
      <li>I was never confident with chemical deodorants, because soon after application I did not smell as fresh as I would have liked to.</li>
      <li>Works, but I fear that the baking soda is responsible for the irritation and redness.</li>
      <li>This really works.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>You can re-apply at anytime during the day, it&#x27;s a nice creamy consistency, and it will last several months because you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
      <li>It does cost more than a typical deodorant stick</li>
      <li>I woke up the next morning and still smelled fresh.</li>
      <li>but if you are looking for something all natural this is it!</li>
      <li>Finally, a natural deodorant that works!</li>
      <li>I seriously had my doubts that this all natural deodorant would work, but it is simply amazing.</li>
      <li>After trying several other organic deodorants, this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>While leaving in a fairly hippy place, this hasn&#x27;t been too big of a problem, but I had to go back to regular deodorant while living in Albuquerque, where my natural odor was not appreciated.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many natural deodorants in the past with no luck.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the citrus for about 4 days so far, but it really works!</li>
      <li>and after I workout I typically have significant body odor</li>
      <li>For 2 days I worked in 85-90 degree weather with very high humidity without a shower, at the end of the 2nd day</li>
      <li>So far no rash.</li>
      <li>If you are willing to risk $20 and a few days recovering from a possible rash, it might be worth trying if you want to avoid the Aluminum Zirconium thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve biked in hot humid weather, and spent hours in the garden, and one application lasts all day, even seeming to reduce perspiration as well as stop odor.</li>
      <li>The texture and applying deo with your fingertips takes a little getting used to but it quickly absorbs into the skin and does&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I live with two male teenagers and a soccer-playing husband and we all, (and my nose) swear(s) by the stuff!</li>
      <li>I did note that many people said they got a rash from this product, so I have been careful to use lotion under my arms after showering, then use small amounts of the deodorant.</li>
      <li>I was starting to think that I was just wasting my money with natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>Have finally found a natural deodorant that works.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this as a viable alternative to anyone that is concerned about aluminum (heavy metals) absorbing into their body, the only suggestion I would make is that Soapwalla somehow formulate this product to work with an applicator similar to the big name deodorant companies, but it is not a deal breaker.</li>

    <li> Have tried EVERY organic deodorant in whole foods and Amazon (an expensive experience) and this won me over. Went for a run in Central Park and I came home and was not at all stinky!!  This is a first for me. Love that it&#x27;s not an anti-perspiring and doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful ingredients found in most anti-perspirants. Pricey for the size but an overall great product!</li>
    <li> Deodorant cream by soapwallakitchen is an amazing product that is a pleasure to use. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love Soapwalla deodorant and couldn&#x27;t wait to try the new scent.  I like the original scent better, but the citrus is great for a guy and it still works great!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product without aluminum for the obvious health reasons, I am a male and struggled to find something that was not flowery or feminine, so I  gave the citrus scent Soapwalla cream a try.  What a pleasant surprise! For 2 days I worked in 85-90 degree weather with very high humidity without a shower, at the end of the 2nd day no body odor, just a nice light citrus scent ! (I did reapply at the start of day 2)  I would highly recommend this as a viable alternative to anyone that is concerned about aluminum (heavy metals) absorbing into their body, the only suggestion I would make is that Soapwalla somehow formulate this product to work with an applicator similar to the big name deodorant companies, but it is not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> Loving my new Soapwalla Organic/Vegan Deodorant Cream!  I have switched to all non-toxic personal care products and deodorant that works is hard to find.  Well not any more, Soapwalla works like magic!  The lovely citrus scent is a bonus!  Wonderful product- thanks Soapwalla!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the clean fresh scent of the citrus, it smells like lemons on a summer breeze.  The texture and applying deo with your fingertips takes a little getting used to but it quickly absorbs into the skin and does&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.  After trying any natural deodorants and being disappointed I put this one to the test at my son&#x27;s lacrosse tournament, at the field from 8:00a.m. in the blazing southern sun, toting equipment, chairs, water and power food for the team back and forth between fields, when I left the field damp with sweat at 5:00 that afternoon to change and head out to dinner I sniffed and didn&#x27;t even need a touch-up on the deodorant.</li>
    <li> Works, but I fear that the baking soda is responsible for the irritation and redness.</li>
    <li> This really works. NO DEODORANT HAS EVER. EVER. worked this amazing im in love lol i went to the gym and worked out hard and i came back smelling AMAZING everyone else noticed too. I tried every deodorant out there this is it</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product!!!!!  I have tried so many natural deodorants in the past with no luck.  They left me smelling within a few hours of application.  This product is amazing!  I like to run and after I workout I typically have significant body odor but I did not even smell after running 3 miles in 88 degree temperatures outside using this product.  This really works!  I have thrown away all other deodorants and will use only this brand. This may be a small container but a little bit goes a long way.  Thanks so much for making such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Stop using commercial antiperspirant and buy this immediately. The only alternative to the chemical stuff that&#x27;s ever worked. I live with two male teenagers and a soccer-playing husband and we all, (and my nose) swear(s) by the stuff!</li>
    <li> After trying several other organic deodorants, this is by far my favorite. It works very well. I use Weleda Citrus Deodorant spray in addition as needed throughout the day. I&#x27;ve had no problems with skin irritation, although I did use a clay mask to purify the skin prior to using this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Works all day long, and as a man I prefer the Lemon scent to the lavender.</li>
    <li> I love this product - have been searching for an alternative to over the counter deodorants - and Soapwalla is sooo much better - does the job without all the chemicals - great to have this option!!!</li>
    <li> Finally, a natural deodorant that works! I&#x27;ve only been using the citrus for about 4 days so far, but it really works! I&#x27;ve biked in hot humid weather, and spent hours in the garden, and one application lasts all day, even seeming to reduce perspiration as well as stop odor. I did note that many people said they got a rash from this product, so I have been careful to use lotion under my arms after showering, then use small amounts of the deodorant. So far no rash. I am really happy with Soapwalla.</li>
    <li> 7/21/15 Review update: I used this deodorant at a music festival this weekend. The temperatures were in the 90s during the day and I danced at night. I woke up the next morning and still smelled fresh. I am very impressed with this deodorant.  I have tried so many natural deodorants over the years. Most of them did not work for me at all or required reapplication several times a day. While leaving in a fairly hippy place, this hasn&#x27;t been too big of a problem, but I had to go back to regular deodorant while living in Albuquerque, where my natural odor was not appreciated. I was starting to think that I was just wasting my money with natural deodorant. This product actually works. I am thrilled.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working well but is causing some irritation. Will see how it goes!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews that say this stuff gives you a rash. I figured that it was probably just some rare reaction. But, after one use it produced a pretty bad one. It seemed to work fairly well as a deodorant but not as well as crystal. If you are willing to risk $20 and a few days recovering from a possible rash, it might be worth trying if you want to avoid the Aluminum Zirconium thing. But, I would say try crystal first.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review on 6/29/2015 about this deodorant, and my opinion stands STRONG still!! This is honestly THE BEST DEODORANT I have ever tried, and I can tell you this from someone who literally sweats while sitting down..I was never confident with chemical deodorants, because soon after application I did not smell as fresh as I would have liked to. I can honestly tell you that I have never been more confident, and even after a hot afternoon run, NO SMELL..I am still amazed how well it works. I now have one at home, and one in my purse. You can re-apply at anytime during the day, it&#x27;s a nice creamy consistency, and it will last several months because you don&#x27;t need a lot. WORTH EVERY PENNY to me!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  For me, it has worked beyond expectations as a deodorant!</li>
    <li> I have been using Soapwalla deodorant cream for a while now and have loved it from the beginning.  This is the first time I have purchased the Citrus scent and it&#x27;s even better than the original.  I love the wonderful fragrance - it&#x27;s nice and light and refreshing.  This is one product I will never stop using.</li>
    <li> This deodorant really works! Took a 1 1/2 hour cardio class and this deodorant cream held up beautifully.  Have finally found a natural deodorant that works.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I seriously had my doubts that this all natural deodorant would work, but it is simply amazing. It works just as well as regular, chemical deodorants w/o the harmful chemicals. It goes on smooth (just have to get used to applying the deodorant cream by hand), has a refreshing lemon scent, and keeps you dry all day. I didn&#x27;t even feel any perspiration or moisture under my arms during the entire day. It does cost more than a typical deodorant stick but if you are looking for something all natural this is it!</li>
    <li> *Update! I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for about two weeks now and have just started to develop a slight rash under my arms. It is very faint and not painful or irritating. I wear sleeveless shirts to work all the time and no one has noticed the redness either.*  Ever since a coworker was diagnosed with cancer, I have been fanatically researching carcinogens and chemicals that I surround myself with. Most things I&#x27;ve been able to find an easy all-natural, and cruelty free, alternative, but deodorant has been a big issue for me. I&#x27;ve always been a heavy sweater, having to use &amp;#34;maximum strength&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;, and even some men&#x27;s deodorant (since they almost always work stronger than those extra strength women&#x27;s ones). Because of this, no natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used has ever worked. Soapwalla was completely different! I love everything about this deodorant. It works all day and I can still smell a slight citrus scent at the end of the day. I use very little, only about a pea size or less, and it still manages to work as though I&#x27;ve been re-applying it all day long. This is no small feat either as I teach 4-5 year olds in California which means I&#x27;m running around and on my feet for most of my 9 hour shift in our 100+ degree Summer weather. This stuff works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used! The reviews about the rash had me worried but I haven&#x27;t experienced anything yet, and honestly I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about this deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love the original scent, works amazingly well. so does the citrus scent but irritates my under arms. makes them itchy n red.&lt;br /&gt;Will def buy more of the original.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days now, and I am pleasantly surprised with how effective it is!  I have tried a few organic deodorants in the past, and I&#x27;ve always been left feeling less than fresh.  This product has held up during my hot yoga class and during a day of running errands on a hot summer day in Florida. Applying the cream will take some getting used to, but the smell is nice and once the cream absorbs I&#x27;m pretty dry all day. I did have one small patch of skin that seemed a little irritated the first two days, but it seems to have cleared up.  Overall I am happy and smelling great!</li>
