      <li>Love the product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This was not an effective product for me.</li>
      <li>Use your own hair conditioner as your shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>I also use the aftershave powder and the mix of the two has made shaving very easy.</li>
      <li>It easily clogged our razors (Gilette Mach 3 - I tried doing the DE razor scene, but it didn&#x27;t work out too well for me!).</li>
      <li>No rash...leaves skin smooth!</li>
      <li>A time ago I bought it for my husband and he fell in love with this creme.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product...  </li>
      <li>Try this product out or do what I suggested above and find out for yourself what works best for you!</li>
      <li>works so well and helps with razor bumps :)</li>
      <li>Love the product, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>It was ok.  </li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t believe it at first, since I had been through so many &amp;#34;sure thing&amp;#34; remedies to no avail.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more labor intensive than hitting the pump on the coochy bottle, but the results are far superior.</li>
      <li>However, I will give you these tips to get the best shaving results (meaning less bumps and redness). 1.</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t lather up and isn&#x27;t smooth shave.</li>
      <li>I can wear shorts and dresses again, and don&#x27;t have to put cover up all over my legs just to feel comfortable.</li>
      <li>A dime-size amount lathers into a significant portion w/ a shaving brush.</li>
      <li>For those of us that really do have true razor burn with redness, bumps, and even bleeding, this product is ok.  </li>
      <li>And no ugly bumps</li>
      <li>First day was fine</li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff, really minimizes razor burn</li>
      <li>so it is economical as well.</li>
      <li>But I had other bottles with good pumps and we use them now.</li>
      <li>It does the exact same thing as my own hair conditioner (which is cheaper) or even coconut oil.  </li>
      <li>Smells light and pretty, my whole body has never been so calm, soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It really does help protect against razor burn, and leaves skin super smooth &amp; soft.</li>
      <li>I have had better luck with Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s shaving creams, particularly the avocado one.</li>
      <li>this cream really helped!</li>
      <li>Works much better than regular shave cream or gel.</li>
      <li>Gets the job done exactly like it says.</li>
      <li>Works better than regular shaving cream but still have the bumbs.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I suggest taking a shower first, drying off then applying the cream and letting it sit for a minute or two.</li>
      <li>With new razors, the second use and on is better  4.</li>
      <li>This stuff is honestly life changing, and I would recommend to anyone suffering from whatever the hell those little cursed bumps are.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Love this product for shaving, helps to keep skin irritation to a minimal.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Leaving it on for a minute makes the hair softer and much easier to shave.</li>
      <li>Apply warm water to the skin area for a few minutes before shaving.  </li>
      <li>I used to only be able to shave once a week which obviously posed a problem on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular product.</li>
      <li>Since my skin is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>Lastly, be sure to pat dry razor and store in a dry location.  </li>
      <li>It wont work as well if you use it in the shower or if your skin is super wet.</li>
      <li>and they are left feeling really soft.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how big the bottle is!</li>
      <li>Disappointing considering the price point, good thing I like the product.</li>

<li> I usually shave almost daily and this large container lasts me over a year</li>
<li> I can shave every other day which was completely out of the question before.</li>
<li> But when I was younger and less busy, it worked well.  </li>
<li> It shipped quickly, however, when it arrived the pump was completely broken.</li>
<li> I only have a problem with the pump - since they change from white pumt to this black ones -</li>
<li> Pat dry shaved area and apply a dermatologist recomended over the counter skin lotion.  </li>
<li> If you can find it, use a single blade razor.  </li>
<li> A 16oz bottle will last a very long time - a little goes a long ways.  </li>
<li> So, I&#x27;m not really one to write reviews, but considering this shaving cream drastically improved my quality of life (not an exaggeration)</li>
<li> I always always get razor burn, ingrown hairs when I shave &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and also on my legs if I don&#x27;t shave carefully.</li>
<li> since I started shaving my legs, I would develop little red bumps from the base of my legs to the top of my thighs.</li>
<li> but I think this bottle will last at least 2 months.</li>
<li> it was down hill from there.</li>
<li> Every home remedy from coconut oil to black soap.</li>
<li> Just a few tips I thought id share.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this shave creme for the past few years &amp; I won&#x27;t shave with anything else.</li>
<li> For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t have those ugly little red bumps all over my legs making me look like some diseased animal.</li>
<li> So PLEASE, do yourself a favor and at least try it.</li>
<li> I ran out of this stuff for a month and my legs immediately went back to looking like I had the chicken pox.</li>
<li> Really not better than soap and water!</li>
<li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always broken out really bad under my arms and</li>
<li> bikini line is spotless, which I thought was impossible without waxing.</li>
<li> It was so bad I was too embarrassed to even wear shorts</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does a good job for what she needs and I use it for shaving my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always broken out really bad under my arms and this cream really helped! I advise anyone to buy it that breaks out a lot. Great product!</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. A time ago I bought it for my husband and he fell in love with this creme. He doesn&#x27;t use anything else. I only have a problem with the pump - since they change from white pumt to this black ones - it is not working well. But I had other bottles with good pumps and we use them now. I still give 5 stars because it is not such a big deal. Creme is very-very good. You wont&#x27; regret.</li>
    <li> Must have!!!! You will never need another shaving cream ever againg.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  Had to go out and buy something else to put it in.</li>
    <li> For those of us that really do have true razor burn with redness, bumps, and even bleeding, this product is ok.  It does the exact same thing as my own hair conditioner (which is cheaper) or even coconut oil.  These products improve your skin but unfortunetally, there is still no cure, as my dermatologist will tell you.  However, I will give you these tips to get the best shaving results (meaning less bumps and redness). 1. If you can find it, use a single blade razor.  2. Never use any one elses razor!  3. With new razors, the second use and on is better  4. Never shave going against your hair growths direction (unfortunataly, it&#x27;s not the closest shave).  5. Apply warm water to the skin area for a few minutes before shaving.  6. Use your own hair conditioner as your shaving cream.  7.  Pat dry shaved area and apply a dermatologist recomended over the counter skin lotion.  8. Lastly, be sure to pat dry razor and store in a dry location.  Give this a try for atleast a month.&lt;br /&gt;Now, do I do all this?  Nope, who has the time!...But when I was younger and less busy, it worked well.  This is just my experience and we&#x27;re all different.  Try this product out or do what I suggested above and find out for yourself what works best for you!</li>
    <li> It works so perfectly smoothness after shave. Although it gives me problem on a female area. Since my skin is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Smells light and pretty, my whole body has never been so calm, soft and smooth. Definitely will repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does help with razor burn and bumps. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the pump breaking. I also use the aftershave powder and the mix of the two has made shaving very easy. It smells really great too.</li>
    <li> works so well and helps with razor bumps :)</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used for my &amp;#34;coochy&amp;#34; &amp; butt. I suggest taking a shower first, drying off then applying the cream and letting it sit for a minute or two. It wont work as well if you use it in the shower or if your skin is super wet. Leaving it on for a minute makes the hair softer and much easier to shave. I also recommend shaving every day or every two days because that&#x27;s what helps me prevent ingrown hairs. The hair cant curl back on itself it you dont let it grow. Just a few tips I thought id share.</li>
    <li> I like the way it works but when using it for my the vaginal area I still ended up getting razor bumps and I even used to the spray that&#x27;s supposed to help with itching. First day was fine it was down hill from there. I do like to use it as shaving cream for my legs and they are left feeling really soft.</li>
    <li> This was not an effective product for me. It led to razor burn and ingrown hairs in the &amp;#34;coochy&amp;#34; area. It easily clogged our razors (Gilette Mach 3 - I tried doing the DE razor scene, but it didn&#x27;t work out too well for me!). I have had better luck with Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s shaving creams, particularly the avocado one. It doesn&#x27;t clog our razors, doesn&#x27;t cause razor burn, and doesn&#x27;t promote ingrown hairs anywhere on my body. One tub of it lasts my husband and I around 5 months. A dime-size amount lathers into a significant portion w/ a shaving brush. It&#x27;s more labor intensive than hitting the pump on the coochy bottle, but the results are far superior. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular product. I gave it a two stars only because the bottle really is as massive as others say.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this, it doesn&#x27;t lather up and isn&#x27;t smooth shave. Feels like conditioner on the legs.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave creme I have ever found. I usually shave almost daily and this large container lasts me over a year so it is economical as well.</li>
    <li> Love the product! It shipped quickly, however, when it arrived the pump was completely broken. Disappointing considering the price point, good thing I like the product.</li>
    <li> Really not better than soap and water!</li>
    <li> Best shave cream ever</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff, really minimizes razor burn</li>
    <li> The greatest stuff for guys to shave with. Will never shave with anything else</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! No rash...leaves skin smooth! And no ugly bumps</li>
    <li> Works better than regular shaving cream but still have the bumbs.</li>
    <li> I have been using Coochy creme to shave my legs for about 5 years now.  A 16oz bottle will last a very long time - a little goes a long ways.  It makes my skin feel softer afterwards than regular shaving creams ever did.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product...  Since I&#x27;ve used it, I have not encountered any razor bumps or ingrown hairs.  Plus it smells great and perfect for people with sensitive skin, like myself.  I also have curly hair which is prone to ingrown hairs.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has the same issues with shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shave creme for the past few years &amp; I won&#x27;t shave with anything else. It really does help protect against razor burn, and leaves skin super smooth &amp; soft. Highly recommended! Amazon always has the best price.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. Can&#x27;t believe you can&#x27;t find this in stores.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product for shaving, helps to keep skin irritation to a minimal.</li>
    <li> Works much better than regular shave cream or gel. I was surprised at how big the bottle is! I always always get razor burn, ingrown hairs when I shave &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and also on my legs if I don&#x27;t shave carefully. When I used coochy cream, virtually no ingrown hairs. I did get irritation, but that was because I used a crappy razor. Will be buying again but I think this bottle will last at least 2 months.</li>
    <li> Not all its cracked up to be. Didn&#x27;t help with razor burn</li>
    <li> It was ok.  Did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m not really one to write reviews, but considering this shaving cream drastically improved my quality of life (not an exaggeration) I feel one is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started shaving my legs, I would develop little red bumps from the base of my legs to the top of my thighs. It was so bad I was too embarrassed to even wear shorts let alone show my legs at all. There&#x27;s still some debate as to what it actually is, some people have told me its razor burn while othes have said they&#x27;re just ingrown hairs since they come either immediately after I shave or days after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. Every home remedy from coconut oil to black soap. I even tried squirting rubbing alcohol on my legs after shaving to prevent the red bumps (don&#x27;t try that, it hurts and didn&#x27;t work AT ALL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a friend told me about coochy creme. I honestly didn&#x27;t believe it at first, since I had been through so many &amp;#34;sure thing&amp;#34; remedies to no avail. But this was different. For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t have those ugly little red bumps all over my legs making me look like some diseased animal. I can wear shorts and dresses again, and don&#x27;t have to put cover up all over my legs just to feel comfortable. I can shave every other day which was completely out of the question before. I used to only be able to shave once a week which obviously posed a problem on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bikini line is spotless, which I thought was impossible without waxing. I ran out of this stuff for a month and my legs immediately went back to looking like I had the chicken pox. This stuff is honestly life changing, and I would recommend to anyone suffering from whatever the hell those little cursed bumps are. So PLEASE, do yourself a favor and at least try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done exactly like it says.</li>
    <li> I always used to get shave bumps in my armpits but with thus shaving cream I never do. Love it!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your accommodations. I appreciate your customer service! I had a good experience.  And this product is awesome! Thanks!</li>
