      <li>You don&#x27;t need much to smell great</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>And I love that my husband loves it.</li>
      <li>This Perfume Oil is now my favorite.  </li>
      <li>read about it on a blog and am so glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>and I love this as Rosie Jane is conscientious about the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is more of a &amp;#34;knock</li>
      <li>I took a chance buying it because of the reviews and I like essence oils better than perfume.</li>
      <li>and that is more valuable than toxic perfume</li>
      <li>so I would expect to pay more for it.  </li>
      <li>Some people remarked that it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming</li>
      <li>I love the rollerball.</li>
      <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>The product itself smells wonderful, but the advertisement does not say how big it is except that the shipping weight is 4 ounces.  </li>
      <li>I have so many people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
      <li>Strong perfume gives me a headache, but this is very light.</li>
      <li>The roll-on bottle is also super handy to carry with you.</li>
      <li>This is very sweet and floral to the point of being cloying.  </li>
      <li>Such a lovely scent and great travel size</li>
      <li>The pear blossom is way too strong for my liking and cheapens the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I am prone to getting headaches from fragrances that are too strong.  </li>
      <li>When you first put it on, jasmine is super strong but it mellows out very quickly and blends with your own chemistry to create a beautiful, soft scent.</li>
      <li>New favorite, love it!</li>
      <li>Overall a great experience.</li>
      <li>So refreshing and feminine but not too powerful.  </li>
      <li>It feels more natural and just keeps smelling better and better as the day goes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this amazing oil, and you think I would get used to it, but I still get surprised and pleased when people realize that fabulous smell they&#x27;ve been noticing is coming from me!!!</li>
      <li>Happens so often because the scent is soft, fresh and lingers pleasantly.</li>
      <li>light and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>The jasmine is so overpowered by the pear blossom and that says a lot since jasmine is typically pretty strong.</li>
      <li>I received this product quickly.  </li>
      <li>It smells clean and fresh, very feminine, and lasts all day!</li>
      <li>I am a Jo Malone Badil Lime sort of gal, so take this for what it&#x27;s worth but this scent smells cadaverous to me.  </li>
      <li>It smells like a fresh summer day at the beach.  </li>
      <li>It is fruity and just the right amount of scent.</li>
      <li>but I love all the individual components (fresh cut grass, jasmine, vanilla, etc.)</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I get for straying, listening to reviews that are off the mark and buying a fragrance without smelling it first.  </li>
      <li>As nice as it smells, I would not have spent the money on the miniscule amount that you receive.  </li>
      <li>I also love that it&#x27;s made from essential oils.</li>
      <li>lasts the whole day!</li>
      <li>I prefer soft, clean scents.</li>
      <li>Pure Grace by Philosophy, Heaven by Gap and Viva La Juicy by Juicy Couture.</li>
      <li>I will say that it was shipped fast and made it on time.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a light floral fragrance.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how it smells really.</li>
      <li>It is not overpowering and really smells like flowers.</li>
      <li>I have a deviated septum and consequently don&#x27;t smell very well</li>
      <li>It would help me out with the need to scrub my skin clean so no trace of this scent is left.  </li>
      <li>In the past, I have loved the following scents (maybe this will help you decide whether you will want to try it or not):</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s unbelievable fresh, clean and feminine.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say, this perfume smells amazing!</li>
      <li>I am frugal, so of course I wish it was bigger, but I will definitely buy it again because it is such a lovely scent.  </li>
      <li>It smells exactly like these tiny , scented dolls in a bottle from the sixties callec &amp;#34;Little Kiddles.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>First of all, my bad for buying this scent based on reviews on Makeupalley.com saying it reminded them of the beach and more importantly referencing Monyette, which is my all time fave.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to stop wearing it when I can.the scent is like a soft floraly smell that lingers softly because it&#x27;s an oil based product.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a natural perfume and read a review about this in one my magazines.</li>
      <li>Such a nice scent,  subtle but lasts all day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is something wonderfully different about using pure essential oils versus traditional alcohol-based fragrance.</li>
      <li>I was a little concerned about buying perfume without smelling it first</li>
      <li>Generally it&#x27;s after I&#x27;ve walked by a second time</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am 41 and have never found a scent I am crazy about ... until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started wearing Leila Lou last week and it&#x27;s unbelievable fresh, clean and feminine.  When you first put it on, jasmine is super strong but it mellows out very quickly and blends with your own chemistry to create a beautiful, soft scent. I also love that it&#x27;s made from essential oils. You don&#x27;t need much to smell great and I think my roller ball will last a few months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something wonderfully different about using pure essential oils versus traditional alcohol-based fragrance. It feels more natural and just keeps smelling better and better as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the packaging is minimal (just the fragrance wrapped in thick cardstock and tied with twine) and I love this as Rosie Jane is conscientious about the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - In the past, I have loved the following scents (maybe this will help you decide whether you will want to try it or not): Pure Grace by Philosophy, Heaven by Gap and Viva La Juicy by Juicy Couture.</li>
    <li> I love the way this perfume oil smells! It&#x27;s not loud or overpowering, but it lasts a long time. Strong perfume gives me a headache, but this is very light.</li>
    <li> Refreshing fragrance.  This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; perfume.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. It is not overpowering and really smells like flowers. Would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a light floral fragrance.</li>
    <li> light and fresh smelling. lasts the whole day! women and men love the scent and want to know where they can purchase it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how amazing this is. Why is my mouth watering. Maybe it&#x27;s the nectarine. I am adding this to my list of staples. A must have especially for spring and summer.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my daughter...she loves it</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a stocking stuffer for my GF for Xmas and she is pleased by it. I have a deviated septum and consequently don&#x27;t smell very well so I don&#x27;t know how it smells really. I will say that it was shipped fast and made it on time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  So refreshing and feminine but not too powerful.  It lasts all day long without re-applying.  I am so happy!  Strangers have stopped me asking me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> Can I just say, underwhelmed?  First of all, my bad for buying this scent based on reviews on Makeupalley.com saying it reminded them of the beach and more importantly referencing Monyette, which is my all time fave.  Guess what? It&#x27;s nothing like that. Not even close. More like Miss Marissa by Ebba gone wrong.  The pear blossom is way too strong for my liking and cheapens the fragrance.  You get a glimpse of the nectarine and grass for about a minute after you initially put it on. The jasmine is so overpowered by the pear blossom and that says a lot since jasmine is typically pretty strong. Where o&#x27; where is the vanilla and white musk?  Still waiting for you to appear.  It would help me out with the need to scrub my skin clean so no trace of this scent is left.  That&#x27;s what I get for straying, listening to reviews that are off the mark and buying a fragrance without smelling it first.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes! It is fruity and just the right amount of scent. I love the rollerball. This is my go-to perfume and always order when I start to get low!!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume.  Such a distinct yet light and floral without being sickening.</li>
    <li> Quite possibly my favorite fragrance! Very light and airy.</li>
    <li> My friend had told me it was an earthy fragrance and it smelled wonderful on her.  Sadly, it was way too sweet for me and I will give it to my friend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural perfume and read a review about this in one my magazines. I was a little concerned about buying perfume without smelling it first but I love all the individual components (fresh cut grass, jasmine, vanilla, etc.) so I took a chance. Needless to say, this perfume smells amazing! Some people remarked that it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re not used to essential oils (as opposed to lab-created scents in mainstream perfumes). The roll-on bottle is also super handy to carry with you.</li>
    <li> This scent is very strong and flowery. I took a chance buying it because of the reviews and I like essence oils better than perfume. A little goes a long way and it lasts all day so I gave it three stars. I prefer soft, clean scents. This is more of a &amp;#34;knock you out at the florist sinus headache&amp;#34; kind of scent. Not for me. My loss.</li>
    <li> When I read all the reviews of this &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  Oy.  This is very sweet and floral to the point of being cloying.  It smells exactly like these tiny , scented dolls in a bottle from the sixties callec &amp;#34;Little Kiddles.&amp;#34;  I am a Jo Malone Badil Lime sort of gal, so take this for what it&#x27;s worth but this scent smells cadaverous to me.  Maybe some will like it.</li>
    <li> I have so many people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. And I love that my husband loves it. It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find one that men like as well and not perfumey. The grass notes but be the turnon for my husband! lol</li>
    <li> The best!!!  I am prone to getting headaches from fragrances that are too strong.  Leila Lou not only smells wonderful, but it also doesn&#x27;t cause the headaches.  It smells like a fresh summer day at the beach.  Love, love, love!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this amazing oil, and you think I would get used to it, but I still get surprised and pleased when people realize that fabulous smell they&#x27;ve been noticing is coming from me!!! Happens so often because the scent is soft, fresh and lingers pleasantly. Generally it&#x27;s after I&#x27;ve walked by a second time or so I hear the &amp;#34;it&#x27;s you!&amp;#34;  I like the fact that it&#x27;s not so obvious or obnoxious that people smell it before they see me. But they sure don&#x27;t forget it once they smell it! I may be breaking the perfume/oil laws but I plan to wear this all year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about it on a blog and am so glad I bought it. I&#x27;m considering getting the other Leila Lou scent as well, but I&#x27;m thinking maybe I shouldn&#x27;t mess with perfection! For reference, the only other perfume/oil I wear is Marc Jacobs Daisy.</li>
    <li> Read my review on the Rosie Jane perils Lou perfume</li>
    <li> Such a lovely scent and great travel size</li>
    <li> Amazing fragrance! Get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff!  It smells so wonderful on her.  When she runs out I&#x27;ll definitely buy her another bottle.  :)</li>
    <li> I received this product quickly.  This Perfume Oil is now my favorite.  It smells clean and fresh, very feminine, and lasts all day! Really happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife who had already tried it in a store and loved it.</li>
    <li> Seller was extremely helpful, and the perfume exceeded my expectations. Overall a great experience.</li>
    <li> I would wear it every day if possible. I get a lot of compliments on it.the only person who does not like it is my mom.so unfortunately I don&#x27;t get to wear it that often for I take care of her. I don&#x27;t know whyshe doesn&#x27;t take to it but everybody else does.so I&#x27;m not going to stop wearing it when I can.the scent is like a soft floraly smell that lingers softly because it&#x27;s an oil based product.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the bottle is very tiny.  However, it is all essential oil inside and that is more valuable than toxic perfume so I would expect to pay more for it.  The scent is absolutely beautiful.  It smells like lilacs and pears to me.  The scent is very delicate but lasts for at least 6 hours.  I have received compliments on the fragrance.  I am frugal, so of course I wish it was bigger, but I will definitely buy it again because it is such a lovely scent.  Also it isn&#x27;t poison.</li>
    <li> The product itself smells wonderful, but the advertisement does not say how big it is except that the shipping weight is 4 ounces.  It comes in a tiny 0.17 oz  bottle and I am not impressed with that.  As nice as it smells, I would not have spent the money on the miniscule amount that you receive.  It may state somewhere in the Amazon description how big the bottle is, but not clearly enough for me to find it anywhere.</li>
    <li> Such a nice scent,  subtle but lasts all day. Most compliments have ever gotten about a perfume! New favorite, love it!</li>
    <li> A great clean smell that is not overpowering in any way. perfect for anytime or place. just what I was looking for.</li>
</ol>
