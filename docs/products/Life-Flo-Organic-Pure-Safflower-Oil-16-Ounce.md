<li> and i saw this and was confused, sorry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great base for essential oils. I mix it with sweet almond oil to lighten the texture. Wonderful moisturizer!</li>
    <li> The quality of this oil is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Like this product feels good on my natural kinky hair, love it. I mix this oil with olive, vitamin E, grape seed, jojoba, coconut oil and it is a great hair moisturizer for black hair.</li>
    <li> Used in soap, worked great...</li>
    <li> Too much money for 20g</li>
    <li> I use this for homemade skin care products.  Works much better than jojoba oil at a better price.  Non-comedogenic which is a huge plus (unlike jojoba, olive, and coconut oils).  The texture of salves is velvety when made with this oil.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This oil is very nice for your skin</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer, it absorbs so quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and moisturized without feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve even started using it for making bath bombs, and that is working wonderfully! Definitely will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to add into my mixture of body creams.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair &amp; skin extremely soft. I will order more</li>
    <li> this oil absorbs really well and does not have a smell, I make my own skin cream and I like the price and amount in the bottle, great value!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my natural hair and i love it. Definitely one to try if your natural and looking for a little extra moisture in your hair.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my skin while in the shower.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for oil-cleansing (with castor oil) to remove my makeup, and I also use a small amount to keep the ends of my hair soft, as well as a few drops in my moisturizer at night. This is a great oil for a good price; it does what it says it will, there&#x27;s little to no smell, and it&#x27;s very silky. I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome it really works nice in my lotion bars and soaps it has a real nice condition factor</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair and to use as a ingredient for body lotion. Will order again. Thank you !!! !</li>
    <li> I use this oil after getting out of the shower if my skin is dry, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, but leaves my skin soft of ages after</li>
    <li> I purchased this safflower oil to use  for my hair and skin. It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and soaks in nicely.</li>
    <li> After much research about the study showing that high linoleic safflower oill decreases belly fat, I bought this product.  The safflower oil available in supermarkets, for cooking, is high in oleic  acid, and is not what was used in the study.  Although this product seems to be labeled as a skin care product, it is pure and of nutritional quality.  Of course, it must be refridgerated after opening. I take 1 teaspoon twice a day, which is basically the dosage used in the study.  It is flavorless, and I just swallow it fast.  I have only been doing this for a couple weeks, so the jury is still out on it&#x27;s effectiveness.  I am hoping this helps to reduce omentum fat, and lower my blood sugar, as I am a prediabetic.  After my research, this is deffinately the least expensive way to take high linoleic acid safflower oil.  The capsules from the health food stores, and SafSlim are way more expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with some other oils I purchase to moisturize my hair.  It seems to be doing the trick.  I have no complains as of now.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to make soap with but last night I was presented another option- I began making fajitas for dinner and realized too late that I was out of Canola Oil. Rather than using Olive Oil, I searched through my arsenal of soap oils and decided on the Safflower Oil. The fajitas tasted AMAZING! So, great for soap, great in the kitchen :D</li>
    <li> the oil goes on light but it moistures so well. I use it right after showers and the scent is very light. I use it in my hair as well. I had some dark stretch marks and after using for a month I noticed they are fading and smoother to the touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this safflower oil a few times. It is nice, I felt like it more coated my hair, instead of absorbing into it. My hair looked shiny and felt soft, great sealant. So I have decided to use it as a combination oil.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping reduce tremors</li>
    <li> I love this oil....I am using it for my hair...Along with other oils it it really do wonders for it....I have no complaints..I will buying again</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin in lieu of chemical-filled moisturizer. It is lower priced and better for you! If you suffer from very dry skin as I do, you&#x27;ll want to use this after your shower or bath.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.also received really quick</li>
    <li> My son had eczema when he was around 3 months old. I started putting this in his bath every night and then moisturizing him with lotion while his skin was still damp and oily. His eczema cleared up completely after a month or so and I stopped using this in his bath...the eczema has not returned. I can&#x27;t say this was the magic remedy, but I feel it was a helpful part of our routine.</li>
    <li> The product is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this oil with a lot of different esstential oils and really like it. I mostly use it with oils for freshing diaper pails and garbage cans on a cotton ball and it is a very good base oil.</li>
    <li> My skin was very dry, I heard that safflower oil is extremely good for the skin so purchased the Life-Flo Safflower oil. I absolutely love it. I have been using it everyday on my legs and on my face at night, I can&#x27;t believe the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> this is not what I wanted, my fault, I wanted oil to use in my citrus slaw recipe and i saw this and was confused, sorry.</li>
    <li> Love it for my baths.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great quality</li>
    <li> This is a great oil for you skin and hair. I use this in a mix with castor oil and lavender and tea tree oil to clean my face. I also use this as an ingredient in a hair oil that I make.</li>
    <li> Pretty much self explanatory. Wasn&#x27;t rancid, seems to be what it says it is (I&#x27;m not an oil expert though I do make professional products with them) and this did the trick. Nice consistency, similar to macadamia nut oil but not quite as viscous.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair for a hot oil treatment and great on my face in the winter months, I cannot wait to move to the south, the winters in NJ are a killer. The product is a must have.</li>
    <li> Shipment canes really fast and can&#x27;t wait to start using it once I get the thanaka powder:)</li>
    <li> I have a long and straight hair and I used this product and leave it for an hour. My hair is so soft and feel like I came from the hair salon. Highly recommended to all.</li>
    <li> Great product. Used for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Amazing, lightweight oil that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and absorbs quickly into the skin. It makes my skin look and feel amazing and helps hide my fine lines because it&#x27;s so hydrating. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> this is good for belly fat.</li>
    <li> Product is unscented but please note that  it&lt;br /&gt;Does contain vitamin E. Great option for parents looking for a nut free oil, very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because I was trying the Oil Cleansing Method. However this actually made my face worse and I tried it out for two months. Even though my face hated this, I use it to shave my legs or moisturize my skin in the shower, which is why I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I like this oil but there are others that I like better. I mixed it with another oil for my hair and it worked okay.</li>
