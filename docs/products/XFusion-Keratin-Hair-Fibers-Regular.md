      <li>Very helpful for those bare spots.</li>

<li> Other than the wrong color, I really do absolutely love this product.  </li>
<li> Some of the other sources are either more expensive, charge for shipping and handling, or do not send .</li>
<li> As far as COLOR MATCH, my hair is actually a little lighter than the XFusion color</li>
<li> Still darker than expected, but i will keep trying different colors because it works so well!</li>
<li> I use it after each hair wash, of course once my hair is dry.</li>
<li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
<li> my wide 1/4&amp;#34</li>
<li> on time and as expected</li>
<li> She&#x27;s rough around the edges</li>
<li> Only negative is that it&#x27;s a bit messy applying and gets in your face if not careful.  </li>
<li> but since all the other medium fiber products are a darker medium brown</li>
<li> I only have one complaint.  </li>
<li> I buy the medium brown, and it&#x27;s too dark.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m getting older and I&#x27;m not sure when my hairline started to go thin, fall out or even why?  </li>
<li> I would recommend it to anyone needing a little coverup.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little messy, but all you have to do is put a towel around your neck and don&#x27;t forget the spray that you can buy separtely.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a 53 year old skeptical woman.  </li>
<li> All I did was tap the little can a few times on each area, and it was all covered!  </li>
<li> My husband, who usually grabs at every chance to be a brat, even admitted it was invisible!  </li>
<li> It can be messy if you were to get too crazy when shaking it out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I RATE THIS PRODUCT TEN!  OMG don&#x27;t hesitate to get it!  You will NOT regret it!  I&#x27;m a 53 year old skeptical woman.  But I stepped out on a limb to try this product.  I tried it for the first time this morning and my bald spot in the front of my head disappeared as well as my wide 1/4&amp;#34; part!  It was so easy.  All I did was tap the little can a few times on each area, and it was all covered!  As far as COLOR MATCH, my hair is actually a little lighter than the XFusion color yet you can&#x27;t see it!  Just hours after I &amp;#34;applied&amp;#34; it, I went to the dentist and as you surely know, you&#x27;re under BRIGHT lights.  I urged the girl who cleaned my teeth to be honest she could see it.  She&#x27;s rough around the edges so I knew she&#x27;d tell me the truth,  She said, she would have never known if I didn&#x27;t mention it and still couldn&#x27;t see it.  My husband, who usually grabs at every chance to be a brat, even admitted it was invisible!  As if that&#x27;s not enough, it&#x27;s 20 degrees and very windy outside.  My hair is shoulder length and was whipping and blowing around but when I checked it in the car mirror, the XFusion was still there!!!  DON&#x27;T HESITATE.  TRUST ME, IT&#x27;S GREAT!  I GIVE IT TEN STARS!</li>
    <li> fast delivery and great product</li>
    <li> It came right to my door in just 2 days, love the product</li>
    <li> Very good product and does the job but you&#x27;ll need a brush to ensure proper coverage in front of the hair. Got here on time also. Thanks for the swift service</li>
    <li> I love using this just to fill in a part if I don&#x27;t want a part showing my scalp. I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering light hair loss. That is not my issue but I use it for pure vanity reasons to make my hair appear thicker.</li>
    <li> love the product just wish there would be some kind of deal or sale going on once in awhile for those of us who buy it often</li>
    <li> excellent job came in sooner than expected thankyou</li>
    <li> Is is a good product, however, it&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought, so it&#x27;s a lot more expensive than using Toppik.</li>
    <li> It was just what I ordered. Good price.</li>
    <li> I really like XFusion&#x27;s product and prefer their Keratin Hair Fibers to the other brands I&#x27;ve tried (have not tried Topix which a lot of people like).  The only problem I have with XFusion AND with the other brands I&#x27;ve tried is that Medium Brown is too dark and Light Brown is too light.  I&#x27;ve tried mixing them and that works ok.  I have fine hair that is thinning and the Medium Brown can end up on my scalp looking like a brown spot, so I really have to style carefully.  However, I DO recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping Product as described</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. I am much more confident now that my scalp doesn&#x27;t show. I would recommend everyone who has thinning hair to use. It is simple and takes no time at all to apply. I love it!</li>
    <li> If your hair is thinning this is excellent cover</li>
    <li> Very helpful for those bare spots.</li>
    <li> Perfect color--matches my hair.  Covers up bald spots.  Only negative is that it&#x27;s a bit messy applying and gets in your face if not careful.  Otherwise, will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Xfusion for several years now and it has helped me deal with my thinning hair in a big way. I lost so much hair from thyroid disease and this product gives me some confidence back. I use the applicator top and it really helps to fill in and thicken what hair I have.</li>
    <li> on time and as expected</li>
    <li> Great product, works so well and hids the scalp wonderfully.  I would recommend it to anyone needing a little coverup.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It was only a one time use.. Way smaller than I thought it would be. Won&#x27;t be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> I received my order today, very quickly I add.  I ordered the medium brown color &amp; I was super excited to receive it, yet skeptical! I&#x27;m getting older and I&#x27;m not sure when my hairline started to go thin, fall out or even why?  I&#x27;m so impressed with this product, that I&#x27;ll buy this for life. If your suffering from any kind of baldness or an embarrassing thin hair line, get off the fence and buy this product! I bought this with my own money and this is my true opinion.  Check out my photos for proof.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheaper and works just as good as Toppik.</li>
    <li> The best there is out of all the hair fibers out there</li>
    <li> Great price, better than the salon. This item works great! It can be messy if you were to get too crazy when shaking it out.</li>
    <li> Decent product, I am a repeat buyer. I use it for coverage of thinning hair. I find the medium brown a tad light but since all the other medium fiber products are a darker medium brown, I like this one to blend in between hair colorings.</li>
    <li> I have been using X-fusion for three years. It has proven to be most affective in naturally concealing the bald spots on my scalp.  No one can even notice that there is anything there.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my hair volume. I have found it is best to use the Prime Amazon product. Some of the other sources are either more expensive, charge for shipping and handling, or do not send .</li>
    <li> Better  than being bald!</li>
    <li> Works as well as other products that are more costly.</li>
    <li> Still darker than expected, but i will keep trying different colors because it works so well!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to be able to get this product from Amazon... My hairstylist sells it but for a much higher price. It works well....:)</li>
    <li> I DO NOT LIKE THIS, IT IS INCONSISTENT, AND DOES NOT GO ON CORRECTLY, THERE SHOULD BE AN APPLICATOR FOR THIS.</li>
    <li> Used this for several years. works wonderfully</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and perfect.  Exactly as described. Definitely buying from them again.</li>
    <li> This product really works. It&#x27;s a little messy, but all you have to do is put a towel around your neck and don&#x27;t forget the spray that you can buy separtely. I did not buy it at first and it really helps keep it on all day.</li>
    <li> Kind of disappointed. When I went to use 1 jar there was nothing covering the holes where the fibers come out of so as soon as I opened it the lid was full of fibers and so was I and my floor there was nothing to salvage so it went in the trash.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  It covers my thinning hair on top of my head.  I only have one complaint.  I wish they had my exact color.  I buy the medium brown, and it&#x27;s too dark.  I buy the light brown, and it&#x27;s too light.  Due to the design of the container, I cannot open it and mix medium with light.  It would be nice if the manufacturer could redesign the container so that it can be opened and the product mixed.  Other than the wrong color, I really do absolutely love this product.  I use it after each hair wash, of course once my hair is dry.</li>
    <li> best thing ever - gives me more confidence</li>
