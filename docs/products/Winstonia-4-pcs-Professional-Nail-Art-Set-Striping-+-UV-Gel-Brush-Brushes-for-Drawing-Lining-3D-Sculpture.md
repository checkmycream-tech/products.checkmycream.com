      <li>Nice price too.</li>
      <li>Great product and shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>Love these brushes.  </li>
      <li>The thickness also helps a lot with gripping and holding the brush when I was painting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love these brushes.</li>
      <li>These are a fabulous deal!  </li>
      <li>These work pretty good</li>
      <li>I used all four brushes - the three striper brushes were used to create roses, petals, and borders, but the square brush was used for clean up around the manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The square brush worked very excellently as a clean up brush.  </li>
      <li>Really like :) I have used them a couple of times now.</li>
      <li>These got here on time and worked fine the first time I used them, but I tried cleaning them and the nail polish wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with them, and I really can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough.</li>
      <li>I recently used this set of nail art brushes on my own hands for a manicure.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used these brushes almost exclusively since I received them, and in that short time I&#x27;ve done some of my most detailed work to date.</li>
      <li>The long brush is great for creating long, even lines, and the small square brush is perfect for cleanup around the cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My cuticles are looking pretty</li>
      <li>definitely recommend nail artists everywhere to try out these brushes! :)</li>
      <li>The short brush is my go-to for fine detail.</li>
      <li>better quailty than i expected.</li>
      <li>To soften the square brush, press it gently against your hand and it should soften up.  </li>
      <li>I am a beginner and really like using these brushes.</li>
      <li>Those are my nails above (the Diamond Head, Hawaii landscape), and I honestly don&#x27;t know if it would have been possible for me to accomplish that design without these</li>
      <li>This 4 piece brush set is hands down my favorite brush set for nail art.</li>
      <li>To soften the striper brushes, just gently bend the bristles a little and it should be fine.  </li>
      <li>I clean them with nail polish remover each time and thoroughly rinsed with water, and have had no issues with the bristles becoming frayed or broken.</li>
      <li>- I don&#x27;t think this set of four brushes is worth the original $6ish, especially considering that three of the brushes are essentially the same type of brush.  </li>
      <li>brushes feel a lot better than the other nail art brushes you find floating around - especially those that come in a pack of 15 and cost around $3.  </li>
      <li>The brushes makes nice stokes with my acrylic paints and cleans up very well with tap water the bristles don&#x27;t be hard or stuck together when they are totally dry.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall they worked well, but the problem was all of the brushes were the same width and different lengths which doesn&#x27;t really make that much difference.</li>
      <li>Quality product, professional feel.</li>
      <li>However, that being said, these brushes are also very sturdy and I can see them lasting me an eternity, so the price isn&#x27;t too terrible.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After I finished painting my nails, I cleaned up my brushes first with pure acetone to remove all traces of nail polish, and then ran the brush under tap water for around 5 seconds, and then I dried the brushes and put their sleeves back on.  </li>

<li> With Seche Vite on as a topcoat, they last a long time.</li>
<li> Each striper brush is about the same width, so there&#x27;s really not much distinction there.  </li>
<li> Came faster then expected it to.</li>
<li> /&gt;The three striping brushes are approximately the same diameter, but in short, medium and long lengths.</li>
<li> The next time I tried using them they were hard and frayed.</li>
<li> If you prefer, you can trim your brushes to as thin as you want, but in my opinion, that&#x27;s not necessary since the brushes are already pretty thin - it would be easier to thin out your paint rather than thinning out your brushes.  </li>
<li> have bought brushes for nail art in the past.</li>
<li> i mean glued down and everything!</li>
<li> Since the brushes are thicker at the base, it feels sturdier and gave me a small confidence boost when I was using them.  </li>

    <li> Very nice nail art brushes. Quality product, professional feel. I am a beginner and really like using these brushes. I looked at several brushes, before purchasing. I am happy with my purchase! Really like :) I have used them a couple of times now. I clean them with nail polish remover each time and thoroughly rinsed with water, and have had no issues with the bristles becoming frayed or broken.</li>
    <li> These got here on time and worked fine the first time I used them, but I tried cleaning them and the nail polish wouldn&#x27;t come off. The next time I tried using them they were hard and frayed. If u have any tips please write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they worked well, but the problem was all of the brushes were the same width and different lengths which doesn&#x27;t really make that much difference. It was like getting three of the same brushes but they worked well for the price and that was what I was looking for.</li>

    <li> These nailart brushes are great quality for the price. I am a nail tech and I even use these on clients. With Seche Vite on as a topcoat, they last a long time.</li>
    <li> The brushes makes nice stokes with my acrylic paints and cleans up very well with tap water the bristles don&#x27;t be hard or stuck together when they are totally dry.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  They are perfect for me.  They work well for my nails.  Nicely packaged.  Nice price too.</li>

The square brush worked very excellently as a clean up brush.  My cuticles are looking pretty dandy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes all came with a protective plastic sleeve, which I recommend you keep to maintain your brushes.  When I first opened up the set of brushes, I noticed that they were a bit hard to the touch.  To soften the striper brushes, just gently bend the bristles a little and it should be fine.  To soften the square brush, press it gently against your hand and it should soften up.  After I finished painting my nails, I cleaned up my brushes first with pure acetone to remove all traces of nail polish, and then ran the brush under tap water for around 5 seconds, and then I dried the brushes and put their sleeves back on.  While I was cleaning with acetone, none of the brush hairs lost their color, so that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is the price.  Definitely buy these brushes when they&#x27;re on sale - I don&#x27;t think this set of four brushes is worth the original $6ish, especially considering that three of the brushes are essentially the same type of brush.  However, that being said, these brushes are also very sturdy and I can see them lasting me an eternity, so the price isn&#x27;t too terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend nail artists everywhere to try out these brushes! :)</li>
    <li> just the size brushes I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These work pretty good</li>
