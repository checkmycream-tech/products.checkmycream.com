<li> I tried both this and the Olivia Garden 2 1/2&amp;#34; 100% Natural Boar Bristles Round Hair Brush to improve blowouts.</li>
<li> My hair is sooo shiny now after using this brush and not frizzy at all when I blow dry it (which is all the time)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> so it&#x27;s a bit rough on the scalp.</li>
<li> combination between the boar bristels and the thermal ceramic center, that&#x27;s what make a world of a difference.</li>
<li> It does have a hole in the other end if you prefer to hang your brush from a hook.</li>
<li> Bristles are a little sharp, but it does the job.</li>
<li> Maybe I should have listen to the bad reviews first before purchasing.</li>
<li> It hasn&#x27;t broken yet, at least!</li>
<li> I ordered the wrong size, so it has not worked for me.</li>
<li> This brush also has plastic bristles that got stuck in my hair and made it difficult to pull the brush all the way through.</li>
<li> Not particularly impressed with this product.</li>

    <li> Nice brush but much bigger than I expected. I gave it to my niece who has long hair.</li>
    <li> Not particularly impressed with this product. While it does the job and I like the design of the two different kinds of bristles, the short ones keep coming out and making a mess all over the bathroom. The brush sheds more than I do. How is this a good thing?</li>
    <li> Nice job of smoothing and styling hair!</li>
    <li> This round brush is outstanding for blowing out a bob length hairstyle. I&#x27;ve ordered 2 sizes now and highly recommend this brush. It has made styling my hair so much easier. The shipping was quick too. Great purchase.</li>

The price is great, so if you&#x27;re considering buying this, definitely go for it.  It is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I spend like 3 months looking for the right brush, since my hay is really wild and frizzy. They really take out those unwanted waves once you use it with the hair dryer. I bought 3 different sizes.</li>
    <li> would buy again great brush</li>
    <li> I tried both this and the Olivia Garden 2 1/2&amp;#34; 100% Natural Boar Bristles Round Hair Brush to improve blowouts. This brush also has plastic bristles that got stuck in my hair and made it difficult to pull the brush all the way through. It&#x27;s also much heavier to hold for a long period of time.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love my new brush!  Can&#x27;t believe the difference it made in my hair. My hair is much shinier and healthier looking and full of body. A must have for everyone.</li>
    <li> the bristles seem too coarse, I feel like it damages my hair. but I still like it, because it grabs ALL my hair when I dry it.</li>
    <li> Wow, nice brush.  Very fast shipping, good packaging.  Would buy again. Ok I have long hair and a huge problem when using round brushes it always gets tangled up in the brush,  but not this one it has long bristles surrounded by bristles.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/9/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love,  the quality of this brush is amazing,  the results are even better!</li>
    <li> My sister likes the brush. Good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Best round brush I&#x27;ve ever used!! It is the perfect size and leaves my hair so silky. Its a must buy for anyone looking for a first or new round brush!</li>
    <li> Not as great as everyone else has described. Maybe I should have listen to the bad reviews first before purchasing. I lost a bunch of hairs using this, it also makes my hair frizzy and it&#x27;s hard to clean as well.</li>
    <li> good round brush. 2.75 inch one is excellent for blowdrying medium long hair.</li>
    <li> The bristles are not covered on the tips with plastic so it&#x27;s a bit rough on the scalp.</li>
    <li> Great for blow outs. Not so much for a pin curl brush out but it does the trick. If you do a lot of blow outs def. consider this bad boy to smooth your hair sexy. Wood handle is sturdy and I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristle melting yet. I wouldn&#x27;t keep the hottest heat on it for over 10 seconds though for this reason. Just keep it moving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Bristles are a little sharp, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! The best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. Never thought a brush would make much of a difference but since I started using this one, people have complimented me on my hair. It has made my hair shinier and easier for me to smooth it out. Which means less time in getting ready in the morning. Love it so much I bought two other sizes!!! :)</li>
    <li> It was a gift but the person loves it</li>
    <li> I just got this brush as a replacement and I LOVE IT!!!! I have long thick wavy hair that required either a straightener and/or excessive products to make my hair frizz free and smooth after blow drying it.  This brush takes care of everything!! My hair is sooo shiny now after using this brush and not frizzy at all when I blow dry it (which is all the time)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination between the boar bristels and the thermal ceramic center, that&#x27;s what make a world of a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a favorite round brush I&#x27;d used for several years. I am generally satisfied with this brush. The size is what I was looking for, and it feels good in the hand. The bristles are nice and compact so you can hold hair taut. The price is affordable. There are two things I would improve on this brush.&lt;br /&gt;1. The harder plastic bristles (the white ones) don&#x27;t have little balls on the end, so if your&#x27;e an aggressive brusher, you may scrape your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;2. The top of the brush is rounded, not flat. This means you cannot stand the brush up on its end on a counter, for example. I keep forgetting and the brush rolls off the counter and hits the floor... Oops. It hasn&#x27;t broken yet, at least! It does have a hole in the other end if you prefer to hang your brush from a hook.</li>
    <li> a bit larger than i anticipated, but does the job.</li>
    <li> Great brush for long thick hair.</li>
    <li> Handle broke the 2nd time I used it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush!  It&#x27;s like photoshop for hair.  Don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It glides through my hair and makes styling so simple.</li>
