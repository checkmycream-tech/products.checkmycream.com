      <li>Absolutely love this color.  </li>
      <li>My favorite OPI polish.</li>
      <li>How could I not but love any OPI Color.  </li>
      <li>For this reason, the Designer Series is my favorite set of colors.</li>
      <li>and obviously the whites are for the perfect &amp;#34;French.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it and can&#x27;t wait to show it off!</li>

      <li>OPI is always my favorite polish and this color is very sparkly with out being a full glitter.  </li>
      <li>Super festive.  </li>
      <li>It is a very classy color and it lasts longer than cheap nail polish!</li>
      <li>You read right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a color you want to put right on and show it off.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t chip - the polish wears off the edges of your nail tips first.  </li>
      <li>It has hints of pink in certain angles, love it!</li>
      <li>-  wore this for four weeks (one touch up for cuticle area due to nails growing) and finally took it off just for a change of colors - Now trying a beautiful purple from OPI.</li>
      <li>so I contacted the seller and they sent a new one right away without any questions.</li>
      <li>The picture is very misleading.</li>
      <li>This is more of an orange/bronze color than the rich dark red that is shown.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the extra money!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s new and shiny for the holidays.</li>
      <li>This is a knockout color - golden metallic red, reminiscent of a candy apple.</li>
      <li>The first bottle I had purchased had gone missing during shipping</li>
      <li>The formula is thicker than my other OPI polishes but that&#x27;s most likely due to heavy gold glitter.  </li>

    <li> My favorite OPI polish. Lots of compliments every time I wear this.</li>
    <li> Beautiful product. Awesome color. Love it</li>
    <li> beautiful color and LASTS and LASTS without chipping/peeling -  wore this for four weeks (one touch up for cuticle area due to nails growing) and finally took it off just for a change of colors - Now trying a beautiful purple from OPI. will be buying LOTS more</li>
    <li> I love this color. Some said it does not look like the photo, since I had used this color in a salon before buying and looking up the name I knew what I was getting and go just that. The first bottle I had purchased had gone missing during shipping so I contacted the seller and they sent a new one right away without any questions.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this color.  It&#x27;s multi-dimensional red with orange and gold shimmer that glows from within.  Super festive.  The formula is thicker than my other OPI polishes but that&#x27;s most likely due to heavy gold glitter.  Even thought the polish is thicker, it still dried well.  I got a week of wear with no chipping, just started to recede at tips.  Removal was difficult because the glitter spread all over my fingers.  I use a non-acetone remover so might be an easier removal with acetone one.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is so very pretty!  OPI is always my favorite polish and this color is very sparkly with out being a full glitter.  It has hints of pink in certain angles, love it!</li>
    <li> The Indulgence color is perfect. It is the perfect color for the holidays, with a deep read and shimmering gold.</li>
    <li> This is a knockout color - golden metallic red, reminiscent of a candy apple. OPI has the best colors in their Designer Series.</li>
    <li> The color is Reddish Orange with speckles (more orange than the picture), great shine, beautiful for long nails. Goes on very smooth and stays on without chipping for a nice long time. 2 Layers are ideal, and best with a bottom and top coat. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fab color for Fall &amp; beyond! Great color to have in your line up at home if can&#x27;t make it to the salon.</li>
    <li> Never disappointed in OPI polishes.</li>
    <li> The polish is a beautiful color that lasts! It is a very classy color and it lasts longer than cheap nail polish! Totally worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> THIS WASN&#x27;T QUIT WHAT I HAD WANTED, BUT THAT WAS MY ISSUE AND NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRODUCT.  IT CAME AS PROMISED AND WAS AS PROMISED BUT NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.</li>
    <li> I love this color and got it just in time for the holidays.  I am wearing it now, and have had compliments on how nice it looks. It goes on easily and has lasted for quite awhile now. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> You read right. It&#x27;s a color you want to put right on and show it off. No waiting until Friday night here ladies! I was pleased with the quick delivery on top of the color was just what I expected. I&#x27;m excited to use it and can&#x27;t wait to show it off!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s new and shiny for the holidays. I always love OPI. I will order more. Great color for all of us.</li>
    <li> All the colors in the Designer Series seem to last lnoger.  They don&#x27;t chip - the polish wears off the edges of your nail tips first.  For this reason, the Designer Series is my favorite set of colors.</li>
    <li> I usually love the colors in the DS series of OPI, but this color was somewhat of a disappointment.  It is not the holiday red as is in the photo.  It is a blue red with tons of gold glitz in it.  I&#x27;m sure this would be the perfect color for many, but not for me.</li>
    <li> This was just beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is more of an orange/bronze color than the rich dark red that is shown. The picture is very misleading.</li>
    <li> My favorite color of all time. Gorgeous!!!</li>
    <li> How could I not but love any OPI Color.  There is yet that I have come across one where I have said -- &amp;#34;Geesh, what were they thinking.&amp;#34;  Even the blacks are so cool and obviously the whites are for the perfect &amp;#34;French.&amp;#34;</li>
