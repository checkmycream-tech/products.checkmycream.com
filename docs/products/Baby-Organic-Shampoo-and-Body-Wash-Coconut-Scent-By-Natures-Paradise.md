      <li>You could not ask for anything more.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
      <li>Buying two more</li>
      <li>That means is really safe.</li>
      <li>I LOVE nature&#x27;s paradise products.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>(I find with most shampoos it won&#x27;t spread evenly, the foam makes it</li>
      <li>I love all their products.</li>
      <li>This leaves him smelling great, and his skin so soft.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff for my kids, they both have eczema and this works well for them does not irritate their skin and has a light sent to it</li>
      <li>It lathers nice right out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine now that it&#x27;s out of the box.</li>
      <li>The product is lightly scented and at times I cannot smell the coconut scent.  </li>

      <li>I love this brand I use all their products, the bottle lasts awhile too since it comes out as foam you do not have to use that much at a time.</li>
      <li>: If you&#x27;re considering this product because you want a completely safe, toxin-free way to bathe your baby, you should note that the apple cider vinegar in this product is NOT listed as organic, and apples have a particularly high risk of pesticide residue/contamination.  </li>
      <li>I found the ingredients to be more straightforward and pure than other brands, even the Honest brand.</li>
      <li>Although it is a bit on the expensive side, and tends to leave a ring around the baby bath tub (which washes off very easily), we will continue to buy and use it because we know it will not expose our bundle of joy to toxic chemical hazards.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also super gentle, and sort of &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;,</li>
      <li>One more thing, it is not a tear free product, so be careful with baby&#x27;s eyes.</li>
      <li>Super gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my newborn.</li>

      <li>We switched to this and it has really made</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is the only brand/product I have been able to find for my babies that is all natural ingredients and truly organic</li>

<li> Proves that you can make a solid product with all the harsh yucky chemicals like these other brands have.</li>
<li> Either way, this is apparently NOT the same as the \\&quot;Baby Organic 2 in 1 Foaming Shampoo &amp; Body Wash,\\&quot; which was the top-rated baby soap for safety at the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skindeep web site, if that is what you happen to be looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Otherwise, this product doesn&#x27;t go as far as regular soap, and I realize that that&#x27;s not a fair comparison, but still something you may want to know.  </li>

<li> but it has lasted a long time, a few squirts goes a long way.</li>
<li> I use it everyday as a body wash and occasionally as a shampoo.</li>
<li> a difference.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this product, and it seems to leave the skin feeling cleaner and softer!</li>
<li> It comes out as a foam, it does lather but not as much as other soaps, but my son&#x27;s hair which is thick and dry with dry scalp/dandruff</li>
<li> One day I did research and learned how harsh J&amp;J baby products are.  </li>
<li> (it doesn&#x27;t make it worse, but also doesn&#x27;t help...)</li>
<li> and my daughters hair is thin and gets oily with the wrong type of products.</li>
<li> It is expensive for the amount you get</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is great and truly organic. The only ingredients are water, organic saponified coconut oil. No chemicals! I just checked EWG&#x27; Skin Deep Cosmetics Database and their rating is 0 for this product. That means is really safe. If you can afford to buy it, go ahead. It is great for your baby and the environment. One more thing, it is not a tear free product, so be careful with baby&#x27;s eyes.</li>
    <li> I actually chose this product not because baby has sensitive skin, but because I do. I have extreme sensitivity to a lot of scents, and some of the compounds used in other commercial soaps. I found most baby washes made my hands break out in a heated rash, and so started looking into other options. This particular one was a guilty pleasure because I love the smell of coconut. It&#x27;s very light, it cleans well, and lasted a long while (we ordered in June or July and it&#x27;s now pretty much October and we&#x27;re just about to run out, and that&#x27;s with daily baths). I do feel like it didn&#x27;t stand up to messier baths as well (we recently started solids, and solids in the hair make for messier baths), but overall I would order again!</li>
    <li> All natural, great smelling, and GREAT products!!  I love all their products. You could not ask for anything more.  I can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and body wash is very gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin. I have not had any rash issues so far. It also helps that it is a foam dispenser so you dont have to work up a lather during the bath time. Will definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> Leaves a greasy film on my hands.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind how it smells. It&#x27;s not perfume that;s for sure, but it is a bad smell. So, I guess it just depends on your senses. It lathers nice right out of the bottle. I think the bottle leaked a bit when I received it. However, it was because of the shipping i think, not because of the product. It&#x27;s fine now that it&#x27;s out of the box.</li>
    <li> I use it on my baby and will continue to do so because it&#x27;s the only non-toxic brand I could find. It doesn&#x27;t lather though, but maybe lather agents include toxins?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every organic baby shampoo/body wash there is.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this one, it&#x27;s subtle but there.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also super gentle, and sort of &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, so you can spread it all over baby (I find with most shampoos it won&#x27;t spread evenly, the foam makes it pre-lathered.)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost gentle enough for my little one who has pretty bad eczema (it doesn&#x27;t make it worse, but also doesn&#x27;t help...)</li>
    <li> This line of products is amazing. My children have sensitive skin and this line of products has improved my child&#x27;s eczema symptoms tremendously.</li>

    <li> I was looking for a shampoo/body wash with minimal ingredients, and free of chemicals/toxins/etc. This is the perfect buy. I use it everyday as a body wash and occasionally as a shampoo. Not my favorite to be used as a shampoo b/c the hair smells like coconut oil - but good for most days. I found the ingredients to be more straightforward and pure than other brands, even the Honest brand. I wish this line had a shampoo only, not just the body wash/shampoo combo.</li>
    <li> this is the best shampoo I have been able to find for my babies (twins). It comes out as a foam, it does lather but not as much as other soaps, but my son&#x27;s hair which is thick and dry with dry scalp/dandruff and my daughters hair is thin and gets oily with the wrong type of products. this product works well for both, has a nutty coconut smell, and leaves their hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the only brand/product I have been able to find for my babies that is all natural ingredients and truly organic I love this brand I use all their products, the bottle lasts awhile too since it comes out as foam you do not have to use that much at a time.</li>

    <li> Leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair soft and clean. I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Pros: Rinses easily, leaves skin and hair soft, BPA-free bottle, smells nice.  My kids like the foam dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you&#x27;re considering this product because you want a completely safe, toxin-free way to bathe your baby, you should note that the apple cider vinegar in this product is NOT listed as organic, and apples have a particularly high risk of pesticide residue/contamination.  Otherwise, this product doesn&#x27;t go as far as regular soap, and I realize that that&#x27;s not a fair comparison, but still something you may want to know.  It seems to take quite a bit to wash one kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product on this page is called \\&quot;Baby Organic Shampoo &amp; Body Wash Coconut Scent,\\&quot; while the bottle pictured reads: \\&quot;Coconut Conditioning Shampoo &amp; Body Wash.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know whether these products are the same, but I think the latter is what you get with this purchase.  Either way, this is apparently NOT the same as the \\&quot;Baby Organic 2 in 1 Foaming Shampoo &amp; Body Wash,\\&quot; which was the top-rated baby soap for safety at the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skindeep web site, if that is what you happen to be looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, this is not a tear-free soap.</li>
    <li> Not the best smelling but pure,and non toxic and to me that&#x27;s all that matters, I uses he&#x27;s moisture lotion in olive oil so a scent for bathing doesn&#x27;t matter to me anyways. Best on the market for truly non toxic and organic! I searched hundreds of products... Buying two more so I never run out!!!!</li>
    <li> My son has always had itchy skin and we could never figure out what it was coming from.  One day I did research and learned how harsh J&amp;J baby products are.  We switched to this and it has really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this product, and it seems to leave the skin feeling cleaner and softer!</li>
    <li> My wife and I wanted an all natural product for our first child. This product was rated one of the safest by The Environmental Working Group, and that&#x27;s all we needed to read. Although it is a bit on the expensive side, and tends to leave a ring around the baby bath tub (which washes off very easily), we will continue to buy and use it because we know it will not expose our bundle of joy to toxic chemical hazards.</li>
