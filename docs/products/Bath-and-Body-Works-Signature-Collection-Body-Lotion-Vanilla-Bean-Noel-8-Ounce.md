      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>I agree with other reviewers that this has a much more true vanilla scent than Warm Vanilla Sugar, particularly since they revised the formula of that one and it no longer smells as good as it used to (more of a chemical overtone).  </li>
      <li>Very pleased, will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>Have received many compliments the first day I wore it.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful fresh scent and very long lasting.  </li>

      <li>Smells exactly like vanilla frosting.</li>
      <li>Very long lasting and good for layering with sweet perfumes.</li>
      <li>I like so much the scent, it smell like candy, cake...</li>
      <li>Not too sweet, not too heavy, just right!</li>

    <li> Wife loves this stuff, best and simple Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the scent of the lotion; not like the foaming hand soap which I love. No fault of amazon but maybe should be noted.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Not too sweet, not too heavy, just right!</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that this has a much more true vanilla scent than Warm Vanilla Sugar, particularly since they revised the formula of that one and it no longer smells as good as it used to (more of a chemical overtone).  My daughter and I both eagerly tried this one and like it for the purer vanilla scent.  However, we have decided that we prefer the other product for the other more complex tones - sandalwood and coconut.  We will enjoy using both, but neither of us is inclined to throw out all of our Warm Vanilla Sugar products (of which we have legions!!!) in favor of this one.  I would choose this product mainly if what I was looking for was a true vanilla fragrance, which it does have.</li>
    <li> Packaged very securely and arrived a couple days before it said they would. Very pleased, will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> The most delicious caramel + vanilla scent. A must have for lovers of gourmands/sweet scents. Very long lasting and good for layering with sweet perfumes.</li>
    <li> Smells like cupcakes!</li>
    <li> lotion has expired smells bad !!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fresh scent and very long lasting.  Have received many compliments the first day I wore it.  So happy to have found it here being that it is a seasonal item.  Thank you!</li>

    <li> My Favorite scent from Bath and Body Works.  Bath and Body Works only sells it at Christmas time. So glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like so much the scent, it smell like candy, cake... something like that. I would buy it again.</li>
