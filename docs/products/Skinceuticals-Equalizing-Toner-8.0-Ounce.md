      <li>Toner is great but leaves a slight sticky residue after drying.</li>
      <li>Nice in that it doesn&#x27;t sting, but it also doesn&#x27;t feel like it actually tones.  </li>

      <li>and they have definitely made my skin much better</li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth without any irritation.</li>

      <li>My wife and I love the SkinCeutial products, especially this one!  </li>
      <li>Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described.</li>

      <li>Exactly what I was expecting.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m ready to walk out the door.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, and the others that go with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really notice much difference in my skin except</li>
      <li>Makes me think it&#x27;s not the real deal.</li>
      <li>Gently tones and cleanses skin, no alcohol, no tightness.  </li>
      <li>I really like the skinceuticals products.  </li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>In fact, all i need is good health physically and mentally.</li>
      <li>A bit on the harsher side for sensitive skin, so not for everyday use, but nice.</li>
      <li>I was having trouble finding a very light summer moisturizer for the humid summer that didn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
      <li>The product seems ok but it was supposed to be new and it definitely had been opened prior to my receiving it.</li>
      <li>This plus sunscreen and my face is clear and even!</li>
      <li>and it really helps to cleanse and balance the pH of my skin prepping it to absorb all the following steps of my skin care regimen.</li>
      <li>Do not recommend it if u have adult acne</li>
      <li>This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
      <li>I am new to this product line and was hesitant to purchase from Amazon based on other reviews.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting.  Gently tones and cleanses skin, no alcohol, no tightness.  Easy to use for both day and night.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is a perfect match. It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth without any irritation.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding a very light summer moisturizer for the humid summer that didn&#x27;t make me break out.  This plus sunscreen and my face is clear and even!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 2 weeks into using this product. Seems to do the job as with any other toner. My one complaint would be the smell. It doesn&#x27;t have the fresh scent that Epionce toner has! When this bottle is gone, I will probably go back to Epionce.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 4 years. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like the skinceuticals products.  Been using them or over a year now and they have definitely made my skin much better</li>
    <li> I am new to this product line and was hesitant to purchase from Amazon based on other reviews. I really like this product, and the others that go with it. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described. Perfect!!! Great gift</li>
    <li> This skin line caused a terrible reaction which included welts on my face and chest area for 2 days.  When I approached the company  about this situation they refused a refund. I finally received my refund a couple of months later but not by them. This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
    <li> Great price for the quantity received! Little to no scent and it seems to do its job! I&#x27;ve been a Rhonda Allison fan but this particular product is nice too!</li>
    <li> Have been having bad acne issues tried everything and this has done the trick.  Love love love it! I have used four products from them and so worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works great to equalize the PH of the skin. I have bought one bottle and has lasted me about a year.</li>
    <li> Come to realize that i don&#x27;t need potions and lotions. In fact, all i need is good health physically and mentally. This actually irritated my skin. I also noticed when i stopped using it, my skin was so used to it, it was like my skin was having withdraws. haha. &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; for skin anyone?</li>
    <li> I use the toner after washing my face and before I apply moisturizer. Seems to take less moisturizer to have soft skin.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love the SkinCeutial products, especially this one!  We use it for the long dry winters, so we don&#x27;t turn into prunes.</li>
    <li> My toner arrived promptly but it wasn&#x27;t sealed and it was not in the Skinceuticals box.  I&#x27;ve purchased numerous Skinceuticals products before but never without a box or the appropriate protection (seal). Makes me think it&#x27;s not the real deal.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Minimizes pores and seems to tighten skin just a bit also evens out skin tone. Would Recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice much difference in my skin except maybe it feels a little cleaner after I use it. But not super impressed especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Best toner for sensitive skin type</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years. And I would certainly recommend this toner because it is very easy to apply. As I apply the toner, I look forward to follow up with the daily moisturizer, and then the sun block. I&#x27;m ready to walk out the door.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works great and does what it says. You will not be disappointed with the Skinceuticals line. Products last a long time and only a small amout is needed for each use.</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals in definitely my favorite face care line.  My facialist introduced me to the line and I haven&#x27;t tried anything since.  The equalizing toner is one of my favorite products in the skin care line and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was sent the face wash and not the toner (what I ordered).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, the pore minimizing face wash is nice. A bit on the harsher side for sensitive skin, so not for everyday use, but nice.</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals Equalizing Toner is a great product. I use this product twice a day and it really helps to cleanse and balance the pH of my skin prepping it to absorb all the following steps of my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Nice in that it doesn&#x27;t sting, but it also doesn&#x27;t feel like it actually tones.  At twice the cost of a comparable toner, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is recommended by my derm as part of my acne fighting regiment.  It is effective in combination with other prescriptions.  The derm told me that this toner helps my skin absorb the prescribed topical lotions.  I guess that&#x27;s how Proactiv started?  OK, this is not a magic end all, but it&#x27;s been part of the the most effective solution for me.  Aside from Accutane.</li>
    <li> I love this toner because it&#x27;s gentle and yet effective.  After using it, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or oily.  It&#x27;s great for a &#x27;fresh-up&#x27; in the summer to help cool the skin.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this product I do not get breakouts like I used to.  I was skeptical because I have had acne since teen years and now am 50.  I have been using it for several years now and it does cut down on the oil and a little goes a long with when you buy all 3 acne products.</li>
    <li> Toner is great but leaves a slight sticky residue after drying. Works well if applying powder afterwards, but can leave your skin lookIng shiny if using this product alone.</li>
    <li> Take away the redness but does not help with black heads or pimples at all. Stopped using it and my skin got a lot better. Do not recommend it if u have adult acne</li>
    <li> When I received my toner the box was ripped on the top and taped closed on the bottom and it didn&#x27;t appear to be a full bottle.  The product seems ok but it was supposed to be new and it definitely had been opened prior to my receiving it.</li>
    <li> I love skinceuticals!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product anyone that is looking for a great toner, this product has no color or smell to it and is a great source for someone who has senstive skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but nothing special.</li>
    <li> nice feel, moisturizing and toning</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy about this toner but it does do a good job of toning after cleaning. I personally cannot use it every day or it will irritate and break out my face. When used in moderation, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> All of the SkinCeutical product are great.</li>
</ol>
