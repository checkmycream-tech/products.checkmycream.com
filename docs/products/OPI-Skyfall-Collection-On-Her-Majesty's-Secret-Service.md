      <li>I love the OPI polish anyway, but this colour is gorgeous!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great although it has more of a spacey vibe.</li>
      <li>Love this color!</li>
      <li>Great color, easy application.</li>
      <li>This color is so amazing.  </li>
      <li>had to get a bottle of my own.</li>
      <li>wife loves it and it looks good on her, she was pleased with the durability as well, three more words</li>
      <li>I was thrilled it was available on line!</li>
      <li>Very nice sparkly polish used two coats and a top coat and stays on for a while a nice silver with tiny sparkles looks great on</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be nice on top of some opaque colours.</li>
      <li>This is one of my all time favorite colors ..</li>
      <li>I had not been able to find it in any store</li>
      <li>I still love it.</li>
      <li>I have gotten so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to find it on here!</li>
      <li>This is one of OPI&#x27;s finest collection, and of all the Skyfall colors available this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>and I received it very quickly.</li>
      <li>This stunning color is my absolute favorite for pedicures.</li>
      <li>Just waiting for the right occasion to put this one - fabulous sparkle that is bound to complement any outfit!</li>
      <li>even in full sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;Still great quality from OPI as usual and the color is still nice.</li>
      <li>The picture is fairly true to colour.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely versatile and looks great with summer wedges and heels.</li>
      <li>The glitter is kind of all different shades.</li>
      <li>product &amp; vendor worth the money.</li>
      <li>Not only am I a huge Bond fan, I&#x27;m a huge OPI fan and nail polish junkie.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a bit transparent but still quite pretty.</li>
      <li>I adore this color, its a striking glitter without looking obnoxious and actually glittery.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on this color, and actually discovered it when I complimented someone else who was wearing it!</li>
      <li>I find that their products last a lot longer on my nails than the cheap off brands too.</li>
      <li>It is very sparklely (not chunky glitter).</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, too.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have that rainbow shine like in the photo...</li>
      <li>it is a very pretty color, seems to change color slightly based on the light.</li>
      <li>This polish is more a a sparkly, dark silver then anything.</li>
      <li>The color is unique and changes in different light or against other colors.</li>
      <li>However it is really more silver with a hit if green once applied.  </li>
      <li>I like this polish but it has a bit of a green tint to it more than the gray in the picture.</li>
      <li>but I put over a black polish and it was very pretty.</li>
      <li>It looks like a prismatic dark gray in the photo but has more of a dark navy tone to it.</li>
      <li>It seems to be composed of small blue and yellow (and in certain lights, pink) shimmers that overall are a striking gunmetal color.</li>
      <li>I just put it on the other day to get ready for the holidays</li>

<li> On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service is such a unique color, I hope OPI comes out with another collection to beat this one.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really looking for a Lincoln Park after Dark but instead of a blue hint, a green hint (basically a dark version of british racing green).  </li>
<li> The color is a deep steel gray with subtle sparkle that is youthful but can still be worn in professional settings.</li>
<li> While the colour wasn&#x27;t as dark as I thought.</li>
<li> my nail tech has used this for my mani a few times.  </li>
<li> From the bottle it looks green (both in the picture and in the bottle).  </li>
<li> If you layer it a few times, you&#x27;ll get what it looks like in the bottle.</li>

    <li> my nail tech has used this for my mani a few times.  it is a very pretty color, seems to change color slightly based on the light. reminds me of a halos polish.</li>
    <li> I had my toes done in this at the salon and they&lt;br /&gt;are still sparkling a month later.  Loved it so much&lt;br /&gt;I had to get a bottle of my own. I&#x27;m hooked on this&lt;br /&gt;collection.</li>
    <li> Great color, easy application.</li>
    <li> Very nice sparkly polish used two coats and a top coat and stays on for a while a nice silver with tiny sparkles looks great on</li>
    <li> This is a very sheer color.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing it alone but I put over a black polish and it was very pretty.</li>
    <li> This color is so amazing.  I have gotten so many compliments.  The color changes depending on the lighting. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just waiting for the right occasion to put this one - fabulous sparkle that is bound to complement any outfit!</li>
    <li> Not only am I a huge Bond fan, I&#x27;m a huge OPI fan and nail polish junkie. OPI did a really great job of choosing the color. It&#x27;s a gun metal blue with flecks of silver in it. I find that their products last a lot longer on my nails than the cheap off brands too.</li>
    <li> Gave it four stars because I didn&#x27;t notice it wasn&#x27;t a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;Great product &amp; vendor worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love the OPI polish anyway, but this colour is gorgeous! Fast delivery, too.</li>
    <li> This one is very sheer if you only do one coat. I&#x27;m sure it will be nice on top of some opaque colours. If you layer it a few times, you&#x27;ll get what it looks like in the bottle. The picture is fairly true to colour. It is very sparklely (not chunky glitter).</li>
    <li> While the colour wasn&#x27;t as dark as I thought. I still love it. Just hope its a colour my queen will approve of.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite colors .. I was thrilled it was available on line! I wil keep shopping!</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful. It goes with everything! I had not been able to find it in any store so I was excited to find it on here! Great price and I received it very quickly. Great experience.</li>
    <li> Love this color! I just put it on the other day to get ready for the holidays and it&#x27;s great although it has more of a spacey vibe. It looks like a prismatic dark gray in the photo but has more of a dark navy tone to it. It also was a bit sheer and I ended up having to put on 4 coats to get total coverage.</li>
    <li> This polish applies well in two coats. It wears well. The color is unique and changes in different light or against other colors. It appears to be similar to Zoya Feifei.</li>
    <li> This polish is more a a sparkly, dark silver then anything. It really doesn&#x27;t have that rainbow shine like in the photo... even in full sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;Still great quality from OPI as usual and the color is still nice.</li>
    <li> wife loves it and it looks good on her, she was pleased with the durability as well, three more words</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this color, and actually discovered it when I complimented someone else who was wearing it! Goes great with any color you might be wearing clothing-wise.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this nail polish, and when it arrived on time I was very happy to use it</li>
    <li> This is one of OPI&#x27;s finest collection, and of all the Skyfall colors available this one is my favorite. The color is a deep steel gray with subtle sparkle that is youthful but can still be worn in professional settings. To acheieve the color presented in the bottle I used three coats. One coat and it&#x27;s a bit transparent but still quite pretty. Day three of wearing it and no chipping either.</li>
    <li> From the bottle it looks green (both in the picture and in the bottle).  However it is really more silver with a hit if green once applied.  I&#x27;m really looking for a Lincoln Park after Dark but instead of a blue hint, a green hint (basically a dark version of british racing green).  So if anyone has a recomendation, please comment.</li>
    <li> This stunning color is my absolute favorite for pedicures. I find that if I have another toenail color on, I&#x27;m longing for this color. It&#x27;s extremely versatile and looks great with summer wedges and heels.</li>
