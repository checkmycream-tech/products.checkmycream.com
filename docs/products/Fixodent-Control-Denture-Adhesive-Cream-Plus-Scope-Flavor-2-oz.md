      <li>but the price was SUPER !!</li>
      <li>It takes more of this product to get the job done</li>
      <li>I see that a great majority of users of this product have awarded either 4 or 5 stars, which means that for them, this product really works well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and now I have conluded that poligrip is the better of the choices out there.</li>

      <li>So glad I found it on amazon.</li>
      <li>I guess it holds his teeth in better</li>
      <li>Fixodent  gives more adhesion for dentures.</li>
      <li>I like Fixodent always have thought I would give the FREE a try better for you I heard.</li>
      <li>Strong but taste is not like is Poligrip</li>
      <li>Only brand I use, hold great</li>
      <li>stay secure as long&lt;</li>
      <li>I am awarding 2 stars, because in my experience, this product is way inferior to SeaBond Denture Adhesive Wafers, in two important respects.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product but &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; material has gotten thicker, more difficult to squeeze and get cream.</li>
      <li>I always use the FREE version of this product, but do wish it was a little thicker, but all in all it is the best one I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>which then allows him to eat more normally.</li>
      <li>I like how the neutral color does not make my gums bright unnatural pink.</li>
      <li>It cost me plenty to have it sent to the Philippines, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since it first came out and have found it to work well for me.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised ....</li>
      <li>Is that a real money-back guarantee?!</li>
      <li>Yes, as soon as this runs out most definitely!!!</li>
      <li>First, this product does not hold my teeth in place half as effectively as the SeaBond wafers.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>Its ok, thought it might have a stronger hold than other brands &amp; it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it has no garish pink color, has great holing power, especially for hard to chew foods.</li>
      <li>You may indeed fall in this category, and certainly this product is well worth trying, because it is relatively inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>a battle of good and bad, the good wins hands down.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold as long or as well as the original version of this product.</li>
      <li>He highly recommends it to anyone seeking a reliable adhesive for their denture.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite, with little or no smell or taste.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this item for $5.99 from my local Walgreens, which is quite a bit higher than the $4.28 per tube from this vendor.</li>
      <li>He has tried the Zinc-free, but says it does not adhere nearly as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Exactly as advertised .... this is a great product. Having used this brand of adhesive before I knew what I was getting but the price was SUPER !!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses fixodent and it&#x27;s so expensive at Walmart. I get this a dollar cheaper per tube plus shipped to my house.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first came out and have found it to work well for me. Delivery was fast and with the subscription pricing it comes at a price that is hard to beat even with a coupon. If you have to use an adhesive, this is the one to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; material has gotten thicker, more difficult to squeeze and get cream.</li>
    <li> A great deal, and I really like the idea of buying more than one and getting a good price.    Happy with this.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it has no garish pink color, has great holing power, especially for hard to chew foods.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fixodent for years. I became concerned about the zinc contained in the product. They say you won&#x27;t get poisoned if you follow the directions and use only the recommended amount. Is that a real money-back guarantee?!</li>
    <li> I have this on a reoccurring order.... always delivered always works.</li>
    <li> Good  product for a good price. I bougth this product for my patient , and hes very happy and confortable using his protesis. Fixodent  gives more adhesion for dentures.</li>
    <li> No taste, holds about as good as any of them</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for hold, consistency and feel. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This purchase was for my Mother in law and she uses nothing but this product.  Will make this same purchase for her in the future.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as long or as well as the original version of this product. It takes more of this product to get the job done</li>
    <li> This is by far the best denture adhesive. It works. Have tried others but always come back to this. Amazons price for 6 is also a big savings.</li>
    <li> Always a great product if you need to use the stuff. blows the comptetion out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was a little slow however</li>
    <li> i bought these for my father, who pays 6 to 8 dollars for them at the store. With the subsribe and save option, they came out to almost have the price! Saves him a trip to the store as well.</li>
    <li> I see that a great majority of users of this product have awarded either 4 or 5 stars, which means that for them, this product really works well.

    <li> Its ok, thought it might have a stronger hold than other brands &amp; it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me.</li>
    <li> When I went to Costco and Sam&#x27;s, I was unable to find this product in bulk. I can always find what I need on Amazon.com! Always!!</li>
    <li> its fine, however, in the cold months it is Very hard squeezing any out.  It takes a lot of time to get any out.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite, with little or no smell or taste.  He has tried the Zinc-free, but says it does not adhere nearly as well. Will buy again when needed. and better to buy a multi-pack here on Amazon, to save trips to the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and now I have conluded that poligrip is the better of the choices out there. definitely.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Infact this is my 2nd time ordering this. would I order this again? Yes, as soon as this runs out most definitely!!!</li>
    <li> The Fixodent \\&quot;Free\\&quot; is getting hard to find in stores. Sometimes they have it &amp; a lot of times they don&#x27;t. I was happy to find this on amazon.com. The price is reasonable. I usually paid anywhere from $4.29-$4.99  a tube. I prefer this over the poligrip. I also like the unflavored. Did not care for the mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/9/14  The price increased quite a bit. Not a good value anymore. Can get this cheaper in any store.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, she love&#x27;s it. Thank You!!</li>
    <li> I always use the FREE version of this product, but do wish it was a little thicker, but all in all it is the best one I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fixodent for 34 years. Fixodent Free is the best. It&#x27;s the only denture cream that holds my dentures in. All this crap going on with the lawyers is just that, BS. 34 years &amp; I&#x27;m still here. I&#x27;m also a Diabetic. It cost me plenty to have it sent to the Philippines, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> alll came in good shape.</li>
    <li> the good&lt;br /&gt;An improvement over pink denture glue and its awful taste the pink has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bad&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t stay secure as long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the conclusion&lt;br /&gt;in a battle of good and bad, the good wins hands down. anything to get away from that awful taste of the pink.</li>
    <li> I like Fixodent always have thought I would give the FREE a try better for you I heard.So far so good still get great hold good price. I would recommend</li>
    <li> My husband likes this over other brands.  I guess it holds his teeth in better which then allows him to eat more normally.</li>
    <li> GOOD DEAL AND WILL BUY AGAIN ....THANKS</li>
    <li> No dyes or flavorings and the best adhesive I have found in many brands and or types of dental adhesives.</li>
    <li> Only brand I use, hold great</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND USES THIS AND HAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO IT MUST BE JUST WHAT HE NEEDS.  IN THE PAST HE HAS USED OTHER BRANDS BUT HE LIKES THIS ONE BEST.</li>
    <li> Long time user of Fixodent. Still satisfactory. Reduced zinc comforting.</li>
    <li> I like how the neutral color does not make my gums bright unnatural pink. I have switched over to this.</li>
