<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The one that came with the Micro pedi works fantastic. Would recommend this item to my all of my friends</li>
    <li> I go barefoot all the time, and my feet show it.  Thanks to these little goodies, I can have soft, smooth heels in spite of the abuse I inflict on my feet.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great seller.</li>
    <li> The Emoji products are great. Finally I have no crust on my feet. Can clean my feet while watching tv. Feet are now nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Great product, the Emjoi rollers work so well I can go much longer between pedicures. Highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Great item and works very well</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll want to have a few on hand, especially if you&#x27;re sharing the Micro-pedi and might lose track of the wear.</li>
    <li> My family and I love my Emjoi.  The grandkids become &amp;#34;foot doctors&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that the rollers don&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
    <li> Leaves my feet smooth.</li>
    <li> THEY DON´T LAST MORE THAN ONE USE</li>
    <li> These refill packs are necessary and must be replaced often, so consider that when you buy the gadget.  The blue is better than the red.  Look for packages that have two blue refills.</li>
    <li> This is a refill for the Emjoi Micro-Ped to remove callus.  It works super. Don&#x27;t overdo it and then use a cream or coconut oil on my feet.</li>
    <li> Wife uses it about once a week and says she should have gotten it sooner. She highly recommends it to family and friends.  Have already ordered replacement rollers.</li>
    <li> The Micro-Pedi is the best products for feet! I love my Micro Pedi and recommend it to anyone who likes extra smooth feet! My feet have not felt like this in years, and I constantly show my feet off!</li>
    <li> Always need extra rollers</li>
    <li> works perfectly and the price was great</li>
    <li> I thought I had just ordered a larger quantity of just coarse  but these were good.</li>
    <li> Emjoi Micro-pedi worked better than I expected. The rollers were the right coarseness to give great results. I will rep[lace the rollers when necessary.</li>
    <li> ordered refill rollers for my Emjoi that i got off of QVC and thought since it was extra coarse it would last longer but no. I didnt really noticed a difference between blue and red. Felt the same to me. Didnt last long, too expensive to keep replacing every month. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> The blue, coarser refill is definitely my favorite for everyday use. The red was too fine to really have a positive effect.  But I do recommend this item for micro-pedi users.</li>
    <li> Excellent, my wife loves it.  She uses it daily.  The old ones wore out and these are exactly what she needed</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and it is effective . Great to use in between  regular pedicures to keep your feet smooth.</li>
    <li> Got worn out after a short time.</li>
    <li> I prefer the blue roller but I needed to try both to know this.  Expensive but very effective.  The rollers need to be replaced frequently.  I wish they lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she said it was notting to brag about. She found other products at the Drug Store she prefered</li>
    <li> Love the micro&#x3D;pedi and it&#x27;s great to be able to get refill rollers so easily.  They arrived quickly and I got exactly what I ordered.  They work perfectly with the micro-pedi, so I can keep my feet smooth!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product and would recommend it but the refills/rollers do not last long and are quite expensive for the amount of time you can use them. I wish there was a better solution for the roller refills.</li>
    <li> Theses really helps to reduce dry and callused feet.  Keeps them smooth and tidy between pedicures or for the do it yourself job.</li>
    <li> I have not found these Emjoi replacement rollers anywhere else for this low of a price. If you are someone who gets pedicures or someone that has issues with your feet, the Emjoi is the product for you. Just try it and buy the replacement rollers here! I have loved mine and my husband used it once cause his feet are not great and he loved it better than the PedEgg that he had been using.So I bought him one for Christmas and will continue to buy his/my replacement rollers here on Amazon</li>
    <li> Easily replaces original sanding roll, pop in and out, easy to clean, and works well. Start lightly removing dead cracked heel skin do not over use.  Moisturize with a good foot lotion to keep skin soft and pliable. See how your heel will react the following day. No adverse affects the next day or so remove a little more if needed repeating the above process.</li>
    <li> These little rollers really work well on your feet.  Will definitely continue to purchase this product. Many thanks to the inventor</li>
    <li> Everyone needs this product.  Works like a charm.  Easy to replace rollers, and they last a long time.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> works well, saves on spending money to have pedicures as i can do it myself using emjoi pedi machine. safe to use</li>
    <li> Wanted to love the Emjoi, but it only works great when you use the roller for the first time.  Gets really dull fast and my feet are not bad at all.  I get better results from using a foot file.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works terrific on the feet, will have to keep plenty of them in the house.</li>
    <li> I used to walk barefoot a lot and the skin on my feet was never smooth.  I tried all lotions and Ped Egg with varying results. Now I just use these a minute or so a day when I brush my teeth and my feet are as smooth as I could wish.</li>
    <li> They wear really quickly. its a joy when they are working but they do not last very long and i don&#x27;t necessarily have massive feet either. I sure wish they would make a product that last a lot longer at least 3 to four applications for each foot. remember we have 2 feet it barely last for 1 foot. Big Foot should stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These work great for refills for my enjoy pedi! They are a bit expensive for just 2 refills.. But work great and no more local pedis where you risk infections!</li>
    <li> The rollers wore down after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> Coarse roller is a must!</li>
    <li> I bought these with the Emjoy Nano. I advise you to get extras, just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;Hands Down the Best Money I Ever Spent On Myself!&lt;br /&gt;Love the electric version, don&#x27;t have to deal with the expense of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen postings that the cord is too short. Hint: buy an extension cord.&lt;br /&gt;I thought my feet were in ok condition until I got this.&lt;br /&gt;It is my best friend on tv night and plan to give one to my daughter for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t delay, get one today!</li>
    <li> Great rollers&lt;br /&gt;Now I know where to order the next batch.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are finally starting to like great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who have rough callouses</li>
    <li> I have the Emjoi pedi and appreciate being able to buy online.  The vendor delivers these as promised.  I am pleased with being able to give a uniform treatment to my feet.  Great idea.  It&#x27;s been around awhile.  The roller gives the perfect amount of exfoliation for the skin...Thanks.</li>
    <li> Use the extra course and then switch to the medium. Love this product. My feet will be as smooth as silk by spring.</li>
    <li> These rollers work very good on dry skin.  This was one of the best tools for dry skin on the feet.  My wife loved it as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> Emjoi is a wonderful product,  Best thing I have ever used on my feet.</li>
    <li> Effective and I am very grateful for these</li>
    <li> Roller work fine after a few tries. Some say the pink rollers are better than the blue but I did not notice any difference.</li>
    <li> The emjoi micropedi is the best and easy way to take care of your feet! This refill package is perfect and arrived pretty quickly. Will definitely reorder in the future!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use the refills yet (I wanted to be sure to have them before I needed to replace the originals) but I do love the MicroPedi and am sure I will love the refills as well (as much as one can love a refill).</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase.....this one for a gift. Can&#x27;t rave enough about this. It gets the job done and is gentle. It is the only thing that my podiatrist allows me to use on my feet. Thanks EMJOI</li>
    <li> I gifted this to my Husband and he loves it, says it is the &amp;#34;best.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> love the product, def makes a pedicure much easier than a hand held file&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is used on dry skin and gently files rough skin</li>
    <li> I bought the callus remover that this refill is for and I am not sure how to rate a refill cartridge for the actual product which I already rated.  The thing is though, the price for this refill, in my opinion is kind of pricey.  We will see how long the cartridges last that came with the callus remover and I will update this review.</li>
    <li> While the course refill works great, I am not at all impressed with the refill that is not coarse.  I may as well have not used it as the same result would have resulted -- i.e., no result -- and I would have not wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Good Product, still haven&#x27;t used as of yet. Still with the other Emjoi Micropedi, they seem to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Keeps your feet really soft.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to the Micropedi and I much prefer the regular refills to the extra coarse.  I truly think they work better and last longer.</li>
    <li> The refills are great to have on hand&lt;br /&gt;And are easily to install in the pedicure machine.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and I have ordered refills.  It has also cut down on my pedicure visits so that helps to pay for using it.  My feed for whatever reason have veru bad calluses (SP??)  Nothing ha sworked as well as the Emjoi and everyone I have mentioned it to has tried it and agree.  II do not like to see ladies&#x27; heels with thick calluses and white lines.  This product will do away with that problem.</li>
    <li> But I am assuming they will work as well as the original part that came with the Emjoi MicroPedi Foot Buffer, and it is great.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife, and she tells me they are just as good as those that came with the unit.  The choice of coarseness is an added plus.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my Emjoi Micro-Pedi unit.  Love the unit and the replacement rollers are a necessity. Highly recommend this unit and rollers.</li>
    <li> The refills are overpriced  (20) since each one barely lasts one use or. I stopped using it after the refills were gone. Frankly, you are better off using a manual device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and the best I&#x27;ve found. The skin on my heels has always been a problem but no longer. I can smooth the heel skin in just a few moments whereas in the past it was a chore!</li>
    <li> Price is so high for about one cent of sand paper. The unit eats batteries up like candy, but it works ok. I will get the corded unit if I ever order anything like this again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see or feel any difference between them...they do work, though, and they are easy to install. I like the product and would recommend you buy them at the same time as the buffer.</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used/  Works as claimed</li>
    <li> I purchased the Emjoi and i just love it my feet feel so good every time i use it, so i ordered refills so that i could continue to enjoy my emjoi</li>
    <li> I got thes two back up rollers to be able to not run out after using the originals.  Was the best buy.</li>
    <li> best product i&#x27;ve found for my feet. So easy to use and easy to clean. Hopefully the replacement heads stick around for a while, I might have to stock up.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi refills last a long time, so you won&#x27;t be buying these often. But eventually, you&#x27;ll need the refill pack. I liked getting to levels of coarseness (the blue and the pink colors represent different abrasive levels) in one refill pack.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic and have rough edges to the bottoms of my feet. I used to use a pumice and even use a blade to shave away the dead rough skin on my feet. Obviously that is not ideal so I gave this product a try when I saw it as a today&#x27;s special value on QVC. I bought refill rollers from QVC but the price here on Amazon is even better because of the free shipping. You will not be disappointed with this product and the refill rollers that are available here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> These work great with the: Emjoi Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with callus on my feet . Runs in family. Over the years I have&lt;br /&gt;tried everthing that I have found in the market place. The emjoi rollers are fast easy and safe&lt;br /&gt;when used as directed. Well pleased with the rollers.</li>
    <li> This product works better then I could have expected. I love the way the bottoms of my heels have become soft . I would recommend this product to any prospective users.</li>
    <li> It works good and I didn&#x27;t have to pay the high price from the shopping network. I feet and pock-a-book are glad.</li>
    <li> Recommmend you purchase the extras as they are great value. Don&#x27;t know how long the originals will last but it&#x27;s always good to have spares on hand</li>
    <li> I bought this refill pack for an Emjoi that I had purchased.  It does a great job removing calloluses and dry/dead skin on feet</li>
    <li> what a great invention! So much easier than files, etc.  Works well with less effort and leaves nice, smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I had no idea what a hit these would be with my wife when I ordered the Micro-Pedi&lt;br /&gt;without her knowledge for a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;She shure likes this more than a new vacuum cleaner, lol.&lt;br /&gt;She loves using it and it&#x27;s easy to order these replacement rollers,&lt;br /&gt;cheap too for the mileage they give.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good about the whole Emjoi Micro-Pedi&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this product, my feet are super smooth now</li>
    <li> Terrible quality. Didn&#x27;t even last one use!</li>
    <li> I purchased and couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it makes your feet. I purchased the refill pack and now my boyfriend is addicted to using it. I have since purchased 2 more as stocking stuffers. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> This item works great on my feet even tho I don&#x27;t have a lot of callus&#x27;.</li>
    <li> this was exactly what I have ordered</li>
    <li> You can just save yourself the battery money and just go and buy a good foot file from the beauty supply store.  Also, too messy.</li>
    <li> Since I bought the Emoji I thought that it would be smart to order the refill pack. to have around when it is time to replace.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi is awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;this delivers a better pedi than any i have ever gotten..&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s was reasonbly priced and the refill are reasonbly priced..</li>
    <li> The Emjoi callus remover does the job beautifully.  These refills were a tad cheaper on Amazon than QVC.  I highly recommend this product.  I bought it for my DIL and son and they also said it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and the replacement rollers work very well.  Very easy to remove and insert into the machine.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife for Christmas she really likes the way they help keep her heel callouses  under control.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed makes my feet very soft and nice.</li>
    <li> I love all emjoi products.  I love the epilator and this home pedicure appliance as well.  My feet are comfortable and smooth now.  Just a a small pedicure with this appliance and sox with shea butter and you are in heaven.</li>
