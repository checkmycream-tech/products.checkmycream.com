      <li>But nice powder</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!!</li>
      <li>need a slightly warm finishing powder and most finishing powders leave either a ghostly whitish finish, or a beigey color which makes my skin look</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
      <li>I love the Ben Nye Banana Powder it has been the best powder by far</li>
      <li>Nice item... looks great light and the right color for me...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and glides on smoothly using a blender, wedge or even with the touch of your fingertips!</li>
      <li>Pink/peach would look better.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure from color and packaging if this was the banana powder every one was raving about ,but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I love the banana powder it came on time and everything.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
      <li>Will purchase more as soon as it&#x27;s done.</li>
      <li>Love this product and delivery was timely, no issues.</li>
      <li>This product has become a household favorite with highlighting and contouring.</li>
      <li>I love the product ecstasy tky</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because many beauty gurus on Youtube have suggested this for concealing and setting your makeup.</li>
      <li>Just a tip I found to work better.</li>
      <li>If your going for more of a night look</li>
      <li>you can add more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smoother and covers more than the banana in Anastasia&#x27;s contouring kit.....</li>
      <li>and this is the shade you will be using most.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve found using it as highlighter is working better for me.</li>
      <li>WHO DOESNT LOVE BEN NYE?????</li>
      <li>Not the right color for fair skin.</li>
      <li>Just got my package, very beautiful money well spent</li>
      <li>I ordered the colorless neutral set from this line which I expect to be maybe too light, but will make a great starting point for its fine grain for mixing slightly warm finishing powder for the day.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines of the skin nor does it leave any cakey face.</li>
      <li>Super soft to the touch after applied, great for setting concealer.  </li>
      <li>This bottle is huge though</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a chocolate woman and it isnt too light for me.  </li>
      <li>I always use a light hand in foundation, colorwork, and finishing powder applications to get the result I am after.  </li>
      <li>Amazing coverage and blends really well</li>
      <li>The powder does do a great job canceling out red tones in the skin though.</li>
      <li>I read so much about this product before purchasing, I researched similar products and found this to be the best.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a good product to use on top of foundation to set it and keep face matte, but isn&#x27;t meant as a highlighter unless you have darker skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Today I incorporated this Ben Nye Banana color powder in my makeup routine and found with the right application it leaves a gorgeous poreless softly matte appearance that I haven&#x27;t seen but very rarely, and which will render a great youthful finish even on a mature skin.  </li>
      <li>powder is now my GO TO finest grain finishing powder and it has caused my previous best finishing powder to STEP ASIDE (smile).  </li>
      <li>therefore it&#x27;d be best to perhaps use a small tray to pour out the powder.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this powder so much!</li>
      <li>Overall, good product.</li>
      <li>An oxymoron, but true.  </li>
      <li>Very rarely is there anything a close enough &amp;#34;match&amp;#34; to use as is, and skin color changes over time making it interesting to stay on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick shipping</li>
      <li>this is super blendable.</li>
      <li>With alittle practice, it is easy to know how much of what is needed.  </li>
      <li>Thank you soo much!!</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>I add my full face foundation first, then a under eye concealer a couple shades lighter in a V shape under my eye</li>
      <li>it has a great payoff in later years) under my makeup, and after that has set up about 15 minutes, blot it carefully not to disturb it, with a tissue.  </li>
      <li>I also mix my finishingpowder out of too dark, too light, too beige with something goldish to warm it up, for the day -</li>
      <li>super fast shipping  </li>
      <li>and then I press the powder in the concealer very lightly and let it sit for a second</li>
      <li>and I found that when I put this powder on top of my highlight it turned my highlight to the same color as my skin therefore getting rid of the highlight effect.</li>
      <li>Fine lines are disappeared, giving my face a fresh soft evenly clear complexion.  </li>
      <li>it works very well at setting my concealer and keeping it from creasing.</li>
      <li>Highlights really well.</li>
      <li>It makes my face very even looking.  </li>
      <li>It made my under eye circles look darker and the powder appeared very cakey.  </li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to trying this with all the hype around it.  </li>
      <li>This could be because I have a naturally light olive skin tone, and beige simply washes it out.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
      <li>Thanks Ben Nye..</li>
      <li>Regular powder , nothing special about this product .</li>
      <li>The only skintone I can imagine this looking good on is an Asian skintone that already has some yellow undertones.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>But the less the better.</li>
      <li>I am 27 and it makes me look much older when I wear this.</li>
      <li>I love the banana powder but it definitely looks better if its mixed with a loose translucent powder to hilight under the eyes so it doesn&#x27;t look as yellow.</li>
      <li>so make sure you&#x27;re not using it everyday.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and provides a natural, but slight sheen that looks radiant.</li>
      <li>Having an oily skin, my quest has always been to find the finest grain finishing powder like rice powder that I can use thinly all day to de-shine my makeup without actually enhancing pores or caking up, but with some color, and NOT white which completely changes all the wonderful color work I have done just prior to using the finishing powder.</li>
      <li>You can get the same type of product for MUCH cheaper.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast actually received before date expected😄 for me</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>Even on the rest of my face, it looks cakey and settles into small fine lines and creases.</li>
      <li>Great product but a little expensive</li>

<li> (last note, the lid is too small to use as a palette for the product which annoys me much to my surprise since it lacks function)</li>
<li> &amp;#34;Product used by Kim Kardashian to hide dark under eye circles.&amp;#34; However, every time I use this product near my eyes, my eyes burn, water, and swell.</li>
<li> It can also be very messy if you pour out too much</li>

    <li> Not the right color for fair skin. But nice powder</li>
    <li> Amazing coverage and blends really well</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all!! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my skin type but the product did not satisfy me or my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love this product and delivery was timely, no issues.</li>
    <li> I love the banana powder but it definitely looks better if its mixed with a loose translucent powder to hilight under the eyes so it doesn&#x27;t look as yellow. Just a tip I found to work better.</li>
    <li> Too yellow on face.&lt;br /&gt; Pink/peach would look better.</li>
    <li> La-la-love it! Everything the tutorials on YouTube said it would be like, would definitely recommend it to my girlfriends that are into makeup</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure from color and packaging if this was the banana powder every one was raving about ,but it gets the job done. Im very very satisfied it does set my highlight</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and a little goes a long way I&#x27;m a chocolate woman and it isnt too light for me.  I add my full face foundation first, then a under eye concealer a couple shades lighter in a V shape under my eye and then I press the powder in the concealer very lightly and let it sit for a second or two then i use a brush to wipe away excess.  If your going for more of a night look you can add more. If your looking powdery I always apply my makeup a couple hours before I go out so my skin becomes dewy and not so powdery look but if you dont have time use a makeup setter like Mac +fix it refresher or elf has a nice one also good luck ladies youll love this. You dont need alot and the packaging can make it a little messy but you&amp;#34;ll make due.</li>
    <li> Regular powder , nothing special about this product .</li>
    <li> Love it! Goes on so smooth and looks great.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product super fast shipping  Thankyou!</li>
    <li> Love it !!! Looks amazing On the skin</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Nice item... looks great light and the right color for me... Thanks Ben Nye..</li>
    <li> Great product but a little expensive</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!! Quick shipping, product arrived as described, and look forward to future transactions! 😊</li>
    <li> Personally for my taste the color is a little too yellow for me so I might go with a different shade. I do like that it works very well at setting my concealer and keeping it from creasing.</li>
    <li> Just received mine can&#x27;t wait to try it!! Thank you soo much!!</li>
    <li> It makes you look yellow, eventhough it suppose to even out your complexion.</li>
    <li> Great for setting my highlight ! The powder is very messy, but it does it&#x27;s job. A little goes a long way so I&#x27;ll have it for a while. Worth the money. This is definitely a must-have for my makeup bag</li>
    <li> Omg!!!!! This banana powder is the bomb...... Love it!!!!! I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> i swear by this!. can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> this is the best powder I have ever purchased. It&#x27;s smoother and covers more than the banana in Anastasia&#x27;s contouring kit.....and this is the shade you will be using most.  handles heat and humidity like a champ.  a must have for any girls makeup routine, regardless the skin shade. this is super blendable.</li>
    <li> WHO DOESNT LOVE BEN NYE?????</li>
    <li> Super soft to the touch after applied, great for setting concealer.  This bottle is huge though and I don&#x27;t use makeup all the time so it will probably go bad before I even go through half this bottle.</li>
    <li> This powder is REEEELY excellent!  Having an oily skin, my quest has always been to find the finest grain finishing powder like rice powder that I can use thinly all day to de-shine my makeup without actually enhancing pores or caking up, but with some color, and NOT white which completely changes all the wonderful color work I have done just prior to using the finishing powder. I am blotting my face all day long, and resetting my blotted makeup to freshen up, and the finishing powder will make or break the finished result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a slightly warm finishing powder and most finishing powders leave either a ghostly whitish finish, or a beigey color which makes my skin look washed out even having plenty of blush / contouring / eye color / lip colors applied!  An oxymoron, but true.  This could be because I have a naturally light olive skin tone, and beige simply washes it out.  Very rarely is there anything a close enough &amp;#34;match&amp;#34; to use as is, and skin color changes over time making it interesting to stay on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complicating everything, I ALWAYS use a 30 sunscreen (this is a MUST - never skip - it has a great payoff in later years) under my makeup, and after that has set up about 15 minutes, blot it carefully not to disturb it, with a tissue.  Then I typically mix my foundation using very small amounts of too dark (or bronze) with too light and with a very small amount of something too yellow gold to warm the finished foundation to use, and add a little mattefier to this concoction which really helps my makeup get less oily during the day. I mix according to the colors I wear, hair color, and season of the year - but I always need a warmish color on my skin.  The amount of foundation with mattefier I mix is in my hand and just enough for the one application that day to layer thinly and carefully over the blotted sunscreen, no leftovers.  With alittle practice, it is easy to know how much of what is needed.  I also mix my finishingpowder out of too dark, too light, too beige with something goldish to warm it up, for the day - sometimes I have leftover of the custom mixed finishing powder - I cover it with plastic and use it over the next day or so until it is gone and I need to mix more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I incorporated this Ben Nye Banana color powder in my makeup routine and found with the right application it leaves a gorgeous poreless softly matte appearance that I haven&#x27;t seen but very rarely, and which will render a great youthful finish even on a mature skin.  I always use a light hand in foundation, colorwork, and finishing powder applications to get the result I am after.  Makeup is an art and great fun to achieve a really great look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS powder is now my GO TO finest grain finishing powder and it has caused my previous best finishing powder to STEP ASIDE (smile).  I ordered the colorless neutral set from this line which I expect to be maybe too light, but will make a great starting point for its fine grain for mixing slightly warm finishing powder for the day.</li>
    <li> I love the Ben Nye Banana Powder it has been the best powder by far I ever used. I don&#x27;t think I would ever use any other brand of powder. Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> It came quickly &amp; yes it works great!</li>
    <li> Too yellow for my skin .</li>
    <li> Just got my package, very beautiful money well spent</li>
    <li> I was under the impression it would show a lighter glow under my eyes....Maybe I&#x27;m just using it wrong....lol</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. You can get the same type of product for MUCH cheaper.</li>
    <li> As for the product itself, it is definitely great at mattifying and keeping your face shine free. BUT I&#x27;m assuming a lot of people are here because Kim Kardashian uses this as a highlighter and in my experience it&#x27;s not quite what you think. I have probably a similar skin tone to her (when she&#x27;s not spray tanning) and I found that when I put this powder on top of my highlight it turned my highlight to the same color as my skin therefore getting rid of the highlight effect. The powder does do a great job canceling out red tones in the skin though. This product also does contain talc which is harmful to your skin so make sure you&#x27;re not using it everyday. Overall this is a good product to use on top of foundation to set it and keep face matte, but isn&#x27;t meant as a highlighter unless you have darker skin. (last note, the lid is too small to use as a palette for the product which annoys me much to my surprise since it lacks function)</li>
    <li> Wonderful, flawless finish.  It goes on easily and provides a natural, but slight sheen that looks radiant.</li>
    <li> I read so much about this product before purchasing, I researched similar products and found this to be the best. &amp;#34;Product used by Kim Kardashian to hide dark under eye circles.&amp;#34; However, every time I use this product near my eyes, my eyes burn, water, and swell. I am careful to not get too close, but it doesn&#x27;t set my make-up like I hoped. Even on the rest of my face, it looks cakey and settles into small fine lines and creases. I am 27 and it makes me look much older when I wear this. Please beware of this before you purchase!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It&#x27;s very light and glides on smoothly using a blender, wedge or even with the touch of your fingertips! It doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines of the skin nor does it leave any cakey face. I purchased this product because many beauty gurus on Youtube have suggested this for concealing and setting your makeup. This product has become a household favorite with highlighting and contouring. A little goes a long way when using this. It can also be very messy if you pour out too much therefore it&#x27;d be best to perhaps use a small tray to pour out the powder. Overall, good product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast actually received before date expected😄 for me the powder is tricky I wanted to use under eyes but I&#x27;ve found using it as highlighter is working better for me. I&#x27;m still playing around with it all and all I&#x27;m happy with it there&#x27;s a lot of product .</li>
    <li> I love the product ecstasy tky what I was looking for and was delivered on time</li>
    <li> Loveeeeee This product</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to trying this with all the hype around it.  I wanted to use it to illuminate my cheekbones and under my eyes.  This could not have been a worse powder for that.  It is VERY yellow and has no highlighting effects whatsoever.  It made my under eye circles look darker and the powder appeared very cakey.  The only skintone I can imagine this looking good on is an Asian skintone that already has some yellow undertones.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love the banana powder it came on time and everything. I feel like this company should create a way that the  powder can be less messy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder so much! But the less the better.</li>
    <li> Amazing ! Highlights really well. Will purchase more as soon as it&#x27;s done.</li>
    <li> This Banana Powder is awesome; I put in on after a light application of my mineral powder, then my blush on top.  It makes my face very even looking.  Fine lines are disappeared, giving my face a fresh soft evenly clear complexion.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  I do recommend it</li>
    <li> Feels/ looks cakey...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real stuff. Will not use it again.</li>
