      <li>I have tried too many anti-aging creams but the C&#x27;Armour Skin Intensive Anti-aging Peptides, All-in-One cream is the best thus far.</li>
      <li>So far, I am very happy, and I am completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I am very fortunate that my friend shared this with me...</li>
      <li>Since I had been using a product that my skin liked just fine, I figured &#x60;why bother to change&#x27;?  </li>
      <li>recommend that you give this wonderful cream a try and believe me you won&#x27;t go back to using anything else!!</li>
      <li>you again C&#x27;amour and wish you are going better and better :)</li>
      <li>It works just as well as (or better than) products that cost much more, and it&#x27;s versatile as well.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve been using it longer and really love the suppleness in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Since using this cream, most of them disappeared.</li>
      <li>My make up stays longer and skin looks more youthful and dewy.</li>
      <li>I find C&#x27;Armour keeps my skin looking and feeling healthy.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to make sure I would not run out.</li>
      <li>My skin just seems softer more dewy and definitely more youthful.</li>
      <li>I am on my second tube and am very happy with this cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will improve even more with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My lips even feel alittle more plumped up than usual!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and you can put your make up on top of it and still feel like there is nothing on your face.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels more supple.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I came upon this lotion and thought I&#x27;d try it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Use the cream a couple times or more every day.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to pay more for an eye cream.</li>
      <li>I never write reviews, but had to share how much I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love that I can use this cream around my eyes,</li>
      <li>and the texture has never been better</li>
      <li>I am in Love with it and use it twice a day and cannot go a day without it.</li>
      <li>I love love love this cream.</li>
      <li>Thank you C&#x27;Armour Skin Care, I love having access to this product here in Australia.</li>
      <li>It really works best for me if I use it before make-up application and before bedtime on freshly cleansed skin.</li>
      <li>And as stated right on the front of the tube, \\&quot;You can&#x27;t go a day without it!\\&quot; Love this!</li>
      <li>They all come in beautiful packages and containers, and a lot of promises!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this oroduct just only for two months and love it.</li>
      <li>it feels light and my skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>My face was smooth, moist &amp; the pigmentation seemed more even.</li>
      <li>top of C Armour I like to put light water based moisturizer</li>
      <li>Easy to use for a guy and gets results that are visible.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a great many things that I can only use at night because it doesn&#x27;t work under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I break out so easily , but I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case even after having a TCA peel.</li>
      <li>This cream begins with the first application and just gets better and better.</li>
      <li>fine lines, BUT</li>
      <li>I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin, and within minutes I can apply my sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>but my skin seems to still crave something more and anyway who can afford to keep that up and again it isn&#x27;t always in the right easy to travel with packaging.  </li>
      <li>Well I&#x27;m happy to say I finally have!  </li>
      <li>Another important feature about this product is that it&#x27;s an all-in-one.  </li>
      <li>well, it is light and your face is not oily afer</li>
      <li>The cream leaves a smooth feeling on my skin, not grasy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just ordered my third tube of C&#x27;Armour.  I love this stuff!  I am 55 years old and have tried tons of products, some very expensive ones too.  I&#x27;ve been using C&#x27;Armour for several months now with fantastic results....smoother, clearer and youthful skin.  Keep in mind this is a &amp;#34;Base&amp;#34;.  With that said, after cleansing my face with DERMAdoctor  Wrinkle Revenge 3 and my Skinmedica Rejuvenative Toner, I apply C&#x27;Armour, then my Skinmedica C &amp; E Complex, then my moisturizer with a drop of Lavendar oil added.  The other products I mentioned you can get on Amazon too.  I love my skin!  I get compliments all the time...people always think I&#x27;m about 15 years younger.  Since I rely on reviews a lot when trying a new product, I hope this review helps you.</li>
    <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and have had dry skin most of my life.  From the moment I started using this cream my skin was transformed.  I have spent thousands of dollars on upscale moisturizers but NOTHING has come close to this amazing cream.  I will use it from now on.  Truly wonderful. C. West</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! I can not imagine going a day without it. My pores appear smaller and I don&#x27;t need to apply as much lotion. great product.</li>
    <li> I got this after reading a bunch of reviews raving about it.  The price was better than the high end department store brands I was using.  It moisturized my skin okay but I did not notice any results.</li>
    <li> I love love love this cream. I am the poster girl for trying new creams, lotions,potions .. you name it I have tried it. My bathrooms look like  retail stores I kid you not!I took a gamble on this because of all the great reviews...and yes..it is just a great as everyone says!.I am on my 2nd tube even though I haven&#x27;t used up all of my first because..just like it says..you can&#x27;t go without it and I wanted to make sure I would not run out. My skin just seems softer more dewy and definitely more youthful.I use it in the am..and actually no longer need a foundation..I just use blush. I apply it also at night..and voila.. I wake up with great skin.And just like the old Brylcream commercials.(tells you how old I am!) just a little dab will do you. Try it  I think you will love it!.</li>
    <li> I have gone through three tubes of this stuff. It is very moisturizing. I did stop using it for awhile , just because of cost, and I have to say, I did see a difference in my skin without it. Wish they had a frequent buyer program!</li>
    <li> Feels rich but is absorbed easily . You can really tell the difference in your skin. The cream is concentrated so you dont need to use lots at a time. I definitely feel this cream has been more effective than others I have tried at making my skin feel soft and plumped up.</li>
    <li> Easy to use for a guy and gets results that are visible.  Exceptional value at the price it is offered.</li>
    <li> expected more for the price.  I take very good care of my skin, but this really did not seem to make any difference at all compared to any other good treatment moisturizer, for half the cost.  Would not reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad it worked for others though, just not for me.</li>
    <li> As a 31 year old mother of 2, I need an easy and effective cream that shows results.  I have dark circles (lack of sleep) and some discoloration from occasional acne.  C&#x27;Armour Skin Base helps so much with evening my skin tone, lessening my dark circles and leaving me with a soft, almost silk-like touch to my skin.  The price is reasonable and one tube usually lasts me about 60 days (when I don&#x27;t catch my husband using it too!).  Love this cream!</li>
    <li> I am a 41 year old mother of three and have tried a ton of anti-wrinkle products over the years.  I was recently introduced to C&#x27;Armour by a friend of mine and COULD NOT BELIEVE the difference I saw in my skin just after the first day! The package claims to even skin tones, and as other products say the same, I was impressed by the fact that this cream ACTUALLY worked.  I had yet to find a base cream that could make my fine lines and wrinkles blend as well as C&#x27;Armour Skin cream does.  The plus to this cream is that it is not greasy or heavy, and my make up applies even and smooth.  I have had several people ask if I had some procedure done (like a peel) because they noticed that my skin looked more radiant and silky-that&#x27;s what a difference using this cream makes.  I LOVE C&#x27;Armour Skin and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a resonably priced anti-wrinkle, skin firming cream.  It really works!  And as stated right on the front of the tube, \\&quot;You can&#x27;t go a day without it!\\&quot; Love this!</li>
    <li> I like to wash my face and experience the good feeling of rubbing C&#x27;ARMOUR skin base on my face and know my skin will benefit from all the excellent ingredients in this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice a day for five years.  It is amazing.  I feel like I have missed something if for any reason I forgot to use it.  I only wish Christina would create a body lotion with the same peptides so I could use it on my entire body!!  Thank you Christina!!  You have made my life better and easier!! Try it!  You won&#x27;t go a day without it!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended BASE to me a long time ago... and I didn&#x27;t want to try it.  I admit I was skeptical. My skin is so sensitive and tends to break into an itchy rash for no reason.  Since I had been using a product that my skin liked just fine, I figured &#x60;why bother to change&#x27;?  Plus, I hadn&#x27;t even heard of it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I was looking at the ingredients of the &#x60;other product&#x27; and realized that it contained similar ingredients to BASE - but also a LOT of fragrance.  Did I mention that it cost me 3 times more than BASE?  Well, I decided to take a leap of faith and try BASE, assuming that it couldn&#x27;t hurt.  If anything, the lack of fragrance and coloring would make it even less likely to irritate my skin.  And the money I save could be used elsewhere (and who couldn&#x27;t use some extra cash??)  That was over a year ago, and today I must tell you that I am hooked.  BASE is truly the one product that I am addicted to.  It works just as well as (or better than) products that cost much more, and it&#x27;s versatile as well.  I use it for my face, neck, and around my eyes. It makes the surface of your skin feel smooth and even (truly, like a &#x60;base&#x27; for other products and cosmetics).  When I travel, it&#x27;s the one tube I throw into my bag, after the toothpaste of course! I like it so much that I&#x27;m afraid I may tend to apply more that I need (it just feels so good!) I am very fortunate that my friend shared this with me... I wish I would have switched earlier.</li>
    <li> I am 63 and my face is really starting to sag.  That is the biggest change I see that my face is tightening up and I feel I look younger. I just started using the cream (2 weeks).  I have many expensive creams that are day and night cream, eye cream etc and I stopped using all of them.  I only use this one now.  I have been getting compliments on my looks with people I haven&#x27;t seen in a while.  i will continue using.  Cheaper and easier.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I have researched and used many different creams, lotions, serums etc. and this is the best I have found. It really works!!! I just ordered my 3rd tube and will continue using this product...forever. My search for the perfect anti-aging cream is over. Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this cream to me and I reluctantly tried it.  There are soooo many creams out there - why can&#x27;t I find one I like!!?  Well I&#x27;m happy to say I finally have!  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but am amazed at how many of the products out there burn my skin.  But the bigger problem is finding one that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  This stuff goes on beautifully and feels so good!  I seriously just love the way my skin feels when I put it on!  And it really seems to make my fine lines disappear.  I seriously love the way my skin looks and feels after putting this cream on!  I never write reviews, but had to share how much I love this product.  I really don&#x27;t want to go a day without it!  I truly love this stuff!  Try it - it really works!!</li>
    <li> The thing I like about C&#x27;Armour Skin Base is that immediately it makes my skin feel nourished &amp; smooth. I LOVE that I don&#x27;t have to buy 5 other products to go with it. It fits right into the regimen I am already using. Compared to all the other products I have bought, Base is very affordable &amp; one tube can last a long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube and I really love this product! It&#x27;s rich and creamy but not greasy - really absorbs well into my skin. I believe it has, and is, making a difference in the texture of my skin - my skin feels softer and not as &#x27;fractured&#x27; as it was prior to my using this product.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this product caused a rash on my neck within a few days of use. I had relied on the reviews, but frankly after looking at them post-rash I do not trust them any more.&lt;br /&gt;In defense of the product - my skin is very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;In defense of the seller - when contacted seller immediately refunded the purchase price - excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I would give this product only one star but the seller&#x27;s immediate positive action changed my review from one to two stars.</li>
    <li> I am strict when it comes to skin care. I read the reviews and had to give C&#x27;Armour a try. So far, I am very happy, and I am completely satisfied. I hope this product is around for a long time. I plan to reorder as long as it is available. Thank you for creating an all-in-one base that actually works!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Michelle~</li>
    <li> This is a really great product for an acceptable price. I am in the over 65 age group and have used almost every pricey products available for mature skin. They all come in beautiful packages and containers, and a lot of promises!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this oroduct just only for two months and love it. The cream leaves a smooth feeling on my skin, not grasy. I think the life lines in my face (please, not wrinkles) show that they are well taken care of.</li>
    <li> C&#x27;Armour skin base is well worth the purchase. You will not regret spending this money on yourself as part of your regular skin care regimen. The cream is not at all greasy. It very easily works into your skin leaving a nice refreshing, firm feel to your face, neck and hands.  I told Ms. C&#x27;Armour how beautiful her skin always looked when I saw her.  I had no idea she had her own anti-aging skin base product!  I was sold right there and then.  I bought her cream for anti-aging on the spot and have not stopped buying it even when we moved 3,000 miles away.  I have received numerous compliments about my pretty skin and attribute them to C&#x27;Armour&#x27;s cream.  Use the cream a couple times or more every day.  You do not need to spend a fortune on a moisturizer when using C&#x27;Armour cream base so right there you will save money!  Invest in C&#x27;Armour&#x27;s anti-aging base cream and you will not regret it!  It really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old and have tried many facial lotions in the past as my skin is showing signs of age.  I am always looking for a product that meets my expectations as far as keeping my skin looking and feeling young. I came upon this lotion and thought I&#x27;d try it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. C&#x27;Armour Skin Base has turned out to be one great skin care treatment! I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin, and within minutes I can apply my sunscreen.  This lotion has improved my skin tone, and has faded dark spots on my cheeks.  My skin is never dry or dull with this product.  I put it on first thing in the morning and at night.  I recommend C&#x27;Armour Skin Base to anyone who&#x27;s looking to improve the appearance of their skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. I put it on in the morning and then add my sunscreen. Any extra, I add to the top of my hands. I actually expected it to work on my face (it really does!), but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smooth out the skin on my hands. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two months and I am hooked- it is absolutely amazing- it feels light and my skin has never looked better. My mom and sister are now also interested in trying Base as my skin looks so good. I am a believer in this product and would not go a single day without it. I have used every face product there is and I can honestly say this creme is by far the best on the market. It is Amazing !!!</li>
    <li> C&#x27;Armour Skin base is incredible. I started using the product last month and it works wonders. My skin is super soft and look healthy. I have switched from another brand. I find C&#x27;Armour keeps my skin looking and feeling healthy.</li>
    <li> this cream is very good and seems to be working on the area I have problem with- decolletege.  I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The best thing about C&#x27;Armour Skin Base is that I don&#x27;t have to change the skincare program that I have been devoted to for years. It&#x27;s so easy to integrate into my regular routine. I simply apply the Base before my daily moisturizer and night cream. My skin definitely looks smoother and feels firmer!</li>
    <li> I am a 47 year old mother of three biological children and 2 adopted children.  So as you can imagine my life goes at 100mph 24hrs a day, 7 days a week.  Over the many years that I have been using facial products, I must have tried every product on the market that would promise the earth and did not deliver the earth!!&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago I came across C&#x27;Armour Skin Base Intensive Cream and I thought that it would just be like the rest, but............ it wasn&#x27;t.  I can honestly say that I have loved using this cream and I can visibly see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I put the cream on before my foundation every morning and every evening after I have cleansed my face before I go to bed at night.  It applies well, it is light and your face is not oily afer application.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you give this wonderful cream a try and believe me you won&#x27;t go back to using anything else!!</li>
    <li> Buy, buy, buy ladies! This cream does just what it says. Since being introduced to C&#x27;Armour Skin Base, my skin has taken on a youthful, glowing appearance. The fine lines around my eyes (my smile lines) are becoming less noticeable &amp; in general my skin is moisturised but does not look greasy! I have combination skin with a tendency to breakout ( yes, it still happens at 44!) but I can honestly say that I have had no problems with this product. I will definitely be purchasing again when I run out. Thank you C&#x27;Armour Skin Care, I love having access to this product here in Australia.</li>
    <li> My skin has been amazing since I used this cream. I look healthy , fresh  and the texture has never been better even my pores look smaller. I break out so easily , but I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case even after having a TCA peel. It helped in the healing process. I still have my hormonal problems once a month.&lt;br /&gt;The face cream is intensely rich and not sticky, it penetrates fast, I am very pleased with the results so far. I love that I can use this cream around my eyes, thats a plus and I don&#x27;t have to pay more for an eye cream. My tube lasts me way longer than a two months but I don&#x27;t apply it every night. Still you get a lot in the tube for a cream of this quality.&lt;br /&gt;It took about a month to really see the change and I also started taking fish oil capsules that has helped go hand in hand.&lt;br /&gt;On top of C Armour I like to put light water based moisturizer and I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I have always used moisturizers both expensive and inexpensive, but hated the ones that made my skin feel greasy and that sat on the top of your skin making you break out.  I love Base because it goes on light, feels silky against your skin and you can put your make up on top of it and still feel like there is nothing on your face.  Plus, all of the anti-aging ingredients are important to this 53 year old face! I would rate Base up there with the most expensive of creams that I have used but still consider it a great bargain for the price.  A little goes a very long way and as the saying goes, you will be running back for more!</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and just tried C&#x27;Armour Skin cream and I felt it wording immediately. I couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on each day and now I&#x27;m hooked. My face is so much softer and healthier looking. I would definitely recommend trying it and feel the difference yourself!!</li>
    <li> I have been using BASE for about 3 to 4 weeks, and have noticed that my skin tone looks more even, and the lines around my lips (that are hereditary) are not looking as pronounced as they used to, which I am really pleased about! My lips even feel alittle more plumped up than usual!&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the lines on my forehead feel a lot smoother and don&#x27;t seem quite as deep as they used to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tube seems to stretch a long way,and I would definitely recommend it. I will be buying more when i run out!</li>
    <li> I have tried too many anti-aging creams but the C&#x27;Armour Skin Intensive Anti-aging Peptides, All-in-One cream is the best thus far. My skin feels smooth and the appearance of wrinkles and age spots are much less visible than before using this product. I am on my second tube and am very happy with this cream.</li>
    <li> I was confused as to the &amp;#34;Base&amp;#34; name, to me that is more of a foundation, so don&#x27;t let that throw you. C&#x27;Armour Base is a skin treatment cream. I started using this product about 3-4 weeks ago. I am a red head, with extremely sensitive skin and over 40. With that said, I noticed right away that my skin felt softer and some of the red undertones in my skin had diminished. I have been using it daily under my makeup and at Christmas, a long-time family friend told me I looked youger than the last time she saw me at Thanksgiving! OK, that sealed the deal... fantastic base, thank you C&#x27;Armour!!! My skin is super soft, healthy and younger looking. I will continue to use this base and am hopeful that soon I will be able to walk out of the house with little to no foundation on!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I am 50 years old and my skin looks and feels the best since I started using this product.  It&#x27;s not greasy and my skin feels firmer as well.  Another important feature about this product is that it&#x27;s an all-in-one.  I like how I don&#x27;t have to use a primer or eye cream.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried several other products before, but this is my favorite by far! Gives my skin a silky, smooth look without leaving it greasy, or dry.  A little goes a long way! Give your face a chance &amp; try it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I have been modeling worldwide for 20 years and have had my fair share of skin products, expensive, in-expensive, different tube shapes and sizes, jars, pots, sachets some easier to travel with than others.  They have promised this and that and the other.  I have never been really convinced........Oh yes I&#x27;ve used the Maria Galland and I&#x27;ve tried La Prairie, i mean yes its all good but my skin seems to still crave something more and anyway who can afford to keep that up and again it isn&#x27;t always in the right easy to travel with packaging.  With C&#x27;Armour Skin Base, after a few applications my skin seems to be relaxed in a way, less taut , less tired looking , lines seem softer.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it sometimes just once a day sometimes twice and the results are to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;Google me, I am 40!  This wonder cream is packaged in a funky little tube and it fits in every bag, it&#x27;s not heavy and is easy to use with its flip top. I work also as a make up artist and use it as a base underneath my make up applications , smooooooooothness :)&lt;br /&gt;I love this Base cream and would recommend it to everyone! I have it on my xmas list and every other list i will be writing in the future. Also great for the guys!!</li>
    <li> I just about to finish my 2 tubes. I had some fine lines on my forehead from much younger age. Since using this cream, most of them disappeared. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel smooth, soft. I would recommend this cream highly.&lt;br /&gt;Just made my second purchased today, can&#x27;t wait to receive them.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a month and didn&#x27;t see any significant change on my skin. Even the wrinkle on my neck didn&#x27;t become lighter. I used it on my hands and nothing changes too. To me this is not as miracle as it said. If you don&#x27;t care about the money, you can play with it and see if this works for you. Otherwise, you can save your money and find more straight forward and effecive products. 75$ for 2 oz is expensive. I could buy 400 mL cold press extra virgin rosehip oil and probably have the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I haven&#x27;t see seller&#x27;s reply until yesterday. And I reply to them to say, I&#x27;d like my refund. And by the end of today, everything is all set. Frankly, this is the best customer service ever. I am so superised and feel so being well considered.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again C&#x27;amour and wish you are going better and better :)</li>
    <li> This product does reduce the appearance of wrinkles, helps skin tone and leaves your skin feeling very soft without the added oil or grease.  I would highly recommend this skin cream for anyone with the above mentioned desires.</li>
    <li> I am 49, and have been using C&#x27;ARMOUR SKIN BASE for over 3 years now and love how silky and smooth it makes my skin feel, never greasy.  I use it in the morning before I put my makeup on (it&#x27;s a great base for my foundation) and really love it at night after I wash my face.  It really is fabulous!!!!  High quality ingredients and I couldnt believe how long a tube last.  In a nutshell, I&#x27;ve tried many high quality creams from department stores and they are either too thick too thin or have a tacky feel....they just don&#x27;t have the quality of smoothness this provides.  Who ever said \\&quot;YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WITHOUT IT\\&quot;, was right!</li>
    <li> This skin base intensive cream has got to be one of the BEST I have tried in years! With such sensitive skin, it is never easy to find a product that works so well. Never greasy, soaks right in and gives the moisture that is needed for thirsty skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> I feel like I have been in on the biggest secret in skin care out there!  This stuff is INCREDIBLE!  I was fortunate enough to begin using BASE a few years ago and can not be happier with the result.  I am a fifty-something Grandma of three who has tried just about every over the counter product out there.  Many of those products made me break out, burned, smelled awful, were sticky or greasy and/or did nothing to improve my skin.  Not one of those products makes my skin feel and look as good as BASE! I look forward to smoothing it on during my daily routine - my skin is soft, supple and just feels great!  Many comment on how great my skin is for someone my age. Highly recommend this - you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! Thats what comes to mind as I start this review.  I just finished my 1st tube and am ordering more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been eternally dry &amp; the more anti aging products I tryout the drier, tighter &amp; flakier I become.  No matter how much moisturizer, oil, hydrating masks I use I remain dry, dry, dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is not a moisturizer it balanced my skin out &amp; I am no longer dry. It not only nourished my skin, it allowed it to absorb other products better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I had to test my theory.  I stopped using it for 2 weeks &amp; kept using all the rest of my products.  Once again I was dry, tight &amp; flaky.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been back on it I rarely need moisturizer and if I do just a light one will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;Armour is great under foundation.  I wash, C&#x27;Armour, sunscreen then foundation.  I&#x27;ve tried a great many things that I can only use at night because it doesn&#x27;t work under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;Value&#x27; of this product on my skin is  immeasurable but the &#x27;Value&#x27; of 2oz of high quality product is immense!  I&#x27;m going to start using it on my neck &amp; chest next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This girl is turning back the sands of time :)</li>
    <li> After doing my research, I found BASE cream offers the most bang for the buck, it is loaded with peptides and makes my skin feel and look really great! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it nightly and getting compliments on my skin; people saying I look refreshed and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the best thing I can tell you is that my husband tried it on his chapped hands.  Yes, I know it was created for facial skin, but let me tell you the background.  For about 9 years, my husband worked in construction, specifically in pouring concrete foundations both residential and commercial, and pouring walkways and slabs.  He didn&#x27;t like wearing gloves because the cement would not lay down as smoothly, so he&#x27;d pop off his gloves and work it directly.  For days afterward the skin on his hands would be dried, crusted, cracked and sometimes bleeding.  He&#x27;s no longer in construction, but he still does some concrete work around the yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month ago he poured a slab for  small garden shed, and of course did not wear gloves.  His soft \\&quot;office worker hands\\&quot; were in tough shape after the work was done.  He found this cream on our bathroom counter and decided to use it.  This time, instead of the moisture being drawn out of his skin, and suffering from cracks and bleeding, his hands healed quickly and within a day were as smooth as before he did the work.  No dried skin.  No cracking.  No bleeding.  THIS to me was the definitive proof that your cream is over and above the competition by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does THIS for his hands, no wonder my facial skin feels and looks younger and refreshed by using it.  I&#x27;m buying him his own tube. Husband thinks you should market it at Lowes and Home Depot, and automotive stores as well. Many thanks for a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> My skin is quite oily and i tend to steer clear of many moisturisers as they give my skin break outs, however a friend recommended C&#x27;Armour Skin BASE to me, and I&#x27;m so glad she did as it is the only moisturiser i have found that helps control the oil on my skin without giving me break outs. It&#x27;s a fantastic cream and I would recommend it to anyone. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> When I first put on the new base cream, I loved the consistency of it! It feels great on the skin and not greasy at all.  It makes my skin feel really smooth and supple.  Then as each day passed, I could tell that my skin was glowing more and just seemed to be more refreshed and younger looking.  Even the woman who gives me my facials commented on how good my skin was looking! and that I look a lot younger than I really am!!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> C&#x27;Armour Skin Base is the best skin cream I have found to date. I am in Love with it and use it twice a day and cannot go a day without it. I now have my mom and sister using it as well.  Amazing product !!!</li>
    <li> I normally do not write reviews but this product deserves to be touted. I use this product every morning and night, and it makes my skin feel fantastic.  Buy it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This cream provides the perfect base. Complimenting my skin care routine perfectly. My make up stays longer and skin looks more youthful and dewy. My moisturiser seems to hydrate my skin better when I use this base cream. I will definitely be recommending to all my friends and will buy it again for sure once it runs low. It&#x27;s still gonna strong for now as a little goes a long way. A product which works so well and fills a void in the beauty market . Five stars x</li>
    <li> \\&quot;My new found Miracle Cream! Being a woman that loves the outdoors,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin has been screaming for moisture! I&#x27;m so happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christina introduced me to this product. I use it daily, before my regular&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer. It&#x27;s smooth, creamy, and non-scented which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, my skin looks smoother and feels great!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I really like it.  It makes my skin dewy without being greasy.  My skin feels more supple.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in my skin tone yet, but it IS slightly less blotchy.  I&#x27;m sure it will improve even more with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;Armour base does get filmy if I put it on straight out of the shower or when my skin is still hot, so I make sure to wait until I&#x27;m totally cooled off.  As long as I do that, it feels great and doesn&#x27;t wipe off but it absorbs right in.  My mom tried it under her eyes and really loved the suppleness it created.  It lasts a long time since only a small amount is needed.  I will continue to use this during the summer and see how it works with the change in season-but I can tell you it&#x27;s great in the dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDED TWO MONTHS AFTER FIRST:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I&#x27;ve been using it longer and really love the suppleness in my skin.  It is evening out the tone too!  Had to come back and five it another star!</li>
    <li> I am 62 years old and my daughter recommended this product to me. She was &amp;#34;amazed at the results&amp;#34; and so am I. It really works best for me if I use it before make-up application and before bedtime on freshly cleansed skin. Over the years I have tried dozens of anti-aging creams with so-so results. This cream begins with the first application and just gets better and better. Is it worth the price? I say yes.</li>
    <li> I was one of the first users of this cream, almost 3 years ago. I love it! The tube lasts me a long time and it makes a HUGE difference in my skin. You don&#x27;t need as much of this as you do other moisturizers. I live in Utah, where the average humidity is 20%. Between the summer heat and the winter cold, my skin dries out fast. The sun, at this altitude, is stronger. When I first started using this, I noticed immediately improvements in my skin. Now, after almost three years, my skin is smooth and clear. Many people cannot believe that I am 48 years old!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my skin, so good I&#x27;m purchasing this on international shipment. My skin feels so soft and looks more youthful. No other cream I have tried achieves such good results. A must have!</li>
    <li> I use this to enhance my current skincare regimen and it makes it work even better.  I use it as a base cream at night and day before I apply my serums and day or night cream. After 2 weeks, I felt improvement! My face was smooth, moist &amp; the pigmentation seemed more even. Over the years, I have tried a lot of expensive brands like Dior, Clarins, Le Mer, Skinceuticals, Cosmedix. None delivered the results like C&#x27;Armour Skin&#x27;s Base. Now I &#x27;can&#x27;t live without it&#x27;....like your package says!</li>
    <li> This product DID make my skin look smooth and appeared to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; fine lines, BUT it was way too heavy for my skin &amp; caused a major breakout. The tube is a generous size, and considering you need less than a pea sized amount to cover your entire face I think it is well worth the price as this tube should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne prone skin this may not be for you - its very heavy and no matter how little product I used, my skin felt greasy.</li>
    <li> I am a 52 year old woman going through the \\&quot;change of life\\&quot;.  Since I started using C&#x27;Armour Skin BASE, I have no more pimples! My friends tell me my face looks fresh and younger!</li>
    <li> Received it quickly and began using immediately.  I found it to be everything that was written in previous testimonials!  A great product!!</li>
    <li> I am 39 years old and am starting to see some lines, especially in my forehead that drive me crazy. I wear sunscreen and stay out of the sun as much as I can. I started using this cream about a month ago and I can really tell it has made a difference in the lines on my forehead. My skin also looks much healthier.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
