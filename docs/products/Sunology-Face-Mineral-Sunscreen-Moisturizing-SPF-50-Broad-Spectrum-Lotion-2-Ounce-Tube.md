      <li>My friends also rave about the kids sunscreen products they offer because they have NO chemicals and provide great protection.</li>
      <li>Which isn&#x27;t really surprising, but just know that if you&#x27;re looking for something to use every day for an extended time, while this does offer good protection, it also seems to clog the pores!</li>
      <li>The opinions in this review are completely my own!</li>
      <li>Great and safe product!</li>

      <li>This is a very nice sunscreen, not too chalky, feels nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>When I was offered this sample product for free to test and review, I was more than happy to try it.</li>
      <li>It has a light but pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>It does not have a scent, it is water resistant and is very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>but I tossed them out after reading the ingredients and seeing that many of them contained parabens, even though I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction and liked them a lot and used them for years</li>
      <li>I’ve researched the most effective sunscreens in the market to protect my skin from the sun.</li>
      <li>It feels wonderful and has a great fresh fragrance that makes it such a pleasure to use.  </li>

      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Sunscreen is non greasy and I love that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
      <li>I used to use Neutrogena sunscreen products for myself and my family for many, many years</li>
      <li>Wish Sunology  had a product like that, I would surely buy it.</li>
      <li>So pleased with the customer service.  </li>
      <li>Just because a product is from a well-known brand or endorsed by celebrities doesn&#x27;t make the ingredients safe.</li>
      <li>I wear this along with my face lotion and put makeup on top</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I love to snorkel and kayak, and I will wear this product with the Sweetsations tinted sunscreen over it.</li>
      <li>Condition of my skin is better when using it.  </li>
      <li>You might have better luck with your foundation or BB</li>
      <li>so I went on a hunt for something safe, no-clogging, and SPF 50.  </li>
      <li>I have used Sunology products for years and absolutely love the products.</li>
      <li>I am buying more for my family.</li>
      <li>I received this product free or at a discounted price in order to give my honest and unbiased opinions.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love Sunology products.</li>
      <li>Did a superb job of protecting even my chest in constant sun.</li>
      <li>I love the way this sunscreen feels on my skin.</li>
      <li>Great price, nice product, quick ship, thanks!</li>
      <li>I will stick with this brand as long as they continue to make awesome non-toxic sunscreens like this.</li>
      <li>This is a great natural sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Love how it feels on my skin--it has a smooth, silky feel and provides all day protection.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to be using a product with natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>One of the best parts of using Sunology sunscreen is that it doesn&#x27;t have the toxic chemicals like some of the other brands.  </li>
      <li>Sunscreen is greasy and comes off easily.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the somewhat plasticky &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; scent, but that too goes away fairly quickly after application.</li>
      <li>Super oily!</li>
      <li>50 is fabulous - very moisturizing - and I was able to be in the sun at an art festival all day without having to re- apply!</li>
      <li>I have melasma so its extremely important to protect my face from sun exposure.</li>
      <li>Also, using Sunology on my arms can leave a light residue on my furniture when my arms have rested on the table, desk, arms of chairs.  </li>
      <li>this product never makes me break out and goes on smooth underneath my makeup.</li>
      <li>is in stick form and tinted light brown called Head Hunters.</li>
      <li>I know that this is great coverage and rated well on EWG, but it goes on with a white film and leaves you looking like a ghost.</li>
      <li>Vegan and cruelty free.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and also am photo sensitive.  </li>
      <li>I love this sunblock so much!  </li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and use sunblock everyday - Sunology Face Cream SPF</li>
      <li>only good thing I have to say about this sunscreen (the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1) is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother them when they sweat and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving this sunscreen so far.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly though.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use and worked really well under my makeup.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re a little tech-crazy in our household, so I have an app that tells me when I need to reapply my sunscreen, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve not gotten sun burned yet using this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I liked that the smell wasn&#x27;t strong or overpowering like other sunscreens tend to be.</li>
      <li>This is a nice big tube of sunscreen, it is 2.0 oz.  </li>
      <li>So glad to find a natural sun screen for our face.</li>
      <li>The sunology sunscreen worked great on my pale skin during a 5 mile run.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s expensive, which would be ok if I loved it as much as everyone else (ok, 3 people) did.</li>
      <li>The new formula is as smooth as silk, and leaves my skin fully protected.</li>
      <li>I like that this brand uses more natural ingredients and antioxidants in the sunscreen making it like a face cream with high spf.</li>
      <li>Also, I did find a facial sunblock that I am able to use, that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and seems to block the sun well.  </li>
      <li>one, unfortunately, is not something I can use.  </li>
      <li>Because it is zinc based, it has the EXACT consistency of Desitin diaper rash cream.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a non-irritating product!</li>
      <li>I really recommend it!</li>
      <li>She looked like a lobster the first week I diligently applied this sunscreen to her</li>
      <li>First let me start off with saying I NEED to use sunblock.  </li>
      <li>Sinology Natural Sunscreen has an awesome low score of 1, on the Ewg skin deep site, witch is a site that scores products from zero to ten, zero being the lowest toxic score and ten being the highest and most toxic.</li>
      <li>I will say I used too much the first day</li>
      <li>Ok but never seems quite dry.</li>
      <li>Both packages were nicely boxed with little plastic seals over the ends and each tube of sunscreen was sealed with a metallic (removable) tab under the screw-down lid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very prone to break-outs, but this hasn&#x27;t made me break out in pimples or clogged up my pores.</li>
      <li>Really, really like this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The Sunology sunscreen goes on much smoother than the Alba one.</li>
      <li>have to rub in really wwell.</li>
      <li>and this product has worked very well since I have been using it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend these products!  SW</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing the oils in this product makes it spread real well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very greasy too.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product is a bit greasy, but the 80-minute water resistance is wonderful.  I love to snorkel and kayak, and I will wear this product with the Sweetsations tinted sunscreen over it.</li>
    <li> After reading about the dangerous chemicals in 80% of sunscreens, this is it for me. Kinda thick going on, feels nice on your skin. Great price, nice product, quick ship, thanks!</li>
    <li> Just got this item!  So pleased with the customer service.  Could not be happier! :)  Thank you</li>
    <li> This worked wounders.</li>
    <li> It is very thick almost like pure zinc diaper rash cream.  I am of a darker complexion and this cream leaves a very noticeable white residue on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how little I use.  It&#x27;s very greasy too.  It is non irritating on my skin though.  I would recommend this sunblock to someone with extremely pale and dry skin.  This sunscreen will look awful on anyone with just a little bit of color.  You must be ultra light complexioned for this not to look bad.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen. No greasy feel. Disappears into your skin (no white residue). Vegan and cruelty free. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I have melasma so its extremely important to protect my face from sun exposure. I’ve researched the most effective sunscreens in the market to protect my skin from the sun. this product never makes me break out and goes on smooth underneath my makeup. One minor issue that can happen is if you don&#x27;t rub the sunscreen in enough you may end up with a white residue on your face but easily rubs right in to your skin with circular motions before applying makeup. wears well during the day. A little goes a long way so this tube last for a long time. definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  No chemicals to soak in.  Stays on for hours.  Effectively blocks those sun rays.  Has no appreciable smell.  Condition of my skin is better when using it.  Use on my face, neck, chest, arms and back of hands.  Only wish it was a little less heavy, as it would be easier to spread on my skin.  But otherwise, love this product!  (Note:  Sunology will show a white crease in my neckline creases, after being on for a time.  I just run the back of my hand over the whitened crease area and re-spread the Sunology over my neck area.  Also, using Sunology on my arms can leave a light residue on my furniture when my arms have rested on the table, desk, arms of chairs.  On wood and glass, this can be easily wiped off with a little Windex or Pledge.  However, I keep my arms off of fabric covered sofas, chairs, etc., as the suncreen will get rubbed into the fabric and become unsightly.)</li>
    <li> Great and safe product!</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen, it&#x27;s not to heavy or greasy on your face.  I had a chemical peel done a little while ago and this product has worked very well since I have been using it.  Anything that has zinc in it will always leave a white film although this one is not that bad.  I will buy it again.  There is another product that I like to use that is in stick form and tinted light brown called Head Hunters. Wish Sunology  had a product like that, I would surely buy it.</li>
    <li> Ok but never seems quite dry.</li>
    <li> love this! a little quantity goes long ways!</li>
    <li> I really loved this sunscreen. It was easy to use and worked really well under my makeup. It came in a big enough tube that I can also use it on my chest and shoulders that often get burnt in the sun too! It has a light but pleasant smell. I liked that the smell wasn&#x27;t strong or overpowering like other sunscreens tend to be. Its not to greasy or oily either. I have wore this several times with and without makeup in heavy sun exposure and have not gotten any sunburn where I have applied it! This Is a really good product. I really recommend it! ***I received this product free or at a discounted price in order to give my honest and unbiased opinions. The opinions in this review are completely my own!***</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT AND GOES ON GREAT....I FEEL PROTECTED!</li>
    <li> Works....has a white color at first....have to rub in really wwell.</li>
    <li> No burn, put it on early, stayed all day,</li>
    <li> First let me start off with saying I NEED to use sunblock.  All over, all the time.  I have Lupus which comes with photo sensitivity and sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a facial sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one, unfortunately, is not something I can use.  Its greasy, and remained greasy throughout the day. My skin also broke out horribly after one use.  I only used about a small, pea sized amount and lightly dabbed it around my face then slowly worked it into my skin so I don&#x27;t think I over did it on the amount used.  I also put it on clean skin (after air dried for about 10 mins) per my normal routine.  I found this product via the EWG sunscreen guide.  Per the EWG guide the current one I&#x27;m using is only so-so in the UV blocking department (which I would agree with) but at least its not greasy and I don&#x27;t break out from using it.  Sigh, oh well onto trying another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I gave this product to my brother (who does not have the skin issues that I have nor the health issues) and he broke out as well.  So I am throwing out this product.  Also, I did find a facial sunblock that I am able to use, that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and seems to block the sun well.  That product is glo.therapeutics spf 40 facial sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love the way this sunscreen feels on my skin. I can use it as a moisturizer as well as a sunscreen. After my chemical peel, I had no reaction to this product and no sunburn at all. This also has very little smell. I do not like the smell of PABA in other sunscreens. I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no difficulties. I am buying more for my family.</li>
    <li> Super thick, but it works!</li>
    <li> Super oily! May have made me break out.</li>
    <li> I am clearly in the minority here. I don&#x27;t care for this stuff and have no intention of ever reordering it. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have one daughter with skin that tans on a cloudy winter day. She looks like a geisha when I apply this stuff. It looks ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have another daughter with skin that doesn&#x27;t tan easily--it reddens, and after several days it browns. She looked like a lobster the first week I diligently applied this sunscreen to her face.&lt;br /&gt;3. Sunscreen is greasy and comes off easily. This is evidenced by the fact that the area where my daughters slide their swim goggles on and off is a somewhat darker shade than the areas that are less meddled-with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I have to say about this sunscreen (the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1) is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother them when they sweat and the sunscreen/sweat runs into their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% sure this is not a tampering/knock-off issue since I ordered 2 bottles; the bottles were sent from different vendors and arrived on different days--one was an Amazon Prime product and the other was sent from an Amazon merchant. Both packages were nicely boxed with little plastic seals over the ends and each tube of sunscreen was sealed with a metallic (removable) tab under the screw-down lid. I am using both tubes of sunscreen with the same bitterly disappointing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Elta MD for this family.</li>
    <li> I freckle very easily and have been working hard to get rid of them and be preventative. I have been using a Cetephil product- SPF 30 and Dr Jart&#x27;s Renewalist BB- SPF 40 and although I love both of those products and still use them for certain circumstances (most-likely indoor and winter), the SPF on them doesn&#x27;t last long enough (all day) nor work well enough.  (Who has time to re-apply?)  I read that anything over SPF 50 was a waste of energy and very-likely detrimental so I went on a hunt for something safe, no-clogging, and SPF 50.  This one seemed to get decent reviews so I gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the package I was surprised (disappointed) by how small the package was but truth-be-told-- a little goes a long way.  Yes, it is true, it does go on a little white so I use it somewhat sparingly without compromising that SPF.  I do apply the Dr Jart&#x27;s over it to cover the remaining freckles and I still, honestly look a little white, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day.  You might have better luck with your foundation or BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will re-purchase.  I have not broken out from this yet-- one week later, daily use. I do use an oil-based cleanser to get it off.  I wonder for those who did break out if whatever they were (or were not) using to remove the substance just wasn&#x27;t sufficient enough. I also use a powered facial brush and glycolic products to really remove the layers. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t leave this on over night!  The face needs to breathe!</li>
    <li> I felt this sun screen was somewhat oily.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice sunscreen, not too chalky, feels nice and smooth. I wear this along with my face lotion and put makeup on top and it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy to wear all day.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I like the way it feels. No fragrance, quality product.</li>
    <li> This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. The sunology sunscreen worked great on my pale skin during a 5 mile run. I like that this brand uses more natural ingredients and antioxidants in the sunscreen making it like a face cream with high spf. I use this for my 3 year old as well.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen is non greasy and I love that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Love it</li>
    <li> I like that your face isn&#x27;t white after using this.  It goes on well.  Doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly though.  Only use a pea size for face coverage.</li>
    <li> This is a nice big tube of sunscreen, it is 2.0 oz.  It is for your face and is SPF 50.  It has natural oils and is 10% zinc. It does go on white and can be rubbed in about 95%, still a little white.  The direction do say to reapply after 2 hours.  It does not have a scent, it is water resistant and is very easy to apply.  I received this product at a reduced rate in return for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult who loves this product. I&#x27;ve tried other recommended sunscreens but they have either not gone smoothly over my moisturizer, or have irritated my eyes. Sunology for Kids has not made my eyes water. I will say I used too much the first day and I looked a bit pasty! Yesterday, I put it on in little dabs over my moisturizer, then gently blended it over my face. Voila! No white face look. Thanks for a non-irritating product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a very light non-mineral sunscreen on my face for years (Neutrogena) that felt non-existant on my skin. I think this feels a little heavy when first being applied, but that feeling goes away pretty quickly. I don&#x27;t love the somewhat plasticky &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; scent, but that too goes away fairly quickly after application. Be careful to put just the right amount on; if you get too much, your face will be left looking rather pale. When I manage to get just the right amount, there is no visible trace left on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really liked this sunscreen, however, it is really think and made me seriously break out after using it every day for about 2 months.  Which isn&#x27;t really surprising, but just know that if you&#x27;re looking for something to use every day for an extended time, while this does offer good protection, it also seems to clog the pores!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal on sun block. The ingredient zinc are nutural elements that help to reflect the sun rays from your body. No sun getting through here!</li>
    <li> Though the tube is small, you don&#x27;t need much for 1 application. If you use too much your face becomes greasy. I&#x27;m happy to be using a product with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Irritated my skin. And the sunscreen turns your face white. Not good :(</li>
    <li> Big thumbs up for paraben-free sunscreen! I&#x27;ve been on a hunt for all things paraben-free for a while now since a health scare forced me to really look at what I was putting on my skin and absorbing into my body. Just because a product is from a well-known brand or endorsed by celebrities doesn&#x27;t make the ingredients safe. I used to use Neutrogena sunscreen products for myself and my family for many, many years but I tossed them out after reading the ingredients and seeing that many of them contained parabens, even though I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction and liked them a lot and used them for years (if you don&#x27;t believe me, read the ingredients in their Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch sunscreen). I found and have been using Alba Botanica sunscreen now because it&#x27;s paraben-free. When I was offered this sample product for free to test and review, I was more than happy to try it. The Sunology sunscreen goes on much smoother than the Alba one. I&#x27;m guessing the oils in this product makes it spread real well. It goes on white, but then rubs clear. We&#x27;re a little tech-crazy in our household, so I have an app that tells me when I need to reapply my sunscreen, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve not gotten sun burned yet using this sunscreen. I&#x27;m very prone to break-outs, but this hasn&#x27;t made me break out in pimples or clogged up my pores. I&#x27;m loving this sunscreen so far.</li>
    <li> I love this sun screen.  I have fair skin and also am photo sensitive.  Using the water proof sunblock helps through out the day.  you have to remember to reapply but if used correctly it works great.  One of the best parts of using Sunology sunscreen is that it doesn&#x27;t have the toxic chemicals like some of the other brands.  Sinology Natural Sunscreen has an awesome low score of 1, on the Ewg skin deep site, witch is a site that scores products from zero to ten, zero being the lowest toxic score and ten being the highest and most toxic. I will stick with this brand as long as they continue to make awesome non-toxic sunscreens like this.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this sunscreen.  I bought it to wear under my makeup, but it is so think and pasty I couldn&#x27;t.  So I use it on my chest and use something else for my face.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen!  It feels wonderful and has a great fresh fragrance that makes it such a pleasure to use.  The new formula is as smooth as silk, and leaves my skin fully protected.</li>
    <li> I have used Sunology products for years and absolutely love the products. I use it daily as my base before applying my foundation. Love how it feels on my skin--it has a smooth, silky feel and provides all day protection. I have compared it against other products and they don&#x27;t seem to give me the long lasting level of protection. My friends also rave about the kids sunscreen products they offer because they have NO chemicals and provide great protection. Highly recommend these products!  SW</li>
    <li> So glad to find a natural sun screen for our face. We love this product!</li>
    <li> But I really didn&#x27;t like this. It&#x27;s expensive, which would be ok if I loved it as much as everyone else (ok, 3 people) did. But I hate it. It has two good points: it&#x27;s natural and has no smell. The problem is that if you use what I consider to be a sufficient amount, it DOES turn your face white (I realize this contradicts another reviewer, but the &amp;#34;white face&amp;#34; effect was my real experience). Not only does it turn your face white, it turns your shirt white, along with anything else you touch immediately after applying it. Because it is zinc based, it has the EXACT consistency of Desitin diaper rash cream. It feels like I&#x27;m smearing diaper rash cream all over my face...it is heavy and a little sticky. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Sunology products. All natural, no chemicals, AND THEY WORK!!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and use sunblock everyday - Sunology Face Cream SPF 50 is fabulous - very moisturizing - and I was able to be in the sun at an art festival all day without having to re- apply!</li>
    <li> Greasy and leaves filmy residue. Not good for under makeup. Comes off on everything. My search for a great under makeup sunscreen continues.</li>
    <li> Really, really like this sunscreen. I was skeptical that it would really work since it is so &#x27;natural&#x27;. Did a superb job of protecting even my chest in constant sun. Going to stock up for the summer!</li>
    <li> I love this sunblock so much!  There is no odor and it works beautifully!  I have melasma and have struggled with finding sunblock that works well.  This does not irritate my skin, goes on beautifully and protects my face completely from the ugly sun spots.  Also, others have complained about the sunblock leaving white streaks, but I have not had this problem so far.  I think I have found my sunscreen for life!</li>
    <li> I know that this is great coverage and rated well on EWG, but it goes on with a white film and leaves you looking like a ghost. My husband used it at a baseball game and all the other dads just kept laughing at how white he was, he couldn&#x27;t get it to rub in! NOT good when you are trying to encourage sunscreen use!</li>
    <li> This is a great natural sunscreen. It makes my face look blue becuase it&#x27;s so white. That&#x27;s a drawback, but for a natural spf 50 what did you expect!! Good for sun protection, bad if youre trying to get a date.</li>
    <li> a bit oily and sticky</li>
    <li> Seems to work great for me!</li>
    <li> too pastey going on.  Not a fan.</li>
