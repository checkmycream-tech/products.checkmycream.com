      <li>Makes a very nice clone</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I bet the product would be great - if I was able to finish the &amp;#34;project&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>We laughed so much &amp; had the best time making this.</li>
      <li>I followed directions precisely, and it worked great.</li>
      <li>I inserted that step on my own.</li>
      <li>We got the vibrating model so word to the wise, allow ample room at the top for displacement with the vibrator.</li>
      <li>Very easy to make if you follow the instructions and have everything prepared before you start making everything.</li>
      <li>Very easy, super fun date night :D</li>
      <li>gave it 2 stars because I love the idea, and I know it must work for some people</li>
      <li>SHE USES IT EVERY NIGHT, SOMETIMES MORE THAN ONCE</li>
      <li>Ended up with something that looked more like scrambled eggs than a &#x27;willy.</li>
      <li>OK so I bought this as a joke for my husband for his birthday &amp; we were beyond amazed by the product.</li>
      <li>u better work fast...and u better</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>:)))</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s OK..</li>
      <li>Be sure to wash anything you plan on salvaging immediately, this stuff bonds to everything…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Part of the body part we were molding ended up touching the side of the tube but it worked out just fine.</li>
      <li>I carefully unpeeled it and ITS AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>Also the Empire Lab people were really friendly and promptly answered my emails and offered to send more powder.</li>
      <li>Should be more user friendly.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend thought this was way cool!</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions and it turns out fine.</li>
      <li>The mixture drys TOO QUICKLY!</li>
      <li>Do this on tile or an easy to clean up surface as some of the molding material will spill out</li>
      <li>read some erotic stories and watched adult movies while I prepared the mix.</li>
      <li>They sent me some more powder and a thermometer, saying that the thermometer must have been faulty and that&#x27;s why the mould didn&#x27;t set right.</li>
      <li>It was a mess that didn&#x27;t work well for me, I got something that turned out like a freaky incredible hulk willy.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the fast paced process.</li>
      <li>Be sure to have everything laid out ahead of time because things do go fast.</li>
      <li>The one provided is only good for about 6 inches.</li>
      <li>and they were really cool.</li>
      <li>Great product for couple bonding, making it is half the fun!</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s OK you can pull the extra off the top of the mold once you push it all the way to the body.</li>
      <li>This is a really fun couples activity.</li>
      <li>95% of the fun you&#x27;ll ever have with this is the making.</li>
      <li>My fiance and I got this thinking it might be fun.</li>
      <li>We got it pretty quickly from the sender, but the product wasn&#x27;t worth what we paid for it.</li>
      <li>the mould came out of the container, making some air pockets and the thing just didn&#x27;t set right at all.</li>
      <li>Have to plan ahead and move fast though, sets quick.</li>
      <li>I think if we had tried to reposion things the mold would have been ruined...it sets up FAST!</li>
      <li>had i been more properly prepared to do it.</li>
      <li>It was funny.</li>
      <li>:) I do suggest you use the vibrator even if you don&#x27;t plan to use it as it adds extra stability.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought this and let me just say that it works awesome if you have someone with you or can multi task unfortunately</li>
      <li>I can not and had to buy more stuff from the actual website but on the plus side they sell each part separately in case</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for anyone interested.</li>
      <li>Haha, I know this sounds ridiculous, but it felt kind of like not being able to have an erection for my gf -</li>
      <li>all the way to the top,  which results in a shorter final product than the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I prepared ahead of time and had the faucet going steady at 98 degrees, I opened the molding powder and had it right beside my bowl with measuring cups.</li>
      <li>however, I followed directions exactly and before I could even begin stirring, it was hardened too much.</li>
      <li>The gel hardens way too fast</li>
      <li>Must work fast as stated in the directions.</li>
      <li>but this was insanely fast</li>
      <li>haha...</li>
      <li>The gel sets up way too fast.</li>
      <li>In the end, I felt really stiffed.</li>
      <li>and my gf was pissed it didnt work hahaha</li>
      <li>highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I got this last night and was excited to use it.</li>
      <li>And with the high price point, I really got the shaft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to do this alone - and i really didn&#x27;t think it would be.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s all vainy and realistic looking.</li>
      <li>I am definitely going to try this again, but only from a different - reliable and honest - seller.</li>
      <li>The step that was missing, in the directions, is sexual intercourse with your partner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had any problems maintaining erections, and masturbation is one thing, but maintaining an erection while masturbating and measuring stuff, and getting the right temperatures and reading directions and setting things up in your bathroom is actually kind of difficult.</li>
      <li>I was trying to do this by myself as a gift for my significant other</li>
      <li>It was a huge mess.</li>
      <li>The directions clearly stated that the molding mixture should be stirred for 60 seconds and would remain the texture of pancake batter...</li>
      <li>complete</li>
      <li>I was actually surprised at the quality.</li>
      <li>set up instantly, it does say sets up fast</li>
      <li>As others stated, watch the YouTube vid because it&#x27;s really helpful to see the entire process.</li>
      <li>model goo is a bit porous and probably won&#x27;t last a super long time,  </li>
      <li>Only other piece of advice is that the points of the cardboard, that you use to secure the vibrator from falling into the mold, should face up toward the cap of the vibrator.</li>
      <li>The body part came out easily after it was set with only a little manipulation.</li>
      <li>instructions are simple and very clear and if you follow them it will turn out fantastically like ours did!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you to do the same.</li>
      <li>I are in a long distance relationship right now, and she actually bought this for me as a gift</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not very messy</li>
      <li>I used 2 sets of the latex completely and I&#x27;m barely 9&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>kind of how it felt the night my willy cloning device failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Try following detailed instructions and staying hard at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I read several reviews both good and bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i dont understand how this works out...not complaining about the sender but the product is weird</li>
    <li> Good product. I really enjoyed the fast paced process. It was funny. But I had great results. Way to go!!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Jk, but seriously it did fail, and it&#x27;s not coz i have a strangely shaped &#x27;willy&#x27; or something. I even shaved the entire region prior to the attempt in order to make it easier to navigate the terrain. As soon as i entered the mould the mould came out of the container, making some air pockets and the thing just didn&#x27;t set right at all. Ended up with something that looked more like scrambled eggs than a &#x27;willy.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was upset because I had been so thorough in preparation and had read the instructions a billion times, and gotten advice from customers on blogs and stuff, so i contacted the empire labs people and they were really cool. They sent me some more powder and a thermometer, saying that the thermometer must have been faulty and that&#x27;s why the mould didn&#x27;t set right. However, I still haven&#x27;t tried it again...I&#x27;m scared i will fail ...it was kind of depressing when it failed. Haha, I know this sounds ridiculous, but it felt kind of like not being able to have an erection for my gf - and now she&#x27;s all like \\&quot;you can&#x27;t perform as a man!\\&quot; Of course, that&#x27;s absurd, and she really doesn&#x27;t care and has other vibrators, but anyways, I guess that&#x27;s kind of how it felt the night my willy cloning device failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gf an I are in a long distance relationship right now, and she actually bought this for me as a gift and I feel like I wasted her gift, or was unable to give her a gift back. It&#x27;s kind of hard to do this alone - and i really didn&#x27;t think it would be. I&#x27;ve never had any problems maintaining erections, and masturbation is one thing, but maintaining an erection while masturbating and measuring stuff, and getting the right temperatures and reading directions and setting things up in your bathroom is actually kind of difficult. I have a short attention span, I suck at multi-tasking, and measuring cups are not sexy. I hate to disappoint her, but I think I&#x27;m going to wait til next time I see her so she can help me out...also then if it fails, she&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s actually pretty difficult and not just think I was a slacker that didn&#x27;t read the directions or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because I love the idea, and I know it must work for some people but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Also the Empire Lab people were really friendly and promptly answered my emails and offered to send more powder. Otherwise I would have given it 1 star.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It was a mess that didn&#x27;t work well for me, I got something that turned out like a freaky incredible hulk willy. I just didn&#x27;t get the mold set well and it went all bad from that point. This item is messy but I do believe it would of worked well had i been more properly prepared to do it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been asking for one of these for a long time and my husband finally bought me one :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are simple and very clear and if you follow them it will turn out fantastically like ours did! I was actually surprised at the quality. Makes a very nice clone :) I do suggest you use the vibrator even if you don&#x27;t plan to use it as it adds extra stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very messy but we did it over bathtub just in case. Be sure to wash anything you plan on salvaging immediately, this stuff bonds to everything…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend! Very easy, super fun date night :D</li>
    <li> Just wrecked my second one.  Third times a charm?  Try following detailed instructions and staying hard at the same time.  Easier said then done</li>
    <li> set up instantly, it does say sets up fast but this was insanely fast</li>
    <li> My fiance and I got this thinking it might be fun. We got it pretty quickly from the sender, but the product wasn&#x27;t worth what we paid for it. The directions clearly stated that the molding mixture should be stirred for 60 seconds and would remain the texture of pancake batter...however, I followed directions exactly and before I could even begin stirring, it was hardened too much. He couldn&#x27;t even get it in the molding mixture! It was a huge mess. May give it another try as the one I got could have been faulty, but I&#x27;m not happy about the wasted money!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all powder dryer up before the 2min limit and couldn&#x27;t use to form.. DONT BUY!!! Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> u better work fast...and u better work hard lol .....piece of crap dried up too quickly and i had to buy another mold powder...the stuff is messy...great concept though...got the other mold powder, but me and my gf havent gotten around to trying it out again...the mold shouldnt settle as quick as it does...or at least give enough powder for two tries, cuz its hard to get this crap down in 1 shot....i read the reviews and thought &amp;#34;nah i can get this done, i already read how others were messing up&amp;#34;....nope...not the case haha...and my gf was pissed it didnt work hahaha</li>
    <li> Totally awesome product. Although it takes a lot of coordination and mind control to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to stay hard while making this... And you only get a 90sec or so window before the mold hardens.  You&#x27;re gonna need a &#x27;fluffer&#x27; to help you with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once complete it&#x27;s all vainy and realistic looking. My wife loves it!!!</li>
    <li> I should caution you that if you&#x27;re a big guy,  they don&#x27;t include enough of the goo to replicate larger parts.  The shell is adequate and of course the goo that makes the mold is sufficient,  but the amount of clone-making goo isn&#x27;t enough and you end up being unable to fill your mold all the way to the top,  which results in a shorter final product than the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model goo is a bit porous and probably won&#x27;t last a super long time,  but that&#x27;s OK.. 95% of the fun you&#x27;ll ever have with this is the making.</li>
    <li> I bet the product would be great - if I was able to finish the &amp;#34;project&amp;#34;. I bought the Novice kit for the extra molding powder but the seller &#x27;Dear Lady&#x27; failed to send the extra molding as advertised. I am definitely going to try this again, but only from a different - reliable and honest - seller. I highly recommend you to do the same.</li>
    <li> Great product for couple bonding, making it is half the fun! Have to plan ahead and move fast though, sets quick.</li>
    <li> SHE TELLS ME SHE USES IT EVERY NIGHT, SOMETIMES MORE THAN ONCE A DAY WHEN IM OUT OF TOWN--IM SO HAPPY SHE IS FULLY SATIFIED</li>
    <li> Time is key. Must work fast as stated in the directions.</li>
    <li> Very easy to make if you follow the instructions and have everything prepared before you start making everything. :) Can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> I got this last night and was excited to use it. I read all of the reviews and I was so nervous I was going to mess it up. I watched the video on cloneawilly.com about 5 times. I prepared ahead of time and had the faucet going steady at 98 degrees, I opened the molding powder and had it right beside my bowl with measuring cups. It was really simple!! The only thing bad I can say is my boyfriends pubic hair got a little caught around the edges but it didn&#x27;t hurt him to take it off. I didn&#x27;t wait 24 hours for it to harden, I would say maybe 10 hours. I went to sleep and woke up and it was firmed. I carefully unpeeled it and ITS AMAZING!!! It looks just like it!!! :))) I&#x27;m so happy with this Product I would recommend this for anyone interested. My boyfriend thought this was way cool!</li>
    <li> The gel hardens way too fast</li>
    <li> OK so I bought this as a joke for my husband for his birthday &amp; we were beyond amazed by the product. As others stated, watch the YouTube vid because it&#x27;s really helpful to see the entire process. Be sure to have everything laid out ahead of time because things do go fast. When they say the molding resin sets up in two minutes they mean it! I was initially worried that the mold mix would pour out onto the floor when we went to use it but it&#x27;s jelly like so it stays in the tube perfectly. Do this on tile or an easy to clean up surface as some of the molding material will spill out but that&#x27;s OK you can pull the extra off the top of the mold once you push it all the way to the body. Part of the body part we were molding ended up touching the side of the tube but it worked out just fine. I think if we had tried to reposion things the mold would have been ruined...it sets up FAST! The body part came out easily after it was set with only a little manipulation. We waited two hours &amp; mixed the skin stuff &amp; poured it in. We got the vibrating model so word to the wise, allow ample room at the top for displacement with the vibrator. Ours overflowed but in the end it didn&#x27;t affect the final product. Only other piece of advice is that the points of the cardboard, that you use to secure the vibrator from falling into the mold, should face up toward the cap of the vibrator. Ours ended up getting stuck in the mold so we had to cut them off with an exacto knife. This is a really fun couples activity. We laughed so much &amp; had the best time making this. It&#x27;s a cheap date night activity!!!</li>
    <li> This item wasn&#x27;t so much a failure, it&#x27;s that there is only one use out of it. If your gentleman is not ready within the two minute window, you just threw your money in the garbage. This is a frustrating over sight and I wish they would include an extra package of the mold making mixture or have suggested doing a couple dry runs before hand.</li>
    <li> Not only did I order 2 and only receive 1 but the one they did send me didn&#x27;t work worth a crap. I would not recommend this product to anyone that works for their money. Unless of course you just like to throw your money away!!</li>
    <li> The gel sets up way too fast. I was trying to do this by myself as a gift for my significant other but i think this is definitely a partner activity.</li>
    <li> The mixture drys TOO QUICKLY!</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions and it turns out fine. Also, now I can DP my girlfriend by myself... Who wouldn&#x27;t wanna do that?</li>
    <li> This product is a terrible waste of time.</li>
    <li> The mold didn&#x27;t work should come with two mold powder packets if it is this hard to do correctly the first time.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews both good and bad. I followed directions precisely, and it worked great. I also did it by myself! read some erotic stories and watched adult movies while I prepared the mix. I didn&#x27;t have any issues. I did however have to use an extra set of the latex mix. The one provided is only good for about 6 inches. I used 2 sets of the latex completely and I&#x27;m barely 9&amp;#34;. contact the company for extras. The finished product was PERFECT!  No trimming needed.</li>
    <li> Bought this and let me just say that it works awesome if you have someone with you or can multi task unfortunately I can not and had to buy more stuff from the actual website but on the plus side they sell each part separately in case you mess up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B+  -  Rating. Should be more user friendly.</li>
    <li> I found the Clone-A-Willy cloning process rather hard. It was difficult to mix the ingredients while sustaining a cock hard erection. The step that was missing, in the directions, is sexual intercourse with your partner. I inserted that step on my own. Due to my extreme left hook, I was left with a rather questionable replica. In the end, I felt really stiffed. And with the high price point, I really got the shaft.</li>
