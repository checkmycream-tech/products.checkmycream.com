      <li>I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!  </li>
      <li>and I must say that it smells amazing!  </li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>My hair has been getting a bit thinner because of a med, but this bar made my scalp feel wonderful and my hair felt sqeaky clean.</li>
      <li>Cinnamon is one of my favorite scents, and this shampoo delivers!</li>
      <li>I love how shiny it leaves my hair!</li>
      <li>My husband´s favorite!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>They smell amazing as a duet when not in use.</li>
      <li>It smells nice</li>
      <li>being said, this shampoo is bar is really nice.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>My hair felt squeeky clean and had a great shine.</li>
      <li>&#x27;New&#x27; sounded like the perfect solution for my woes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent was a very strong, distinctive cinnamon, which is probably not for everyone.  </li>
      <li>Really good for your hair and leaves a light cinnamon smell.</li>
      <li>Works easily if kept in its own uncovered soap dish.  </li>
      <li>I simply love it.</li>
      <li>I love that about it as well.</li>
      <li>I just tried it out today, and specifically made sure that I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair for a couple days to see</li>
      <li>I think this would be wonderful for a guest bathroom or gift but not for daily use!</li>
      <li>Seanik is my FAVORITE.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love it for travel.</li>
      <li>I am impressed that you only have to swipe it thru your hair 3 or 4 times and you get a ton of suds from it.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love cinnamon and the smell stays with you for quite awhile.  </li>
      <li>can happen if your scalp is more \\&quot;senstive\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I like minty cinnamon-y scents, and this is definitely fitting the bill there.  </li>
      <li>It smells awfully strong when it is in its solid form, but leaves the hair smelling wonderfully!</li>
      <li>Granted, my hair is VERY light; I imagine that it picks up color easily.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of it, and it&#x27;s fantastic for travel - not a liquid, so not something you need to stash in that quart bag.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really unusual, but really exceptional scent for a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>so I was able to really clean my hair.</li>
      <li>but as a light to medium-light foam that spreads over the hair easily.  </li>
      <li>and it worked fine.</li>
      <li>However, it has helped it grow longer more quickly.</li>
      <li>This solid shampoo is great for travel.  </li>
      <li>However, I just used a light conditioner on my scalp to combat the dryness</li>
      <li>Not noticing significant benefits, but no negatives either.  </li>
      <li>Sure, it smells great, lasts a long while, looks pretty</li>
      <li>Your hair feels squeeky clean afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing shampoo but do yourself a favor and go to a Lush shop or order online.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, it makes my hair very shiny.</li>
      <li>It has a strong smell when first brought into the bathroom</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of the scent in candles or other room enhancing products, but on the hair it smells great and  doesnt come off like a food scent.  </li>
      <li>Lush!! :)</li>
      <li>Happily turning into a potential Lush junkie !  </li>
      <li>Although I do not use everyday, I find its does a great job cleaning but does take out any and all oil build up, so I use 2 times a week.</li>
      <li>The smell is fresh.</li>
      <li>It was different, but I liked it.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll get $9 worth of shampoo.</li>
      <li>The initial scent is very strong but wears off in a day or two, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like that when you&#x27;ve used it - just when the bar is first set out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s best about Lush&#x27;s shampoo bars.  </li>
      <li>I love my hair long but felt I needed to get rid of some of the damaged ends and get it back to a healthy state!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Problem? I won&#x27;t get the chance to find out if this really stimulates the scalp or not because after 2 washes, my hair literally turned BRIGHT PINK.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used several LUSH shampoo bars and have loved them.</li>
      <li>, first off, DO NOT pay 20 dollars + 5 dollars shipping for this product.</li>
      <li>First off:&lt;br</li>
      <li>I pair this with a conditioner to ensure my hair is soft and tangle free.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea of solid shampoo</li>
      <li>So having to use a heavy conditioner on my ends was a fair trade for quicker growth.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t consider my scalp to be sensitive, but I do live in the desert, so that doesn&#x27;t help, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>My title pretty much says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I love this particular solid shampoo.</li>
      <li>I was about to make my own cinnamon-oil shampoo when I stumbled upon Lush&#x27;s NEW solid shampoo.</li>
      <li>Was impressed enough to turn around &amp; order the Trichomania shampoo bar &amp; another massage bar tin to store it in less than a week after I purchased the solid shampoo bar.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this solid shampoo gave it maximum volume.</li>
      <li>is much easier to use than one would consider a shampoo bar to use, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>but I have noticed that I do not seem to have as much hair in my brush</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my hair thickening up yet</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>, it lathers very well.  </li>
      <li>This was my first Lush product purchase &amp; my first shampoo bar.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s baffling is the fact that other shampoo bars are colored (bright blue, for example) and have not tainted my color.</li>
      <li>Traveled to New Orleans last month with this in the massage tin &amp; it packed well &amp; was easy to use.</li>
      <li>It was interesting because it lasted a decent amount of time, but it really bled and made a line of reddish soap down the length of my shower.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the first products that I bought from Lush.  </li>
      <li>I was intrigued by the concept of using a shampoo bar plus as I have gotten older</li>
      <li>When I used the solidified cream it didn&#x27;t go into the skin quickly at all, still left my hands feeling they needed some moisturiser.</li>
      <li>I wanted something simple to have in the car that was quick absorbent, I got told in the shop it was.</li>
      <li>Very economical because a little goes a long way &amp; produces a satisfying amount of lather.</li>
      <li>I refuse to pay highly inflated prices from greedy middlemen.</li>
      <li>, in turn, I had high hopes for \\&quot;New.\\</li>
      <li>Highly recommended (but at a lower price than this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re ridiculously economical and they last forever.  </li>
      <li>lastly, now that my hair is dry, there is more body and the hair is soft.  </li>
      <li>You can get this much cheaper direct from LUSH, either online or in-store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is none of the usual static from going without conditioning.  </li>
      <li>It cleans my hair well, but does make it slightly more tangled than usual.</li>
      <li>Lush&#x27;s New shampoo bar sports a spciy,</li>
      <li>It is available directly from the manufacturer for less than twelve dollars plus six dollars shipping.</li>
      <li>so LUSH&#x27;s</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I decided to try this one, no particular reason on why this one and not any of the others.  I just tried it out today, and specifically made sure that I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair for a couple days to see just how well it cleaned my somewhat oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;First...the scent is to die for.  I like minty cinnamon-y scents, and this is definitely fitting the bill there.  But it&#x27;s not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Next, it lathers very well.  Not to excess (which I hate...why would I want to have 3 inches of bubbles on my head???) but as a light to medium-light foam that spreads over the hair easily.  And the lather cleans the hair so well, without stripping the hair.  I usually am one who uses conditioner because I don&#x27;t have a choice.  The usual shampoo strips my hair to the point it feels horrible.  My hair, with this product, feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, now that my hair is dry, there is more body and the hair is soft.  There is none of the usual static from going without conditioning.  I am definitely using this again.</li>
    <li> I was about to make my own cinnamon-oil shampoo when I stumbled upon Lush&#x27;s NEW solid shampoo. Great on the environment, lasts for ages, and smells HEAVENLY. Cinnamon is one of my favorite scents, and this shampoo delivers! I have thick and coarse dark hair, and this shampoo lathers easily so I was able to really clean my hair. It does not dry out the hair, unless if it is processed. Used in conjunction with the Coolaulin conditioner, my hair was not frizzy nor was it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shampoo for any hair type as long as it is used with a conditioner applicable to your hair type/condition. Also, it DOES make your hair grow faster! Within a month my hair had grown an inch and a half (an inch is normal for me). Thanks Lush!! :)</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar smells like cinnamon red hots.  It lathers well &amp; cleansed my naturally wavy, thick hair without over-drying.   This was my first Lush product purchase &amp; my first shampoo bar.  I&#x27;ve been very impressed.  After reading the reviews of the shampoo tin, I purchased the massage bar tin to store this shampoo in. (That was a winner also.)  Was impressed enough to turn around &amp; order the Trichomania shampoo bar &amp; another massage bar tin to store it in less than a week after I purchased the solid shampoo bar.  Happily turning into a potential Lush junkie !  Usually run the shampoo bar over my wet hair once &amp; then use the bar to lather up my hands &amp; then run my lathered hands through my hair.  Very economical because a little goes a long way &amp; produces a satisfying amount of lather. Traveled to New Orleans last month with this in the massage tin &amp; it packed well &amp; was easy to use.</li>
    <li> NOT ALL NATURAL/ECO-FRIENDLY-CHECK THE WEBSITE DIRECTLY UNDER INGREDIENTS like Ethylamine Oxide that they actually list as &amp;#34;ok,&amp;#34; but a simple check on the internet will tell you how just how unnatural and toxic it is. WTF?!  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I was tired of the leaking liquid bottle in my travel kit so I tried this. Works really well even in hard water. Just a tiny bit will go a long way, one bar should last for weeks if used right.</li>
    <li> The name says it all.... I love it for travel. I have the tin that goes with it of course.</li>
    <li> Really good for your hair and leaves a light cinnamon smell. Although, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from here, I would just buy it from the actual website. It&#x27;s over ten dollars cheaper. The only reason I could seen in anyone wanting to pay this price for it is because amazon ships faster than lush. Or at least I would assume</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it makes my hair very shiny. From now I am going to use just this shampoo. I recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> This is one of the first products that I bought from Lush.  I was intrigued by the concept of using a shampoo bar plus as I have gotten older I have noticed my hair is getting thinner.  I recently cut my hair because it just did not seem very thick.  I love my hair long but felt I needed to get rid of some of the damaged ends and get it back to a healthy state!  I intend to grow it back out and I hope this shampoo bar helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this just a few times so far so I can not attest to whether or not it will help with hair grow but I have noticed that I do not seem to have as much hair in my brush and I must say that it smells amazing!  I absolutely love cinnamon and the smell stays with you for quite awhile.  I am impressed that you only have to swipe it thru your hair 3 or 4 times and you get a ton of suds from it.  Your hair feels squeeky clean afterwards.  I pair this with a conditioner to ensure my hair is soft and tangle free.  I do suggest keeping this dry and in a tin or some other container to ensure that it lasts longer.  So far, you cant even tell I have used the bar.  I believe the bar will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This solid shampoo is great for travel.  It is available directly from the manufacturer for less than twelve dollars plus six dollars shipping. I refuse to pay highly inflated prices from greedy middlemen.</li>
    <li> This smells like cinnamon to the extreme. I am not a fan of the scent in candles or other room enhancing products, but on the hair it smells great and  doesnt come off like a food scent.  **I also recommend placing this shampoo next to a spot of Lush Porridge soap. They smell amazing as a duet when not in use. -odd, yes i know.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this solid shampoo gave it maximum volume. My hair felt squeeky clean and had a great shine. Although I do not use everyday, I find its does a great job cleaning but does take out any and all oil build up, so I use 2 times a week. Defiantly can&#x27;t wait to try other solids !</li>
    <li> I love the idea of solid shampoo but this one failed to perform as I wanted it to. Sure, it smells great, lasts a long while, looks pretty but it was too drying and it definitely did not spur any hair growth. I think this would be wonderful for a guest bathroom or gift but not for daily use!</li>
    <li> This Solid Shampoo smells like the spray used to kill insects. In my humble opinion, the smell is so disgusting that I wanted to return it, but couldn&#x27;t because evidently, this is &amp;#34;blocked&amp;#34; for returns. The smell of cinnamon that was suppose to have, does not exist. Extremely expansive for something I will have to trash.</li>
    <li> Does not last as long as claimed  and crumbles after some use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive and not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over priced</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!  Rub between your hands, lathers well. Hair feels wonderful afterwards.</li>
    <li> Have been using this since I received it. It smells nice but you have to like the smell of cinnamon and cloves.  At least I smell a touch of cloves in it. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my hair thickening up yet but I may need to be using it longer so I will continue to use it up and see if I notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Not noticing significant benefits, but no negatives either.  It does seem to last a very long time.  And I like the scent.</li>
    <li> Works easily if kept in its own uncovered soap dish.  I appreciate the natural ingredients.  It leaves my hair clean, light and shiny, though so do other shampoos that aren&#x27;t so expensive.  Does it stimulate hair follicles to promote hair growth?  I can&#x27;t tell yet.</li>
    <li> Threw it away after 2 shampoos. It made my scalp itch so bad that I was afraid I&#x27;d end up scratching off the skin on my head.</li>
    <li> My title pretty much says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, first off, DO NOT pay 20 dollars + 5 dollars shipping for this product. That&#x27;s just insanity. Via the LUSH website, you can buy this item for half&lt;br /&gt;the price. LUSH also sometimes offers shipping deals when you purchase a bulk of items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to the actual product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several LUSH shampoo bars and have loved them. Seanik is my FAVORITE. It smells great, gives a lot of volume, is much easier to use than one would consider a shampoo bar to use, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, in turn, I had high hopes for \\&quot;New.\\&quot; My hair is naturally fine, but I think I am experiencing some thinning (I&#x27;m female) due to hormonal issues. I prefer \\&quot;natural\\&quot; treatments to chemicals such as Nioxin, so LUSH&#x27;s &#x27;New&#x27; sounded like the perfect solution for my woes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem? I won&#x27;t get the chance to find out if this really stimulates the scalp or not because after 2 washes, my hair literally turned BRIGHT PINK. Granted, my hair is VERY light; I imagine that it picks up color easily. What&#x27;s baffling is the fact that other shampoo bars are colored (bright blue, for example) and have not tainted my color. The only thing I can think of is the cinnamon stick attached to the bar itself? Maybe this is not the dye on the shampoo, but rather the dye in the cinnamon stick? I&#x27;ve used such sticks as natural dyes before, so it makes sense to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costumers with dark hair will likely have no--or fewer--issues with the dye. My (very dark haired) husband has been using it (he stopped me from throwing it in the garbage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUSH should, imo, warn costumers about the safety of using this product on color treated hair.USH site. Don&#x27;t overpay if you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> good! it really can make the drop hair less</li>
    <li> First off:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price they are charging is way overpriced. You can go to your Lush store or order from Lush online and get this for about $9. The seller on amazon is charging about twice that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this shampoo is bar is really nice. It has a strong smell when first brought into the bathroom but it dies down in a few days. It smells like cinnamon with a hint of clove. The smell does not linger in my hair, however, which I greatly appreciate. It cleans my hair well, but does make it slightly more tangled than usual. However, it has helped it grow longer more quickly. So having to use a heavy conditioner on my ends was a fair trade for quicker growth. The growth is not really noticeable unless you&#x27;re keeping close track, however, so don&#x27;t buy this expecting miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry out my scalp, which thEy told me at the Lush store can happen if your scalp is more \\&quot;senstive\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t consider my scalp to be sensitive, but I do live in the desert, so that doesn&#x27;t help, I&#x27;m sure. However, I just used a light conditioner on my scalp to combat the dryness and it worked fine. I will keep buying this, but not on amazon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get for basically $20 plus what basically $5 for shipping come on too much money when you can just go to the lush site and get it for half the price</li>
    <li> i am not sure why this price is more than double the price that Lush charges on their website. Sounds like Amazon is trying to rip some people off. Awesome product though!! Love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s best about Lush&#x27;s shampoo bars.  They smell beautiful.  They&#x27;re ridiculously economical and they last forever.  Really, this is one Lush product where I think you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Lush&#x27;s New shampoo bar sports a spciy, warming scent- think cinnamon and complementary spices.  It&#x27;s a really unusual, but really exceptional scent for a shampoo.  The little puck fits in the palm of your hand, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  These shampoo bars last just about forever.  So, don&#x27;t be scared of the $9 price tag- you&#x27;ll get $9 worth of shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing shampoo but do yourself a favor and go to a Lush shop or order online. You&#x27;ll save yourself about $8</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  My recipient loves it!</li>
    <li> My hair has been getting a bit thinner because of a med, but this bar made my scalp feel wonderful and my hair felt sqeaky clean. I simply love it. The smell is fresh. I love that about it as well.</li>
    <li> My husband´s favorite!</li>
    <li> The Price for this is insanity. At lush I bought mine for $11.50 + tax. It smells awfully strong when it is in its solid form, but leaves the hair smelling wonderfully! I love how shiny it leaves my hair! Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> It was far too greasy for me. I wanted something simple to have in the car that was quick absorbent, I got told in the shop it was. Its not. It has a nice smell. When I used the solidified cream it didn&#x27;t go into the skin quickly at all, still left my hands feeling they needed some moisturiser. Not impressed at all.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, but I defo will never purchase this again.</li>
    <li> It was interesting because it lasted a decent amount of time, but it really bled and made a line of reddish soap down the length of my shower.  The scent was a very strong, distinctive cinnamon, which is probably not for everyone.  It was different, but I liked it.</li>
    <li> You can get this much cheaper direct from LUSH, either online or in-store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I love this particular solid shampoo. I don&#x27;t have a ton of hair, and one bar lasts me close to six months. Yup. Six. Months. I love the feel of it, and it&#x27;s fantastic for travel - not a liquid, so not something you need to stash in that quart bag. I&#x27;ve been using this an a couple other LUSH solid shampoos for years now, and I don&#x27;t ever want to go back to liquids. Highly recommended (but at a lower price than this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has an invigorating feel when used. The initial scent is very strong but wears off in a day or two, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like that when you&#x27;ve used it - just when the bar is first set out.</li>
