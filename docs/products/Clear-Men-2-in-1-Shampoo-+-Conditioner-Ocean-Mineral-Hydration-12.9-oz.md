### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>in all, one of the best combination hair products I&#x27;ve used, and</li>
      <li>All in all a very good product that I</li>
      <li>/&gt;I’m getting very good results with it in terms of dandruff control.</li>
      <li>That being said, this did the best job of any combined shampoo and conditioner that I have ever experienced.</li>
      <li>but my husband does and the shampoo has done great at keeping it under control.</li>
      <li>It cleans great.</li>
      <li>and it smells very nice.</li>
      <li>pleasant fragrance (mild)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>and it does a good job of cleaning and conditioning my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Clear has superior rinse-ability and truly seems to care for one&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>The anti-dandruff element seems to work too, but I still think Head &amp; Shoulders is superior in that department.  </li>
      <li>it smells lovely to boot!</li>
      <li>(And, this Ocean Mineral fragrance is phenomenal!)</li>
      <li>It’s not horrible, but the lathering performance is not as good</li>
      <li>It’s not as good as Suave’s dandruff control shampoos (my favorite brand).</li>
      <li>It also has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>However, when I got a chance to try this 2 in 1 shampoo, I found it to be a nice change.  </li>
      <li>It is creamy and gives a nice lather.  </li>
      <li>His hair looks marvelous - smooth, shiny, and full.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner does a great job of getting my husbands hair clean.</li>
      <li>My husband and myself both tried this shampoo and I have to say that he liked it much more than I did, which might be why it&#x27;s a man&#x27;s forumula.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ocean Mineral scent is nice but not as pleasant as the Citrus Fresh scent.</li>
      <li>my scalp has felt clean and fairly well moisturized.</li>
      <li>I was even more surprised at the very pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>This one has taken me by surprise by turning out to be one of my favorite shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s thicker and lathers more than H&amp;S, and it seems to control his dandruff just as well.</li>
      <li>and I like the smell better than the Axe products I had been using.</li>
      <li>It seems to do a better job</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
      <li>This may be my favorite scent yet.</li>
      <li>Okay (3-stars)</li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both of these have been excellent at controlling my dandruff once it had been aggravated enough from a lack of attention.</li>
      <li>recommend(especially to those that aren&#x27;t as folically challenged, and perhaps even, bizarre as myself)!</li>
      <li>is most products are a trade off</li>
      <li>He loves the scent because it&#x27;s a very clean scent but not overpowering in any way.</li>
      <li>And the scent is phenomenal (and not too strong, either.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and he found it to be effective for chronic dandruff issues.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair clean, light and healthy</li>
      <li>As a shampoo, this CLEAR shampoo seems to work great.  </li>
      <li>Ok so I am surprised an perplexed but happy.  </li>
      <li>This one, &amp;#34;ocean mineral,&amp;#34; is a nice fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell, left the hair in good shape, and took care of the flakes.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner helps keep my hair nice and soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is also nice.</li>
      <li>Not only was his hair similarly clean and shiny, but it smelled incredible.</li>
      <li>They are tremendously convenient in the shower and a slightly better buy.</li>
      <li>This has been doing a really good job of leaving my hair light and soft and not making me feel like I&#x27;ve been doused in perfume.</li>
      <li>great product that I will be buying regularly.</li>
      <li>Importantly for him he felt it washed out</li>
      <li>I found my hair was great even after 2 weeks of daily use...</li>
      <li>We both enjoy the scent of it as well.</li>
      <li>CLEAR does a good job maintaining that balance.</li>
      <li>Great cleaning, excellent smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>It just smells clean and fresh - much more of a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; or earthy scent.</li>
      <li>My husband had already tried the CLEAR Citrus Fresh scent version of this shampoo, and we liked it better than Head &amp; Shoulders, so he decided to try this scent as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just kind of clean and fresh smelling, as are most of the Clear shampoo products I have tried.</li>
      <li>Umm, maybe I better make that more clear.</li>
      <li>My rating for any shampoo includes how clean it leaves my scalp and how it leaves the texture of my hair.</li>
      <li>It smells much better, and more natural, than Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
      <li>Clean and condition hair, while eliminating dandruff.</li>
      <li>I use CLEAR myself and we really love the way it makes our hair feel!</li>
      <li>nice CLEAR product for men.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at how much I liked the scent of this dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to be just okay, but it&#x27;s turned out to be something I really like.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how effective this product is.</li>
      <li>Full on flake fest.  </li>
      <li>Not only do they leave my hair and scalp clean and refreshed, but they are gentle and consistently make my hair gorgeous and shiny!</li>
      <li>The scent is mild, but I would prefer none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>He likes the way it smells more than the similar brand Suave makes, which used to be his favorite.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no unpleasant &amp;#34;mediciny&amp;#34; smell or anything like that either.  </li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s hair smells good all day long, which it didn&#x27;t with H&amp;S.</li>
      <li>It certainly provides a adequate amount of moisture, but it probably won&#x27;t win anyone over that&#x27;s looking specifically to combat dry scalp issues.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Foremost, I love Clear products!</li>
      <li>I typically prefer shampoo + condition combos to save money, which is especially easy to do with this bottle because it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, the effectiveness and scent makes this well worth considering.</li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy this on my own.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(I tried two versions of this shampoo - this Ocean Mineral and Citrus Fresh.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fine, but I just find that it works better to shampoo first, then condition second with a separate product.</li>
      <li>and it certainly got our hair clean.</li>
      <li>They seem to do an identical job washing my hair, leaving it soft and clean feeling...much better than the $1.99 Suave shampoo/car wash/herbicide/flea dip that I normally use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I love the actual shampoo..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been a Head and Shoulders or generic brand user and have been satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a higher grade shampoo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other kinds of shampoo from this company and they are really nice products.</li>
      <li>His thick hair was so soft, so manageable and ridiculously gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Upside down is nice when you&#x27;re coming to the end of the bottle to get everything out</li>
      <li>with any medication, I am loth to extrapolate their effectiveness from just my single experience, and judging by the plethora of 5-stars that this product has garnered, others seem to have had much better experiences.</li>
      <li>I thought the shampoo did not provide enough conditioning for long hair, but my husband thought it was awesome: left his hair feeling soft but not greasy.  </li>
      <li>because it did work reasonably as a shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyway, my wife likes it as much as any dandruff-treating shampoo, like Head and Shoulders for instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>both thought that it suds up very well</li>
      <li>My husband absolutely loves this shampoo/ conditioner combo.</li>
      <li>#34;Ocean Mineral&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the shampoo + conditioner works very well.</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced and comes in a variety of scents.  </li>
      <li>I know extensive research has been conducted to back up the shampoo makers&#x27; claims that cleansing and conditioning agents can effective be combined in one product.</li>
      <li>I have used a lot of different shampoos and although the smell could be a bit more masculine, it does work</li>
      <li>like the large, flat top that makes it easy to stand it upside down, which in turn makes it easier to squeeze the lotion out.</li>
      <li>I never had much trouble that particular issue, but my wife kind of does</li>
      <li>Manly fragrance, clean and fresh smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Little goes a long way, lathers up nicely even in our really hard water.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best of any brand I&#x27;ve tried over the past few years, so</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband had already tried the CLEAR Citrus Fresh scent version of this shampoo, and we liked it better than Head &amp; Shoulders, so he decided to try this scent as well. He uses dandruff shampoo with conditioner to control flakes that occur because of a dry scalp, and H&amp;S shampoo with conditioner has served well to control his dandruff ever since he started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clear shampoo compares favorably to H&amp;S: it&#x27;s thicker and lathers more than H&amp;S, and it seems to control his dandruff just as well. His hair feels clean and soft, though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s any different than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ocean Mineral scent is nice but not as pleasant as the Citrus Fresh scent. Neither is overpowering like the perfumes in some shampoos, so if you like this scent or one of the others that are offered, you won&#x27;t have to worry about the scent of your hair announcing your entrance to a room or triggering an asthma attack for your sensitive spouse (aka me)! It smells much better, and more natural, than Head &amp; Shoulders. My husband&#x27;s hair smells good all day long, which it didn&#x27;t with H&amp;S. I am fussier about the smell of his shampoos and deodorants than he is, so he has me pick them out for him! This one gets a thumbs up from both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recommend this shampoo and he will likely stick with it over H&amp;S, even though it&#x27;s slightly more expensive. The only problem is that it&#x27;s been hard to find them locally so far, so we will end up ordering them here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband and myself both tried this shampoo and I have to say that he liked it much more than I did, which might be why it&#x27;s a man&#x27;s forumula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both thought that it suds up very well and it certainly got our hair clean. The scent evades description, but it wasn&#x27;t anything that lingered or was obnoxious.  I thought the shampoo did not provide enough conditioning for long hair, but my husband thought it was awesome: left his hair feeling soft but not greasy.  Importantly for him he felt it washed out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice CLEAR product for men.  We didn&#x27;t notice any particular scalp effect.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different shampoos and although the smell could be a bit more masculine, it does work great.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes my scalp and hair without greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use two-in-one... One less step in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Scalp is less itchy from dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a neutral fruity with faint musk smell... Could be more masculine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the actual shampoo.. It cleans great. I will try out their other scents!</li>
    <li> I have previously used much stronger formulations including the nuclear strength scalp-searing versions of Nizoral and Head+Shoulders. Both of these have been excellent at controlling my dandruff once it had been aggravated enough from a lack of attention. When I got a chance to try out the CLEAR versions, I decided to take a chance on a brand that I had not tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my experiences were mixed. The packaging was decent, and it arrived safely with a little piece of cellophane tape to prevent spills. Its texture feels vaguely medicinal, but it lathered on strongly, and I did not feel any lingering itchy residue. However, its overall strength left a lot to be desired. It never quite cleared up my dandruff, and after a few tries, I had to retreat to my old standbys - which worked their magic, and cleared things up for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any medication, I am loth to extrapolate their effectiveness from just my single experience, and judging by the plethora of 5-stars that this product has garnered, others seem to have had much better experiences. Unfortunately, for me it rated at-most an It&#x27;s Okay (3-stars) because it did work reasonably as a shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I tried two versions of this shampoo - this Ocean Mineral and Citrus Fresh. Other than fragrance differences, they had identical effects on my scalp.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A_E~</li>
    <li> Manly fragrance, clean and fresh smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Little goes a long way, lathers up nicely even in our really hard water.&lt;br /&gt;Got this for my son, who has chronic dry scalp/dandruff issues and he found it to be effective for chronic dandruff issues.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair clean, light and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product and does what it says.</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this on my own. It definitely beats Head &amp; Shoulders that I&#x27;ve used previously. This stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and seems healthier and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy residue on the bottle. It also has a nice scent. It&#x27;s the best of any brand I&#x27;ve tried over the past few years, so I&#x27;d honesty give it 4.5 stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always a bit tough for married couples to get shampoo at a reasonable price that works well for both men and women. CLEAR does a good job maintaining that balance. The shampoo has a gentle yet pleasing smell (supposedly it&#x27;s supposed smell like the ocean, but it&#x27;s not really clear to me), not so much for men but enough for women. I typically prefer shampoo + condition combos to save money, which is especially easy to do with this bottle because it&#x27;s so reasonably priced. Finally, I like the bottle design. It allows you to leave the bottle upside down so the shampoo drips down towards the nozzle so it&#x27;s easier to actually get shampoo when supply is running low. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this shampoo/ conditioner combo. He has dry skin and from time to time his scalp gets a bit flaky and this really helps to moisturize his scalp. He loves the scent because it&#x27;s a very clean scent but not overpowering in any way. I use CLEAR myself and we really love the way it makes our hair feel!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used other versions of clear anti-dandruff shampoos in the past and all of them work very well.  The Ocean Mineral hydration has a very faint clean smell.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff issues but my husband does and the shampoo has done great at keeping it under control.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo/conditioner because:&lt;br /&gt;1) a small amount is enough to produce enough lather to wash my head&lt;br /&gt;2) pleasant fragrance (mild)&lt;br /&gt;3) my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch any more&lt;br /&gt;4) no need to apply conditioner separately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wished it had a little bit more fragrance, but I like this product anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man who doesn&#x27;t wash his hair nearly enough... now wait, it&#x27;s not what you think! I assure you that I&#x27;m not the guy who just throws all his refuse into an unused back room of his dilapidated home while various mangy animals defecate around my feet(I was a traveling salesman once upon a lifetime-- these types exist), in fact; I&#x27;m quite the opposite. You could even say I&#x27;m a tad OCD. So what&#x27;s with the lack of hair washing then? It&#x27;s simple really, I appear to be slowly losing my hair... and I believe that washing it makes it fall out faster. Theres no scientific facts behind my theory, all there is... is sadness... and thinning... oh so thinning... hair. BUT, if I were a man who, say, washed his hair regularly(I&#x27;ve heard rumblings that these types DO exist as well)I can say with extreme confidence that this would be a very favorable choice. The scant few times that I&#x27;ve used it my scalp has felt clean and fairly well moisturized. Convenient that it&#x27;s both shampoo and conditioner in one(though it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as silky as when using a separate conditioner after shampooing). All in all a very good product that I recommend(especially to those that aren&#x27;t as folically challenged, and perhaps even, bizarre as myself)!</li>
    <li> My son loves this shampoo. He loves the convenience of using a 2in1 product, no fuss and it&#x27;s done. He also loves the scent. He&#x27;s an athlete and it works well for daily use after practice and workouts. Minus 1 star because the anti-dandruff is not as effective as expected, but we&#x27;ll see if it improves over longer use.</li>
    <li> As a shampoo, this CLEAR shampoo seems to work great.  It is creamy and gives a nice lather.  It doesn&#x27;t have a particularly strong scent either positive or negative, but it does the job.  Some dandruff shampoos have a medicinal scent to them, this does not, so that is a victory.  I use Head and Shoulders normally to control my occasional dandruff and since I&#x27;ve switched to this product for the sake of reviewing I have not noticed any difference in my (lack of) dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative about the product however is the rather shoddy construction of the bottle and spout.  After a week of use I noticed that shampoo was leaking out of the cap on the sides of the bottle, something I&#x27;ve never experienced with any other brand.  I haven&#x27;t lost a ton of product but I fine it annoying enough to dock a star for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Head and Shoulders or generic brand user and have been satisfied with it.  However, when I got a chance to try this 2 in 1 shampoo, I found it to be a nice change.  It has a very subtle scent and seems to work well to keep the dandruff down.  It is reasonably priced and comes in a variety of scents.  This one, &amp;#34;ocean mineral,&amp;#34; is a nice fresh scent.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some dandruff shampoos tend to do.  Next time I pick out a shampoo, I&#x27;ll be looking for Clear.</li>
    <li> He likes the way it smells more than the similar brand Suave makes, which used to be his favorite. He also reports it works as advertised and he has not had a problem with dandruff while using it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re as leery as I am about 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners then you&#x27;ll probably avoid this as you would with any similar product. I know extensive research has been conducted to back up the shampoo makers&#x27; claims that cleansing and conditioning agents can effective be combined in one product. That&#x27;s fine, but I just find that it works better to shampoo first, then condition second with a separate product. What do I know? I&#x27;m not a chemist, maybe I&#x27;m just getting ripped off by buying to separate products. It&#x27;s just the way I generally choose to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this CLEAR product, it seems to do everything it&#x27;s supposed to. Clean and condition hair, while eliminating dandruff. I never had much trouble that particular issue, but my wife kind of does and so she was more the test subject for the scalp-health aspect of it. Yes, the bottle proclaims this is for men - but I have yet to see any evidence that this is not equally suited for females. Anyway, my wife likes it as much as any dandruff-treating shampoo, like Head and Shoulders for instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word on the scent: if you like VERY subtly scented shampoos, this is for you. If you like really richly scented shampoos, you might be disappointed by this. It is practically scentless! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there is a bit of an aromatic quality and it is not at all unpleasant. But if you&#x27;re used to fruit, coconut, floral, or some other type of smell - you won&#x27;t get it with this &amp;#34;Ocean Minerals&amp;#34; formula!</li>
    <li> This 2 in 1 dandruff control leaves my hair soft and moisturized. It is not as harsh as Head &amp; Shoulders and smells much better. It&#x27;s hard to describe the ocean mineral scent. It&#x27;s just kind of clean and fresh smelling, as are most of the Clear shampoo products I have tried. This may be my favorite scent yet.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how effective this product is. I was even more surprised at the very pleasant scent. Too often, shampoos go overboard, in this case they got it just right. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this on myself, but my teenage son was having some scalp issues and he gave it a try.  Nice smell, left the hair in good shape, and took care of the flakes.  Nothing to complain about!</li>
    <li> While I actually like the way my hair looks after using this shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my scalp as far as dryness.  Having used tea tree based shampoos in the past, this one seems underwhelming in comparison.  There&#x27;s no tingle sensation, and I find myself itching my scalp only marginally less than other non-scalp shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That of course is not to say that this shampoo fails miserably.  It certainly provides a adequate amount of moisture, but it probably won&#x27;t win anyone over that&#x27;s looking specifically to combat dry scalp issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy or poofy.  There&#x27;s no unpleasant &amp;#34;mediciny&amp;#34; smell or anything like that either.  I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to recommend it, but it is a decent option.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner does a great job of getting my husbands hair clean. He tends to have a lot of product build up and this 2 in 1 product thoroughly cleans and conditions his hair. We both enjoy the scent of it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of 2-in-1 options because they usually don&#x27;t condition your hair much at all, and, quite obviously, don&#x27;t live up to separate conditioning. That being said, this did the best job of any combined shampoo and conditioner that I have ever experienced. My rating for any shampoo includes how clean it leaves my scalp and how it leaves the texture of my hair. It did well on that front. I also find that some shampoo leaves my head itchy the next day, but this did not (maybe the anti-dandruff elements). I rater conditioner on ease of combing out, body enhancement/retention, shine, and texture. This scored about 80% as well as a separate conditioner on everything except ease of comb-out. I&#x27;d say that it did about 60% as well on that front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, one of the best combination hair products I&#x27;ve used, and it smells lovely to boot! Usually, men&#x27;s shampoo has a strong &amp;#34;Irish Spring&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;Men&#x27;s deodorant&amp;#34; smell. This does not. It just smells clean and fresh - much more of a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; or earthy scent. It is a little expensive at current prices ($6.69), but since you save the cost of separate conditioner and it&#x27;s a higher grade shampoo, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Foremost, I love Clear products! Not only do they leave my hair and scalp clean and refreshed, but they are gentle and consistently make my hair gorgeous and shiny! When I saw this version for men, I grabbed it for my boyfriend and put it to the test. Not only was his hair similarly clean and shiny, but it smelled incredible. Moreover, the hydrating feature was immediately noticeable. His thick hair was so soft, so manageable and ridiculously gorgeous! (And, this Ocean Mineral fragrance is phenomenal!) Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear has superior rinse-ability and truly seems to care for one&#x27;s hair. I cannot recommend these products highly enough. Whenever possible, buy the oversized pump version. They are tremendously convenient in the shower and a slightly better buy.</li>
    <li> This is hair care cream that promises shampoo/conditioner/anti-dandruff/moisturizer, so I think we can call it an all-in-one hair cleaning product.  If that&#x27;s what you want, this reasonably-priced product can be recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to hydrate the scalp somewhat.  The anti-dandruff element seems to work too, but I still think Head &amp; Shoulders is superior in that department.  The scent is mild, but I would prefer none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the large, flat top that makes it easy to stand it upside down, which in turn makes it easier to squeeze the lotion out.</li>
    <li> Umm, maybe I better make that more clear. My husband adores this shampoo! It&#x27;s the first time he&#x27;s tried Clear combo shampoo and conditioner, or in fact, a poo/cond combo at all. His hair looks marvelous - smooth, shiny, and full. And the scent is phenomenal (and not too strong, either.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear&#x27;s definitely made a convert!</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance of this and it does a good job of cleaning and conditioning my hair. It seems to do a better job and I like the smell better than the Axe products I had been using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other kinds of shampoo from this company and they are really nice products. Great cleaning, excellent smell and a little goes a long way. I love trying the different varieties and haven&#x27;t had a bad one yet.</li>
    <li> This one has taken me by surprise by turning out to be one of my favorite shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. I switch around pretty regularly because I get bored of the same scents and styles easily, and sometimes I like to use products intended for men when I want a milder scent or something that&#x27;s not too flowery. This has been doing a really good job of leaving my hair light and soft and not making me feel like I&#x27;ve been doused in perfume. I was expecting it to be just okay, but it&#x27;s turned out to be something I really like.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how much I liked the scent of this dandruff shampoo. Normally medicated shampoos smell, well, medicated. This does not – very clean scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m getting very good results with it in terms of dandruff control. The added conditioner helps as well without leaving a greasy feeling behind as other conditioners can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only strike against it is lathering ability. It’s not as good as Suave’s dandruff control shampoos (my favorite brand). It’s not horrible, but the lathering performance is not as good as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the effectiveness and scent makes this well worth considering.</li>
    <li> So I have horrible winter dandruff, every year since I was a kid.  Full on flake fest.  Hate it but its true.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I have tried many many products over the years and am always willing to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;Truth is most products are a trade off, usually the tea-tree shampoos work by simply making my flakes smaller so they are still there but not as noticeable. The Head and shoulders type products all use the same  Pyrithione zinc (1%)  as an active ingredient, and you will find it here to. And the Nuke-em product of the dandruff world TAR. (yep I said it tar.) which works in extreme cases but smells like ...well tar..and leaves you with no flakes but hair that hates you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular everyday products seem to help but do note eliminate my dandruff, and worst off they seem to leave my hair scorched and dried out over time (anything more than a week.) I find myself alternating between a dandruff shampoo and a regular shampoo in an effort to have normal looking hair without the dandruff. It works maybe 6 months out of the year...then the cold season sets in and forget it...flake city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time it was different. This shampoo works on all fronts.  I found my hair was great even after 2 weeks of daily use...no need to switch back and forth to avoid dried out look, and the flakes were gone....like totally gone.  Ok so I am surprised an perplexed but happy.  It has the same active ingredient to start with but whatever comes next seems to work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product that I will be buying regularly.</li>
    <li> About a year ago I switched from Head and Shoulders to Clear and I&#x27;m really glad I did. Prior to this I had tried the Clear &amp;#34;Ginseng Mint and Tea&amp;#34;. Not really sure about these things they add in the bottle. This bottle says &amp;#34;Ocean Mineral&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the shampoo + conditioner works very well. I have no dandruff issues when I use this and it smells very nice. The conditioner helps keep my hair nice and soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is also nice. You can put it upside down or regular way. Upside down is nice when you&#x27;re coming to the end of the bottle to get everything out easily.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, they&#x27;re pretty much the same except for the scent.  It&#x27;s strictly a matter of personal reference, but I prefer the Citrus Fresh version.  They seem to do an identical job washing my hair, leaving it soft and clean feeling...much better than the $1.99 Suave shampoo/car wash/herbicide/flea dip that I normally use.  I knocked off a star because both versions briefly sting when I get them into my eyes.  Otherwise, they&#x27;d be a five star product.</li>
