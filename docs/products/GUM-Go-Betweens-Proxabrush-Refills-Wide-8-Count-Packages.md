<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these proxabrushes for cleaning my teeth.  Not available in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used these little brushes for years. My dentist recommended them and they work very well. My check-ups prove it!</li>
    <li> They were hard to find in stores in my local area, so I tried Amazon because I use the brush daily to help keep my teeth clean. I like them much better in the holder than with the fixed in place handle.</li>
    <li> The product has been recommended by my dentist.  I have purchased these through drug stores for many years.  So I&#x27;m pleased to now purchased the Gum Go Betweens at a much better rate!</li>
    <li> I selected this instead of slim brushes (I could not find them in the listing). However very useful for a good dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> These proxy brush refills seem a whole lot flimsier than they once did.  They don&#x27;t last nearly as long as they used to.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to get these locally.  Even though my dentist recommended them.  And if I could, they&#x27;d no doubt cost more.  What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> I have been using GUM proxabrushes. it is very difficult to find in stores. I usually get them at Wal-Mart. But recently I don&#x27;t have any luck at all. They always run out of it. I am very glad to find it here. It is even cheaper than Wal-Mart. Shipping is fast, and price is great. I have no compliant at all. In case you don&#x27;t know. This is model number 614. I assume they want to start using \\&quot;tight\\&quot;, \\&quot;moderate\\&quot;, and \\&quot;wide\\&quot; instead of model numbers.</li>
    <li> There are really uncomfortable between my lower molars. I highly suggest using the Proxabrush 414 Tight model if you are new to this.</li>
    <li> I just want to add my thanks to Amazon for stocking this and other hard to find items. I have spaces between some of my crowns and really need these.  WalMart quit carrying them several years ago.</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended these. I am on my second order so that should speak for itself. I use these after I brush and before I floss. I was amazed how much stuff was between my teeth after brushing so I will keep using them.</li>
    <li> Very useful small brushes for taking care of teeth and gums.  I&#x27;ve been using them for a long time on a dentist&#x27;s recommedation.</li>
    <li> I live in a small town, and these proxy brushes aren&#x27;t readily available often, and if they are, there is maybe 2 or 3 packages.  Having this product on Amazon is great, and being able to buy them in multiple packages is even better!  Will definetly buy again.</li>
    <li> I usually buy these brushes in local stores. But recently I can&#x27;t find any in the stores, so went online and found this one.    Placed the order on Saturday, shipped out on Monday, and received on Thursday.    I put one on the handle. It felt the same as the old ones I had used before.    The only downside is the wire broke after three days, while the old ones could last a week. Maybe my using style has changed? Will see how the rest last.    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Was glad to find these brushes as the local stores not longer carry them.  Was shipped on time and arrived on schedule.</li>
    <li> I use this product for several years and I am very satisfied with it.  In the last year the manufacturer has launched a similar product which is disposable and needs no refill, but it is more expensive...  As the new product catches in, the traditional golden handle with the proxabrush refills is not available in pharmacies any more, therefore I liked the opportunity to purchase it through Amazon at the old pharmacies price.</li>
    <li> When my dentist suggested I try using a Proxabrush with its replaceable brushes I thought, \\&quot;What a pain!\\&quot;  I really did not want to be bothered.  Just like when I first began flossing it takes a little time to learn how to use it and I when through a couple of the replacement brushes in the first week.  But now that I know how to use it I use it at least twice a day and carry the portable Proxabrushes with me as well.  It is wonderful to get all the stuff out between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Great brushes last longer than most.</li>
    <li> Same quality but costs a lot less at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy plus shipped on Prime, what else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I have only been able to find these at Wallgreens Drug Store (used to buy them at Wal-mart) for about $4.00 per package of 8.  This is a great savings even with shipping charges.  The price was incredible.</li>
    <li> I have searched every store for these and turned up empty every time. I was super thrilled to have found them here. The quality of GUM products is great...add that to the price at Amazon and you have a no-brainer purchase! I have enough Christmas tree brushes to last for quite a while now!</li>
    <li> I have been using these proxabrush refills for years and couldn&#x27;t find them locally.  This experience was easy and pleasant so I think I&#x27;ve found my place to order in the future.</li>
    <li> use them all the time</li>
    <li> My husband and I use these daily at the request of the periodontist.  Our check ups are much better when we are consistent with using these daily.  My periodontist can definately tell when I haven&#x27;t been as consistent as I should.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy them in Target, etc but have had to resort to buying them here since I can&#x27;t find them anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Gum Proxabrushes for several years now.  I love them &amp; they keep my teeth clean between my teeth. I love buying in bulk too, so being able to buy 6 packs of 8 Proxabrushes is excellent for me.  Thank you, db77</li>
    <li> This product is, in my opinion, essential for healthy gums and highly recomended by dentists. Amazon is the only way to purchase GUM refills easily for me. They are shipped the day ordered and arrive in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> bulk purchase was cheaper.  Before I hated to pay so much for something .so little</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. Our dentist recommended between our semi-annual office cleanings, use 2x a day instead of floss to slow and arrest dental plaque buildup and use alongside a pulsating [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]. I was skeptical. But after a year of use, our family is hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use this product after brushing teeth. Just insert a refill onto a Proxabrush Toothbrush Handle and gently move the bristles between the spaces in your teeth. Then rinse. I do not like the [[ASIN:B00126DM2E Butler Go-Betweens Cleaners 8 ea]] because it is harder to maneuver in each of our mouths. Use the [[ASIN:B000GGKPQC Gum go-betweens Proxabrush Handle with Refills]] to determine what size refills you need and to get your first handle. The bristle refill should slip completely in and out between each tooth so the tapered refills does not work for us. 8 refills are in a single pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I combine with the Waterpik before bed. Each bristle refill lasts 3 days to just over a week. When bent during repeated use, the bristle refill is weakened, can break and get stuck between the teeth. The user must take care not to swallow when removing the broken end from between the teeth.  Because of this design flaw, it is not suitable for children or the aged or people with mobility problems. This happened for me about 1 time out of the 8 refills and I&#x27;ve learned to be more careful and inspect before each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Users in their 40s-60s who are more at risk for gum disease and plaque formation should be more than satisfied with the results. I personally have found no product better for arresting plaque and look for and encourage feedback if anyone has a better tool. It feels good to be active in slowing plaque build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my bug-a-boo and why I am writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our family needs both wide [[ASIN:B000KPKBOA GUM Go Betweens Proxabrush Refills, Wide, 8-Count Packages (Pack of 6)]]  and TIGHT [[ASIN:B00620QI2G GUM Go Between Proxabrush Tight Refills-8ct (Quantity of 6)]] refills. The wide are more readily available and often discounted. The TIGHT are harder to come by and for some reason unknown to me, more expensive. None of Amazon suppliers for TIGHT offer PRIME free shipping at the time of this review. But this supplier offers PRIME on wide, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the manufacturer&#x27;s website found local distributors and spent 3 days trying to find the product locally. Frustrated, I went back to the manufacturers website, found I could order direct and even found a discount and free shipping code. However, the code does not work and the system bug removes the shipping line charge but includes it in the total. Furthermore, the manufacturer&#x27;s web order system requires personal information that I prefer to limit when ordering. In short, Amazon remains my store of choice and I remain grateful for ease of use and security.f 6)]] refills. The wide are more readily available and often discounted.

    <li> Proxabrush is far better and more effective than flossing, especially if your tooth contact points are tight.  It does a much better job at cleaning out the plaque on your gums between your teeth and will provide for fewer lectures from your dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> Item is OK though they are a bit on the small side..</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere locally and was amazed to find it thru Amazon.com.  Price was right, so was shipping.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Fits the proxabrush handle as advertised. Works well.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, over time, this product has become less satisfactory.  The barrels have grown thinner over the years.  I now buy them directly from my periodontist&#x27;s office.  I suspect dental professionals receive better product....or so it seems.</li>
    <li> good product, excellent price, works well, timely delivery</li>
    <li> Have used these Proxy Brushes for a long time but this is the first time I bought these from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They were good price and will continue to buy them from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product which I&#x27;ve used for many years, ever since my dentist recommended it. I find that &#x27;proxabrushing&#x27; is just as effective as flossing, but quicker and less cumbersome. Not always available at pharmacies &amp; other retailers but can always be ordered reliably from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My dentist asked me to get some of these .  Walmart no longer carries them .  Those from Amazon came quickly , and are a great benefit to my teeth .</li>
    <li> We used to be able to buy these at Wal-Mart.  So their loss and our Amazon vendor a gain.    Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Very good deal to purchase in bulk and the brushes meet expectations.</li>
    <li> Purchased GUM Go Betweens Proabrush Refills after visiting my dentist and having my regular dental cleaning. The staff recommended that I use the GUM Go Betweens Proabrush in cleaning between my teeth and after using them for a while I found them to be very good at cleaning between my teeth. The wide size is a little too big for most of my teeth. The medium size works best for me. I will purchase this product again and recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> We received the items on time and at a great price. We are defiantly going to order more soon!  :)</li>
    <li> ONCE AGAIN MY HATS OFF TO AMAZON FOR THE FAST SHIPPING. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A WHILE. THE LAST TIME I WENT TO THE DENTIST, SHE TOLD ME MY TEETH WAS IN GOOD SHAPE, THANKS TO THESE BRUSHES.</li>
    <li> Bought the refills, now I have to buy the brush</li>
    <li> Great brushes that I use after I floss. They last a decent amount of time and I have reordered twice. Good product and the cone shape is best!</li>
    <li> I looked for many months in the drug stores, etc. for this product to no avail - so I checked with Amazon and lo and behold you had it.  I ordered enough so that they would last me awhile. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, but all of a sudden I could&#x27;t find them in the drug stores.  Hooray Big \\&quot;A\\&quot; had them and I paid less over all for them.</li>
    <li> The only reason I do not give this a 5 is because I cannot figure out how to remove the bristles to replace them!!</li>
    <li> Well constructed.  Will use many times in the future.</li>
    <li> happ to note that delivery was very prompt and contained what I ordered....am very pleased with the product, but wish&lt;br /&gt;that the manufacturer had an even wider cylinder brush.</li>
    <li> Great Product -  Easy to Use, High Quality, Long Lasting, and a Must,  Exellent for Dental Hygene - Great Price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure these are perfect for some people but I prefer the ones that have the handle and the brush in one - like dentec slim brush or Plackers dental brushes</li>
    <li> This product is a good product to clean wide spaces between the teeth although you have to replace it every other day.</li>
    <li> Based on the price of $12.39, this Amazon reseller must be quite proud of their offering.  I just purchased the GUM Go-Betweens Proxabrush (414 Tight) pack of 8 for $2.01/pack from another online retailer.  I bought 2 packs (16 brushes) for $4.02 with $2.39 for shipping.for a total of $6.01</li>
    <li> This product helps prevent cavaty.  Great for cleaning in between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The product was what expected.  I&#x27;m set for awhile since the drug store doors not stock this anymore.</li>
    <li> good price. I was amazed at how much better this is than flossing</li>
    <li> As advertised and cheaper than buying in a retail store.</li>
    <li> It arrived as expected, on time and as described. Already used this and it works perfectly. It is a great product for the price. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A dentist recommended I start using these brushes.  Since I&#x27;ve started using them I&#x27;ve had good check-ups with my new dentist.</li>
    <li> Works great, there are several different varieties based on the type of teeth you have, Wide, Narrow, Fine, be sure to look at the package.</li>
    <li> Good quality, easy to use and assemble to handle. Package was easy to open, brushes are easy to use &amp; handle</li>
    <li> Way better than a tooth pick.  These are excellent at cleaning between the teeth.  I wish I had found them years before.</li>
    <li> This is a specialized product.  It&#x27;s designed for cleaning a very small area of the teeth, mainly the area between teeth.  It&#x27;s certainly not designed for cleaning a large area.  It works very well for it&#x27;s intended (specialized) purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a specialized cleaning device, this is fine.  I suspect that this device would be most beneficial to those who have dental appliances, such as braces or retainers.</li>
    <li> Product which used to be good quality has now gone straight downhill and they don&#x27;t last half as long as they did. Another reviewer commented that they must be made in China now with quality to match and I have to agree.</li>
    <li> Works well in situations when you cannot floss.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in pharmacies and supermarkets. They are very helpful to my wife and I and their availability and good price are great.</li>
    <li> I have big space between my teeth, So I need wide proxabrush to remove plaque. I feel much better after clean my teeth。.</li>
    <li> I have top and bottom braces and these brushes get most of the food debris out from between my teeth.  They are easy to use and change when they are worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a large supply because I use them three times per day.</li>
    <li> These work great in those hard to clean larger places where floss doesn&#x27;t quite do a complete job.  Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> The brushes attach to the handle very easily. The wire can be an issue as it bends without much effort. This can be a problem if the space between the teeth is close.  Otherwise, I find the brushes work very well and I am quite satisfied overall.</li>
    <li> order was as advertised,,shipping and service good,,,,</li>
    <li> I like the cone-shape brushes far better than the cylindrical ones. The latter feels like there is nothing on the brush, it&#x27;s way too thin. The cone ones do a far better job. GUM is also of better quality than, say, Oral-B. Oral-B, which is what I get as a sample from my hygienist, do not last at all and feel flimsy even on first use.</li>
    <li> These are getting harder to get, but they are wonderful for getting between teeth using the holder.  That way you don&#x27;t have to get your hand into you mouth while you are doing the cleaning.</li>
    <li> The Proxabrushes do a great job of cleaning between my teeth and my dentist and oral hygienist have noticed the difference.  They remove food particles even after I have done a thorough job of brushing.</li>
    <li> The shape of the brushes is great but the wire is so pliable that it very quickly bends so much as to become unable to return to a straight position and thus to become useless. Each brush therefore can only be used between 1 and 3 times thereby effectively costing way more than expected.</li>
    <li> Best proxabrushes on the market.</li>
    <li> Bought by the item model number on the original packaging and the product is the same. It is almost impossible to find proxabrush refills in the stores anymore so this was a good find. Good price too!</li>
    <li> I have use these for years and I believe they are one of the main reasons I still have teeth.  All the local retailers have stopped selling them so I hope they will be available from this source for years to come.  If you use these dip the brush in Hydrogen peroxide before you brush between each tooth.  You won&#x27;t believe how clean your teeth will stay and it will  help prevent gum disease.</li>
    <li> We like this product, it is dependably the same each time we order it, it is perfect for our needs.</li>
    <li> I love these little &#x27;trees&#x27;! my dentist recommended these to me. I never HEARD of them before, but my teeth have spaces at the base, and tighter on top. He said flossing didn&#x27;t really help me, and told me about these. I had a deep scaling procedure done once, and since I&#x27;ve used these I&#x27;ve been SHOCKED at how WELL they&#x27;ve helped!</li>
    <li> These refills are used on a daily basis in my house so with the free shipping I save a few cents by buying multiple packages here instead of purchasing locally.</li>
    <li> I started using for orthodonic cleaning between braces.  The handle and brush works well.  I would like a brushe even a little wider but this does the job well.  Price with 6 packages of 8 is good.  Allows much more frequent change out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
    <li> Product was what I thought it would be - and arrived quickly and easily. That is what Walmart gets for not having this item on its shelves. The larger quantity in this order also lets me replace them more freely - which one should do anyhow.</li>
    <li> exactly as described. fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have used these in all sizes and thank there great.</li>
    <li> Received order just two days after placing it.  Very good. Well satisfied.</li>
    <li> yur teeth is clean.  no never get stuck.  better then commershal and easy to used.  thats all i got to say.</li>
    <li> Perfect refills for the brush handle, easy to twist in and out. They last about 2 weeks with twice a day use, before you need to replace them.</li>
    <li> whatever works for you and gets the job done, as they do for me.  A bit pricey in public; these are a much better value at about 1/2 price.</li>
    <li> Very useful.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> After periodontal surgery in 1995 I have used this product faithfully to prevent further infections.  I do wish they lasted more than four days but they are worth whatever they cost.  Saves a lot on dental bills.</li>
    <li> Went to the pharmacy and discovered they were no longer supplying these brushes. So I rushed home to place this order. This is a steal of a deal. They are also the perfect size, although I had to make an educated guess because the one I usually purchased at the pharmacy had measurements on them, these just had small, medium, wide, so just be careful of the size</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they would fit on the end of my Proxabrush holder but it turned out that I had a different type of Proxabrush holder.  I finally bought the proper handle and then ordered these brushes but that didn&#x27;t work for me.  Now I have the wider ones and they work fine.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of the Gum Proxabrush which comes with its own handle. I misorderd this brush, it, has about the same label. As I had the long handle required, I tried it. Found that it is harder to use and has no advantages.</li>
    <li> This brand was smaller than the brand that I was used too.;  it doesn&#x27;t do as good  a job</li>
    <li> Prefer using these to flossing. simple to use and does the trick</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Wide enough to get between my teethe and durable enough to use multiple times after a thorough cleaning and rinse.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Good price and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I have wide gaps between some of my teeth. I Super Floss to try to dislodge the food there when I brush my teeth, but it isn&#x27;t always wide enough to do the job. My dentist recommended these to me, to help dislodge the food when I brush. This is my best sequence: 1) use the Proxabrush. 2) Use Super Floss, 3) Brush my teeth using a Soni-Care toothbrush. Once I got that order down, I&#x27;ve had a lot fewer cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the medium cylindrical Proxabrushes, but these seem to work fine.</li>
    <li> No issues, delived what I expected.</li>
    <li> Bought these as refills for my kids proxabrushes. Same as I got from the orthodontist but way cheaper.</li>
    <li> always use these so they&#x27;re great</li>
    <li> I have been using interdental brushes for years and much prefer them to dental floss. there is nothing more to be said.</li>
    <li> GREAT TO REACH IN BETWEEN THOSE PLACES WHERE WE CAN&#x27;T BRUSH.</li>
    <li> Very effective for removing food bis between teeth</li>
    <li> Purchased these on my dentist recommendation and they work great. The price us incredible. Since using these my check ups have been great.</li>
    <li> Wide brushes worked perfectly...</li>
    <li> My wife uses these regularly and loves them</li>
    <li> As a Registered Hygienist, I specialized in treating periodontal disease.  To prevent the onset of this degenerative bone disease, you must clean between teeth. Brushing alone will NOT be enough. I wish it was.  Using a good floss with a good technique daily is your best tool. However, in years of clinical practice, I noticed those patients who would not floss and preferred toothpicks did better using this product than they did using toothpicks. They are able to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; the plaque from between teeth. The little bristles do a great job of grabbing food debris and gently scrubbing the tooth surfaces between teeth where the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t reach. These will not clean under the gums or the contact the way floss can, so I urge you to suck it up and floss your teeth. Use these for when you can&#x27;t floss. I use them myself. These come in 3 sizes. Use the size that fits between your teeth without force or discomfort.  Rinse the item well after use. It can be reused several times and replaced with a new one when the bristles or stem become bent. You will need a proxabrush handle to insert these into (sold separately).</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars, but this rating comes with a caution.  I bought these only to use on the back teeth and for that purpose they do a great job removing such things as popcorn, corn on the cob or pieces of any type of meat entrée such as steak, chicken or pork that gets stuck there.  However, if you are thinking the wide size is an all around &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; that will do your entire mouth, you&#x27;re probably going to be disappointed because they really do not go between front teeth very well, if you can even get them between your front teeth at all. For that, you may either want to stick with floss or possibly try one of the less wide size refills that Proxabrush has to offer.</li>
    <li> Having used the prior version for so long, I was reluctant to give the new product a try.  Glad that I did, it is a very good replacement.</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding Proxabrush refills at regular \\&quot;brick and mortar\\&quot; stores. Sometimes I have found them at Wal-Mart, but more likely than not they will be out of stock or not even available at all, causing me to become frustrated with having made a special trip, only to come up snake-eyes. This then leads me to make bad life choices, such as when I go to the McDonalds at Wal-Mart and buy thirty or fourty cheeseburgers and eat them in one sitting, drinking no liquid at all, to try to numb the pain. Quickly I spiral downward into other forms of self-harm and then the self-loathing sets in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, back to the review. It was great to find these online. Much cheaper too than buying at a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; store. I use these because I am somewhat more prone to gum disease than your average bear. In combination with brushing, these keep my teeth more clean than floss. They are also faster than floss and less frustrating--they don&#x27;t break off in the middle of the job. These Proxabrush refills come in at least two sizes. I prefer the larger ones but am fortunate that either the larger or the smaller size will work in my teeth. I replace these about once a week, which is the recommendation.</li>
    <li> Yesthey were just what we were looking for hard to find in stores in our area. They use to be available.</li>
    <li> these are very useful they can be used for clean and working on your gums,excellent to have and the fact that they came in large quatity make it a good envestment</li>
    <li> as represented and fair price</li>
    <li> Could not find in stores.  Good product and hard to go from store-to-store to locate.    Happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> I like the &amp;#34;Christmas Tree&amp;#34; shape better than the straight shape.  It helps get the plaque out between my teeth better..</li>
    <li> bristles wear out fairly quickly. bristles must be dried completely after each use or they will harden and lose flexibility.</li>
    <li> I swear by these things. My periodontal check -ups show it</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, but couldn&#x27;t find locally.  Amazon came though again with the right product at the right price.</li>
    <li> I never would have purchased these if the dental hygienist had not given me a sample. I was surprised at how easily they slid in between my teeth. If they weren&#x27;t so darn expensive I would rate them 5 stars because they are a nice addition to the proxa-brush I have used for decades, but which can&#x27;t get into spaces between six of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to buy, don&#x27;t give up on getting them into the spaces in the back of your mouth. With some practice you can hold them with two fingers and use the fingers as a lever to hold the corner of you mouth back enough to slide the tip of this tiny brush between you teeth. It needs to go straight in, otherwise the thin rubber/plastic of the brush bends or breaks and you are using a brand new one for your last two teeth. I burned through about five of them getting this trick down, but once you get it cleaning with these becomes a breeze. I think it is faster to use these than flossing, but I do both and irrigate once a day because who wants to lose their teeth? Recommended!</li>
    <li> Great pricing, hard to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> Great little things - clean between the teeth, gets places toothbrush won&#x27;t reach</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price.  Works well for cleaning debris from between the teeth.  Purchased from Amazon due to the fact that this product is no longer available locally.</li>
    <li> Good product cleans well.</li>
    <li> thanks for having them on line thery do not have them in the srores any more.</li>
    <li> Saved a trip to the drugstore.</li>
    <li> great - hard to find locally</li>
    <li> Works well, but each brush can only be used 2 or 3 times.</li>
    <li> Very good deal. I have used it, I like it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used GUM Proxabrushes for years.  They&#x27;re easily useful in that these small interchangeable brushes clip into the end of a long &#x27;stick&#x27;, making it easier to do some additional cleaning between the teeth without your hands reaching all the way into your mouth. This helps get rid of bad mouth odor from decaying food lodged between the teeth, but importantly supports good healthy gums and cleaner teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shopped this Amazon vendor before. The store carries a broad line of supplies at reasonable cost, and the store packs merchandise well and ships quickly.</li>
    <li> My hygienist said that y gums and teeth are in excellent condition.  I attribute that to regular brushing, flossing, and using the Proxabrush after each meal to keep food particles from being trapped between my teeth.  These are nearly impossible to find in local stores, so this is the place to go for ordering them.</li>
    <li> These are so much easier and your mouth and teeth feel cleaner than flossing.  This makes flossing fun and easy.</li>
    <li> It was too big for my teeth.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended these. They work better than floss for some places between my teeth where the floss (I use the Gore floss) just goes around the food particles, particularly the wider gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted extra-wide but that size wasn&#x27;t available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my review for the \\&quot;tight\\&quot; version of these from the same provider for more info.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the local stores replaced this product with an inferior version--thanks to Amazon, my husband still gets to use these brushes.</li>
    <li> It works; what else can I say - my dentist said to use them if I wanted to keep my teeth - so I do, and I can.</li>
    <li> These brushes are extremely good and reasonably priced. Due to the length of the shelf life, the brushes can be ordered in very large quantities that will last for years, a good economical way to purchase and have on hand.</li>
    <li> Bought in quantity. When you need the brushes you need them. I found most stores have large selection of toothbrushes but prophy appliances are lacking.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for total tooth care.</li>
    <li> Great job in getting the food out of your teeth. Recommended to use as a back up to your regular flossing (though I am no dentist to advise of this) we use this regularly especially after those sumptuous steak meals. Does what is ti supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I also use these as micro brush cleaners for model trains as they do a great job to clean micro debris from your motors or wheel sets.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they came MINT flavored!</li>
    <li> So easy to find these on Amazon, no pressure and easy breezy!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and was perfect for what I was looking for a truly an excellent deal!</li>
    <li> I use these everyday, and I thought the price, how quickly they arrived, and the packaging were&lt;br /&gt;all just fine.</li>
    <li> Finally found these at a good price.  My dentist used to give me some at my checkups, but doesn&#x27;t do that any more.  This is the same product and the price is much better than at a retail pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Both were what I wanted</li>
    <li> These are a definite necessity for those of us who are getting older, and I wish I had had these a long time ago.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love these proxy brushes and have been using them for years.  The local stores no longer carry them, but luckily Amazon does and at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush but wish the diameter was slightly smaller so they wouldn&#x27;t wear out as quickly.  I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Having a superb prosthodontist, I&#x27;ve used this since I got crowns, and a full mouth rehab. Much easy and more comfortable to use than floss. I replace the brush frequently, for cleanliness, and because they wear out faster than you might think. They are fast to use once you get the knack, and you can do the job watching TV. The price offered on Amazon compares favorable with retail. so order them in bulk on Amazon, and just keep a good stock of them in the house..&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist always says my home routine is impeccable (who wants to go through more time and money with more dentistry?) and these do the trick.</li>
    <li> I use these every night. I have the holder that you can change the refills out every week. It really gets the food out of my teeth.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this item for years now. On my last purchase, the metal used to hold the brushes is very brittle. Its life span is not very long. In the past, the wire used to last forever. Sometimes the brush ran out of hairs before the wire gave signs of distress. On the last purchase, the wire breaks when the brush is still relatively new.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find these brushes as I can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore and the price is very good, but I need a new handle or two.  The one I have is an Oral B, probably gotten as a free starter from my dentist.  Am assuming I need a GUM Proxabrush Handle, but the Amazon reviews are confusing - it looks like there&#x27;s the old kind that these brushes fit into, and a new snap-on kind?.  Reviewers complain of receiving the wrong ones but their descriptions are confusing and the product pictures are too small to see clearly!  Does anyone know where to get the handles?  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is almost impossible to buy this in the Chicago area.  I guess no one other than myself has a bridge that needs cleaning it&#x27;s open space.  I find that if an item does not sell well, it is not carried.  Thanks a lot there you supermarkets.  Without Amazon to go to I would not be able to purchase such under appreciated items.</li>
    <li> The proxabrushes provide the same benefit as flossing. However, they allow you to clean areas betwwen teeth that you might miss with floss due to large/small spaces between teeth. The GUM brand has been ideal for me in maintaining the health of my gums. I recommend them to anyone who needs proxabrush refills.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch for the price.  I use these twice a day, every day.</li>
    <li> The items were sent from two places but they were what I wanted.  These brushes are hard to find locally and do a good job as always.  I have used these brushes for over 30 years and they do a good job.</li>
    <li> These are indispensable for me and I think Butler GUM is the only one left still making these. Oral B used to make one but I haven&#x27;t seen it in stores for a while. Even the Butler GUM brush and refills can be hard to find sometimes.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the Proxabrush handle which was recommended by by dental hygienist.  I wish they were sold in the slimmer size.</li>
    <li> My guess is that all the 5 star ratings are from folks who are first time users of these brushes. I’ve been using proxabrushes for many years. Several years ago, there were two companies making these brushes (I believe that Sunstar &amp; Gum were separate companies,) both making a variety of sizes no longer available (like the large cylinder size) and the brushes they made were much superior in quality than the current version. Not sure which company bought out the other but once that happened, the quality of the brush diminished along with the choices in size of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a bunch of new ones on 7/1/14. This new lot of brushes is totally inferior to the brushes I ordered maybe a year ago from the same company. The new brush is actually SHORTER and LESS DURABLE than the previous ones (I had some old ones left over so I measured them.) And, the durability is pitiful. The brush doesn’t last through ONE good brushing (I use it between all my teeth, brushing from the front then again from the rear.) The wire is inferior to the old ones on these new brushes. It bends easily when I brush my teeth and is a problem trying to keep it straight. This didn’t happen so easily with the old brushes. The wire is so much weaker on the new brush that I can now easily pull out the used brush from the handle by grabbing it with my fingers. On the old brushes, I couldn’t do that. I had to use my thumbnail or nail file to pry up the wire end and then pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in this new lot of brushes. I never got the hang of using floss but I better start learning, especially if these brushes remain the poor quality they are or, possibly, get even worse.</li>
    <li> the price was right. the service was excellent . can&#x27;t be better than that !</li>
    <li> I like it. It is less durable than the snap in, but cheaper.</li>
    <li> These work great and arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Have been using them for years, can no longer get them from my Dentist.</li>
    <li> good product, received in time.</li>
    <li> I love them.  They work great.  I have used these for years and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these in the local stores.  Very useful product.</li>
    <li> The brushes fit perfectly and will go where my toothbrush won&#x27;t go!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I use these every morning. I have good teeth but terrible gums and these help clean in between my teeth so I feel clean and healthy. I would recommend these to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Good product.  i need to order more!</li>
    <li> They are required for my daily dental routine. They are not easy to find locally. I was happy to find them online. I did not realize how many I ordered but now I have enough to last the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> these are not always available locally.  i prefer them to anything i&#x27;ve seen and they do what they are intended to do</li>
    <li> Good buy.  Great quality.  Return customer.  I am satisfied.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gum Go Betweens brushes are just the right size: the wide are not too wide and not too narrow. Just right.</li>
    <li> As advertised and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I use these every day. I appreciate buying in quantity. The only reason they got 4 stars is because I couldn&#x27;t get 50 or 100 in a pack.</li>
    <li> Fine, just as I wanted</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these and they work very well.  They are sturdy and last longer than others I have used.</li>
    <li> These brushes do a fine job; the handle could be better though. The cost savings over buying packs of the pocket size brushes at the drugstore makes up for any minor shortcomings.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I have  used these gum go betweens proxabrush for years but I could not find them locally for years . ,and one day while shopping in a store for the brushes another custorner inform to  go on amazon .com and low behold I did just that , and there  they were  so my gums ,teeth and my Dentist are very happy to have done business with  you and I will continue to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Frances O.</li>
    <li> Good know product so problems there. I usually buy this from local stores but this time it was a little bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> The wide version scrape the enamel of my teeth when that space is just a little shy of \\&quot;wide.\\&quot;  That can&#x27;t be good for my teeth. And how do you refill them?  the brush doesn&#x27;t screw out.  No instructions come with them.</li>
    <li> This product is for additional cleaning between teeth. It preforms as expected. It is a product I like and find easy to use. Local brick and mortar stores in my area don&#x27;t carry it for some reason.</li>
    <li> Used with a high fluoride toothpaste, this is highly recommended by my long time dentist. I don&#x27;t think Prevident (the toothpaste) is available over the counter, I can get it from my dentist. Even over the counter toothpastes would be effective in remineralizing your teeth, however, which wards off decay. This is a lot cheaper than buying the replacement brush tips at local pharmacies. I straighten them by hand and replace when they break or are obviously worn (not often). Try to use them daily, hitting problem spots between designated teeth (as identified by my dentist).</li>
    <li> The tiny steel brushes are very strong and easy to clean, one brush lasted me for 3 weeks before it bent and broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are cheap and working as expected... I love it.</li>
    <li> Replacement proxy brushes. Great for cleaning between teeth.</li>
    <li> Me dentist recommended I use this daily to supplement flossing and brushing to help keep plaque down - it works!</li>
    <li> I checked CVS all they had was packs of 4 for over 5$, what a rip off, sorry I won&#x27;t pay that for 4 little things like that. I bought these and will have enough to go about a year for 1/4th of the price.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and was so frustrated trying to find them at the same store twice and found them online at a great price. Won&#x27;t be looking in the stores any more.</li>
    <li> somehow, this time, the length was a little bit short (the brush hair part).</li>
    <li> Interdental brushes are an essential tool, along with dental floss, for removing plaque from teeth and are best used immediately after flossing. There are other good inter-dental brushes, but Sunstar GUM Proxabrushes have the advantage of enabling one to insert the brush either from outside in or inside out (the latter being much more difficult with other brushes I have used). The brushes come with a short metal stem which is attached by bending the stem under a plastic cover at the tip of a plastic holder which one must purchase separately. Sunstar could strengthen the metal stem, which after much use sometimes breaks, but by the time they break it is usually past when one should change the brush for hygienic reasons or because the bristles become unavoidably less effective.</li>
    <li> Produce arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Have used these interdental brushes for years and appreciate the consistently excellent dental checkups. They are an important part of my dental care.</li>
    <li> I have some area between my teeth that catch food and are wider the dental tape.  This product comes in multiple sizes and is literally a small brush to clean between your teeth.  They need a handle to hold them &amp; you can reach all spaces inside you mouth.  I got my first one from my dentist.  I like them so much,  I found them on the internet &amp; have continued to use them.</li>
    <li> excellent for getting the stuff left behind between the teeth after brushing....&lt;br /&gt;recommended !!&lt;br /&gt;make sure you have the holder(s) too...</li>
    <li> GOOD DEAL...&lt;br /&gt;GOOD PRODUCT...&lt;br /&gt;SPEEDY DELIVERY...</li>
    <li> This product was flimsy and cheaply made preventing it from being of any use. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have had a difficult time finding this product locally at the MSP.  Good product suggested by my dental professionals.</li>
    <li> Very useful.  I use two sizes; the small and the large, and find each a good added tool in my tooth care program</li>
    <li> Ordered for my spouse. She is quite satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
    <li> After spend a near-fortune and a year and a half in getting an implant, these work great to keep it clean.  This is by far the cheapest place I&#x27;ve found to buy this great product.</li>
    <li> better priced and more efficiently acquired than in stores.  These interdental brushes, used with a holder, work better than those that come with  their own handles.</li>
    <li> Good product. I found it in Venezuela much more expensive as everything. I will buy much more .. 100% recommended</li>
    <li> Even with the S&amp;H, these were cheaper than in the stores, IF you can find them in the store .</li>
    <li> good staff, we like it very much easy to use and easy to operations, no problems at alll, if you like it go get it.</li>
    <li> The headline says it all.  I&#x27;ve been using these Proxabrush refills for many years - nothing better for cleaning teeth.  Can&#x27;t beat the price - or service - from this vendor!  I&#x27;ve re-ordered several times with consistently great results.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use these to clean between my teeth after meals.  They are good.</li>
    <li> They are nowhere near the quality of the old barrel shaped ones.</li>
    <li> The products meet my expectation and are cheaper than any local stores. I will buy again if all are used up.</li>
    <li> These are great. I have been using them for a long time. I get a lot of stuff between my teath and can&#x27;t wait to get it out. The dentist has remarked several times how clean my teeth are. This is used in conjunction with a toothpick holder and brushing. This is a much cheaper way to buy them than small packages in the stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and quality.</li>
    <li> I use Proxabrush every day for years.  I like the clean feel and it does keep down plaque and tartar.  Just wish the brushes were a bit stronger and firmer.  Good value over retail store price.</li>
    <li> There are many many products out there but I find this to be the best for me and my family.</li>
    <li> Great product and you can find them only on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I mean, it is what it is.</li>
    <li> Does the job. It does not even have to fit in a GUM handle.</li>
    <li> The items work very well. They are just as advertised.</li>
    <li> These do the job. If you are not careful the wire holding the brush is a bit sharp but they do a good job. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These WIDE brushes are very good for my teeth.  Have used them for a number of years.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  I would not want to live without this product.  They clean between teeth perfectly and make flossing much easier.  Having a smaller size on hand is a good idea.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find where I live so this was a great surprise to find them online at this price.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me these because with aging, 72, my gums are receding and it seems like massive amounts of food get caught around my gums and teeth and I am getting blisters in my mouth so in addition to other things, these little buggers help me keep my teeth clean and I carry one in my purse as well so when I eat out I can clean my teeth better than anything else I have found.</li>
    <li> Product is what I ordered. Actually, the snap ons are the better brush. However, these will do for now. OK</li>
    <li> Apparently, all grocery and drug stores in this area quit selling these refills which was very disappointing because the brushes that come with short stubby handles are useless in regards of maneuverability between the molars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using interdental brushes for years now, and get great reports from my dentist. These don&#x27;t replace flossing, but are a great tool for cleaning some of the interdental spaces that flossing is supposed to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use these brushes to brush ACT fluoride rinse into the spaces, too -- a great way to ensure you get fluoride into the spaces that can be most vulnerable to cavities.</li>
