      <li>definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It perfectly fits my retainers and I would definitely purchase another.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve been kicked, sat and stepped on more times than I can remember.</li>
      <li>It was very useful as a travel case!</li>
      <li>Pretty amazing technology</li>
      <li>Great simple case for my invisalign.</li>
      <li>Cheap insurance to protect your retainers.</li>
      <li>I could temporarily keep my dentures clean and protected</li>
      <li>Durable, portable, compact, and useful.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>It is durable enough to withstand travel and easy to wash.</li>
      <li>I ordered these and was pleased to find they fit both uppers and lowers in the same single case with room to spare, surprise!  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>Seller packaged and shipped fast and items promptly received.</li>
      <li>Mainly because I expected it to arrive more than two days later, but it happened to show up two days earlier which is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for something that is functional.</li>
      <li>As the company doesn&#x27;t pay for returns I didn&#x27;t think it was worth it to send it back.  </li>
      <li>I had just received this in the mail and was very surprised.</li>
      <li>The price is great, the shipping is rather high in my opinion for such a small lightweight product (hence lost one star of rating), but I had looked long and hard for this smaller size case in local stores and found nothing that fit my wants except these, so at least I found my solution, so I&#x27;m generally pleased.</li>
      <li>We received exactly what we expected to receive.</li>

    <li> I had just received this in the mail and was very surprised. Mainly because I expected it to arrive more than two days later, but it happened to show up two days earlier which is fantastic. It perfectly fits my retainers and I would definitely purchase another.</li>
    <li> I have had this retainer case for almost a year now, and have travelled across the country in cars and planes. It is durable enough to withstand travel and easy to wash. Not much more to say about a retainer case. It does the job.</li>
    <li> Bought a couple of these cases to have around. They&#x27;ve been kicked, sat and stepped on more times than I can remember. Cheap insurance to protect your retainers.</li>
    <li> you will never have enough of these! great for kids with retainers, 1 in backpack, 1 in sports bag, etc</li>
    <li> This product was cracked by the time I received it.  As the company doesn&#x27;t pay for returns I didn&#x27;t think it was worth it to send it back.  It does not stay closed and is essentially useless.  I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for something that is functional.</li>
    <li> serves its purpose. Hard to fill a word minimum when your describing a small black retainer case. that is all.</li>
    <li> We received exactly what we expected to receive. Works perfect and keeps the retainer nice and clean. great buy for the money</li>
    <li> Used this to store ear plug in and put in my range bag.</li>
    <li> Durable, portable, compact, and useful. Everything that I was looking for. Hopefully, it will last for an extended period of time.</li>
    <li> The goods is very nice. It looks like in the picture that I saw. It didn&#x27;t broke anymore. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> We just needed a couple of spare cases to keep in the car and at school for retainer emergencies, especially after having to dig through restaurant trash to retrieve it. ICK. I&#x27;m happy to have found these.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do. THe only grip I have is that I got a blue one when I ordered this black one.</li>
    <li> The case they gave me at the ortho broke, so I got this one and its great for the money!</li>
    <li> I recently got upper and lower dentures and wanted a case I could temporarily keep my dentures clean and protected should I have to take them out in an emergency when not at home. I ordered these and was pleased to find they fit both uppers and lowers in the same single case with room to spare, surprise!  NOTE: you cannot store dentures in these for extended periods as they do not hold liquid , this is for emergency times only (their are 3 holes in one side so that  mouth protectors can air out and don&#x27;t get yucky which is the intended usage).  Adjusting to new dentures is painful and sometimes you just have to take them out, and if you&#x27;re in your car or away from home, at least this case will protect them until you can put them in the proper bath type container you&#x27;re supposed to use. I keep one case in my car and another in my purse or pocket. The price is great, the shipping is rather high in my opinion for such a small lightweight product (hence lost one star of rating), but I had looked long and hard for this smaller size case in local stores and found nothing that fit my wants except these, so at least I found my solution, so I&#x27;m generally pleased. Seller packaged and shipped fast and items promptly received.</li>
    <li> It was very useful as a travel case!</li>
    <li> product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - hold my retainer when i&#x27;m not wearing it. definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Very happy with my purchase.  Great simple case for my invisalign.</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing technology if you ask me. Not a single retainer will escape from this device, no matter how hard it tries. Would buy again if I necessary.</li>
