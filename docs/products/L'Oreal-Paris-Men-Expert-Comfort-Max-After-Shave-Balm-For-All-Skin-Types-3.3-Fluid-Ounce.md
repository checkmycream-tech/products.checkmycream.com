      <li>Great after shave balm, nice fragrance and like the upside-down container ;)</li>

      <li>I said ok this might not be for that</li>

      <li>Ladies you will love it for your husband&#x27;s and it doesn&#x27;t smell of perfume</li>
      <li>I used to love this product and have used it for over a decade.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff as it is SPF 15 to protect me from Colorado sun.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite after shave products.</li>
      <li>Be it sunscreen or moisturizer, I have no interest in even touching it.  </li>
      <li>Refreshing.</li>
      <li>With the SPF 15, it&#x27;s great for the whole face, neck, and ears.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite stuff for the face post-shave.  </li>
      <li>SPF+aftershave is perfect solutions for going outside home after shave.</li>
      <li>This balm is an effective moisturizer with a light fragrance and sunscreen all in one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a skin moisturizer with an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; odor.</li>
      <li>I also love the smell of it and how it makes the skin feel.</li>
      <li>Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy after feel, soaks into skin, protection from the sun</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s one of the better products from what I can tell.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that  being a refreshing after shave experience, though I know many men use these kinds of lotions for this purpose.  </li>
      <li>It also feels more like an 50W &#x27;oil&#x27; than a face lotion.  </li>
      <li>Prior to this I used L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Hydra-Power Invigorating Moisturizer with Vitamin C (also an excellent product) but that item contained no sunscreen protection.</li>
      <li>Smells good to just right</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good and seems to moisturize well, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>Awesome product..much much better than other more pricey and famous brands on the market.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to dispense and apply, and no fragrance/odor.</li>
      <li>I need an oderless product that is easy to apply and works well.  </li>
      <li>Also, this stuff is not that easy to wash off the hands.  </li>
      <li>Good purchase, overall I was pleased and satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Mild but pleasant odor and is very soothing.  </li>
      <li>Goes on very smoothly and does not look oily if used in the right quantity.</li>
      <li>It is a light colored like off-white, cream.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and not greasy.</li>
      <li>This item seems to fit the bill!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Soothes, moisturizes and is odor free.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t feel too extravagant for not using the cheap stuff on my face.</li>
      <li>This is a good skin care product for men with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It quickly soothes irritated skin, and I don&#x27;t mind the smell (it&#x27;s nothing too strong).</li>
      <li>I usually use after Pinaud Clubman and I get the best of both.  </li>
      <li>I believe everyone&#x27;s eyes are the most sensitive, important and precious.</li>
      <li>This is the only aftershave lotion I use now because it is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for finishing a shave.  This is more a skin lotion than a traditional &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34;.  I prefer to use an alcohol based aftershave first to close my pours before applying this lotion.  The SPF is nice too.</li>
    <li> Packaging has changed but same product inside</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the consistency or smell. It&#x27;s also not really an aftershave, at least not the kind I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s more like a skin moisturizer with an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; odor.</li>
    <li> Best aftershave lotion I&#x27;ve found.  Mild but pleasant odor and is very soothing.  One of those few products that you actually miss when you run out.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product. It may be good for my skin but it does&#x27;t feel invigorating or smell good. I still like Acqua Di Gio by Armani.</li>
    <li> not sure if the ingredients are as wholesome as they could be but it&#x27;s one of the better products from what I can tell.  saves me spending so much on &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; brand</li>
    <li> Great after shave balm, nice fragrance and like the upside-down container ;)</li>
    <li> 5 stars! Awesome product..much much better than other more pricey and famous brands on the market. Very suggested!</li>
    <li> Best face lotion I have found, leaves a bit of a shine but not feminine or anything like that. Not oily and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to breakout. Used for years..</li>
    <li> My favorite daily after-shave. I like that in addition to serving well its primary purpose that it also offers some sun protection. It has a light, pleasant scent and absorbs quickly without a white, greasy residue that so many facial products with an SPF feature often do. It&#x27;s a good price on Amazon so I don&#x27;t feel too extravagant for not using the cheap stuff on my face.</li>
    <li> I still experience razor burn after applying this product. I was hoping it would soothe as advertised.</li>
    <li> Used for years, hard to find locally; when I do, it&#x27;s the same price as Amazon.  Low scent, so you don&#x27;t smell like a teenage boy, provides good sun protection if you spend a lot of time outdoors.  With a shaved head, I basically use this stuff over my whole head each day.  Non-greasy, protects well, low odor.  Nice to find a &#x27;mans&#x27; product, not some perfumed oil.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  If you use a lot it will be very hard to work into your skin and not have a white lotion on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No irritation using this product, use after shaving and gives a very cooling, refreshing feel. (no sting)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this shipped to an altitude over a mile high - and first time I flipped the lid down to squirt some in my hand a TON shot out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the Neutrogena Men Razor Defense Post Shave Lotion better.  Both work very well though.</li>
    <li> I respond to electric shaving well but my face does get irritated at times. This creme not only takes care of that discomfort and rushing buy also tightens your skin so it looks healthy, youthful and clean. I took a chance ordering it online and I am so glad I did. Ladies you will love it for your husband&#x27;s and it doesn&#x27;t smell of perfume it is unscented. Manly! Get it if only for the clean, smooth, youthful look it gives the face!  Just a tip!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two years.  If you apply it properly (don&#x27;t use a handful) it isn&#x27;t greasy, has a nice scent and has the bonus of SPF 15 sun protection. I am outdoors a lot and am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this since it includes SPF 15 along with aftershave.  Turns out it works great!  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, provides SPF protection, cools &amp; moisturizes after shaving, and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.  I usually use after Pinaud Clubman and I get the best of both.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I need an oderless product that is easy to apply and works well.  This item seems to fit the bill!&lt;br /&gt;It is however, often difficultt to find!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using after shave balms for years. And they have ranged from $22.00 Nivea to $40.00 + Old Spice Hi-Endurance After Shave Moisturizer. My adult son said to save the bucks and go for the L&#x27;Oreal balm (I didn&#x27;t realize L&#x27;Oreal made products for men).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, the soothing and the anti-irritation effects plus the hydrating equaled those of the higher priced balms. Also, a little bit goes a long way. I shave my head, too. The size of a pea of balm does it all.</li>
    <li> This one definitely gave comfort but has caused eye burning/irritation to me. I usually apply the lotion all over the face after shaving. I&#x27;m curious to know if other people noticed the same or not. I have been using Nivea Extreme Comfort After Shave Balm but unfortunately I don&#x27;t see that product available online anywhere. So, I wanted to give this product a try. I believe everyone&#x27;s eyes are the most sensitive, important and precious. I&#x27;m not using this product again.</li>
    <li> Excellent - works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this! Goes on smooth and helps calm the irritation down. I will be sticking with after shave balm from now on, I like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as an after shave moisturizer in my travel kit. I think that I will start using it at home as well.&lt;br /&gt;It soothes well and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this! Instantly soothes your face after shaving. It also makes for a nice moisturizer with no overpowering kind of scent. Recommended for anyone looking for a new aftershave lotion!</li>
    <li> A little bit of this goes a long way to take care of your skin. And its a sun block...!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite aftershave - I&#x27;ve been using for several years. This one looks a bit updated vs the previous bottle. It protects the skin really well: no alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out; goes in very smooth and no residue; a little bit of sunscreen. I use it both on the shaved and unshaved areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;The big problem is it&#x27;s so hard to find now - I can only find it on Amazon and the price is almost too high.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for an aftershave balm that doubled as a sunscreen as I am not big into grooming and I could not be bothered messing with two separate products after a shave.  Having searched the internet for something that I thought would be straightforward to find I was amazed to find only this and some crazy priced boutique product. Then when I tried to order it was only available in the USA for shipment within the USA so I had 6 bottles ship to a US address and on to Europe from there. It sounds like a lot of hassle and it was but it was worth it as the product is a good balm with a broad spectrum SPF 15 and I use it every day to save sun damage. I really think l&#x27;Oreal have a winning product here and should sell and promote it in Europe. - John, Galway Ireland (yes we do get sun here occasionally)</li>
    <li> PERFECT....It&#x27;s a CREAM not an watery fragrance....THIS is EXCELLENT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to avobenzone and chose this sunscreen because Neutrogena switched their men&#x27;s OTC sunscreen to avobenzone as active ingredient a few years back. This was my go-to daily OTC sunscreen for my face, but after I bought a replacement after I ran out, I was pleasantly surprised when I got to work with red splotches all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturers need to tell their customers on their packaging when they change the formula. Not everyone is insensitive to changes in ingredient they&#x27;ve been slapping on their faces for several years.</li>
    <li> My wife would tell ya, I absolutely hate any kind of lotion.  Be it sunscreen or moisturizer, I have no interest in even touching it.  That said, I&#x27;ve been rubbing this stuff on my head after every shave.  It works so well that I put aside my hatred for lotions because this stuff feels great against a freshly shaven head and it has sunscreen too.  Win win!  Way to go L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
    <li> You must use an aftershave that does not contain alcohol and this fits the bill perfectly. Add to that the SPF protection and they have me for life. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and don&#x27;t use cologne as I have had more than one girlfriend tell me it smells great just as is.  It&#x27;s not greasy and even when laid on thick. dissolves into the skin within minutes.</li>
    <li> I shave twice a week and use this product. My skin irritates very easily and this balm calmes my skin better than other products. There is still irritation on the second day after shaving (never on the next day) but fewer than without using. Reduces redness on the day after shaving too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to go with two other L&#x27;Oreal Men Expert products (foaming cleanser &amp; moisturizer) mainly because I like the other two and I wanted something with a sunscreen in it. Unfortunately, this one triggered my perfume allergy so badly I had to take benadryl! If they ever put this out in an unscented version, I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
    <li> I use this product every couple of days when I shave - it&#x27;s not greasy and since there is no scent, it doesn&#x27;t compete with my after-shave.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this based on other Amazon reviews.  I found that it tends to irritate/burn more than actually soothe.  It also feels more like an 50W &#x27;oil&#x27; than a face lotion.  Ultimately, it may be &#x27;good&#x27; for your skin and/or help in avoiding sun burn, but as an after-shave lotion, it seems to be lacking.  Also, this stuff is not that easy to wash off the hands.  Should you accidentally touch the areas around your eyes during the first couple of hours after application, you&#x27;ll definitely know it.  Last but not least, if all you want to a soothing after-shave lotion, this item seems a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite stuff for the face post-shave.  With the SPF 15, it&#x27;s great for the whole face, neck, and ears.  It&#x27;s lighter and smoother to apply than Neutrogena&#x27;s protective face lotion, and it protects and lasts all day.  It&#x27;s not available everywhere, as it used to be, Dove and Nivea appear to be bribing the major retailers and taking over the shelf space, so it&#x27;s good to have Amazon.com around to keep good products available.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great products. Works as advertised. I have very sensitive skin and would get horrid razor burn. Since using L&#x27;Oreal, great skin, no razor burn at all. Not greasy either. Worth a try</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and not just after shaves. It&#x27;s light and not greasy. Takes care of my face even if I don&#x27;t shave and perfect to use daily. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this L&#x27;Oreal after shave while on a business trip in 2011. I had never used any products from L&#x27;Oreal before and was hesitant to buy. After reading the package and giving it the smell test I purchased. I have a high profile career, I work both inside and outside (40:60), and I meet new people all day every day. I sometimes experience a little burn around my neck after shaving but not more than any other product I have used. I use this product even when I don&#x27;t shave and don&#x27;t get the irritation on non-shave days. I like that it doesn&#x27;t clog pores , is SPF-15, and get a lot of compliments on the scent (I don&#x27;t wear cologne). I have three different deodorants and/or ant-perspirants in my cabinet and this scent combines with all of them. I can always find it at CVS and usually buy three at a time as I live over 2 hours from my closest one.</li>
    <li> These type of products are subjective to personal preference, I have tried similar products and this seems to work best for me.</li>
    <li> Great for Indian scorching heat. SPF+aftershave is perfect solutions for going outside home after shave. Otherwise it&#x27;s feel strange to put layer of aftershave and then sunscreen</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years, great after shave for my face and head. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy after feel, soaks into skin, protection from the sun</li>
    <li> it is as advertised. it has its own scent which mixes with my shaving cream sent which is ok. I would prefer its unscented, but I like it.</li>
    <li> For several years I bought this from Walgreens but then they stopped carrying it for awhile, so I ordered it from Amazon.  The Amazon version looks and smells exactly the same but the consistency is thicker and goes on almost like vaseline.  While it is still my favorite facial cream I am wondering if this was a bum batch or if they permanently changed the recipe?  I liked it better before.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!!! After washing may face &amp; applying in the morning then even following showers throughout the day, my face still feels pleasantly moisturized before I go to bed at night. The scent is hardly noticible and will not clash with cologne. It would be nice if this could be made with more sunscreen protection IE: SPF 30 which would provide greater coverage against the sun&#x27;s harmful effects. Prior to this I used L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Hydra-Power Invigorating Moisturizer with Vitamin C (also an excellent product) but that item contained no sunscreen protection.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in my area. So glad amazon exists.</li>
    <li> Very nice-to-use after shave balm. Refreshing! I do not react to this (skin break out or itch or make eyes burn and water) and it has an SPF of 15. Easy to dispense and apply, and no fragrance/odor. Nice size and attractive on my sink counter. Goes on very smoothly and does not look oily if used in the right quantity. It is a light colored like off-white, cream. And I use Norelco (prefer it, and the 3D unit) and Braun (do not like Braun) electric razors. I often use both: Braun to knock it down, and 3D to refine. I&#x27;m 66.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend, will buy again and I hope this helps someone</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have used great that it has SPF 15 protection as well no need so far for additional sunscreen in my daily use in the Midwest.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, great for your face, fast ship</li>
    <li> I like the hydration, and can appreciate the SPF 15 in this product, but it makes this cream feel heavy like a sunscreen and less like a quick facial hydrator. This is just my preference, this may work for you if you don&#x27;t mind the heavy feel to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent for men&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> This is not a premium face product so don&#x27;t expect much.  I was using a much nicer premium brand but wanted something with sun protection built in.  Thats a big plus for this but it also burns my face when I apply the product.  No idea whats going on or its supposed to be like that but I immediately went back to my old product.</li>
    <li> Smells so good! And is very affordable!</li>
    <li> This was the best aftershave lotion and I have used it for years.  I am not sure L&#x27;oreal is still making it, however, which means that old sku&#x27;s are being sold today....</li>
    <li> I usually just use this on my neck after shaving (I have a different lotion for my face). It quickly soothes irritated skin, and I don&#x27;t mind the smell (it&#x27;s nothing too strong). After a while, I forgot I even put on a lotion because my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I used to love this product and have used it for over a decade. Just recently they added two more suncreens to the formula that now stain my shirt collars orange. Change the formula back please L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I always get terrible razor burn on my neck, no matter what combination of razor/cream/lotion I try. Unfortunately, this lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to help at all with razor burn. It smells pretty good and seems to moisturize well, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Refreshing. Just wish it would have a higher SPF, at least 30.</li>
    <li> This is the only aftershave lotion I use now because it is perfect for sensitive skin. It has the added bonus of being a light sunscreen without feeling thick and heavy on your face. Love the quick delivery with Amazon Prime because I always forget to pick this up in stores when I run out and these small bottles seem to last too long to justify buying in bulk (I shave twice a week and one bottle lasted me almost a year).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been unable to find this anywhere in the real world. It&#x27;s great after shave lotion. I really like the SPF-15 sunscreen (I live in Arizona after all.)</li>
    <li> No matter how little you use of this stuff, it gets you entire face nice and greasy.  I can&#x27;t imagine that  being a refreshing after shave experience, though I know many men use these kinds of lotions for this purpose.  I prefer the good old-fashioned, alcohol-containing, astringent after shaves.</li>
    <li> Very good after shave balm. Smells good to just right</li>
    <li> While the effectiveness, texture, scent, and SPF are all great aspects, there is one massive problem with this product: It has a ridiculously shiny, high gloss finish that never goes away unless you wash it off or leave in on all night. I&#x27;ve had to relegate it to use only on days when I&#x27;m either not going out or spending the day in the remote outdoors. I would buy it again if the sheen problem were corrected.</li>
    <li> Went back to double edge shaving and needed a nice after shave moisturizer. This product smells nice (not overpowering) and really feels great after a close shave. As for the sunscreen additive, it can&#x27;t hurt as nobody needs skin cancer. Give it a try. Bang for the buck is great as a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is great after-shave, but a little greasy. You don&#x27;t need much. Personally, I prefer L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s cooling gel after shave, but that is getting progressively more difficult to find. Perhaps this means I&#x27;m in the minority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, however, is good. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin. I happen to have an aloe allergy, so it&#x27;s difficult to find good after-shave that does not contain aloe. This stuff gets the job done and then some. A big step up from the typical alcohol or Nivea stuff, and thankfully not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Soothes the skin without the irritating burn that many others unfortunately do.  I also love the smell of it and how it makes the skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I cannot find in stores.  I bought 4 at once this time in order to ensure I have some for the future.  It makes your skin have a healthy, red glow and helps prevent wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does not feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; when applied. Can&#x27;t tell you are wearing a product with sunscreen in it.  One of my favorite after shave products.</li>
    <li> Came on time, just what i ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Bit disappointed to discover it for a bit less in a local store</li>
    <li> Love this stuff as it is SPF 15 to protect me from Colorado sun.  Very light scent from a high quality manufacturer.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, so it last forever. Really takes care of any razor rash.</li>
    <li> Short version:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stop bleeding, redness or burn sensation faster. I expect this of an aftershave but I never got that. Sure does moisturize at the cost of greasy feel that lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long version:&lt;br /&gt;Did I get a bad batch or something? The plastic factory smell is bad, but doesn&#x27;t stay for long. When I do happen to cut myself, note that its very rare because I use a Gillette Fatboy vintage on least agressive setting and Bluebird DE blades, I generously spread over my burns and cuts.  First thing I get a sting that fades quickly but is notable nothing wrong with a little sting, then comes the greasy feel and even though I am in this to stop the bleeding and prevent infection the bleeding will not stop. I said ok this might not be for that so what about the burning? The burning lingers even longer than without aftershave! When I do get burn the feeling lasts for hours, especially on hot days. The other thing to note about is there is no soothing feeling when applied, at all. And if being uncomfortable from a cut that won&#x27;t stop bleeding, a redness that will not go away and a burning feeling now add GREASY feeling almost to the point it feels sticky to this pile of unaccomplished product. So I said hey lets give this a chance, lets test on hot and on cold showers and also vary the quantity of aftershave put on. Results were still unsatisfying the only change was redness and burn sensation cooled off faster on cold shower (you willing to trade warm showers for that?) and greasy feel wasn&#x27;t too present with less application BUT compressed face feeling kicked in as a side effect.  The bleeding never stopped in all cases. I cant really test the SPF feature so I won&#x27;t pool it in with the other things I expect an aftershave to do.  This product does do some level of moisturizing, I notice a change yes but the greasy feel that accompanies it is not a good trade-off.  I get kissed a lot and the girls reaction is always negative when they feel their lips stick to my cheeks, best they described it was like kissing a sweaty man, do you want that impression on women? I don&#x27;t recommend this product.tick to my cheeks, best they described it was like kissing a sweaty man, do you want that impression on women? I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It was Worth the money and no weird scents like other products. Good purchase, overall I was pleased and satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have found this moisturizer to work well with me. No Fragrance, Soothes my face and adds SPF protection. I will keep buying this as long as it is made.</li>
    <li> Does what I need for a shave lotion.  Soothes, moisturizes and is odor free.  Also no greasy feeling after applying.</li>
    <li> A good product as an after shave with added bonus of SPF 15 sunscreen included.  No need to enhance review just to make word minimum,</li>
    <li> I thought this stuff was just what I wanted until orange stains started showing up on my white T-shirts and dress shirts.  I was told by customer service at L&#x27;Oreal that &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; men have a chemical reaction that causes this, but I found that applying it directly from the bottle to a T-shirt had the same effect.</li>
    <li> love the smell and works great. One tip is to put a dime size in hands and rub hands together for a few seconds then apply to face and neck so will go on smoother and not fill so thick. LIke the fact it has sunscreen built in. wife likes the smell also. will buy again.</li>
    <li> surprised at the spf ability even at 15.  I use it regularly even when not having shaved, and I can get tanned up everywhere and my face and neck are totally protected.  i&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle..</li>
    <li> Its very good stuff. I like that it has a #30 sun protection in it. L &#x27;Oreal seems to be a great product brand though the majority of their products are for women..</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but the packaging could be improved. It fell approximately 16 inches from my medicine cabinet to my sink top and the lid broke off. Why not just have a simple twist top?</li>
    <li> This balm is an effective moisturizer with a light fragrance and sunscreen all in one. The formulation is not oily and does not cause pimples to form. The fragrance is only noticeable up close and resembles a botanical scent. Not quite flowery. Some may not like this. As a moisturizer, it definitely soothes any irritation I get, even if I apply sometime later in the day.</li>
    <li> Good product , great price</li>
    <li> This is a good skin care product for men with sensitive skin.</li>
