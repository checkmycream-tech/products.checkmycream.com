### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Had this about a year now, still works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Very good for the price.</li>
      <li>Very good brush for the cost and a good match for the ivory stand and razor</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Good bargain for a starter brush.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive, but good quality shaving brush.</li>
      <li>Good brush.</li>
      <li>and finish on this brush is good and while it&#x27;s not the softest I&#x27;ve ever used it nice.</li>
      <li>Amazing Quality for the Price.</li>
      <li>5 stars for sure.</li>
      <li>the price you will not find a better brush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will go away, as the boar brush scent went away with time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good entry level brush - it can shed a bit but for the price well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Brush is much smaller than my VDH boar brush, but I&#x27;m happy it is, because it fits my new perfecto chrome shaving stand perfectly and looks fantastic hanging on it to dry.</li>
      <li>It creates a lather incredibly quickly, as compared to the VDH boar brush.</li>
      <li>Lathers well, cleans up quickly.</li>
      <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s outstanding so far.</li>
      <li>Its good, but too small.</li>
      <li>Good enough, I like it, no loose hairs after first use, no regrets</li>
      <li>Just remember before you use it wash it and then put on a little hair conditioner and rinse it well in WARM water.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t rust and dries fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real money saver compared to those shaving gels and foams.</li>
      <li>Short and sweet here - The smell goes away.</li>
      <li>By that, I mean the boar brush would cramp my hand trying to whip up a lather, whereas this brush creates a perfect lather in seconds with very little effort (using the same soap, might I add).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>not yet shaved with it, just been cleaning it leaving it fully loaded over night to tame the strong animal scent.</li>
      <li>But, again, it&#x27;s lathering capabilities, so far, are certainly worth the minimal investment.</li>
      <li>Its natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only shed 3 bristle&#x27;s the whole week</li>
      <li>No loose hairs.</li>

<li> The bristles are soft and dense and the base is sturdy.</li>
<li> This brush shed like crazy for days and days.</li>

    <li> Good enough, I like it, no loose hairs after first use, no regrets</li>
    <li> Had this about a year now, still works perfectly. 5 stars for sure. Lathers well, cleans up quickly. SOLID</li>
    <li> I used a brush with a chrome handle. What a mistake. This doesn&#x27;t rust and dries fast. It&#x27;s a real money saver compared to those shaving gels and foams.</li>
    <li> Like this brush a lot. It is replacing a cheapy grocery store brush. The bristles are soft and dense and the base is sturdy.</li>
    <li> This brush shed like crazy for days and days. My advice, pass it up.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price. I have been using this badger brush for a couple of months with very little bristle loss. Good bargain for a starter brush.</li>

    <li> Inexpensive, but good quality shaving brush.</li>
    <li> for the price, this brush is tits</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this brush for a week and I have to say it&#x27;s outstanding so far. It&#x27;s only shed 3 bristle&#x27;s the whole week and I have to shave twice a day and reapply shaving soap several times so.....&lt;br /&gt;Fit and finish on this brush is good and while it&#x27;s not the softest I&#x27;ve ever used it nice. Just remember before you use it wash it and then put on a little hair conditioner and rinse it well in WARM water.&lt;br /&gt;For the price you will not find a better brush and I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Good brush. Works great. No loose hairs.</li>
    <li> Amazing Quality for the Price. You may want to repackage if this is a gift.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good entry level brush - it can shed a bit but for the price well worth it.  If you want badger without craY prices pick this up.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet here - The smell goes away. Its natural. The bristles will fall out with the first few uses and slowly stop falling out. You can&#x27;t beat the price, plus you&#x27;ll be the talk of the town when you pull this puppy out.</li>
    <li> Its good, but too small.</li>
