      <li>I have purchased it many times and love it.</li>

      <li>:)  </li>

      <li>Love that it is a 50 spf and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>it has a light sunscreen smell but nothing that really bothers me and it moisturizes beautifully...</li>
      <li>and my skin is looking pretty good.</li>
      <li>It offers great protection for being in the sun, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>started to notice a very mild burny sensation after using this product.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a lotion with decent full-spectrum protection that was also not oily, would not clog pores, and gave me good moisture.</li>
      <li>Does not clog pores and goes on light and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and a terrific price.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a fragrance; it kind of just smells like</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s so light and not sticky or greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth - not too oily or watery.  </li>
      <li>Fairly light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, goes on smoothly and</li>
      <li>I have tried several brands of sun screen looking for one I can use forever and be happy with.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s extremely important for me to wear sun screen almost all the time.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>the shine fades away pretty quickly leaving a nice radiant effect.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena goes on easy, it&#x27;s greasy, and actually feels good on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Much better price here on Amazon than I kind find in the local stores.  </li>
      <li>an excellent product, often hard to get in drug stores.</li>
      <li>Dematologist really did recommend and I love</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no white cast after you apply and it does a really good job of moisturizing.</li>
      <li>but my skin quickly readjusted to it.</li>
      <li>I experienced no redness, but the feeling does persist for about half an hour.</li>
      <li>And not expensive!</li>
      <li>it goes on smoothly and is so much better than a sunscreen only product.  </li>
      <li>It blends right in and disappears.  </li>
      <li>No usual sunscreen strong smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same SPF just not as controversial ingredients in the Baby version.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just fine for her, but my skin is sensitive.</li>
      <li>Makes skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I was encouraged buy a former hairstylist to use this shampoo to keep my scalp healthy and encourage scales from farming leaving my hair quite a bit thicker then without the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recomment to my friends and order more.</li>
      <li>Her dermatologist recommended she use Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 50.</li>
      <li>I burn a little easier than average, so the mild burn suggests the Healthy Defense did a damn good job.</li>
      <li>This one does the job, but I do not know if it has any amazing properties compared to other products</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic everyday moisturizer that you won&#x27;t be able to live without once you start using it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for morning application on an island or beach trip!</li>
      <li>I got a bit sun-kissed but the burn was minimal and went away overnight after I applied more on the Health Defense.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t really fragrant</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re looking for more of a wet lotiony consistency, this might not be the moisturizer for you.</li>
      <li>It prevents sunburn and it also makes my skin look fresh and young.</li>
      <li>Many other products of course protect from the sun</li>
      <li>I have used many  other makes and  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t end up drying your face out even more afterwards (like some other products I&#x27;ve used).  </li>
      <li>Scent is similar to sunscreen thanks to the spf but disappears quickly.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t like how it leaves a greasy sheen directly after you apply, but that&#x27;s not too big of an issue because it soaks in pretty quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a thick layer of white grease, and you get a large quantity for the money that you spend.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. I use it every day.  I have skin cancer in my family, and have always been concerned about protecting my skin.  This is non-greasy, absorbs well, has a pleasant smell, and protects me from those nasty UV rays.</li>
    <li> Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a little bit like sunscreen...same consistency and same smell minus most of the shine. My skin is generally a tiny bit shiny after applying , but not overly greasy. the shine fades away pretty quickly leaving a nice radiant effect. So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half and my skin is looking pretty good. It&#x27;s not overly hydrating I&#x27;ve found, so if you&#x27;re looking for more of a wet lotiony consistency, this might not be the moisturizer for you. It offers great protection for being in the sun, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Continued Use:&lt;br /&gt;I started to notice a very mild burny sensation after using this product. I never really payed much attention to it in the beginning, but I really started to notice it after continued use. I get tiny tiny red bumps on my cheeks also from using it and it gives me sort of a ruddy appearance. I love the Neutrogena sun screens. they do not have this burny effect on my face, but this for whatever reason does. I gave the rest of my moisturizer to my mom to use and it&#x27;s just fine for her, but my skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> Terrible ingredients for skin. Horrible sun protection. Only positive thing is, it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast/film on dark skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and acne prone.  I developed acne in my thirties, and my dermatologist prescribed Tazorac, which makes skin extremely photosensitive, and can make it dry.  My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has proven to be effective in providing moisture and sun protection.  Thus far, it is also non-comedogenic and has not irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> very nice, not greasy</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy, goes on smoothly and the white film goes away if you rub the lotion in well. Both my boyfriend and I use this every day.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Healthy Defense with SPF 50 goes on smoothly NOT oily!  My dermatologist recommended it.  I hate to put on two different smelly greasy products.  I love it...and use it on the backs of my hands as well to protect against brown spots!</li>
    <li> wife loves it..its a five star if shes happy</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Wife is a fan, which makes me a fan.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is one of the best, if not the best, sunscreen products available. It has full coverage protection in a creamy base that moisturizers the skin. I have worn only this product the last five years and credit my skin appearance, no freckles, brown spots or sun damage, to this protection.</li>
    <li> Dematologist really did recommend and I love the SPF and Helioplex are both  in  moisturizer - which I&#x27;m in the habit of using daily</li>
    <li> long-time Neutrogena customer</li>
    <li> I also had the &amp;#34;burning feeling&amp;#34; reaction from this product, which my excellent dermatologist makes available in sample size to customers. I experienced no redness, but the feeling does persist for about half an hour. I have no idea what the ingredients are here, with their exotic brand names (&amp;#34;Helioplex&amp;#34;?), but I didn&#x27;t have this effect when I used Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunscreen SPF 45 Twin Pack, 6 oz. ASIN: B004D2DR0Q, which I can recommend as an alternative. Great product, that one.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer and sunscreen - my facial skin is softer and fewer wrinkles after about 2 months of use</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  An amazing sunscreen and moisturizer in one.  I&#x27;m 55 and have dry skin and this has helped my skin a lot!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended per research organizations.  I like that it&#x27;s a light feel, and knowing that it has SPF of 50 keeps my fair skin from burning.</li>
    <li> I am a guy. I use this because I had a basal cell carcinoma (a weak-sauce skin cancer) removed a few years ago and was told to put sunscreen on my face. I was given a sample of the Healthy Defense SPF 50 and liked it. It isn&#x27;t really fragrant so I can put it on and my manliness can stay intact. It works well too, I went on a hike on a sunny day (~105 F) in the Sonoran Desert (Phoenix area), and ended up out there for about 5 hours (while sweating and not applying any more Health Defense). I got a bit sun-kissed but the burn was minimal and went away overnight after I applied more on the Health Defense. I burn a little easier than average, so the mild burn suggests the Healthy Defense did a damn good job.</li>
    <li> My friend has had extensive surgeries and procedure for skin cancer. Her dermatologist recommended she use Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 50. I like the fact that no cakelike residue remains after apply, just a nice finish on your face.</li>
    <li> It blends right in and disappears.  It hasn&#x27;t burned my eyes at all.  It doesn&#x27;t smell.  So far, it&#x27;s perfect!  :)  I haven&#x27;t had it on with a sweaty face yet, but I don&#x27;t anticipate having any increased eye irritation during those times.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year now and it is the only moisturizer I use aside from eye cream. I have extremely sensitive skin and other moisturizers either cause blemishes, rashes, or build-up. This one does the job, but I do not know if it has any amazing properties compared to other products--I just know that it has none of the negatives I usually encounter. It&#x27;s a great sunblock too.</li>
    <li> I always check www.beautypedia.com before I purchase anything cosmetic, including facial lotions and cleansers. This one came recommended years ago, and it&#x27;s my go-to purchase for daytime lotion under my makeup. It is not sticky at all, seeps right into the skin, and best of all it&#x27;s spf 50. Try to find that anywhere else. You won&#x27;t. This is a fantastic everyday moisturizer that you won&#x27;t be able to live without once you start using it. Highly recommend. (I used Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizer for years until I read the reviews on BeautyPedia.com).</li>
    <li> This is great for what it is.  I don&#x27;t like in that it initially goes on white (and I look like I have kabuki face, since I have olive skin), but eventually it blends in.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. It feels wonderful on the skin and I no longer have to worry about applying sun screen when I am going outside.</li>
    <li> i use it as a sunscreen because it has an spf of 50 but at the same time i have a moisturizer.  it goes on smoothly and is so much better than a sunscreen only product.  the price for the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> This SPF 50 product is perfect for California beach bunnies.  Easy to use and can be used several times a day to protect the facial skin from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.</li>
    <li> Looks great under makeup</li>
    <li> Having thinning hair since puberty I was encouraged buy a former hairstylist to use this shampoo to keep my scalp healthy and encourage scales from farming leaving my hair quite a bit thicker then without the shampoo. Lately I have had more difficulty finding this product at the salon, so I checked on Amazon and bingo I found it. Just what I had been looking for. My friends we&#x27;re impressed with the Quick response and lower price that I received from Amazon then I had from the local salons. Now they are ordering this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and a terrific price.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite moisturizer for a few years. It prevents sunburn and it also makes my skin look fresh and young. I love it.</li>
    <li> I started using this because I wanted amoisturizer with a high SPF...I had a skin cancer on my face and didn&#x27;t want to take any chances...it has a light sunscreen smell but nothing that really bothers me and it moisturizes beautifully...no greasy but I do have to let it settle in  on my face for 10 minutes before I put makeup on...I use this year around</li>
    <li> I use this on my face everyday before my makeup.  Goes on great and blends in well..  Love that it is a 50 spf and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin (oily in T-zone areas but dry on cheeks and around eyes) and this moisturizer works pretty well for me. At first, it dried out my skin even more which I thought was odd but my skin quickly readjusted to it. There isn&#x27;t much of a fragrance; it kind of just smells like sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it has spf 50 in to protect against skin. However, I don&#x27;t like how it leaves a greasy sheen directly after you apply, but that&#x27;s not too big of an issue because it soaks in pretty quickly. There&#x27;s no white cast after you apply and it does a really good job of moisturizing. I would recommend, but I prefer the Visibly Even one over this one.</li>
    <li> I love  this  use  when I gomout on all days  have  sensitive skin  and it protects my skin  I have used many  other makes and  this is the best  I carry it in my purse  lila r</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for years and still love it.  Does not clog pores and goes on light and non-greasy.  I wear under makeup everyday to product my skin and would not switch to another brand.</li>
    <li> This is great but do not put on eye area.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of sun screen looking for one I can use forever and be happy with.  Diagnosed with a Melanoma in Aug. 2011 it&#x27;s extremely important for me to wear sun screen almost all the time.  Neutrogena goes on easy, it&#x27;s greasy, and actually feels good on my skin.  I mostly use the Baby version though.  It&#x27;s exactly the same SPF just not as controversial ingredients in the Baby version.</li>
    <li> I like it, it helps my skin but it&#x27;s too oily almost. And I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Terrific sunblock that doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on your face. I have purchased it many times and love it. Kids don&#x27;t complain either.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product for my abused face.  After years of life guarding, refereeing soccer, running, etc my face needs some protection all the time.  I was afraid it would be greasy but it rubs right in and leaves no greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Is a good one, not sticky, love the light weight texture on my face.  No usual sunscreen strong smell; I use it on my arms and hands too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin, but it does make my face sort of shiny, even if I just use a little. I usually wait a few minutes, then use an oil-absorbing sheet, then put on makeup. But that&#x27;s a pain -- wish I could find a moisturizer with SPF that doesn&#x27;t make my face shinier.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, provides great sun protection with a nice light texture that doesn&#x27;t clog my oily skin. Scent is similar to sunscreen thanks to the spf but disappears quickly. works great under makeup!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lotion with decent full-spectrum protection that was also not oily, would not clog pores, and gave me good moisture. I sometimes still use a thicker moisturizer on my T-zone, but I have this on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning.  I pray that the 50spf is indeed in there since I can&#x27;t tell one way or the other.  If there weren&#x27;t a label on it, I would never know spf were in it at all - it&#x27;s so light and not sticky or greasy at all.  I wear it under my make up since it provides a really great base.  I finally finished one 1.7oz tube and it took me 6 months!  As a previous reviewer said - a little goes a long way!!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s sunscreens have been in the spotlight lately for having harmful ingredients. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Not oily or messy.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I use sun screens almost daily because of my skin&#x27;s sensitivity.  Many other products of course protect from the sun but, I suspect, have a solvent base that makes my eyes water.  This Neutrogena HD was recommended by my dermatologist, I bought it and now no watering eyes.  I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 Star because it is expensive ......... $13 for 1.7 OZ (50 mL) a dinky amount.  I use the Neutro on my face and another product on my arms and hands. If anyone knows of a comparable product like this one at a lower cost, please let me know.</li>
    <li> Much better price here on Amazon than I kind find in the local stores.  I like that it has an SPF 50 sunscreen especially for the summer.  Fairly light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Goes on smooth - not too oily or watery.  Makes skin soft and smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t end up drying your face out even more afterwards (like some other products I&#x27;ve used).  Also has SPF.</li>
    <li> Great travel sunblock (3oz and under) and worked perfectly on my cruise trip. Very fair price and helps minimize breakouts. Highly recommend for morning application on an island or beach trip! Great size for each person to have their own.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s greasy and yes it smells like sunscreen. But I prefer that over cancer. I&#x27;m switching to the Ultra Sheer Dry Touch at least during the summer when I won&#x27;t already be sweating like a pig. Still like it.</li>
    <li> Could not live without, fast shipping thanks</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products and this is the best prices ever. Would definitely recomment to my friends and order more.Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this when I go out into the sun because it has that SPF 50 thing. I do burn terrible in the sun without it. It feels lovely on my skin. It does not have that terrible fragrance that most suntan lotions have. It does have a minute fragrance that my sinuses are able to tolerate. I do love the feel of it on my skin. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> an excellent product, often hard to get in drug stores.</li>
    <li> See that warning in the description of this product?  It says: DISCONTINUE USE IF RASH APPEARS.  I got what amounts to a chemical burn all over my face and neck from this product.  I thought I should sue but given that there&#x27;s a warning and I&#x27;m &#x27;just a consumer&#x27; I would totally lose the lawsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned.  There is a chemical in this product that will cause your skin to become raw, inflamed and you will develop welts if you&#x27;re sensitive to whatever that chemical is.  But will Neutrogena disclose what that chemical is?  NO.  You are a guinea pig.  There are 5 active ingredients in this product.  If you don&#x27;t know AHEAD OF TIME that you&#x27;re sensitive to it you will be disgusted that you paid for this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of a few products with a high (50) SPF rating.  After having sun related problems with my skin, I was advised to use a moisturizer with an SPF above 25.  Not easy to find.  However, this product meets all the requirements.  I only wish it had a slight tint.  It does rub in well though.  Truly recommend.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is advised by my dermatologist.  This is great....good sun block plus a good moisturizer.  And not expensive! I use it every day....don&#x27;t need those expensive sunblocks!</li>
