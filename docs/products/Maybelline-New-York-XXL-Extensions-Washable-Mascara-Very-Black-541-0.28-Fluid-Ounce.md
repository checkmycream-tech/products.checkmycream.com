      <li>nice mascara--</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and of all the mascaras I have tried it is absolutely the best!  </li>
      <li>I hope I will be able to buy it online for many more years!  </li>
      <li>Love the two layers</li>
      <li>I love the primer, so I had to order it online.</li>
      <li>and I have not been able to find it in stores for about a year.</li>
      <li>I am just glad I was able to buy 5  on Ebay.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>and I love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>but I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I have never gotten as many compliments on my eye lashes since I started wearing this.</li>
      <li>So glad to have found it online.</li>
      <li>I had been using it for years and wasn&#x27;t able to purchase it in stores anymore.  </li>
      <li>but I LOVE the primer (Step 1).  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always my luck that any beauty product I love eventually gets discontinued</li>
      <li>It washes off easily, it makes my lashes look AMAZING and full and it does not make my lashes stick together or get clumpy.</li>
      <li>it stays on, doesn&#x27;t run, doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes and is easy to remove with eye makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>I bought four while they are still available.</li>
      <li>Wish the makers would keep this available at the stores.</li>
      <li>I was excited to find it on line and ordered 5 tubes of this mascara.</li>
      <li>and this mascara is seriously the best.</li>
      <li>It does get clumpy quickly though.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t quite as great as I remembered but still like the old double layer system Maybelline quit making better that their new hyped ones.</li>
      <li>so it was worth it to my daughter.</li>
      <li>It is a pain to wash off, but the look is definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I was only able to get through 3 days.</li>
      <li>I always order a new tube for special occasions</li>
      <li>and it really takes a lot of work to get them to stand out, and this is the first mascara that I&#x27;ve found that does that without a ton of effort.  </li>
      <li>It lengthens and makes my lashes 100% more visible &amp; long.</li>
      <li>and I hope I will be able to purchase it for a long time.</li>
      <li>but it took too long to put on:)</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>They really make my lashes look thick and long and sexy!!!</li>
      <li>and it lasts throughout the whole day.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore, so I am buying it online because I like it so much.</li>
      <li>Much to my dismay, this product became scarce in the stores I had been purchasing it.  </li>
      <li>With thin eyelashes, I found the great product of Maybelline New York XXL Extensions Washable Mascara.  </li>
      <li>It makes my thin lashes look long and full, I get so many compliments!!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>: first is a primer that lengthens with fullness and second: a layer of dark mascara that makes my lashes look like they did when I was in my twenties, long, lush and amazing!  </li>
      <li>But u can tell it was new</li>
      <li>very useful  for lengthening lashes  a great base for mascara</li>
      <li>Like I said, I can do most of the work with the white side and then when they are where I want them I coat them with the black.  </li>
      <li>long lasting and true to its claim of making lashes have that wow factor otherwise.</li>
      <li>I wonder if this product is old stock.</li>
      <li>And so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any leaking or raccoon eyes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only mascara that makes my lashes look long and natural and full without clumps.</li>
      <li>I love the white \\&quot;primer\\&quot; side that allows me to really work on separating and building up my lashes without painting my entire face black!  </li>
      <li>But I love it none the less!!!</li>
      <li>I am fair and the black can sometimes be a little too dark.  </li>
      <li>There is not a single mascara that works so well.  </li>
      <li>I just felt I had to write a good review after it got such a bad one.  </li>

<li> so you will have to find something to manually unclump lashes once they dry if that happens.</li>
<li> Item was old and dried out!</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t find it in Walmart or any other stores around me anymore.</li>
<li> I have blond, thin, short eyelashes with really deep inset eyes</li>

<li> This purchase was not worth the time or money.</li>

<li> This mascara is a little pricey, but it is no longer on the market</li>
<li> However, upon using it it seemed dried out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a huge make up user, and I&#x27;m no expert</li>
<li> I received Very Black 542</li>
<li> I normally try a product for a few weeks before I leave a bad comment.</li>
<li> Use it everyday!</li>
<li> When I received this item, the mascara packaging was completely mangled, dirty, and had already been opened.</li>
<li> At least Amazon refunded my money.</li>
<li> Packaging was broken when product was received.</li>
<li> not happy at all</li>
<li> I have one at home and keep one at work for a touch up after lunch (I always do that with all of my makeup) and even with the buildup of a few applications it isn&#x27;t too bad to take off.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, Maybelline discontinued it.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately Maybelline has stopped making this product which I have used for years.  </li>
<li> and I have been unable to find it anywhere in the discount or department stores!</li>
<li> Too bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Item was old and dried out! Buyers beware</li>
    <li> It says it is washable, however it is not. I received Very Black 542 and it is waterproof, which I cannot wear. At least Amazon refunded my money.</li>
    <li> Yes I love it! So happy I found this online since it is now discontinued. Works great!</li>
    <li> I just felt I had to write a good review after it got such a bad one.  I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline XXL pro for at least a year or two (however long it&#x27;s been out) and I just love it!  I love the white \\&quot;primer\\&quot; side that allows me to really work on separating and building up my lashes without painting my entire face black!  I have blond, thin, short eyelashes with really deep inset eyes and it really takes a lot of work to get them to stand out, and this is the first mascara that I&#x27;ve found that does that without a ton of effort.  Like I said, I can do most of the work with the white side and then when they are where I want them I coat them with the black.  They really make my lashes look thick and long and sexy!!! And so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any leaking or raccoon eyes.  I have one at home and keep one at work for a touch up after lunch (I always do that with all of my makeup) and even with the buildup of a few applications it isn&#x27;t too bad to take off.  I used to use a CG brand mascara and I had to buy waterproof because it would run and then I&#x27;d pull out half of my lashes trying to take it off.  My only complaint (which is why it got four out of five) is that they don&#x27;t make a brown or brown/black shade.  I am fair and the black can sometimes be a little too dark.  But I love it none the less!!!</li>
    <li> love it! it extends my already long lashes even longer but does clump sometimes so you will have to find something to manually unclump lashes once they dry if that happens. long lasting and true to its claim of making lashes have that wow factor otherwise. i recommend it.</li>
    <li> With thin eyelashes, I found the great product of Maybelline New York XXL Extensions Washable Mascara.  Much to my dismay, this product became scarce in the stores I had been purchasing it.  I then learned it had become a discontinued product.  Thankfully, I located a way to continue using the product (even tho I&#x27;ll eventually have to say goodbye) and ordered all they had.  I am happy while it lasts!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and can&#x27;t find it in the drug store anymore. It does get clumpy quickly though. I always order a new tube for special occasions</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara  and I have been unable to find it anywhere in the discount or department stores!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! I can&#x27;t find it in Walmart or any other stores around me anymore. So glad to have found it online. It&#x27;s the only mascara that makes my lashes look long and natural and full without clumps. I keep coming back to it!</li>
    <li> not at all happy with this, i get clumps that are awful and globs that require a needle to separate. not happy at all</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the actual mascara (step 2) but I LOVE the primer (Step 1).  I&#x27;ve tried other lash primers (both cheap and expensive) and this is the only one that really makes a difference for me.  It&#x27;s always my luck that any beauty product I love eventually gets discontinued so I am VERY happy that I can still buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was really happy when I found out that I could buy this product online.  I had been using it for years and wasn&#x27;t able to purchase it in stores anymore.  I hope I will be able to buy it online for many more years!  It makes my thin lashes look long and full, I get so many compliments!!  Anyone who says this product is clumpy is a liar!</li>
    <li> I love it! I have used it for years now. It thickens and elongates my lashes. It&#x27;s a Very good product!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and hate that it has been discontinued.  I have not found one to replace it yet!</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years. It lengthens and makes my lashes 100% more visible &amp; long. They need to put it back on the shelves at the store!!</li>
    <li> This is sold out at all my local stores. I love the primer, so I had to order it online. It gives very long, defined lashes. It is a pain to wash off, but the look is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> why does it have this nice review?!&lt;br /&gt;it makes my eye like panda and dry.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t use this after 1week try</li>
    <li> I hate this stuff. It makes my eyelashes stick together and feels gross. I normally try a product for a few weeks before I leave a bad comment. I was only able to get through 3 days. I can&#x27;t believe that I paid for this stuff.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately Maybelline has stopped making this product which I have used for years.  I have super sensitive eyes and I love this mascara.  it stays on, doesn&#x27;t run, doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes and is easy to remove with eye makeup remover.  I am just glad I was able to buy 5  on Ebay.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when they are gone.  Too bad.  It is an excellent product.  Maybelline, are you listening?</li>
    <li> very useful  for lengthening lashes  a great base for mascara</li>
    <li> Used It for ages.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge make up user, and I&#x27;m no expert but I love this mascara. It makes my eyelashes 50x longer and it lasts throughout the whole day. I was very happy with this purchase! :)</li>
    <li> Packaging was broken when product was received. But u can tell it was new</li>
    <li> Do not buy this mascara. When I received this item, the mascara packaging was completely mangled, dirty, and had already been opened. This purchase was not worth the time or money.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. It appears it may be discontinued so I bought all they had.</li>
    <li> Wish they would bring this back!</li>
    <li> I purchased three. One of them was not correct and the package was opened. I just had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> This mascara is a little pricey, but it is no longer on the market so it was worth it to my daughter.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara and I have not been able to find it in stores for about a year. I was excited to find it on line and ordered 5 tubes of this mascara. However, upon using it it seemed dried out. I wonder if this product is old stock.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! So glad I found it here since I cannot find it in stores anymore! Use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, Maybelline discontinued it.  The lash primer increases the look of lashes and the shorter wand is much&lt;br /&gt;easier to handle...I don&#x27;t poke my eyes with it!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite as great as I remembered but still like the old double layer system Maybelline quit making better that their new hyped ones.</li>
    <li> nice mascara--but it took too long to put on:)</li>
    <li> I have tried like every mascara ever and this mascara is seriously the best. I can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore, so I am buying it online because I like it so much. It washes off easily, it makes my lashes look AMAZING and full and it does not make my lashes stick together or get clumpy. I have never gotten as many compliments on my eye lashes since I started wearing this. People off the street will ask me what mascara I use. I love it and I hope I will be able to purchase it for a long time. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and of all the mascaras I have tried it is absolutely the best!  Love the two layers: first is a primer that lengthens with fullness and second: a layer of dark mascara that makes my lashes look like they did when I was in my twenties, long, lush and amazing!  Wish the makers would keep this available at the stores. There is not a single mascara that works so well.  I bought four while they are still available.</li>
