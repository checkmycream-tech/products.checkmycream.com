<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this cologne and it was great to find it on Amazon at such a great price. You definitely get your moneys worth. What a savings over shopping in the high dollar chain stores.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this cologne, came quickly and is the correct fragrance! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my preference...loved</li>
    <li> Excellent 5 stars Dar I</li>
    <li> This scent has the perfect amount of balance in my opinion. Its fresh, but not so fresh that it smells like Axe spray. Its also got the perfect level of musk which isn&#x27;t found often in colognes. This leaves you wanting more and more without being overpowering or having a foul or unfamiliar scent. This decisively masculine scent is a perfect balance between unique taste and refreshment. However balanced this scent is, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but its cheap price almost makes up for that.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes, but for my wife, it&#x27;s her absolute favorite.  Drives her crazy.  It&#x27;s a fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering, yet can stand out within a crowd.  Amazon&#x27;s price is a little more than half off of what Macy will charge her.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Husband and he loved it, and has been using it since it arrived.I  was stunned when I seen how cheap it was here compared to the stores.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne, most of all my girlfriend loves when I wear it. Excellent smell that lasts most of the day. Amazon has the cheapest price around, I will buy here again and again.</li>
    <li> Good morning, regarding this product thoroughly recommend it because it is a very good perfume, the size is the same as shown on the page and original.</li>
    <li> The only problem that I found with this product was that it does not stay very long. The scent goes away after some hours! Other than that good! Fast shipment</li>
    <li> I like this product from Guess v much, this is my 2nd bottle. Lasts till end of my work day.</li>
    <li> Excellent mild smell and its stays long around for a day. I got this from Amazon on a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> Great smelling citrus top notes get compliments throughout it&#x27;s average longevity and projection.  Great as a work scent, subtle citrus from beginning to end.  A little synthetic smelling but very tolerable, surprised me coming from a lower end designer scent.  Doesn&#x27;t get many compliments due to its average projection and over-spraying just creates a cloying mess.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered it was great thank you</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, really like the smell and how its not over powering. All you need is one or two sprays and lasts all day. Ladies love it for real! Got many compliments and so on lol..</li>
    <li> this product was not as i expected it to be.  this perfume has very light smell which wont last more than 30 minutes...  u can hardly smell it fragnance...   so i wont recommend this product....</li>
    <li> This product is amazingly good. A must buy for all perfume lovers. It has got very nice fragrance. I gifted this to my husband on Valentines Day and he just loved it:)</li>
    <li> Wonderfull i love this model</li>
    <li> This smells so good. I often get compliments because this fragrance is a head-turner. TRUST ME!! if you purchase this fragrances FELLAS you will LOVE this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I enjoy having this scent in my collection of colognes.  It is a nice clean scent that I enjoy very much.</li>
    <li> i thought the guess make good cologne but this one is bad. it smell like wood.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> All good, this product is excelent and rapid of obtein in few minuts. all recomend and i like buy this product</li>
    <li> Fresh Green Smell. Love it!</li>
    <li> I dont know why we have some many good comments but the fragnance doesnt even last for one hour. Also, most of it seemed like water.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s smell really good, but I feel that the smell dose not last as long as it should be.</li>
    <li> wowwwww this cologne is just amazing, i have already gotten a couple of compliments about this cologne from random people at work and just walking around, this is quite a nice smell that is not too powerful and not too weak, its just right and smells amazing  cologne i own:  Acqua  Di Gio  Yves Saint Laurant L&#x27;homme  ck free/one  Lacoste Pure  American Eagle Real  Guess Seductive</li>
    <li> nice my husband like it. smell is good.</li>
    <li> well I bought this item as a gift for my brother , I asked him about the perfum and he told me he loved it and I believe what he said I know when my bother lies.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and excellent price!</li>
    <li> I got this cologne as a gift for my boyfriend, and I recommend it to every man out there. I never had a problem with this supplier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this cologne on multiple occasions. It&#x27;s a nice cologne, smells good. It smells kind of cheap too. Like a high schooler would wear it. The fragrance lasts a very long time without going bad.</li>
    <li> I have gotten this for my husband and it is wonderful!! It lasts all day with out him having to re-apply it.</li>
    <li> Even though I do like it ,it&#x27;s so light(maybe less than 2 hours and u cannot recognize the smell any more).</li>
    <li> Great seller . Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I found this bottle in Macy&#x27;s and other dept stores and it was more than 2 times more... I was very impressed to get the bigger bottle for my husband and only spend 26 dollars total :)</li>
    <li> Very nice clean scent, but just wish the scent would last longer.  Its a good cologne for basic everyday use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Guess supposed to be like this but I put my cologne on in the early morning and by the night I really didn&#x27;t smell it anymore.  I&#x27;m not so happy about that. Could it be old stock?  I hope not.</li>
    <li> Great purchase for the price. I love it when I find awesome colognes that aren&#x27;t so expensive. Great fragrance. It would be an awesome gift.</li>
    <li> Good price.  I did not review the scent before purchase.  Not terrible but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Pepper, pepper, peppeeeer !If you like pepper, go for it. If you don&#x27;t, stay away from it.&lt;br /&gt;3 out of 5 (I would say 2,5)</li>
    <li> Brazil - Gramado - Rio Grande do Sul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this scent but it does not keep for long, I recommend</li>
    <li> For my money, this is still the best men&#x27;s cologne out there. I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I got a bottle of this for Christmas, smells amazing.  I feel GQ when I wear it!</li>
    <li> Smells good not great.. Arrived on time and packaged properly.. The cap is annoying to put back on just throw it away... I like the smell not overpowering</li>
    <li> I used this before and I see a lot of Difference in the Smell when compare with Last time and even the smell is not lasting for a long time.</li>
    <li> lots of complements...</li>
    <li> espa&amp;ntilde;ol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ingl&amp;eacute;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;franc&amp;eacute;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is good and sports, I like to wear on the weekends, the problem as well as some others that I do not last long on the skin but is actually good and the case is the mime like fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;sending and safety of this is excellent</li>
    <li> It is number one odor for me. I ve been using it almost 10 years and I love it. I suggest it to everyone</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> Perfume smells really good!</li>
    <li> $22 for 2.5oz is a deal on most colognes. This is a quality scent that sticks with you reasonably well. The real selling point is that my girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
    <li> This was one of the best experiences I have had. will recommend and I will be doing business with this shipper. VERY IMPRESSED</li>
    <li> Delivered &amp; described as promised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok, fresh and clean..but for the price I can get a much better fragrance from either Nautica, Davidoff, Perry Ellis, Sun Java, or Thallium ...I won&#x27;t be buying it again, thats for sure.</li>
    <li> Same perfume you can get at retail stores but much cheaper, the packaging was appropriate for this product and hassle free, great scent, a must buy.</li>
    <li> I was not sure to buy it or not, i made the right decision, smell good and for the price is worth i, cheaper than retail stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the price but the small is amazing. Much cheaper than department stores and large sized.</li>
    <li> Edit: Amazon refunded my money without any questions. I am happy I got it from Amazon! :)    I am a regular user of Guess. I&#x27;ve been buying it on perfumania so far. This is my first time on Amazon.     I received the perfume, and my favorite Guess had a pungent odor. I sprayed it on my hand for a second, and when I sniffed at it, I was stunned for a second due to its STRONG pungent odor. Its clearly been on the shelves for too long! And guess what? You cannot return this item to Amazon since you cannot ship back flammable stuff.</li>
    <li> This is one of my top colognes. It was amazing how it mades women melt. I suggest this trust me any woman is going to fall in love with you if you have this on. Also try VS Very Sexy for men. But Guess really nailed it on this one!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery. Thank you</li>
    <li> Best scent ever. Not too strong.</li>
    <li> My son lol loves it he&#x27;s 14 years old</li>
    <li> Excellent product worth what you pay for, I am satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> it is perfect scent for my husband</li>
    <li> llego en perfectas condiciones y es excelente perfume, de muy buena calidad, ademas de economico, lo volveria a comprar si es necesario</li>
    <li> Had it at one point but ran out so I bought it again and smell fresh has before love it thanks</li>
    <li> Muy buen producto y cero complicaciones para compras internacionales  Excelente colonia muy buena y el precio tambien    Excellent product</li>
    <li> The fragrance of the same perfume found in store is no where comparable to this. The one sent to me was an old one with kind of foul and rotten smell. I really doubt how to use this and how any one can use this. A big NO to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and a great gift!</li>
    <li> I was kind of nervous ordering cologne online as I had received bad orders through other vendors. But it being on amazon and never having trouble in the past I took a gamble. And it worked out. I had never smelled the stuff before and made my decision based solely on customer reviews. It smells exactly as people describe. It has a very crisp, clean scent, that is good for everyday use. Will definitely always be in my collection.</li>
    <li> Recommend you do not buy from this parlux fragrances as they never sent me my items and Amazon would not refund since it was after 30 days.  If youi go to a store you may be paying a bit more but you know you got the product.</li>
    <li> excellent product and service</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, I like it, and so does other people.</li>
    <li> to make this short i considered my self to be a cologne fanatic can&#x27;t leave my house without wearing cologne currently i have&lt;br /&gt;escape,lanvin,nautica island voyage,lagerfeld,salvatore ferragamo,lacoste pour homme,z zegna and chromme.guess is an exelent cologne&lt;br /&gt;that you&#x27;ll love.</li>
    <li> frangancia good, recognized brand, I buy a gift for my parents, I recommend them to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Smell so good very  nice.</li>
    <li> best smelling cologne i have ever used</li>
    <li> I am allergic to pretty much every perfume and cologne except Guess for Women.    So when I saw Guess for Men, I decided to give it a shot, and as I suspected, I am not allergic to Guess for Men either.  Smell is subtle, but potent.  Good product!</li>
    <li> Got this cologne as a birthday gift from my girlfriend. Absolutely love it! I have gotten several random remarks from people and I have only had it for less than a month. Nice citrus smell, make sure you spray it on your body. It mixes with your body oils and smells better!</li>
    <li> I always find myself wearing this Cologne or Kenneth Cole&#x27;s Reaction.  If you have the means, I would recommend doing so.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and its not too strong, stays subtle. It doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day though. Overall a good buy online compared to the local stores.</li>
    <li> terrible ... it&#x27;s a knock off and I want to return them ... I&#x27;ve been using Guess for years ... this item was delivered in package that was wet ... and full of bugs when I opened ... it does not smell like  the original Guess at all ... terrible</li>
    <li> This stuff is one of the best smelling colognes that I have ever worn!!!! I am a new and forever more buyer of this cologne.. It was delivered ahead of time and well packaged..</li>
    <li> Excelente, fue entregado en el tiempo previsto y sin ningun inconvenientes, lo recomiendo, es responsable 100%. Satisfecho con el servicio prestado</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing this online and I am very happy with it. This is not the easiest cologne to find.</li>
    <li> I got one to my father as a gift, he like it it&#x27;s very nice smell with daily uses .</li>
    <li> very attentive to the item, shipping came the day scheduled in good condition. Recommended 100% and there were no problems with the purchased item</li>
    <li> Wow, smells great and the price is great as well.  Pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> A very, very pleasant smell. Strong but not overpowering!! I got a sample of this from a Guess store when I bought a watch. After that I had to get it. I cannot say enough good things about this. It also lasts for quite a while. And for the price! You cannot pass this up. -LL 2008</li>
    <li> MORE THAN EXPECTED.  DELIVERY MADE ON TIME!</li>
    <li> speaking of a fragrance that will catch people&#x27;s attention...GUESS For MEN..Is a spring type of fragrance that smell great, But evening better when it&#x27;s rainy &amp; damp outside. A strong beautiful scent can&#x27;t help but notice it on. It last pretty long on my skin &amp; gives me about 7 to 9 hours ....A true good 1</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my father for Christmas, and both he and my stepmother loved it!  It is a great scent, and you definitely can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>

    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> About several years ago, my dad received this cologne as a gift, from a close friend of his. My father isn&#x27;t a huge fan of colognes so he gave it to me. Prior to this product I had no experience with Guess colognes, let alone Guess in general. I did not know what to expect, but I tried it anyways. This cologne smells wonderful, and has a strong, dominant scent. I am usually not a fan of strong scents but my girlfriend loves it so hey, now I must wear it. Even though I do not prefer this cologne much because of how strong it is, I do however receive tons of compliments on it. So to the average person, the scent of this cologne is very appealing. The duration of this cologne is kind of unbelievable. Sometimes my girlfriend wears my shirts/sweaters, and she usually calls me 2-3 days later informing me that my clothes still smell like this cologne. In retail stores this product goes for about $35-40 dollars, so if your on the edge of deciding wether to get this product or not, I say go for it because the price on Amazon is very cheap and it is a very good cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I helped! let me know if you have any questions or comments. Thanks for reading!</li>

    <li> I ordered this perfume as a gift for my husband for our first meet anniversary and it turned out to be smellless fluid.I felt so embarrassed with my gift choice and went to return the package, but got to know perfumes cannot be shipped :(. Thus, I would suggest you to avoid buying this perfume. Instead put this money in some nice dinner/movie date.</li>

    <li> I have the female version to this and it is absolutely delicious!! It has my co workers salivating over it lol, so I went out on a ledge thinking if the female version is great, then the male to it should be just as great!  I anticipate that he&#x27;s gonna love it. I haven&#x27;t smelt or tried it out yet (yes i wear men&#x27;s perfume also), but when he opens it and I get a whiff, I will definitely be back to update!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;s&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this scent! it&#x27;s so tart n fragrant...my bf loves it also...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear cologne anymore, cause who cares- and you don&#x27;t want to be that guy. That being said, when I did- the female doggies really loved this. This and old spice and desperation worked for me a few times in the long game. Nahmeen?</li>
    <li> I was not sure how this will smell but still ordered it based on good reviews but found out that It does smell like alcohol as other people have said. It feels like using a cheap perfume bought from Dollar store. Sorry guys, but this is not what you want if you want to feel good about how you smell.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT, 100% ORIGINAL</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  It is a little stronger than most, but it smells great, so there&#x27;s no complaints here.</li>
