      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I purchased these in hopes that they would help my children brush better, as intended.</li>
      <li>Even though they don&#x27;t really like them, they are so proud when they show me their spotless teeth.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Beware though, they are strong dyes</li>
      <li>The kids loved it because it turned their tongues bright pink for a while.  </li>
      <li>, each time we test they get better, it has stopped the quick brushing.</li>
      <li>that although they do crummy brushing and refuse to listen/try most the time, the number of times and the various &amp;#34;pink pill check&amp;#34; help to dissuade cavities and they eventually get a good cleaning one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Your sink will scrub clean but clothes/towels will not.</li>
      <li>but eventually scrubbed them clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be delighted to do business with Western Dental through Amazon again!</li>
      <li>This product is just good for dyeing your tongue red like a dragon.</li>
      <li>I love having concrete proof they are or aren&#x27;t brushing well.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and helps cut down on the \\&quot;...</li>
      <li>The youngest is still trying to get away with murder in his bright pink teeth.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t honestly know if it&#x27;d stain their teeth if not brushed off after the chew and swish</li>
      <li>Getting my son ready for braces - these helped him really get his teeth clean every day.</li>
      <li>This product did exactly what I needed it to do.  </li>
      <li>Using the Disclosing Tablets enabled them and us as parents to see that they still needed areas of improvement (MUCH IMPROVEMENT!)  </li>
      <li>Luckily their shirts have come clean without aide of extra stain removers but the sink, walls and such look wretched if not cleaned off quickly.  </li>
      <li>These tablets really help my kids know how they are doing.  </li>
      <li>The real issue came about once it&#x27;s time to spit the tablets out, then brush again.</li>
      <li>This was very unfortuate.  </li>
      <li>waste your money on this kind of product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Finally clean teeth without having to go back again!    </li>
      <li>It was a wonderful tool to see where our daily brushings fail.  </li>
      <li>So far, the oldest has been doing MUCH better on the days I announce pink pill time.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The only thing to be aware of is these really do stain.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to actually see the hidden pockets, that I normally would have assumed were clean.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t love the taste, and they tried to get away without chewing the tabs properly, so now they have to show me their pink teeth before they brush.  </li>
      <li>I strongly suggest using it before bed as the color stays for a little while.  </li>
      <li>The products does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but my 10 yr old son will not spit in sink very neatly and will splatter red all over sink area as well as carpet and towels.</li>
      <li>My sink is old and worn and absorbs stains if not wiped away promptly.</li>
      <li>I have two young boys (3.5 and 5.5 years old)</li>
      <li>and he is re-brushing and slowly getting better.  </li>
      <li>They make the plaque hot pink.</li>
      <li>I have tried some other mouthwash style disclosing products and this one is the first one to give me the contrast that I wanted.  </li>
      <li>We brushed for nearly 5-10 minutes on my younger son, and my older son was about 3-5 minutes after they had independently brushed.  </li>
      <li>I did worry about a pink toilet bowl for several days but all seemed fine and no side effects seemed visible other than his dismay at losing sugars for a couple days for the trick.  </li>
      <li>I break them in half and give one to each big kid (12 &amp; 8) at least once a week if not twice a week.  </li>

    <li> These tablets really help my kids know how they are doing.  Finally clean teeth without having to go back again!    They don&#x27;t love the taste, and they tried to get away without chewing the tabs properly, so now they have to show me their pink teeth before they brush.  Even though they don&#x27;t really like them, they are so proud when they show me their spotless teeth.  Dazzling smiles are worth it.</li>
    <li> Our dentist uses this product to reveal plaque and he provided the ordering information so I can use it at home between visits. the kids love using it and they really learn how to brush properly, when they see which areas they are missing.</li>
    <li> My young son does a poor job brushing his teeth.  These disclosing tablets help him see where he missed so he can go back and brush in those places.</li>
    <li> Great for really clean teeth.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Now the kids can tell how well they brush.</li>
    <li> My Grandchildren love to test their brushing ability, each time we test they get better, it has stopped the quick brushing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and helps cut down on the \\&quot;...but I brushed my teeth properly arguments\\&quot;.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This works well but watch out - Red stains! The products does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but my 10 yr old son will not spit in sink very neatly and will splatter red all over sink area as well as carpet and towels.</li>
    <li> This product is just good for dyeing your tongue red like a dragon. Sorry I have to say the truth, but it really is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this kind of product.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t listen to me, you will regret like I did to waste my $40 bucks for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should stop selling those tricking product like this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best mail-order service I&#x27;ve ever had.  I told the people at Western Dental (which supplies G-U-M dental disclosing tablets through  Amazon) that I needed the tablets within a week, because I was going overseas.  They shipped my order the next day, and sent it priority mail at no extra charge.  My dentist recommended G-U-M products and I&#x27;m very happy with them.  I&#x27;d be delighted to do business with Western Dental through Amazon again!</li>
    <li> Never understood why this product vanished from the dentist&#x27;s office and drugstore shelves. Does what it always did for me as well as ever. And the vendor met or exceeded all expectations.</li>
    <li> Terrible taste but it modivates our kids to actually brush the their teeth.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase these from Amazon, but received some samples from our dentist.  I have two young boys (3.5 and 5.5 years old) and they are independent brushers.  We split one tablet in half after they brushed independently.  Using the Disclosing Tablets enabled them and us as parents to see that they still needed areas of improvement (MUCH IMPROVEMENT!)  It coated what I assumed was bacteria and plaque and we brushed and brushed and brushed to get it out!  It was a wonderful tool to see where our daily brushings fail.  We&#x27;ve only used this once and I suspect it won&#x27;t show as much red next time and the red won&#x27;t be as difficult to brush out.  We brushed for nearly 5-10 minutes on my younger son, and my older son was about 3-5 minutes after they had independently brushed.  I was excited to actually see the hidden pockets, that I normally would have assumed were clean.  My husband and I will try these as well, just to check up on our own habits.  Really awesome idea and product, but I wouldn&#x27;t let the children do it unsupervised.  Another reviewer pointed out that they stained, but we didn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> Good product for checking on the work that your children have done with their teeth.</li>
    <li> I love that it helps my disgruntled kids brush their teeth appropriately.  I break them in half and give one to each big kid (12 &amp; 8) at least once a week if not twice a week.  I finally got them in the habit of twice a day brushing, floss and fluoride and then with this as an aide, I feel confident that although they do crummy brushing and refuse to listen/try most the time, the number of times and the various &amp;#34;pink pill check&amp;#34; help to dissuade cavities and they eventually get a good cleaning one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware though, they are strong dyes and when they spit or drool, it stains quickly if not cleaned up.  Luckily their shirts have come clean without aide of extra stain removers but the sink, walls and such look wretched if not cleaned off quickly.  I don&#x27;t honestly know if it&#x27;d stain their teeth if not brushed off after the chew and swish but I use it to threaten them with pink teeth and classmate humiliation if they don&#x27;t get it off.  So far, so good!  Came close once to calling my bluff(?) but eventually scrubbed them clean.  I only give it to them at night cleanings so in the likelihood they ever sleep with it, they have another chance to get it off in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids being kids, the only two times they&#x27;ve tried to skirt the procedure, it was very obvious.  Oldest once broke it into a couple chunks and pretended to swish and come spit time, I saw the chunks and it was obvious he only had two pink spots where his teeth broke it.  The youngest one recently swallowed the pill and did same motions and teeth were about the same as the oldest&#x27;s trick.  I did worry about a pink toilet bowl for several days but all seemed fine and no side effects seemed visible other than his dismay at losing sugars for a couple days for the trick.  So far, the oldest has been doing MUCH better on the days I announce pink pill time.  The youngest is still trying to get away with murder in his bright pink teeth.</li>
    <li> I do weekly &amp;#34;spot checks&amp;#34; on my kids. I love having concrete proof they are or aren&#x27;t brushing well. They make the plaque hot pink.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Works great with kids!</li>
    <li> I purchased these in hopes that they would help my children brush better, as intended. They probably would be great, if they didn&#x27;t stain everything they touched. My children, aged 5 and 7, actually ended up brushing less because they thought it was so &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; to have their teeth turn red. That is not a flaw of the product, however, just children trying to make a game out of it. The real issue came about once it&#x27;s time to spit the tablets out, then brush again. I had to scrub my sink basin for literally an hour, just to get the red stains (mostly) out. Children being children also managed to get some on the wall directly behind the sink, as well as on the towel they used to wipe their mouths after brushing. Everything it got on is stained, including their toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to receive the tablets, but receiving a less expensive solution instead.  This was very unfortuate.  I had to return and re-order from another supplier.</li>
    <li> Just got this last week and my son (7 yo) has used it a few times now.  Working great and he is re-brushing and slowly getting better.  Warning, it does cause quite the mess!  I keep an eye on him so I can wash down the sink, his face, etc because I bet if left on too long, it would stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus, used green mouth rinse afterwards and the spit was purple!  Learning more about mixing colors!  :)</li>

    <li> Getting my son ready for braces - these helped him really get his teeth clean every day.</li>
    <li> My dentist used these at my daughter&#x27;s cleaning and they were great-really showed the plaque.  The only thing to be aware of is these really do stain.  Your sink will scrub clean but clothes/towels will not.</li>
