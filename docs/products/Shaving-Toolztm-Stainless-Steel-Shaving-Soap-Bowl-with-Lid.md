      <li>Could be heavier and it would be nice if there were some texture inside the bowl to help build up a lather.</li>

      <li>Love how the lid protects the shave soap from drying out.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;ceramic shaving mug, I would be quite satisfied using this set.</li>
      <li>Get a high-quality soap puck, drop it in, and you&#x27;re transported to a more genteel era every time you shave.</li>
      <li>Sturdy product, wish it held heat better</li>

      <li>the lid is also more for use with the soap pucks, which stay pemanently in the bowl.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask?</li>
      <li>Perfect size for even the larger hand made / custom shaving soaps I use .</li>
      <li>I have a matching chrome set, with stand and double edge razor and a wood brush, so it looks perfect on my counter.</li>
      <li>My Edwin Jager mug did SO much better than this.</li>
      <li>With a standard soap puck in the bottom, there is a good 1/2&amp;#34; of space at the top in which you can whip up a good lather.  </li>
      <li>Well made,  looks good,  won&#x27;t rust,  not expensive.</li>
      <li>The bowl is ideally shaped for this, and also does not tip over with the brush left in it.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Love the sleek clean look on my counter.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get your soap to melt into the contours of the bowl just by putting it in an inch or two of boiling water.  </li>
      <li>Easy to maintain.</li>
      <li>Incredibly easy to work up a lather in.</li>
      <li>The lid or mouth could easily bend.</li>
      <li>Wanted to love this, it looks great, however I&#x27;ve only just got it</li>
      <li>It was a Christmas gift, and was liked very much.  </li>
      <li>I like to add hot water to my bowl to let the bowl, brush and razor warm up before adding the creme.  </li>
      <li>This product is solid and looks great.</li>
      <li>It looks like some cheap Indian &amp;#34;xyz&amp;#34; holder</li>
      <li>Light weight metal.  </li>
      <li>My soap pucks fit well in it.</li>
      <li>purchased for husband;  he was looking for a shaving bowl with a lid for traveling,  this one fit the bill</li>
      <li>use two rubber bands, in an &amp;#34;X&amp;#34; pattern, to hold the lid secure when I travel.</li>
      <li>use Taylor Jermyn Street shaving cream - I lightly dab the brush int</li>
      <li>I received a gift certificate for a straight blade shave , and after talking to the barber while I received the shave, I now have a better understanding of taking some time to shave versus the slapping on foam and gripping and ripping a over priced 4 bladed razor over my face.</li>
      <li>It is just the right size for most shaving pucks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bowl, nothing to get excited about.</li>
      <li>I wanted to have a lid to keep a clean appearance.</li>
      <li>the problem with it is that the lid is far to lose fitting!</li>
      <li>Nicely made, large enough to fit most any shaving soap puck.  </li>
      <li>This bowl is an excellent addition to my shaving kitsmall enough to take on my travels a little dab of a quality soap, (I recommend Taylor of Old Bond Street) on a damp quality brush swish it around in this bowl and you get a great lather and away you go.</li>
      <li>and it does an adequate job soaping up in the morning.</li>
      <li>functional,  would have liked it better if it had been a little thicker, heavier in construction....</li>
      <li>The pucks melted incredibly fast and now am able to work up a lather much easier as there is no movement ever from the soap.</li>
      <li>Even then, I felt it was worth the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought. Works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;I use two rubber bands, in an &amp;#34;X&amp;#34; pattern, to hold the lid secure when I travel.</li>
    <li> This is a great size for dentures! And more classy than the plastic tub I was given. (forget that I&#x27;m walking around with no teeth)</li>
    <li> Ordered this and got the simply beautiful deluxe bowl...which is a nice item but not what I wanted. Seller might want to address attention to detail</li>
    <li> flawless. I use it for talcum powder.</li>
    <li> i put shave soap in it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bowl, nothing to get excited about.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautifully made. Quality is excellent and exactly what I was looking for. I recommend this bowl for your shave soap.</li>
    <li> Cheap and flimsy don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this, it looks great, however I&#x27;ve only just got it (was overseas when i ordered it and just picked up from a friend in the US) the problem with it is that the lid is far to lose fitting! It comes off far to easily and is no good if you are traveling as I am for a few more weeks! Is going to be a problem now! Real shame as it&#x27;s not a cheap product!</li>
    <li> Fits the soap perfectly, floats in the sink which warms the lather, fits comfortably in my palm, the lid fits tightly keeping the soap from drying out, and it looks great on the bathroom counter which makes my wife happy. A little spendy but well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Looks good.  Not cheap looking.</li>
    <li> Great! Fits a large puck inside.</li>
    <li> Beautiful.  Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Ordered this and got the simply beautiful deluxe bowl.....which is a nice item but not what I wanted, and what is worst is that, it has rust inside the lid even though I ordered new. I returned it back and it took them about a month to refund my money. the customer support is not great at responding to e-mail. I had to constantly remind them to check the e-mail I sent. they kept replying to me &amp;#34; oh we apologize for the delay to respond to your e-mail.......&amp;#34; if you want to improve your customer support  experience try it but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Sturdy product, wish it held heat better but it&#x27;s metal so what can you except.</li>
    <li> purchased for husband;  he was looking for a shaving bowl with a lid for traveling,  this one fit the bill</li>
    <li> Works great.  Looks great.  Easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> Could be heavier and it would be nice if there were some texture inside the bowl to help build up a lather. It looks real nice sitting on the bathroom counter and it does an adequate job soaping up in the morning.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the recipient likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have recently returned to the &amp;#34;old school way&amp;#34; of shaving, double edge, pre oil, brush, and soap. I received a gift certificate for a straight blade shave , and after talking to the barber while I received the shave, I now have a better understanding of taking some time to shave versus the slapping on foam and gripping and ripping a over priced 4 bladed razor over my face. This bowl is an excellent addition to my shaving kitsmall enough to take on my travels a little dab of a quality soap, (I recommend Taylor of Old Bond Street) on a damp quality brush swish it around in this bowl and you get a great lather and away you go. The bowl cleans easily and looks good too.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price, the bowl is the perfect size for shave soap and the lid fits tightly. Highly recommend to anyone that wants an affordable but classy shave soap dish</li>
    <li> Light weight metal.  Soap rattles about in it.</li>
    <li> Well made,  looks good,  won&#x27;t rust,  not expensive. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> The Shaving Toolz Stainless Steel Shaving Bowl is a great alternative to the breakable ceramic shaving bowl.&lt;br /&gt;Those who have a tendency to drop and break things will appreciate the quality and durability of this set.&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated this would be great for travel.  The bowl and cover fit together perfectly. While I prefer my&lt;br /&gt;ceramic shaving mug, I would be quite satisfied using this set. I purchased this as a gift for my son who is afflicted&lt;br /&gt;with the &#x27;Bull in a China Shop&#x27; Syndrome! ~ The Boss</li>
    <li> The shaving bowl matched my stainless steel razor stand perfectly.  It is light and the perfect size for getting a good lather from cream.</li>
    <li> I liked the appearance of this covered shaving soap bowl as soon as it arrived.  It is finished well, with no sharp edges or visible flaws.  After using it for better than a month, I still like its appearance and am also pleased with its functionality.  Although the diameter is larger than my cake of soap, the soap has remained stationary as I lather my brush.  I do see finger prints after handling the bowl with my wet hands, but have found that briefly wiping the bowl as I put it away eliminates all prints and smudges.  I see no sign of corrosion, unlike I have read about for some bowls.  It does its job well and looks good sitting on my bathroom counter between shaves.  I liked it so well that I purchased a second bowl to store small items in the bathroom.  Unfortunately, the bowl was no longer available from Amazon when I decided on a second, and paid a higher price at the importer&#x27;s website.  Even then, I felt it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this bowl to put my shaving soap in. Works perfectly! The chrome finish is nice and the lid fits snug but not too tight. The metal is a little thin but doesn&#x27;t really effect what I&#x27;m using it for. Overall i would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a soap dish out and maintain a neat appearance.</li>
    <li> Bought this bowl for shaving mainly due to it&#x27;s lid and stainless steel.  It came in two days and is a great bowl.  Soap pucks fit inside perfectly.  The lid helps to reduce any drying. Very lightweight and the stainless is thin.  Which is good and bad.  I like to add hot water to my bowl to let the bowl, brush and razor warm up before adding the creme.  With the thinness of this bowl handling the bowl when hot will get you burned. Yet I can handle that with a cloth.  The price and functionality of this bowl is well worth the price and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> love it fits all my soaps best quality would  it to any one  recomned it seeking a quality product at a fair price</li>
    <li> An excellent and unbreakable investment! Love how the lid protects the shave soap from drying out. I&#x27;m glad I ordered this!!</li>
    <li> This is great for providing a covered container for your shaving soap puck.  It is just the right size for most shaving pucks.</li>
    <li> Awesome bowl, as everyone else mentions the lid fits perfectly snug (it fits inside the lip of the bowl, not over).  It also transfers heat exceptionally well so it&#x27;s easy to get your soap to melt into the contours of the bowl just by putting it in an inch or two of boiling water.  I have a pretty thick brush and had issues with my previous mug, was a little hard to really get the brush moving around inside of it but it works perfectly with this bowl.</li>
    <li> An excellent lathering bowl.  It hols a DR Harris puck perfectly</li>
    <li> I received it on time. My soap pucks fit well in it. The lid fits tightly. I have no trouble building my lather. Its simply what I needed it to be.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time</li>
    <li> Great shaving bowl. As mentioned by many others, it is very light, but that does not seem to be a problem. Lid fits snugly. This is a great bowl for the price.</li>
    <li> Works as billed.  No frills, no fuss, no muss!</li>
    <li> Works well and looks great!</li>
    <li> Been using this bowl for about a month. Was a bit hesitant to buy but I am happy now I did.&lt;br /&gt;I use a Parker badger bristle brush and this bowl is the perfect size for that brush.&lt;br /&gt;I fill up the bowl with hot water and let the badger hair brush soak in it for a couple of minutes, then empty the bowl and lightly squeeze out the brush , then add about half a teaspoon of hot water. Too much water and the lather is on the thin side.&lt;br /&gt;I use Taylor Jermyn Street shaving cream - I lightly dab the brush int the shaving cream - dont need much - then swirl it around in the bowl to get the lather. The bowl is ideally shaped for this, and also does not tip over with the brush left in it.&lt;br /&gt;Just the small amount of shaving cream and the small amount of water generates enough lather to easily do the &amp;#34;three direction&amp;#34; shave .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont use the soap pucks, so can&#x27;t comment on the suitability of the bowl for those products.- the lid is also more for use with the soap pucks, which stay pemanently in the bowl. As I use the creams, my bowl gets rinsed out after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have commented, it is not real heavy gauge stainless, but is adequate for the task.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I like about it - it does the task for which it was designed very nicely. What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> Beautiful bowl used for shaving soap, excellent.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift, and was liked very much.  Just what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Elegant,  very nice to look at  .....functional,  would have liked it better if it had been a little thicker, heavier in construction....unfortunately it was damaged when it came,  warped into more of an oval shape and the lid wouldn&#x27;t t fit properly and had to bend it round again which was harder than you would imagine, over all i happy with it...hoping it won&#x27;t rust.</li>
    <li> Love the sleek clean look on my counter. Very solid design and manufactured so there are no lines or connection points. The lit fits perfectly and snug but doesn&#x27;t catch when taking it on or off. Fits my puck with a little room once at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
    <li> Great looking bowl, well-made, and the lid keeps the saving soap out of sight.  A great step up from tubes and tubs of shaving cream.  Get a high-quality soap puck, drop it in, and you&#x27;re transported to a more genteel era every time you shave.</li>
    <li> It has a good look and I like have the lid to keep the soap clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a big bowl with a lid.&lt;br /&gt;Highly polished but feels a little bit thin and light in the hand when whipping up lather.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was thicker walled so it would hold some heat in my cream.&lt;br /&gt;Deep enough that the cream doesn&#x27;t end up on my fingers.</li>
    <li> This shaving bowl is a great investment for the price point.  This is a large bowl so please consider the size.  One negative comment I have about this product is that the picture makes the bowl walls look thicker than in real life.  Still recommend!</li>
    <li> It is small and very thin walled, will not hold the soap jar in it like it was described.</li>
    <li> Pretty lightweight for the cost but works</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars if the lid was snug.</li>
    <li> Great still holding up well</li>
    <li> Very, Very Thin I thought the box was empty. The appearance is second to none.</li>
    <li> I needed a bowl to use with my shaving soaps. I wanted to have a lid to keep a clean appearance. This product is solid and looks great. I have been using Mitchells Wool Fat Soap and it fits perfect. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great shaving bowl.  Incredibly easy to work up a lather in. I also tried something with this bowl that I have never done before which is i placed 2 pucks of shave soap in it and put in a pan of boiling water.  The pucks melted incredibly fast and now am able to work up a lather much easier as there is no movement ever from the soap.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time looking for a quality soap dish and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;This shaving bowl  is well made and well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semper Fi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Snyder&lt;br /&gt;GySgt. USMC Retired</li>
    <li> Nice shaving bowl, I picked this one because of the lid which fits perfect does not require to much pressure to open but tight enough to keep soap sealed. I thought it was a little high priced but after getting and using it it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great soap bowl for the price. Have not noticed any rusting, but I have only had it for a short period of time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fit and finish . Perfect size for even the larger hand made / custom shaving soaps I use .</li>
    <li> The right size, wish I had the double wall to hold heat better.</li>
    <li> Nice little dish. I have a matching chrome set, with stand and double edge razor and a wood brush, so it looks perfect on my counter. The metal feels a little thin, so you have to be careful about dropping it. The lid or mouth could easily bend.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Every product I&#x27;ve been ordering as come exactly as it is pictured and representsits true value. It arrivres in the time quoted if not faster. I&#x27;m a very happy buyer</li>
    <li> Actually, this is not used by myself. The recipient does like it, it is used every day (sometimes twice a day). Being the one who cleans, I give it a 5 star, to the recipient it is just a bowl.</li>
    <li> I used to put my shaving soap in one of those mango wood bowls - the soap filled it pretty much to the rim.  The wood finally started to break down, so I replaced it with this steel bowl.  Nice steel with a nice shape.  The key differentiator, though, is the depth of the bowl.  With a standard soap puck in the bottom, there is a good 1/2&amp;#34; of space at the top in which you can whip up a good lather.  Not the case in the mango wood bowl.</li>
    <li> My shaving soap fits into this, and then I could probably throw in a pool party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is so big that it hold my soap, my lucky dog&#x27;s foot and then some. This is something out of an Indian Bazaar that has been repurposed to be a &amp;#34;soap holder&amp;#34;. My soap really just bounces around inside of it. My Edwin Jager mug did SO much better than this. I may go back to using that, even with the lint/hair that floated into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: Don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s just not worth it. It looks like some cheap Indian &amp;#34;xyz&amp;#34; holder once it&#x27;s on your counter. For now, it works, but I&#x27;m looking for something better.</li>
    <li> Nicely made, large enough to fit most any shaving soap puck.  Wish it were just a bit heavier gauge, but it serves its purpose well and looks beautiful.</li>
