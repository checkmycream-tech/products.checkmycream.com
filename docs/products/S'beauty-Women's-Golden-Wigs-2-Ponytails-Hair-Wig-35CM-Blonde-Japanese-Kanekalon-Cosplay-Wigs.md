<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sheds a little. Using it for my Harley Quinn cosplay. I was worried it&#x27;d take too long to get it. But it came 13 days after ordering it! Very cute. :)</li>
    <li> Very nice wig! My only complaint is that the hair was thinner than I expected, making it difficult to cover my dark brown hair, but with a little work, I was able to make it suit my needs</li>
    <li> First the positive, it&#x27;s very comfortable and great condition. It also came a lot sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;My wonderful negative, there were no pigtails and as of now I&#x27;m trying to work out this problem with them. I&#x27;m very frustrated and disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used it as a Harley Quinn wig and it worked well.  I wore it 12+ hours 3 days in a row and it was fine. At first I was concerned  because it fit my head a little snug and that was with my bun of long, thick, curly hair sticking out the back, but putting my hair in twin braids and hairpin Ning them close to my head did the trick. I personally  got a nude wig cap just to make sure my dark brown hair wouldn&#x27;t  show around the edges but it wasn&#x27;t necessary to put on the wig. The clips as pigtails were a little  weird  but stood in place well</li>
    <li> Wish I could give ZERO stars.  I just got the ponytail clips.  What am I supposed to do with these?  No wig, no wig cap.  And I paid an additional 15 dollars to mail it quicker.  What a waste of time.</li>
    <li> I am extremely angry this just came as a wig with no ponytail clips. This was a complete was of time and money I wanted this before the 31 and now I have a completely useless wig.</li>
    <li> Great wig, many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Wore this to Harley Quinn. The whole thing is easy to put on and the fact that the pig tales are detachable and you can pretty much put them any where takes the cake. Also since they are clip like the wig stays in place easier. Really fun and easy to wear!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Pam Poovey Halloween costume, and it was perfect. The pig tails detach and I used one of them, tied up into a bun, as the Pam wig. It was perfect, and I got lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture. Great quality!</li>
    <li> Super cute very well made only problem is the pigtails are heavy so ot slid back but sooooo cute!!</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing!! The pictures do not give it justice &amp;#60;3 I adore it. Very very comfortable. The wig cap was easy to figure out. It is my first ever. My friend who is a seasoned cosplayer loves it and was shocked when I told her how little I payed for it. I can not wit to use it for my Lolita Harley Quinn Cosplay. This is my first Con ever and first time cosplaying so I really want to do well. I am sure it will be a hit now &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my Harley Quinn cosplay!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous I love it</li>
    <li> The wig is everything I wanted. It is just like the pic and is perfect. I love it thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Harley Quinn. Three part wig with base and pigtails. Nice quality fibers</li>
    <li> This is a very realistic looking wig for the price and since the pigtails are detachable, you can wear the wig as a regular wig that doesn&#x27;t look so &amp;#34;anime.&amp;#34; There is hardly any wig shine to the product either. The hair itself is really nice. HOWEVER the wig is very heavy with the pony tails attached, and it is kind of small (I don&#x27;t have an especially big head and it was too small to fit comfortably on there and you could see my real hair at the bottom in the back.)</li>
    <li> I adore this wig. It&#x27;s slightly darker than the picture but it&#x27;s fantastic and I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> Adorable, thick and adorable!</li>
    <li> The colour is as shown, it&#x27;s soft and is just about perfect! For this being my first wig, I absolutely love it and would buy more from here. It arrived fast, and on time with no difficulties! I find the bangs in the front a little long fo my small forehead, but I just sweep them across to look more as a side bang. All around, an adorable wig with the pigtils or sexy as a short bob! The Attachments work great and it is xactly the wig every Harley cosplayer needs.</li>
    <li> This wig is more yellow than is shown - if you&#x27;re looking for bleach blonde. The pig tails are separate clips you can place on the center wig where you choose. It&#x27;s pretty decent quality with a sizing clasp in back. Stays in place well with a wig cap.</li>
    <li> Awesome! And it even came with a wig cap! I can&#x27;t wait to use it for my Halloween costume</li>
    <li> the good thing about my order was that it arrived much sooner than expected. Super excited about that. The wig doesn&#x27;t look like the picture at all (the pony tails do though), it&#x27;s just the same size all around like a bob. But it still looks amazing. BUT it had a damn worm on it, and it was still alive. What the!!! Where do they store these things. Includes a picture for proof.  The worm is what gives it a one and overshadows any good thing I had originally thought</li>
    <li> I bought this wig a while ago for a harlequin cosplay. I only got one ponytail clip. GIANT waste of my money since I needed it for the next day. I ended up having to break the stupid clip in half and making my own ponytails. The wig itself was really thin and you could easily see my cap under the hair. It also runs pretty small.</li>
    <li> Used for a Harley Quinn cosplay…. absolutely adorable and very practical wig!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, came incredibly quick and perfect for my Harley Quinn cosplay</li>
    <li> super speedy shipment looks like the picture and is very full</li>
    <li> Product was exactly like the description stated and the service was great!</li>
    <li> The color is more blonde than shown I think, but it was good quality! I did have a bit of trouble hiding the clips in the ponytail, but nothing too bad.</li>
    <li> Its a great wig,not too heavy and not too thin,though one pigtail is slightly smaller then the other,its not bad at all though a great wig for the price</li>
    <li> Beautiful and nice hair..I wish it was a bit blonder though.</li>
    <li> Such a cute wig! I ordered it for a Harley Quinn costume and it was perfect. It is a three piece wig but the clips stay in place really well.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I&#x27;m using this for my fem!nagisa cosplay. It fits all sizes and is easily styled. The pigtails are attachable so I can be both fem and normal. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The wig is definitely quality made. I just think the clips used for the poney tails are a bit too large. Aside from that, I am in love with this item. Look, feel, fit are all fantastic.</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to not look as nice as the picture because of the price, but it did look very lovely!</li>
    <li> Got this for my Harley Quinn cosplay. I like it but it was a little cheaply made. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it though!</li>
    <li> Beautiful!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great quality , thick and the pony tails are amazing! Curled nice!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Harley Quinn cosplay at DragonCon this year. Being a very dark haired brunette it took trying it on a few different times for me to get used to it, but it is a very cute wig for the price. I&#x27;m not crazy about the color. It&#x27;s a bit more on the blonde yellow side than a natural looking blonde, but I&#x27;m hoping I can tweak it a bit. I would also recommend ordering it as soon as possible so there&#x27;s plenty of time for it to arrive if you&#x27;re planning to use it for a cosplay event or party, etc. It does take a bit of time to get here, but it was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> It seems everyone has the same idea for this wig - Harley Quinn. I purchased this wig for my Harley Quinn Arkham City cosplay for ComicCon. I didn&#x27;t realise the pigtails were attached to clips until it arrives - making dyeing the ends SO much easier! The wig is also heat resistant (up to a certain heat), as I did straighten the top layer of the pigtails and nothing burned or shed. The hair feels so natural and pretty, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it! In the picture, however, the wig appears to be more of a light blonde, but the actual wig is a VERY golden-yellow blonde. I don&#x27;t mind, because it still fits the character, and it works very well. Overall, it&#x27;s a really really nice wig, perfect for Harley Quinn (basically what everyone uses it for!) It also arrived very quickly and the packaging was not careless. It has shed a little, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
    <li> Love this wig! Super comfortable. Wore it all day at ComicCon as Harley Quinn and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Really nice wig and very versatile. In love with this wig!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this wig straightened it and dyed the tips and it&#x27;s an awesome harley Quinn wig.</li>
    <li> Good quality, especially for the price, the hair feels and look natural and it fits great. The detatchable ponytails make it super easy to style and maintain. I use this for my Harley Quinn cosplay at conventions and it&#x27;s perfect, people are always askimg where I ordered it from :)</li>
    <li> color is accurate and wig is really thick and soft easily my new favorite the pigtails can be a little hard to clip in and take out but at least they wont fall out they also dont feel heavy at all i would recommend this wig</li>
    <li> Wow it may sound crazy but it actually looks and feels just like your very own hair.. This was a gift for my daughter and she as well as myself are very pleased.. Well worth the price..</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It came in 2 days and is exactly as described. I was suspicious bc of the low price, but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. It comes in 3 pieces that are very easy to assemble. I have other wigs with clips that are horrible, but this works well.</li>
    <li> Wig is in great shape. It&#x27;s great for my Harley Quinn costume. I do wish the color was a bit lighter blonde but it&#x27;s okay and will due for Halloween. Super great shipping. I didn&#x27;t expect to receive until between sept 1-sept-25 or something and I got it on Monday.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s adorable and seems like a good quality wig. I haven&#x27;t worn it to a convention yet, but it looks great on.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality wig for the price. The clips hold very well, and there is minimal shedding.</li>
    <li> super cute, used it for a costume</li>
    <li> This wig is perfect for cosplay! I wore it for HarleyQuinn. I love that you can change the style from it being pigtails to just a bob!</li>
    <li> I wish so much I could leave a positive review. I was so excited when this package came. It came with a wig cap, it looked nice and not too shiny and felt fantastic. But it only came with the middle piece and not the two ponytail clips. If I had more time I could have figured it out but it&#x27;s for a cosplay on Friday. I guess I know better then to wait till last minute but I was really counting on you guys. Especially after reading all of the great reviews. Sending it back and hoping I can find something local</li>
    <li> The wig was packaged very well and the item was spotless! They also provided a nice charm with a Chinese character on it, which I thought was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Did not come with bald cap, but other than that it is great quality.</li>
    <li> This wig is soo pretty, I love it a lot. I Order it for my Harley Quinn Costume and it&#x27;s perfect. It is a little yellow then shown in the photo but i love it.</li>
    <li> This wig is super cute and tight I&#x27;m so excited to wear it with my harley quinn costumes!! I was nervous so people have had bad luck but mine included everything and looked it exactly like the picture. Also super fast shipping.. Got here in three days! 😊👌❤️♦️</li>
    <li> I did NOT get what is advertised in this photo. I got a low-quality wig with one awkward curl down either side. No pigtails. Not full. Not even the same bangs or anything. I&#x27;m very disappointed. Complete waste of money and let down for an event I was attending this weekend.</li>
    <li> Daughter LOVES this for cosplay!</li>
    <li> the wig doesn&#x27;t not look like how its on here&lt;br /&gt;but in all its a good wig the sides of the hair&lt;br /&gt;are not long as they show on the picture</li>
    <li> its so cute, the pig tails detach, its super cute, i get hit on every time i wear it out</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for my Harley Quinn cospla . So beautifu . Amazing quality for the price</li>
    <li> Love it. Very soft and great for my Harley quinn cosplay.</li>
    <li> This actually can be straightened at a low setting! I found it looked more natural with it straightened. Can you guys make this in black!?</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig, and great quality. The pigtails have an amazing bounce to their curls and it moves and feels almost like real hair.  Got it for my sister for a Harley Quinn Cosplay.</li>
    <li> SOOO AWESOME!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Super great quality totally worth the money amazing deal</li>
    <li> Color is exactly as pictured. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the clips though. The hair seems a bit thin and the clip shows through a bit, I am hoping with some styling that this won&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
    <li> This wig is perfect for Harley Quinn and my Agitha cosplay! It&#x27;s soft and curls like the picture. It&#x27;s alittle but of a darker blonde then the picture but none the less definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Dream2reality Cosplay wigs. I recently purchased this specific one for my Harley Quinn cosplay and am very happy with it. This wig is great quality. It is easy to care for, does not tangle easily and sheds less then most of my other wigs. I happen to like the color of this wig and feel that it was true to the picture. It was comfortable to wear and fit my head nicely even with all my hair under it! I love the versatility of this wig as I can remove the pigtails for a short bob look or attach them for a school girl/ Harley Quinn look! I recommend this wig!!!!</li>
    <li> item as described!  nice quality wig no shine! XD would highly recommend and i will buy from this seller in a future! fast shipping 2 weeks or so.  thank u for my wig! C:</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely perfect! Shipping was fast for me, I had it in about a week and a half even though it said up to 2 months.  It came with a hair net and all 3 hair pieces.  Looks SO real and perfect for my costume. I would highly recommend. the fit is great too (and adjustable). quality is wonderful.</li>
    <li> it is a nice wig over all. i wish i had known that the pigtails are not connected, so i feel like they want to fall off all the time. i also dont feel it looks quite like this hair cut style, but as long as i brush it a little it doesn&#x27;t look too too bad</li>
    <li> I wore this wig as Harley Quinn and it went over perfectly! The fact that the ponytails clip on gives the wig some versatility as well. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Such cute bouncy curls wear it all the time with my bubbles cosplay</li>
    <li> The color is a bit more yellow than the picture.  Also the length is shorter for the main hair piece.  it is a great wig for Comic Con or Cosplay or even Halloween.  The quality is great for the price.  I love these wigs because you get so many options with them on different ways to look.</li>
    <li> I cannot say how fun it is to detatch the pigtail randomly in public and watch people do a double take. The wig was comfy, which is amazing since I have a big had and long hair underneath.  It lasted and entire day out with only a couple bobby pins in the wig cap, and was very soft and didn&#x27;t tangle easily.  very good</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my Harley Quinn cosplay as well, and it&#x27;s absolutely to die for!! Even without the pigtails in, it&#x27;s a very cute blonde wig. With the pigtails attached it&#x27;s even cuter, and doesn&#x27;t weigh as much as you&#x27;d think it would. Over all this was a fantastic purchase, and I love it. (Without the pigtails in it&#x27;d be perfect for the Girl Titan from AoT)</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This wig is very nice! The pigtails are beautiful, so is the base. Mine changes colour depending on the lighting, on my desk it is more of a strawberry blonde, but near the window it is a light blonde. The clips stay on snug. Everything is very well done. It arrived very quickly, which is suprising because I live in Canada. Usually stuff comes on the last expected day, but for this one was the opposite. This one does not come with a wig cap, as expected, but I have plenty. So that is not a problem. I am using this for my Harley Quinn suicide squad cosplay, so I&#x27;ll be touching things up. I would order this wig again because it is so nice!! It even comes with a tag saying how to wash the wig, which is helpful. I have no complaints about this wig! :)</li>
    <li> Wig looks great, nice quality. Shipping took longer than expected.</li>
    <li> The hair is very nice quality. And it&#x27;s thick so I can&#x27;t see the wig cap or seeing through it. Brushes easily. And I can straighten or curl it on low heat setting</li>
    <li> Used this wig for Harley Quinn cosplay and loved it!! It fits perfect and was great even with my dark complexion. Love this wig!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and undamaged. Was packaged well to avoid tangling. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> i loved it .. perfect fit the pigtails are comfortable ..the pigtail are very nice and curly came nicely packages and goes great with my costume</li>
    <li> This is such an amazingly cute wig</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was a 3 peice wig that you had to peicemeal together.  The clips on the pig tails, that attach it to the main part of the wig, do not stabilize the tails very well and they shift around.</li>
    <li> came out of the box just like the picture!</li>
    <li> Worked amazing as a wig and held on all night.</li>
    <li> I love how I can adjust the pigtails to whatever height I need. High-quality.</li>
    <li> This wig is so cool! I have used it twice so far and going to wear it again next week. Everyone loves it. Shipped in perfect condition and it looks so real!</li>
    <li> Thoroughly disappointed in the hair. It is just two yellow blonde pigtails that clip to your hair. The image is false. The pigtails are a mess. Very unhappy with this purchase</li>
    <li> great wig, very cute, great price</li>
    <li> The wig came within the expected window for delivery and was very well packaged. The wig itself is very well made and is more of a dirty blonde/darker color than what is pictured, but it is still very nice.</li>
    <li> This. Wig. Is. Amazing. It comes in three pieces, the head wig is a short biy cut in the back, long bangs to style and two long pieces down the front. Ratting it up and using hairspray is great. Then you get the two pigtails separation big claws to attach for strength. The texture and feel is wonderful!! Using it for cosplay Bubbles Powerpuff Girl.</li>
    <li> Fit well and recieved many compliments</li>
    <li> Amazing wig, high quality, and doesn&#x27;t tangle very easy at all. Cheap price for a wig this nice.</li>
    <li> Great quality wig! It comes in two/three pices you get the main pice and then two clips for the poney tails. the Poney tails are kinda heavy but the wig is a good enough quality to hold it all. I got the wig earlier then expected and really good for the price. I will have to make some adjustments to it to get it to fit my harley quin constume but over all it looks really good. On the plus side you can wear the wig without the pig tails and have a short blond wig. I have added pictures of the wig, excuse the dumb faces I am making it&#x27;s late.</li>
    <li> Color is yellow not light blond</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig twice. The second time was for a backup for my Harley Quinn costume. The first wig was as pictured and perfect color match. The second wig was drastically different in color. I am very disapointed. I will post a pic so others can see the color difference. Pictured on left is the poytail 1st version that matches the picture on the right is the newer one that everyone seems to be getting instead .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like picture at all. The wig is way to blonde and looks fake and used for my Harley Q.</li>
    <li> Accurate with natural-looking highlights. Very pretty. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> harley quinn cosplay, of course. stayed on all day at con and was rather convincing. absolutely LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> The wig was perfect and came in a timely manner</li>
    <li> As others have stated it is a bit darker than platinum.  It looks more like the customer pics as far as color goes.  I bought from a US dealer and it came quickly and in great condition!  I came with the main wig neatly in a black net, and two pigtail clips in their own individual black nets as well.  Now all I have to do it buy a wig cap and I&#x27;m set!  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic wig!! Used it for my Harley Quinn costume! So many compliments!! Loved the color, loved the fit! It&#x27;s brushable with out losing its bounce! By far my favorite wig I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing wig, really high quality!</li>
    <li> Love this wig for dressing up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for a cosplay.  I was excited when it arrived because the color was spot on and the wig felt very soft and was quite pretty. However, I had the same issue many other purchasers have had, I only recieved the base wig and not the ponytails. I have contacted the seller and have received no reply, so I guess I will have to return the wig.  Personally, I would not reccomend this wig because it seems the seller does not tell the truth about what they are selling and have no interest in correcting the issue.</li>
    <li> this wig is great! I was a little worried about buying it but it really was an awesome buy! the fibers are good and the picture represents it well. the clips are easy to use and brush! not only did i buy this for my harley quinn cosplay but my friend tabby bought it for her rin cosplay. the only thing that i found bad about it is that there is elastic on the clips that had to be trimmed. not that big of a deal tho anybody can do that and it only takes a  minute. I recommend this wig to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> As advertised. Good wig.</li>
    <li> Great wig, doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, easy to work with High quality.</li>
    <li> It arrived a little darker than the picture showed. More of a golden blonde than the bleach. Also the actual wig looks a little different than the picture. Pigtail require some maneuvering to hide the clips and the wig itself is a little small.</li>
    <li> Love this! It arrived quickly and just as I expected. The pony tails clip in and feel very secure once they are in. The color is exactly as it looks in the picture. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I got the wig earlier than expected, which was a plus. I love the wig in general, the only things I have to say is it smelled strange out of the package, but that will probably go away. And also the main wig has really long bangs. I tried to cut them but ended up making it worse, overall great wig!</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Even though it arrived after the posted delivery date, it&#x27;s still a great wig. Well made, and color is spot on.</li>
    <li> omg i love this wig so fun and easy to wear ready to purchase more wigs thank you</li>
    <li> This wig is great! The pigtails are separate and my wife is able tonsure it for two different costumes! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving it one star because I can&#x27;t post this with out giving it one...This wasn&#x27;t even what I ordered. I bought this off my other account and all I got were 2 green hair clips with blond pig tails on them. It wasn&#x27;t even a real wig!!! I&#x27;m suppose to have a wig. Not hair clips! This is false advertising</li>
    <li> Wig is slightly darker then pictured which was expected. The quality of the wig is amazing for the price and the wig is just adoreable. the reason i only gave it 3 stars tho is because delivery was a couple weeks later then the date given by seller, and it did not contain a wig cap as was listed. other then the missing item and slow shipping its a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and well made. Very happy</li>
    <li> I love everything about this wig! It&#x27;s perfect! Only thing is one of the pigtail clips is hard to open :(</li>
    <li> the color is great, the pigtails stay on perfectly asjhsjgasl everything about it is great.</li>
    <li> Used this as my Harley Quinn wig for Halloween. It looks GREAT</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig. I was afraid I was going to receive it smashed but I took it out of the package and it looked perfect! I love how you can adjust the pigtails. I&#x27;ve been practicing several Harley Quinn looks and have received compliments with it already. My con is in 3 weeks and I can&#x27;t wait to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after Con: I still loved this wig, however, it started to get a little heavy after a while, from the pig tails. After several hours of wear it did not lose its shape and stayed on perfectly, without falling off at all. I did experience some minimal hair fallout, but not terrible.</li>
    <li> came on time its soft and silky i love it</li>
    <li> The wig itself is much MUCH curlier than the picture leads to believe. Luckily it&#x27;s a mildly heat restistant wig, so a light run over it with a hair straightener and it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> I got this wig and it was perfect for my Harley Quinn cosplay!&lt;br /&gt;its soft and doesn&#x27;t look cheap&lt;br /&gt;its perfect for any Harley Quinn cosplay :)</li>
    <li> One of the cutest wigs I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> It was better than I expected!!!!! The hair is not real of course but it feels soft and bouncy to the touch. The pigtails clip in almost anywhere on the cap and u can take them off or leave just one in for a single side pony. I went to a showing of the rocky horror picture show and I wore the wig without the pigtails with a sexy black leather mini dress and I got sooooo many complements. I love this product. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Love this wig. I have it in blonde and in cotton candy pink, will most likely get other colors if I can find them.</li>
    <li> matches product specifications</li>
    <li> Before purchasing, I contacted the seller to ask if the wig looked like the image and they said it was exactly the same. Btw, I did choose to buy from a different seller at a slightly higher price to get it sooner. The seller claimed they shipped from US however, it came from China (weird). But I received it on time so no biggie! The wig came nicely wrapped in some nets and in a plastic shipping bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This listing says it comes with the wig + wig cap however, mine did not come with the wig cap. It&#x27;s possible the seller(s) think the black nets are the wig caps (which are more like hair nets for lunch ladies) but either way it&#x27;s not a big deal; I&#x27;ll purchase a wig cap from a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is super soft and doesn&#x27;t feel/look synthetic like cheap ones from Party City. The wig does shed (a little) but only when played around with. The two pigtails are clip ons and feel very secure when clipped to the main wig piece. At first I was worried the wig wouldn&#x27;t turn out like the images because of some reviews I read however, the wig imho looks like the picture. The color may not be the perfect exact match but it&#x27;s pretty darn close and no complaints from me about it. I provided images of my wig because I think this listing really needed some customer photos! No filters were done. The photos were taken indoors at night with artificial lighting using my iphone 6 plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is for my Harley Quinn costume and it&#x27;s absolutely perfectttt.&lt;br /&gt;So excited to wear this wig!</li>
    <li> I love it so much! The quality is amazing for a lower priced synthetic wig. Its also very versatile since the ponytails are detachable.  Definitely my new favorite wig! The shipping was also much quicker than expected. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for my Harley Quinn costume and it was absolutely perfect! I didn&#x27;t think it was going to ship on time but it got here 2 weeks earlier than it was supposed to. I like the fact that the pig tails were detachable because you could wear the wig without them if you choose to.&lt;br /&gt;The wig was comfortable, I had no problems with it falling off or out of place, I got tons of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;For the price the wig was a steal and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Perfect wig, especially for the price. Nice quality. I purchased for Harley Quinn costume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the picture, please note I had to cut the wig to make bangs, because I have a low hairline that the wig didn&#x27;t go over. But 99% of the population wouldn&#x27;t have such a problem, haha. So, your wig won&#x27;t have such bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works with curling iron, etc. Pigtails are separate/detachable, which is nice because then you can adjust where exactly you want them on your head.</li>
    <li> Great quality and two pig tails that clip on are very secure! Plan on wearing for Harley Quinn to Comic Con!</li>
    <li> I think the first thing I should mention is, like other people have stated, the wig is less of a bright blonde (as pictured) and more of a tanish/caramel blonde. (I don&#x27;t know hair color names all that well, forgive me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it for a Harley Quinn cosplay and I&#x27;m not going to be using it because I don&#x27;t like the color for her, but I am keeping the wig. It&#x27;s actually really fantastic. It&#x27;s soft and so far nothing has been shedding out of it. The pigtail clips are curly and really springy which is super fun to play with on it&#x27;s own. It covers my dark hair nicely,doesn&#x27;t seem to have any holes in the wefts, and it&#x27;s not unnaturally shiny.  The strands are a mixture of different shades of blonde too so it looks  lot nicer than a solid color might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think out of all the wigs I&#x27;ve ordered this one is by far my favorite. Awesome wig, just not the right color for me.</li>
    <li> Unexpected but very happy with the product.  Great Harley Quinn wig!</li>
    <li> The wig is great. The colour slightly different from the photo, but that is to be expected. I used this for my Fem!England cosplay, but this could also be used for Elizabeth Middleford, Alois Trancy (removing the clip on pig tails of course), and plenty of others depending upon how you style it for each character.</li>
    <li> The wig just came in the mail today and it&#x27;s not the right one; it&#x27;s just a short-haired, blonde wig that doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, and did not come with a wig cap or pig tails. The wig is nice though, but not the one i ordered.</li>
    <li> Wig is great just a note that no skull cap came with it.  Otherwise, no complaints.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this wig for me and it is PERFECT for my Harley Quinn cosplay. The wig provides excellent coverage and fits so well. I had no trouble attaching the two pig-tails at all. I plan on incorporating this wig into many more costumes because I love it so much!</li>
    <li> Wig fits very well, the clip ins are very easy to move  it has a beautiful curl to it and the wig looks great!</li>
    <li> Really cute. Pig tails attach with clips to the head piece. They are kind of heavy, but if you attach them right, they work fine. I wore the wig for Halloween at Disneyland and it stayed on the entire time no probelm. Looks great! Got lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Amazing Quality. It looks  great. Had to wear it for a Harley Cosplay. Looks real. and feels comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The pig-tails are detachable which is cool, cause i could wear it in a different style.</li>
    <li> Not as wonderful as I hoped. I feel the hair weave net is too loose so I have to be gentle as heck with the hair or it falls out</li>
    <li> I use this wig for Harley Quinn cosplays. I like that the pig tails are clip ons, because you can move them in to different positions or leave them off and just use the blond wig portion. Wig fits nicely on my head - was easier to just put it on rather than use a wig cap. But I also have very short hair (usually under two inches at all times).</li>
    <li> Bangs are long. But looks fantastic.</li>
    <li> IN LOVE WITH THIS WIG!  very soft and well maintained.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a great product, very impressed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This wig is great quality and was perfect for my Harley Quinn costume</li>
    <li> perfect for my harley cosplay. not too big, not too small, and looks just like harley</li>
    <li> I just received mine in the mail, 2 weeks before the earliest estimated shipping date!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I purchased this wig not only to wear at a convention, but also to use for videos on my cosplay-focused youtube channel (CospleiSensei).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be posting a full video review on my channel, but let&#x27;s get into the pros and cons here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Crazy fast shipping from China&lt;br /&gt;- Soft, human-like hair&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with packaged wig cap&lt;br /&gt;- Comes in cardboard shaper so that curls and clips are not damaged during shipping&lt;br /&gt;- Large cap size will fit larger/male heads&lt;br /&gt;- Hair on main cap is shorter than in photo, shaped more like a bob style haircut (this is a pro for me, because I now do not have to cut it to size)&lt;br /&gt;- Ponytail clips are strong and hair is full&lt;br /&gt;- Enough hair to cover cap pretty fully - you can still see it, if you look for it or part the crown strangely&lt;br /&gt;- Color matches product photo exactly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Weird, unnecessary cords hanging out of ponytail clips&lt;br /&gt;- Clips are white, where I would prefer a more yellow-beige-toned clip to blend with the hair. Not a huge issue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, I am very happy with this wig. I&#x27;m excited to play with it and get as much use as possible. For the price, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to fellow cosplayers on a budget.</li>
    <li> perfect for my harley quinn cosplay!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more yellow than as shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t have worms in it like one review and it was cheaper than the other options I was looking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get everything; nothing was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pigtails are very fully, and decent. The wig itself is very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m half debating on if I need to buy wefts or return this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for though, so I really can&#x27;t complain. But it&#x27;s more a Halloween wig than cosplay quality.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh golly!! This wig is exactly what I wanted!!! Like most, I am using this wig for a Harley Quinn cosplay and it came in just the right color and style. There is only about 2 things that are &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; about it. 1 being that the base wig sheds A LOT. 2 the base wig is kind of a tight fit on my head. I have kind of a big head but its very snug. But all in all it is such a pretty wig!! I HIGHLY recommend for people to get this wig for Harley Quinn!!!!</li>
    <li> So I received all 3 pieces of the wig and an unexpected wig cap, which was cool, earlier than expected and is a beautiful color (that matches picture), clips stay in great, slightly on the small side so I foresee some adjusting while in cosplay. Service with the seller was infuriating: took at least 10 emails to confirm that it would be the correct color and have all 3 parts of the wig (which I wanted as proof in case neither were true upon arrival) and at 1 pt seller thought that I wanted to cancel the order which I never requested.  If you can find a different seller to buy this same wig from I would or just hope that you have no issues that require contacting the seller.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for my Harley Quinn cosplay. The base wig isn&#x27;t as long as shown in the picture, however. I&#x27;ve worn this wig twenty times or so and it&#x27;s still just as beautiful as the day I got it with minimal upkeep.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my Harley Quinn cosplay for halloween and possibly a comic con. This was my first time buying a wig. I gave this product 4 starts because the color is a bit different than the picture, more like a honey color. But i still am very happy with it! It arrived right on time, and the pigtail clips stay in place very well. The photos i took were taken in a bathroom, no filters. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s so soft and fluffy and perfect for my Harley Quinn cosplay!!! It also works perfectly for my Lolita fashion!</li>
    <li> VERY happy!  Fits great.  Can&#x27;t wait for the costume party now!  (And maybe Comic Con to!)</li>
    <li> love it.. I&#x27;ve never worn a wig before but I loved this one. the photo attached is me with the wig</li>
    <li> This is a great wig and I would recommend it to those who need something like this. It&#x27;s the best buy at such an outstanding price. The wig feels very soft and has a very realistic color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are, however, a few issues. The first thing I noticed was that it was a little darker than I expected. That isn&#x27;t the end of the world. The second was that the base wig is smaller than any I have ever worn. If you have a big head or long hair, proceed with caution. There has also been a bit of shedding, but I understand that a small amount isn&#x27;t a big deal in some of these cheaper wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is going to be great for what I wanted it for and I&#x27;m happy with it. There are just a few things that I wish were a bit better.</li>
    <li> I just got this wig today (almost 2 weeks earlier than expected) for my Harley Quinn costume. I absolutely love it! I think it looks better than the picture. So soft and natural looking. With or without the pigtails it&#x27;s absolutely adorable. Great quality and adjustable on the inside of the wig. Definitely can&#x27;t beat the price and so much better than any wig I&#x27;ve ever bought from a costume store. Definitely recommend. Try ordering at least 2-3 weeks before you actually need the wig since its shipping from China.</li>
    <li> I really love it! It&#x27;s soft, and so pretty. Th email highlights are really natural, and the clips are thick!. Yay! Can&#x27;t wait to try it out for my cosplay.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice quality but what they sent me was 4 ponytail clips instead of the wig with 2 ponytail clips...</li>
    <li> i am very pleased with the wig, it fits perfectly i have no complaints</li>
    <li> I always get a little apprehensive when ordering cheaply prices wigs online, and I have to say, this wig did not disappoint for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself fits very nicely and the fibers feel soft and lay rather well.&lt;br /&gt;However, there are a few small draw backs. The wig appears a bit fried near the clips and the cap. It&#x27;s not really noticable, so it won&#x27;t be an issue. Secondly,  the color was a little bit more buttercup than anticipated, so be aware of that if color is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend this product,  eespecially if you are cosplaying on a budget.</li>
    <li> The packaging came with the base wig but with no ponytail clips!!! what a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> The pigtails are super cute and detachable which allows for different looks.  The wig is super soft and realistic looking.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in love with this and looks super cute in it.</li>
    <li> The wig I received looked nothing like this and was missing the pigtails.</li>
</ol>
