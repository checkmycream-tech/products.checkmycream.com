      <li>Beside experiencing more breakouts, I dont see a difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>really nice product I enjoy using this product a lot ...</li>
      <li>But this one is better than all the others I use for moisturizing my face.</li>
      <li>This Radha Skin Clearing &amp; Anti Aging Serum is what I rely on most.</li>
      <li>(I received one bottle free in order to test and provide my honest feedback/review.)</li>
      <li>Also, make sure your using sunscreen with this because it has retinol + vitamin C in it.</li>
      <li>The serum does not contain fillers or harmful fragrances, dyes or parabens which is why I love</li>
      <li>But this serum is great, it reduces the redness in my face and totally stops any kind of premature aging.</li>

      <li>It has a nice clean fragrance, and light in consistency.  </li>
      <li>So far im happy with my results</li>
      <li>My face looks and feels smoother and more even, this serum is full of healthy ingredients, no pore clogging parabens or harmful chemicals.</li>
      <li>I would honestly do more research and wait for credible reviews.</li>
      <li>First of all, you honestly don&#x27;t need to use more than a couple of pumps of product for your face, neck and chest.</li>
      <li>Received first order in exchange for an honest review :)</li>
      <li>and she said it smells like strong basil so please keep this is mind.</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful mix of ingredients that fit well with their other products that I have been using.</li>
      <li>It cleared up my acne prone skin and soften any fine lines I had.</li>
      <li>in mind, however, that my skin is incredibly oily, and it takes A LOT for my skin to dry out.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think globbing on a huge amount will give you the results you want more quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>and I liked, they really works.</li>
      <li>was sent this for free to review and my opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;https://jaaysreviews.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/skin-care-routine/</li>
      <li>Now I read them and realized everyone who wrote a raving review was given the product for free</li>
      <li>/&gt;*Serum received for free in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>I had to promise nothing in return however and my review is genuine.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for making such great quality products at affordable prices!!!</li>
      <li>In full disclosure I was given this product as a free promotion.</li>
      <li>After about 2 weeks use, my skin is much clearer, the pores have shrunken, fine lines have smoothed out, and my skin looks a bit more plump and taut.</li>
      <li>Hoping I will get the right one this time!</li>
      <li>Love this product it makes my skin looking very youthful .</li>
      <li>This serum is so light and easily absorbed by the skin.  </li>
      <li>I have never seen such good results from a product before.</li>
      <li>And most of them written within days of each other or on the same day, lol!</li>
      <li>This is a great serum to layer under other moisturizers or retinol products.</li>
      <li>The first couple of weeks it was fine.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! My face looks bright, tight and just glowing after just using this Serum for just a few weeks. Recommended for anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> First of all -- I didn&#x27;t realize it was made in Berkeley, CA. As a SF Bay Area native - there are a couple of places you know you are going to get true natural or organics stuff. Berkeley, CA is one of them. Why isnt this being sold in Whole Foods yet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a nurse who specialty in wounds, I can tell you that Vit C helps with cell-regeneration and I have been looking for products with it. I&#x27;m so glad I found something that includes everything I am looking for in a product without using 5 different products. I am now looking into getting eye-gel from Radha</li>
    <li> I have to admit that i was a little hesitant to try this product as I have sensitive skin, but this worked great for me. I use it overnight and the next morning my skin feels tight but not dry and any blemishes are gone.  I was given this product to try it and write a review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love these products, but I bought this item twice and twice I got the wrong product. The box was for the skin clearing serum, but the bottle inside was the plain vitamin C serum. I compaired the ingredients lists from the box and bottle to be sure, and it was indeed the wrong product. After returning both, I placed an order directly with the company. Hoping I will get the right one this time!</li>
    <li> I honestly just got this product and am currently using it to see its effect. I unfortunately went by only its star reviews without reading them. Now I read them and realized everyone who wrote a raving review was given the product for free...like come on. Not even one unbiased one? I truly hope this works or else I&#x27;ll be back to write even more!!!!</li>
    <li> I wrote an review of this product over on my blog. I think it so great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://alisvolatpropriss.com/2015/04/23/radha-beauty-skin-clearing-serum-review/</li>
    <li> I could never open the coupon that was sent to me for this product, when I tried ordering the product and using the coupon, it would not open for me, so sadly I can not rate this product, although, I love the previous products that I did get, the essential oil and the retinol cream.  I would love to try the vitamin C product if you send me a coupon, but till then I can not rate this product.  Thank you so much for making such great quality products at affordable prices!!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time first of all. It is just day 2 but I am beginning to see changes.  I had a lot of scarring from a breakout and this is helping me a great deal.  It is not greasy and it is not irritating my skin.  Will post more at the end of the week</li>
    <li> I love this stuff its amazing i suggest you try it out!</li>
    <li> Good Product &amp; Good Price, Fast Shipping~&lt;br /&gt;Quite Recommendable!</li>
    <li> I usually buy the skin clearing serum and it works great. I received it yesterday and when I opened the box it&#x27;s a vitamin C serum instead of the skin clearing serum. As you can see in the picture the ingredients differ and the bottle looks different than when I received it last time. I&#x27;m not sure how a different product ended up in the box. I would like to get the item replaced but they are just offering a refund if I ship it back.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I have been using it for about a month and I&#x27;m seeing great results! Used along with derma roller and got even better results! It soaks into the skin quickly and works very well. The texture is a milky consistency and it smells alot like tea tree oil(which it does have in it). Will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Even in my early 40s, I suffer from occasional acne, especially during a certain time of the month. I was actively looking for something to help with both acne and aging for the longest time -- and now I&#x27;ve found it. Usually, if I treat pimples, my skin gets dry and looks like I&#x27;m getting more wrinkles; if I treat for aging, some anti-aging products made my skin greasy and I would break out. This Radha Skin Clearing &amp; Anti Aging Serum is what I rely on most. (I received one bottle free in order to test and provide my honest feedback/review.)</li>
    <li> I used it for a few weeks.  The first couple of weeks it was fine.  Then I started noticing a stinging feeling when I put it on.  It would go away when I used a moisturizer with it.  I will use it up but just in short bursts.  Don&#x27;t think it does it for everyone based on the reviews I saw.  Can&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It helps clear rapidly &amp; fades older acne scars. It did bring some gunk to the surface the 1st week I used but that means it&#x27;s working. Cleared up after a about a week.  Redness faded fast. I will be trying more products from this company.</li>
    <li> This has made my skin feel like it never has before! I am very impressed with the results I have had from this product.</li>
    <li> At first I thought ok it works but 4 days later towards my chin area and my lips it started burning and my skin my starting to feel like rough skin even though I would moisturizer so I stopped using it</li>
    <li> I really thinks that this product will help me. I like the reviews and would love to try it out. Please.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Wrong product was delivered in the box. It was vitamin C Serum. This looks like a widespread issue.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me idk I just used it a couple days it broke me out and has a bad smell but all skin is different I have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Just finished using one bottle of this and noticed lightening of my sun spots and acne scars. Didn&#x27;t take care of my acne but I am going to keep using this. I am now using this on my shoulder and back where I have acne scars and it is definitely getting lighter. Ordering another one soon!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this skin clearing serum for a couple of weeks now and I am seriously loving it! I will make sure to always have this one on hand. This serum is so amazing because it helps with any breakouts I may have while reducing my pores and smoothing fine lines. Products I have used in the past always irritated my skin but this serum doesn&#x27;t at all and I use it everyday. My daughter also loves this for her bad breakouts! I have to keep two on hand, one for each of us now.  Received first order in exchange for an honest review :)</li>
    <li> I love the earthy scent of this serum. It does go away once is soaks into your skin leaving it silky smooth! It has a wonderful mix of ingredients that fit well with their other products that I have been using. I do see a reduction in my wrinkles and highly recommend Radha Beauty Products. I was sent this product to try out and give an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Oh last time I ordered one and I liked it and then I just ordered one and its not the same I don&#x27;t know what is going on with the product</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product that saving your adult acne, here it is! Love it!! I used it only for those acne when I got this product, then it just works so well that I am using it for my entire face now, every day and night.</li>
    <li> Nice product! Use a moisturizer with application.</li>
    <li> Radha Beauty Skin Clearing Serum has been my saving grace through this last month. With all the moving, bad food choices, traveling, illness, and teething, the stress was getting to my skin in a bad bad way. I was breaking out way worse than I had in years and my regular cleanser and moisturizer weren&#x27;t doing anything to help. I needed something that was powerful enough to combat some crazy acne, but wouldn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin. I found this serum from Radha almost two weeks ago and since then has worked wonders! Honestly, after a little less than a week I started noticing my acne fading and my skin has only been improving since then. This amazing all natural formula doesn&#x27;t contain any dyes, parabens or fillers and combines Vitamin C, Retinol, botanical hyaluronic acid, salicylic acid and Niacinamide to powerfully but gently fight breakouts. I put it on every morning and night after washing my face and it absorbs into my skin fast without leaving any weird residue or burning feeling. If you need skin clearing help, run to Amazon and pick this up. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I received the right box with the wrong product both of the times I&#x27;ve ordered it. I received a vitamin C serum with nothing else in it like retinol, salicylic acid, niacinamide etc. I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t doing anything for my skin after several weeks of use and read the bottle and discovered that it wasn&#x27;t the same product that was listed on the box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 35 and never considered needing an age-defying product. But for the last week I have been using the Radha Skin Clearing Serum along with my normal skin care routine which includes a derma roller. Until now I have considered my current products harsh, assuming they are for the most benefit. With my sometimes sensitive skin my face is often left looking red and flaky. The serum does not contain fillers or harmful fragrances, dyes or parabens which is why I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since adding this additional step my face hasn&#x27;t felt as tight and I&#x27;ve noticed a softness I hadn&#x27;t in years. I can only imagine the difference moving forward. And the best part is that the serum is cruelty free and manufactured in a State of the Art FDA Approved facility in the US!</li>
    <li> Dont waste your time on this makes skin breakout smh</li>
    <li> really nice product I enjoy using this product a lot ... read my product review here http://fortheloveto.com/?p&#x3D;25</li>
    <li> Beside experiencing more breakouts, I dont see a difference in my skin. I have lost all hope for my skin every clearing up. I have wasted too much time, energy and money on skincare products with no positive results.</li>
    <li> Really like this cleaner. I received a code to test it out and am so happy to do it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how it feels in my face when I  apply it! It&#x27;s not super oily and I can feel that my skin is firmer after using it for over a week. Also, I did get this product for free as a target, but I&#x27;m planning on ordering it again once I run out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just begin using Radha Beauty Products and I liked, they really works.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for results that are visible though I like the gentleness of the cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is a great standalone product, or it can be used in conjunction with a moisturizer. It&#x27;s non-drying, and not irritating and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant, perfumey or medicinal smell like some acne products do. I noticed a reduction in scarring and an improvement in skin texture within one week. Keep in mind that this product is thin and watery, so be sure to dispense into the palm of your hand to avoid wasting any. I only use one or two pumps morning and evening. If you have sensitive skin, this product might sting slightly when you first start using it. I noticed that initially, but the reaction went away after the second day using it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I was actually sent this in error(I had ordered something else), and instead of returning it, I decided to try it. I had told them that the wrong product was sent, and they let me keep this one for free and sent me what I had originally ordered. I used it at night and when I woke up that next morning, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much brighter and clearer my skin was! I am a big Radha fan as I also use their Vitamin C and eye cream. Their customer service is A++ also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m suspicious of all these rave reviews.  Why are so many of these rave reviews recently written in March and April of 2015?  And most of them written within days of each other or on the same day, lol! I find it unrealistic and incredible .  They also sound like they&#x27;re written by the same people.  I have never heard of this brand.  I would honestly do more research and wait for credible reviews.</li>
    <li> Its been a couple of days and i love this already, it makes my skin feel so good. My face doesnt itch and i havent broken out 😀 . This and the retinol moisturizer are my favorite</li>
    <li> The cap was broken. I have open the broken cap and transferred to another bottle. After I used it, my face start to develop small acnes. Moreover, the smell is terrible.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet. But I think it should be alright.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving this product!  It has a nice clean fragrance, and light in consistency.  The packaging is also very modern and sleek, however with the nature of this serum, its a little hard to get it on your fingertip, I feel a different pump style would work better, which is why I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skin Clearing Serum, along with the Retinol Moisturizer by Radha, has really helped transform my skin!  My complection is evening out, not as many blemishes, and not as oily.  It doesn&#x27;t dry our your skin badly like other products with Salicylic Acid have done for me in the past.  It absorbs quickly, and once in awhile after application, I feel a little tingly sensation...to me, that means its working its magic (doesn&#x27;t burn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy once my trial product is gone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to review several products from Radha Beauty. This company is one of my favorite skincare brands &amp; I have come to trust their products. This time I received their Professional Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum.&lt;br /&gt;When you get any skincare product, the first thing that you notice is the packaging. I love the Radha Beauty packaging in the sleek silver &amp; black pump container. Then I check out the ingredients list to see what I&#x27;m putting on my skin. It contains 20% Vitamin C, 2.5% Retinol, 5% Hyaluronic Acid, 2% Salicylic Acid, 3.5% Niacinamide as well as Arganic Aloe Vera, Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, Tea Tree Essential Oil, Lavender Essential Oil &amp; Ylang Ylang Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;This is a serum so it pumps out as a fairly thin liquid. It has an herbal scent which must be from all of the wonderful essential oils &amp; has an underlying floral fragrance. I have somewhat sensitive skin but did not experience any redness or irritation from using this serum. I also have combination skin so I was a bit leery to use it on my oily T-zone, but when I did I discovered that it absorbed nicely just as it did on the other parts of my face. This serum leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; smooth. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see drastic results yet, but I feel that my skin tone is better. I did use it when I expected my monthly skin breakout &amp; it cleared nicely. I&#x27;ve been using it at least once each day &amp; will continue.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong product! I got the 1 oz vitamin C serum it came in the skin clearing serum box. What happened? Don&#x27;t think I would deal with Radha Beauty again unless I received my Skin clearing serum</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It cleared up my acne prone skin and soften any fine lines I had. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is the ultimate face serum! I have never seen such good results from a product before. My complexion is becoming more uniform and my acne scarring is seriously almost gone. I am in love with this serum and hooked. This is the best, seriously look no further. The only drawback is it smells like sweet basil SO bad. I hate the smell, its VERY HERBACEOUS and slightly peppery smelling - I say this because I didn&#x27;t think it was noticeable but I walked past my coworker recently and she quickly asked my why I smell like spaghetti &amp; meatballs and at my dismay I realized it was from this serum. I asked her specifically what scent triggered that question and she said it smells like strong basil so please keep this is mind. But this serum is great, it reduces the redness in my face and totally stops any kind of premature aging. Also, make sure your using sunscreen with this because it has retinol + vitamin C in it. Oh did I mention it stops acne? It&#x27;s amazing. I rub this into my breakouts and they go away faster and they don&#x27;t scar. Anyway its great I would recommend this for any skin type, age or condition!</li>
    <li> This is a great serum to layer under other moisturizers or retinol products. It is also really great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful addition to the Radha beauty line.  This serum is so light and easily absorbed by the skin.  It, along with the moisturizer and vitamin C is now a permanent part of my skin care.  I love this line of products, and highly recommend using it for any skin problems.  I also use on my hands to keep them from looking so old.  I received a coupon for this, but even without the coupon I would add it to the Radha products I use.</li>
    <li> I receive compliments constantly about how radiate and youthful looking  my skin is.  Thanks to Vitamin c.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have a feeling these reviews are fake. A friend bought it for herself and it broke her out!</li>
    <li> This is serum is great! I had a huge pimple and when I applied this, it went away that same week. This is seriously a great serum! I highly recommend this if you are looking for something to help you clear up your face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for free to review and my opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;https://jaaysreviews.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/skin-care-routine/</li>
    <li> This works very great! Only use once a day so your face doesnt peel really bad and get red.. noticed relief within the next day!highly recommend this with a combination of the aztec secret indian healing clay.</li>
    <li> Love this product it makes my skin looking very youthful . It evened out my tone</li>
    <li> Got a vitamin C not the one I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Oh I love this clearing and anti aging serum!  My skin is so even now compared to all the dark spots I had.  It is also wrinkle free!  I use this twice a day before I use my moisturizer.  I highly recommend this serum and all of Radha Beauty Products!  *I received this product for my honest and unbiased review*</li>
    <li> i love it.... it seems to work just like it says i will probably be ordering more of it when i can</li>
    <li> My skin looks dramatically better after using this product. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this product. Instead I received the vitamin c serum.  I do use that product already and wanted to try something new.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and I&#x27;m living it!!! There has been a noticeable improvement in my skin!!</li>
    <li> First off, I see a lot of people who reviewed this product got it for free. I did not. I guess I am one of the only people who had to pay? I personally wondered if the reviews I read were fake or real? If they are fake, they didn&#x27;t need to do that because this is actually a good product. I&#x27;ve been using this serum every other day for the past 3 months. I do not have really bad acne to begin with, but I do get occasional breakouts. This has definitely helped improve my skin. On the days I don&#x27;t use this, I use the Radha Vitamin C Serum/Retinol Cream. This &amp;#34;every other day&amp;#34; combination seems to work nicely on my skin. I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement on my fine lines on my forehead also. These products don&#x27;t work overnight to magically get rid of wrinkles, but with time I think they are one of the best &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; products out there. I would purchase this again, although it would be nice if I could actually be one of the people who got it for free ;-P</li>
    <li> Suffering from acne scars, I&#x27;ve looked and looked for solutions to help with the dark marks and post acne marks that have riddled me for over a decade. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Clearasil, proactive, and even antibiotics for a short time. But, after taking this, my hope has been restored. I&#x27;ve suffered from cystic acne as an adult, and I thought I could help myself by minimizing the marks, but after over a a half a month I&#x27;m beyond impressed. (Keep in mind that I&#x27;m a guy, so hormonal acne might be a little bit different).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cystic acne had almost stopped completely, with only a few appearing here and there on my face, and the overall texture has improved tenfold. The acne scars are less visible and the marks, while not gone yet, are simply fading. I could attribute this to using this twice daily along with an exfoliate in the shower. While I can feel it on my face, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable, and in fact it feels like it&#x27;s actually &amp;#34;doing&amp;#34; something to my skin, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, however, that my skin is incredibly oily, and it takes A LOT for my skin to dry out. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this with an exfoliate, unless your skin is really oily. A simple clean with soap and water, followed by this product, would probably show results. And don&#x27;t use a lot, because a pea sized portion is all you need. Don&#x27;t think globbing on a huge amount will give you the results you want more quickly. Retinol doesn&#x27;t work that way. A pea sized portion is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to complain, I would say that the dispensing portion of the product is very unsanitary. If your finger wipes across the dispenser nose, it can introduce bacteria inside the bottle, or at least at the tip. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving this product a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend a retinol based formula to anyone suffering from any kind of acne. It&#x27;s a miracle cure.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-50&#x27;s and battle my skin issues daily.  Recently I had noticed my usual products were workng. I found Radha Beauty Products, and couldn&#x27;t resist trying it.  First of all, you honestly don&#x27;t need to use more than a couple of pumps of product for your face, neck and chest. It glides right on, and dries quickly.  I let it sink in for approximately 30 minutes, then add a moisturizer and go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the products, you will notice that it is packed full of active ingredients that have been proven to help skin repair it&#x27;s natural structure, without the use of fillers and nasty chemicals. After about 2 weeks use, my skin is much clearer, the pores have shrunken, fine lines have smoothed out, and my skin looks a bit more plump and taut. Honestly, I look better to my worst critic, ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 5 for packaging, its scientifically backed active ingredients, no &amp;#34;nasties&amp;#34; included, and the most important part, a 5+ for early results and no irritation.  I am going to continue using this in my regimen.</li>
    <li> This serum is AMAZING! I have been having my 16 year old son, who has acne scarring on his cheeks.  He has tried everything to get rid of the acne and scars with no results. After using this product for 4 days the acne has gone away and now the scarring is lightning. He is so happy and so am I. We got a coupon to try this and give our honest review and what a gift it has been. I will be buying this for him to continue use when this bottle is out.</li>
    <li> i can see a differance in my skin already</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!! I wanted to wait until I used this for a bit before writing my review so I could report on how clearing it is. Although I am just about 40, acne has become an issue for me in the past few years. Truly annoying and truly hard to treat. As with most things that promise to help clear your skin, things get worse before better. Knowing this I hung in there. It is not had to do because it is the best smelling product ever! I am not kidding! I wish they made a body wash and lotion with this scent. It smells like a spa! After things starting popping out, things are really clearing up! I am amazed that even some stubborn acne scarring I have is disappearing! (Confession - I pick at my face. AND, yes, I know that is horrible). In full disclosure I was given this product as a free promotion. I had to promise nothing in return however and my review is genuine. Even though there was no cost associated with this bottle I will gladly buy it again. I have been using this in the am and pm before I use Radha&#x27;s Retinol Moisturizer. Great deut! I have had no annoying drying and peeling, and I think a lot has to do with the high quality of their Moisturizer. I don&#x27;t recommend things that I do not believe in. Trust me, this is a must add to your skin care regime!</li>
    <li> You can actually feel the skin tighten shortly after applied!</li>
    <li> This serum has a relaxing and gentle scent, the lotion is thin so it soaks quickly into your face. I use this with the Radha moisturizer, and have not had a problem with breakouts or greasy skin. My face looks and feels smoother and more even, this serum is full of healthy ingredients, no pore clogging parabens or harmful chemicals. I try not to use any chemicals on my face, but most products have high alcohol content and can be extremely drying to your skin, this serum is refreshing. I am happy to include it as part of my skin care regime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Serum received for free in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This product is hydrating. I have a very sensitive skin and i have to use salicylic for my face and all the others that use are very drying. But this one is better than all the others I use for moisturizing my face.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! from the packaging, to the texture, consistency and overall quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it at night time for the past few nights now and when I wake up in the morning my skin just feels so plump and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary to test and review, and I must say I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like Radha beauty Products- they&#x27;re natural products that done irritate my skin-I have combination skin so im always looking for best skincare solutions-Ive been using Radha&#x27;s rose hip oil as a moisturizer but i wanted more to help reverse the sun damage-this serum gives me the benefits I need without the harshness of chemicals, and with just a few drops(2 pumps covers my entire face and neck)Also this particular serum has a very earthy scent- So far im happy with my results but ive only started using a week ago</li>
    <li> Wow is my first thought.  Then miracle in a bottle for skin clearing.  I had a stubborn ache scare that would not disappear after a couple of applications it has started to shrink .  yes I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
