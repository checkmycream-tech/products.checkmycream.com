    <li> This lotion is amazing! This is my third bottle. I turned 50 this  year and this lotion has helped firm and tighted. Three kids, stretch marks, weight loss, sun damage...noticeable improvement in a couple of weeks. My sister and her husband are believes.</li>
    <li> love this product and at the price offered it&#x27;s a great deal. -1 star rating because one of the two bottles was open and the pump top was cracked on arrival...there was very little loss but still.</li>
    <li> Great price... great product!</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing skin and firming over small wrinkles and imperfections in the skin. Plastic bottle with pump. Instantly sinks in, especially after shower. You can instantly feel it Absorb into the skin. Pleasant fragrance. Well worth the money. Not as expensive as other moisturizers.no artificial fragrances. 100% vegetarian ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Make your skin feel silky and very hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the ingredient list is not displayed on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what is printed on the box.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Organic Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower (1), Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower (1), Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Leaf (2) and Organic Arnica Montana Flower (3) Extracts (Aqueous), Glyceryl Stearate Se, Vegetable Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Sorbitol, Sorbitan Stearate, Algae Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ubiquinone (Coq10), Organic Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (2), Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polysorbate 20, Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola) and Echinacea Purpurea Extracts, Sodium Carbomer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chlorella Vulgaris (Algae) Extract, Biosaccharide Gum, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond), Rosa Canina (Rose Hip) Seed and Borago Officinalis (Borage) Oils, Organic Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (2) and Other Essential Oils.</li>
    <li> Really nice body lotion.  I like the CoQ10 inclusion, it&#x27;s supposed to be very good for keep the skin smooth and supple.</li>
    <li> We like the product - husband uses it also.  Will need to have used the lotion for at least a year to give a more thorough review.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. I am 66, my skin was beginning to bruise and tear. Much better now, unless I really bang myself.</li>
    <li> Avalon&#x27;s Ultimate Firming body Lotion is one of my favorites &amp; I&#x27;ve purchased dozens of bottles at health food stores.  This supplier sends a 2-pk that is far cheaper than instore retail, so I&#x27;ve been ordering online for the past few months.  The products always arrive very quickly &amp; are well packaged.  Very pleased - would recommend.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for even a month yet, so not sure, but the lotion feels nice. Lets see if it will take care of some wrinkles !!</li>
    <li> Somebody recommended this lotion to my wife for itchy skin. We decided to try it &amp; she found good results with it. She is having me order more. It was well package &amp; we received it it good time.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with thin, easily-bruised skin for 18 months, and since starting use of this product, my arms are almost clear! I&#x27;m not ashamed to wear short sleeves.</li>
    <li> June 2017 updated&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed that they changed the product!  The fragrance is a heavy sickening odor.  The label states roses but it is very nauseating.  Unfortunately they took a great product and ruined it; no longer a customer.&lt;br /&gt;March 2014&lt;br /&gt;This is not one of those hand lotions that stays on your hands for hours and makes your skin feel like velvet.  At first I was not sure if it even had any benefits.  So I began using it on my hands &amp; arms every night just before bedtime.  The scent reminds me of patchouli and the scent is pleasant at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I realized that my hands and arms had a nice subtle change in texture.  My elbows are not as dry and my skin feels softer.  Still does not last if used during the day time, but will continue use at bedtime.</li>
    <li> I have very very dry skin and have looked for years to find a lotion that is nourishing, hydrating and smells nice all at the same time. Finally!!! Avalon Organics is the first and only lotion that does all three and more!</li>
    <li> When in my late 50s I lost weight and discovered that the skin under my arms looked like crepe paper - HORRORS!!!  Found this lotion at local health &amp; beauty store. Tried it because I had read that CoQ10 was a firming agent. Did a test using it only on one side of my body. In weeks I saw results of smoother and firmer looking skin on the side with this lotion. Of course I then applied it to the other arm!&lt;br /&gt;That was almost 6 years ago. These results appear to be permanent because when the lotion ran out the skin stayed smooth. It is not magic - it did not make my skin super tight - but it did get rid of the crepe-look and those results were lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Have just purchased this product again to use on my neck, chest, and legs because they are beginning to get that crepe-like appearance. I am now almost 65. My interest is to look the best I can at my age, not drastically alter my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells good, too!</li>
    <li> Great as just a lotion but after 2 bottles no firming noted.</li>
    <li> I decided to try another product with the coQ10 ingredient. I normally use the Nivea. At first I thought the fragrance was interesting, but the smell doesn&#x27;t go away and it really does smell like water-based lubricant is all over your body.  I just wanted to wash it off. I&#x27;ve gone back to the Nivea and very happy.</li>
    <li> At the age where the slightest bump to the hand or forearm seems to leave a bruise or worse, bleed.  I think using this product daily really does help.  Recently introduced two new dogs to my household and I was starting to look pretty beat up!!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> excellent received promptly</li>
    <li> I am 57. I have thin skin such that if I accidentally scratch my arm, it bleeds under the skin like a much older person. I tried this product (with a yellow label and purple lettering) despite the fact that some reviews reported that it had an unfavorable smell. I have had no bleeding under the skin since I started using it and I found the fragrance to be acceptable. Thus, I was impressed. I purchased a new order. The bottle came and it looked different. It had a lime green color, rather than a yellow color. I am horrified by the smell. It smells like dirty laundry. I don&#x27;t know what to do since the previous lotion really helped. Presently I am using it, but both my cat and I gag. I&#x27;m not sure what I am going to do next. I&#x27;ve found an oral substitute. Maybe I&#x27;ll try it after some research?</li>
    <li> Avalon Organics makes wonderful firming lotion with CoQ10 as an added bonus.  It&#x27;s a light lotion with all healthy ingredients so I feel good about using it.  It keeps my whole body soft and moisturized.  It soaks right into your skin so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re covered in petroleum or oil!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, but the local organic store that I usually purchase it from is always running out.  The pack of 2, listed here is a bargain!  With Amazon Prime, I received my order in two days from the day I ordered.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 1 month and do not see any difference at all. It feels good on my skin but it has not reduced the creepynes or made it any softer. To much to pay for so little results.</li>
    <li> My legs is getting itchy and my skin color is getting reddish when I start using this product on second days.&lt;br /&gt;I stop using this product on third day, my skin is still reddish and itchy on 4th day.&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive skin, but I never have a trouble like this with the organic and also over $10&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Update: This is not even the same product anymore. Most of the ingredients have changed and it does not do the same. THIS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED to be advertised using all these reviews for a completely different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps my nails stay strong and grow like weeds. Good for skin, and smoothing my hair. Can&#x27;t live without this stuff because nothing I know of does all that.</li>
