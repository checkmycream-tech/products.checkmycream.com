      <li>If you like a richer, more spicy cologne then this is for you.  </li>
      <li>It is very subtly sexy, not overpowering at all.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a discontinued product that my wife loves. I found it here and she is going to absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Obsession Night is a wonderful scent - I love it almost as much as the original!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It is light and not overpowering and I have received several comments on how great it smells.</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter who always nags me for Calvin Klein and and I oblige !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she reciprcates with Klein for men. Nice product. Would definetly recommend. Im always tempted to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try another product but always fall back to these products.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with the order, the item came very fast, was in an original package and brand new! I love this perfume so I was more than excited to see everything worked out well! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. My wife loves this and I equally love it on her!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Obsession for over twenty years, and decided to try this one for something different.  First, let me say if you are a fan of the original, don&#x27;t expect this to be the same.  It was described to me as a \\&quot;stronger version\\&quot; of the original Obsession, and that&#x27;s what I expected.  However, the two scents are completely different.  The original Obsession is a softer, sexy &amp; mysterious scent....and this one is a lot stronger, but still manages to be sexy at the same time. The scent definitely lasts longer, and is very strong when initially putting it on. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it, but after it&#x27;s on awhile, it&#x27;s as if the scent changes a bit and I actually liked it.  I know some say it&#x27;s for night, but I found if you want to wear it during the day, just spray and step into the mist and it isn&#x27;t as strong.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments when I wear it, so that&#x27;s a plus as well!!</li>
    <li> Great Buy Product as described!</li>
    <li> I BUY THIS PERFUME 100 ML OF MY HOUSE AND I GET ME ONE OF 7 ML. MEETING THAT CHEATED ME AND I SHOULD SEND THE FRAGRANCE OF 100 ML 4 MY HOUSE WITHOUT CHARGE CHILE AGAIN .. I DEMAND A SOLUTION, BEFORE TAKING ACTION LEGALES.CHAO</li>
    <li> If you like a richer, more spicy cologne then this is for you.  I wore it one day this summer, but would reccommend Fall or Winter use.  That being said, I do love the aroma and feeling I get when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for her birthday.  This was the best price that I found and she was very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> just love it. love the scent</li>
    <li> Had to try Night Obsession since I really love the fragrance of Sheer Obsession. It is ok but can&#x27;t beat the Sheer&#x27;s light fragrant smell. The top cap of the Night Obsession had a sticky substance covered all over it and took about 15 minutes to clean if off with Goo Gone product. The box it was in did not have the sticky glue on it. Strange the cap was just sticky, like someone put it in the box dried before boxing it. Was very disappointed with this surprise situation when lifting it out of the box. Hope it doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same quality product you can get everywhere but the price is unbeatable! If you like to shop around you won&#x27;t find a better price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different perfumes over the years without success. Citrus and floral scents don&#x27;t work for me. And I&#x27;m not a sporty girl or a girly-girl. I longed for something that had more mystery to it. I&#x27;m a writer and a lover of nature. I like earthier smells and it&#x27;s hard to find something like that with a balance of classiness. Some musks worked okay, but it wasn&#x27;t until I found Obsession Night that I found THE scent for me. I get compliments when I wear it. My husband loves it. I think, as long as you don&#x27;t spray on a lot, it is just as good to wear during the day as it is in the evening. I use it Fall through Winter and switch over to Arbonne Jasmine during the Spring and Summer. Obsession Night seems to compliment well with Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani, my husband&#x27;s cologne. Both have hints of jasmine. I gave it 4 stars only because I have never purchased it from Amazon. I only purchase perfume from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It is same packing and the same bottle, but the perfume is imitation. It does not have the same color, it is yellow instead of transparency, and it does not have the same aroma. That cost me very expensive for imitation. 65$ with the shipping, and I can&#x27;t use it. Excuse my English i&#x27;m french.</li>
    <li> this perfume is awesome!! very sophisticated and subtle...I love it my mom loves it and everyone thta smells it loves it</li>
    <li> My wife asked for this so I purchased it for her for Christmas gift. Good smelling perfume that we both like.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the notes and appreciate the scent. I would love to wear this more often, but I can&#x27;t. The combination of jasmine and gardenia is overwhelming to my palate, although I love it&#x27;s masculine edge. The white florals are head-ache inducing on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CK OB is unwearable in warm weather, and nearly unwearable on cool nights. Love it on paper, just not on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do sample before you buy.</li>
    <li> Something I wear everyday, it is my favorite CK scent. Not too flowery, sweet, or overpowering. Produces a soft clean smell.</li>
    <li> I love this smell, sad they don&#x27;t make it anymore</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I love it when my wife wears it.  Lovely scent without being too overpowerful either.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. It has such a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved and used this fragrance for so long. I was a little hesitant about buying here when I read a comment about this being a fake but I took my chance and it totally paid off!!! Woody, floral as ever it was! And it lasts all day long and some. I sprayed a blouse and left it intentionally for a couple of days after wearing just to test the authenticity- I only remembered to check after about a week and when I checked, the blouse still had the scent of the perfume!</li>
    <li> Too light and sweet. I thought it would be spicy.</li>
    <li> THANKS FOR EVERYTH&#x27;NG.IT &#x27;S A GOOD G&#x27;FT FOR MY W&#x27;FE.&#x27;T SMELLS SO GOOD.AND SOME OF MY FR&#x27;ENDS GAVE ORDERS ABOUT TH&#x27;S PARFUM.</li>
    <li> I personally think it&#x27;s too strong.  Nice combination of fragrances but still too overpowering for me, even for my boyfriend.  Definitely a formal, night fragrance.</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN GIVE OBSESSION NIGHT A BAD REVIEW. OH WELL EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN OPINION. PERSONALLY, I LOVE THE SCENT OF THIS PARFUM, IT SMELLS SO SEXY AND SEDUCTIVE. IT IS WEARABLE DAY OR NIGHT. THE SMELL IS DEFINITELY NOT OVERWHELMING....IT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. ALSO, THE BOTTLE AND COLOR OF THE PARFUM ITSELF IS APPEALING AND BEAUTIFUL TOO.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I am so upset that they are not selling it anymore except online.</li>
    <li> The bottle shape is cool and nice to smell.&lt;br /&gt;Gifted to my mother..SHe liked it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it so much.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing to hug her in night...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I love this. I feel SEXY in it! It&#x27;s spicy, and sassy. This is the only perfume I ever deemed worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why this is $10 cheaper than Euphoria????  Maybe the essential oils, I don&#x27;t know but the scent to this is absolutly splendid!  It is very comparable (strength, beauty etc)  to Euphoria but not to be confused with smelling anything like it though.  They are both very alluring in scent and very nice after drydown too.  Wow!!!!  I just love this soooooo much!  Its a little like Midnight Poison by Christian Dior but softer and sweeter or a little like Eiteannes Aiger&#x27;s Black,  it smells like a spice cabinet.  Im not sure everyone will agree with me because no two people see things the same and someone will say: \\&quot;What are you talking about, I don&#x27;t smell that!\\&quot;.  I just gave you the very best I can offer in what I percieve so you will have a better understanding of what it smells like.  I hope I helped a little bit.  This is well worth the $40 though.  Happy perfume hunting.</li>
    <li> This is a very sexy fragrance and should sway anyone special to want to hold and hang on to you in a loving way.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my wife. She is pleased with the perfume. A pleasant and long lasting fragrance. Amazon has the best price on this perfume. Win Win !!</li>
    <li> I took a chance I would like this product based on experience with the original Obsession. I loved this fragrance. Prompt shipping too!</li>
    <li> I use to wear this in the early 2000 and then I stop see it.  So when I saw it here on amazon I had to have it.  Everytime I wear this someone ask me what are you wearing it smells so so good.  People would hug me to smell this sent.  I had to give a bottle away because the person love the way it smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Not sure about this one, its kind of musky, a little spicey,  hum, a fine line between a men&#x27;s cologne and a woman&#x27;s perfume! every time I try to wear it (at home)I cant deal with the fact that it smells more like a mans cologne on me, I would say this one is unisex!</li>
    <li> I had never even noticed this in a store prior to finding it here, so I had no idea how it actually smelled.  The description sounded nice and I like Obsession, so I took a chance and ordered it.  I am so glad that I did!  I love it!  It is very subtly sexy, not overpowering at all.  This scent immediately became one of my top three favorites.  From now on, I will always have a bottle of it in my collection.</li>
    <li> It is one of my favorite perfumes and I cannot buy it in the store anymore. The price was great and it arrived on time. One stop shopping. So easy!!!!!</li>
    <li> I get more compliments then anyone when I wear this perfume.  It has a wonderful scent that is unlike another.</li>
    <li> The name Calvin Klein and the fact that I wanted to try this one it has a very light sent great for day or night time I and a fan of the stronger scents sometimes you just feel like wearing something a lighter and this works for me.  Yes I would recommand</li>
    <li> It smells like candy mixed with floor cleaner. There are probably better perfumes made by stupid celebrities from Walmart! GROSE!</li>
    <li> What a great perfume! I loved it. I haven&#x27;t seen Obssesion Night at stores anymore. So I decided to look in Amazon, so I&#x27;m more than happy that I finally found it.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;With Obsession, alway wear a little...don&#x27;t over do...it mixes with&lt;br /&gt;your body chemistry and will linger for a long time...&lt;br /&gt;nice.</li>
    <li> I remembered loving Guess Gold on one of my best friends a few years back and decided that, at 25, I was finally old enough for such a sexy fragrance. However, it seems Guess Gold stopped being produced and there was no way in hell I was going to spend $200 on a perfume, especially when I could only BARELY remember how it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obsession Night by CK is a close substitution for Guess Gold. It&#x27;s really deep and kind of musky but in a very sexy and appealing way. While I&#x27;m glad I bought this, I don&#x27;t wear it too often (I prefer Lady Millionaire) and sometimes it is a little too sweet smelling for my liking. All in all, worth the price compared to the outlandish cost of GG now.</li>
    <li> bought present for my wife, she liked it alot. finished bottle in no time will buy again, &#x27;nuff said</li>
    <li> I really liked this fragrance several years ago but had not seen it around.  Delivery was fast and exactly as ordered.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light citrus with earthy spice.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfurme by recorded comments, the perfume is very soft for my taste but smells good, I&#x27;ve always used the Euphoria or Very Irresistible.</li>
    <li> love my purchase, no regrets, thanks fragrance net for the samples that came in my package........ to anyone who loves calvin klein collection this is one of the best choices..</li>
    <li> This purchase arrived in the time offered by delivery company. The product came in its original box and there were not any damage. The quality of the parfum is good. A little bit soft smell but good for the price and considering it is a Calvin Klein parfum.</li>
    <li> The product was impossible to find in any local stores.  I am very sensitive to perfume scents.  There are very few I can use that do not give me incredible sinus headaches. When I find one that works well and I like....&lt;br /&gt;I found several places and price options on the Amazon site.  The product was shipped and in my home within one week; even with standard shipping.  I was very pleased with the service and the product.</li>
    <li> This was a gift......She loves it.</li>
    <li> its my go to!  I havent been able to find it anywhere else but Amazon (admittedly I have not tried very hard).. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My husband bought me obsession about five years ago and I never liked it. It was to strong for me but a few months ago a friend told me that there was another obsession so I ordered it and I loved it right away I get compliants every time I use it I will be order it before this one is done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff for years - I think I&#x27;ve bought 4 bottles now?  People who get very up close constantly tell me how great I smell, but it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell.  You can be fairly generous with application because it is NOT cloying at all and one bottle will last a VERY long time (1-2 years at least with daily application).  I can&#x27;t imagine ever switching perfumes.</li>
    <li> I have had several bottles of Obsession over the years, in fact still have a half-full bottle on my dressing table. I love sweet, spicy scents like Shalimar, so it&#x27;s hard to scare me with sweet heavy fragrances that are so ideal for cooler weather. However, I never took to Euphoria. Something about it was just wrong for me. At any rate I&#x27;ve been longing for a new fragrance for fall and had my heart set on a bottle of Cassini EDP, but it is proving difficult to find. Swinging by TJ Maxx today to check and see if by chance they had some, I saw the Obsession Night. Something told me: \\&quot;Just get it.\\&quot; And I did, and honestly, I am head over heels in love with this perfume. At first sniff it reminded me a great deal of Chanel&#x27;s Coco Mademoiselle, another undeniably fabulous scent. But Obsession Night is wonderful in its own right. I can tell I am going to really enjoy wearing this. I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
    <li> One of the best you can have on for an evening event. Calvin Klein discontinued this for their new one called Euphoria. Which is a great one to have also. We found this for my wife at Amazon. Paid under $40. It comes with a cream in the box but the Parfum is absolute class. You cannnot tag it with a teenage or an mid-aged peron. Its just so good and sexy for all ages.</li>
    <li> This perfume is a classic -- light and airy, yet feminine and alluring. At department stores, a bottle this size costs anywhere from $60 - 100. I got it here for $37. Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Being a fan of calvin klein  I have to say I was quite disappointed, right after spraying it on the scent disappeared very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> always loved it - always will. how much can you say about a perfume - you like it - or you don&#x27;t ... I love this one</li>
    <li> Always a happy customer with this product. It&#x27;s exactly what I want and in great condition. GREAT PRICE too &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a smell for man but gosh it smells good! I ordered for my self but ended up giving to my hubby coz it suits him more. It&#x27;s long lasting and so cheap! Haven&#x27;t expected that much ordering it. No way you go wrong with it unless its kind of manly so yea :)</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the price!!  Love this stuff.  It smells so good.  I was worried it was a knockoff at the price of $15 a bottle as I&#x27;m used to paying at least $35 for the small bottle but it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Fast easy shipping.  A perfect gift for a lady in your life.  Wow nice.  I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this because I received a sample in a magazine and instantly fell in love with it. I wear it on &amp;#34;dates&amp;#34; with my husband, and he always compliments me on how nice I smell. It smells more like a unisex scent than womanly, which I prefer. It&#x27;s a crisp scent initially, then dries down to this warm, slightly powdery scent that I can&#x27;t get enough of. I&#x27;ve stocked up on it!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the same bottle from amazon over a year ago for my girlfriend and she loved it. however, this time around the scent was off. it wasn&#x27;t as strong and seems a little sketchy. unfortunately, i cannot return it to amazon. My girlfriend still likes it but she has to spray a large quantity in order to get the same affect from the original. probably wont order any other perfumes from amazon in the future. love amazon for other purchases, but not for perfume anymore.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scent. Its fresh and easy but still just amazing. I literally got compliments EVERY TIME I wore it. I just got another one.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, arrived when promised.....&lt;br /&gt;I just love Obsession Night by Calvin Klein&lt;br /&gt;Has been my favorite since I have tried it years ago.  Get lots of compliments on the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I usually wear Obsession, which I have been told is my fragrance. Saw this and had to try it. Love it too, for a change. More of a grown up evening scent.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. The smell of this perfume is simply obsessive, especially at night! If you are looking for something for yourself to give your wife or girlfriend this is it.</li>
    <li> I have got lots of compliments on how I smell, so I am more than glad :) good for price.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasts most of the day</li>
    <li> This is an amazing perfume. The scent is jus too good. Nice product. I think I finally found a perfume I can always use.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in that the scent disappears almost immediately.  It is a very pleasant scent, which is too bad that it does not last.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend. Came pretty promptly and smells a little more sexy than the normal Obsession. Pretty mild smell.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance since 2006.  It&#x27;s the ONLY fragrance that I constantly get compliments on - the only fragrance that women and men alike ask me what it is because it smells so good.  That should tell you how good this smells.  Even my teenage niece asked about this fragrance!  Pair it with the lotion - to get a nice layering to make it last longer!</li>
    <li> good product and good quality will order again if this item is needed at a future time, thanks for item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this  product and really smooth transaction, perfume smells really good. The product was just as advertised</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are saying they got the lotion? I ordered it and got just what I wanted! Loved it!</li>
    <li> I dont know if it&#x27;s a fake or what, but it barely smells at all, the smell lasts for like ten minutes, so i dont think i&#x27;ll be buying perfume online again,</li>
    <li> Good evening, excellent product I manage to cover the expectations that tape-worm on, I come in time and in good conditions thank you.</li>
    <li> Best perfume from Calvin Klein</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in fragrance. Price was good so I thought I would give it a try. It in no way resembles Obsession. The scent is pleasant, but fades in seconds. I find that simple bath sprays last longer than this scent.</li>
    <li> He comprado este perfume para mi chica y le gusto mucho.&lt;br /&gt;Se respira un Buen aroma, sensual y seduciente....Lo recomendo.</li>
    <li> This is a fake version of the Obsession night. It was a mistake and I should have listened to the reviews. I have used this perfume for many years and I know how it is supposed to be. This bottle is very Watered down, the smell disappears by the time it hits your skin. Lessons learned, pay extra money and buy perfume from Macy&#x27;s and other stores and not online. I should have been more careful, this product has been off the market for a while. So, what we can find is either fake or watered down, expired - but when I used it before, I liked it so much, I thought maybe by chance this might work - did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller was Perfumesworld and it was prime shipping - Amazon would not take it back and refund money for this purchase - why sell it in the first place? They are increasing their prime membership prices, maybe they should put more checks into the sellers before they start hitting the consumers with increased pricing.</li>
    <li> A very light smell that lasts all day!</li>
    <li> very original. recommend the product. very good fragrance.</li>
    <li> I just love this scent. It is good for the evening wear, but if you like heavier scents, it will work anytime.</li>
    <li> Le gusto a mi esposa, tiene muy buen aroma. llego a tiempo y sin ning&amp;uacute;n problema el empaque sin ning&amp;uacute;n problema</li>
    <li> Love it!  Sad it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered, perfect.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and it lasts reallly long. Bt it is nothing like obsession.. Bt its still amazing...I love it</li>
    <li> I already knew the product was the one I wanted, evaluated a perfume is very subjective&lt;br /&gt;good perfume&lt;br /&gt;good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a perfume freak, and when I got a whiff of this, I had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it, however, use just a little as it&#x27;s a little strong.  I get alot&lt;br /&gt;of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted could not find any where else. My sister bought this on vacation in the Bahamas some years ago and wanted to try it again. thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years it is very light and musky.  Men love it on me&lt;br /&gt;It is very hard to find I can only buy it online now.</li>
