      <li>You&#x27;d be better off just blowing your nails yourself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute</li>
      <li>BUT, CUTE</li>
      <li>You can blow more air on your nails with your mouth than with this thing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s adorable, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>, IT IS JUST SOMETHING CUTE</li>
      <li>THIS ITEM IS CUTE, I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it has many uses in it before it will break</li>
      <li>I used it too of course :)</li>
      <li>it was cute but mostly just for show.</li>
      <li>so we are sure they are going to love them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Cute for a kid or a collector.</li>
      <li>Super cute!</li>
      <li>Works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Works good but hard to position nail for best air contact</li>
      <li>but it works fine, and it&#x27;s adorable.  </li>
      <li>glad it was a cheap purchase.</li>
      <li>Not sure it is very effective, for drying nails, but happy with the product.</li>
      <li>The air isn&#x27;t that strong and makes a lot of noise.</li>
      <li>This was done to save money on the mold I am sure, but it does reduce the effectiveness of the product as the air blows right at the tip of the finger rather than over the top.</li>
      <li>But I like it, its cute, cheap and unique</li>
      <li>Perfect for little children to use maybe as pretend but</li>
      <li>It had a good steady stream of cool air, and would serve its purpose well.</li>
      <li>For something cheap?</li>
      <li>yeah, but cheaply made.</li>
      <li>She has &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; equipment, but this makes a fun and cute item for her collection.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of something for the kids to play with because it doesn&#x27;t have much output, but I love it.</li>
      <li>I originally saw this product on Wanelo, and it reminded me of my sister soI had to get it for her.</li>
      <li>Very cute for young girls.</li>
      <li>When it arrived in the mail I was uber excited</li>
      <li>This is a great product for any girl that needs a faster way to dry their nails.</li>
      <li>the reason why i&#x27;m giving this rate is because this little guy doesn&#x27;t blow very good and the batteries don&#x27;t stay in place, so it goes off</li>
      <li>Spa day with little sisters this is ideal.</li>
      <li>Very cute novelty item, but it barely blows any air out.</li>
      <li>You have to apply a lot of pressure to get it to work, but for the price you really can&#x27;t expect much more.</li>
      <li>We purchased the nail dryers for our granddaughters,  they are so cute and do really work  </li>
      <li>Overall a good buy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay but very flimsy.</li>
      <li>Not bad.  </li>
      <li>guess I was was lucky, when I put the batteries in the fan</li>
      <li>nothing is better then that the monkey face broke when I got it and getting youre nails done at a place is better</li>
      <li>I inserted fresh batteries and nothing happened.</li>
      <li>they wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
      <li>Well worth the $3...</li>
      <li>, I gave it to my nieces, but it is a fun product to have.</li>
      <li>Anyways,they are small,cute,and worth the 2.50.</li>
      <li>It is pretty cool, but it took like 8 years to get here.</li>
      <li>It was worth the money.</li>
      <li>The air comes from below so it hits the tip of the finger, not down on top of the nail as it</li>
      <li>This monkey is so cute!</li>
      <li>It was small and cute and it was a nice gift for her.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cute and it actually works.</li>
      <li>It barely reaches the top of the fingertips.</li>
      <li>Product came faster than i expected and pagaging is safe and secure.</li>
      <li>Does not blow air very much at all.daughter doesn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
      <li>be going back to buy more</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>It is a cheap piece of garbage directly from china.</li>
      <li>But if higher?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Slowish shipping but it works fine, and it&#x27;s adorable.  I named it Kong.  ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with this.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how cute it actually was when it arrived. I bought three (3) for my S.O. and my friends as well. They all love them. It works pretty well from what we have seen. The button is a little hard to press, but you get used to it. That is really the only thing I can see that could use improvement. Other than that, it just takes two (2) AAA batteries and you&#x27;re nails will be dry in a jiffy.</li>
    <li> This does not dry your nails what so ever, horrible product</li>
    <li> The air does not blow out of the monkey&#x27;s mouth, but underneath the chin. It barely reaches the top of the fingertips. Plus, the button is super hard to press down and it&#x27;s uncomfortable to hold it down. I used it once with brand new batteries and it already doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know if it is a fluke from the batteries, or the button is broken, or what. But I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Received and did not work. :\</li>
    <li> I purchased this solely for the cuteness factor! I didn&#x27;t really think it would be that practical but it is. We have used it and other than being cute it is functional.</li>
    <li> Literally didn&#x27;t work, batteries were brand new, didn&#x27;t even turn on once. The base is on the wobbly side too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for little children to use maybe as pretend but nothing else really. The product does not blow much air at all and would take just as long to air dry.</li>
    <li> this was really cute, but it shipped in a thin plastic bag that was meant for clothing so it was broken when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Arrived months after order. My daughter raced to put batteries In it, just to find that it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but very flimsy. Could be better built. But for 2.50 it is what it is. The air comes out from an opening at belly not threw the mouth. Cute for a kid or a collector. Got 2 of them, One for me and one for my daughter. Mine was meant to be used for my nails. Daughter likes monkeys. So her will probably not be used. Anyways,they are small,cute,and worth the 2.50. But if higher? they wouldn&#x27;t be worth it. Batteries go in the back of it&#x27;s head. Takes two AAA batteries. The button where your finger presses was loose on mine. The cap part wasn&#x27;t down in the place setting where it should have been. I will get back on how long it lasted.</li>
    <li> It takes long time to dry the nail polish but better than dangerous UV rays.</li>
    <li> adorable little guy dries my nails great!&lt;br /&gt;he was a hit with all my friends and is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;will be going back to buy more soon.&lt;br /&gt;the only downside is that he only dries one nail at a time.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected. It&#x27;s cute yeah, but cheaply made. You can blow more air on your nails with your mouth than with this thing. I feel it should be apart of a child&#x27;s play beauty set.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s adorable, but it doesn&#x27;t work. After the batteries were put in, still nothing. Not worth the $4</li>
    <li> I saw this item on Pintrest and had to have it.  I was kind of disappointed that it was not a little stronger powered.  It is cute but not really worth the bother.  Btw I did put brand new batteries in so I know that was not the issue.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t even work I&#x27;m upset</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift to a nail art fan and she thought it was great. She has &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; equipment, but this makes a fun and cute item for her collection.</li>
    <li> This is really adorable people!! This is so cute and was so happy i bought this item! i&#x27;m a big fan of &amp;#34;cute things&amp;#34; and this certainly fits the profile!! Product came faster than i expected and pagaging is safe and secure. Thank you Finejo!</li>
    <li> this product does what it says it does, but its not amazing. could b stronger, and the button is a little hard to press with the pinkey finger</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cute but the quality is not that great. You have to be very careful not to drop it. But it works and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> Bought 3, none of them worked</li>
    <li> It did not do anything. I gave it to my baby to play with it thinking it is a monkey. Does Not worth 50 cents.</li>
    <li> super fun present for someone, really adorable but really useless and pretty loud. Little kids love it though! Spa day with little sisters this is ideal.</li>
    <li> I have a nail dryer but mine is exactly that...you can tell what it is just by looking at it. I bought this one as a gift for my niece and even in the picture it appears the monkey blows your nails dry. This is actually not at all what happens. You must depress a button with a bunch of bananas to activate the dryer. There is a small opening between the button and the monkey were the jet of air comes out of. I was slightly disappointed. Still great for the kiddos and I&#x27;m sure she loved it but I felt kind of slighted.</li>
    <li> This monkey is so cute! It&#x27;s more of something for the kids to play with because it doesn&#x27;t have much output, but I love it.</li>
    <li> Does not blow air very much at all.daughter doesn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> It was broken and dindt work</li>
    <li> We purchased the nail dryers for our granddaughters,  they are so cute and do really work  so we are sure they are going to love them.</li>
    <li> I was never expecting high quality from this. Unfortunately I got this and it never worked. I&#x27;m still trying to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Does not have fan strength but good toy to pretend</li>
    <li> cute but not cute I have to get this for my daughter it broke when I took it out of the mail if you want to have a good gift give her a gift of love nothing is better then that the monkey face broke when I got it and getting youre nails done at a place is better bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  something else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  sorry for the 1sssss  11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111</li>
    <li> I button is hard to push. I bought it has a gift and it hurt their figures trying to use it.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS CUTE, I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT IT BEING PRACTACLE, IT IS JUST SOMETHING CUTE &amp; IT&#x27;S JUST A NOVELTY ITEM, BUT, CUTE</li>
    <li> I definitely would not recommend. When it came the box was open and completely crushed. The air isn&#x27;t that strong and makes a lot of noise. The back piece by the batteries was crooked and does not stay unless I hold it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t get this unless you&#x27;re getting it for a little girl. I mean you get what you pay for I guess. The way it looks is it&#x27;s blowing down but you have to push really hard to get even a little air going. They&#x27;d dry faster blowing on them yourself.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. I use it every time to dry my nails and it drys it much faster.</li>
    <li> from the way it looks it will blow your nails dry, it doesnt! you can barley feel the air and if you think like i did the air comes out the mouth then you would be wrong again! it comes out at the base, very bad design. the only plus on this item is it is cute beside that it is useless</li>
    <li> While this monkey nail dryer is absolutely adorable, you basically have to dry one nail at a time and a long time at that.  It is not really funcational and would make for a long, long drying process.</li>
    <li> This is works but when it goes I smells horrible and takes a few minutes to dry but it works</li>
    <li> Love it! Just as cute as it looks!</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re going for cute, this is your monkey... however, if you want it to actually &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; air, you&#x27;re in for a giggle.  There is NO power behind this little cutie, It&#x27;s on the manicure table purely for looks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this works, I gave it to my nieces, but it is a fun product to have.</li>
    <li> I disliked this because It doesn&#x27;t dry my nails it barely blows at all its just terrible i tried evything to fix it</li>
    <li> This item did NOT work. It did not blow air. It is a cheap piece of garbage directly from china. If I could give it a 0 or negative star, I would.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> blows very little but super cute</li>
    <li> the reason why i&#x27;m giving this rate is because this little guy doesn&#x27;t blow very good and the batteries don&#x27;t stay in place, so it goes off</li>
    <li> It was a very very tiny blow dryer.  (if you want to call it that).  Very cheaply made. It would take forever to dry your nails.  I bought it for my granddaughter and when it came, I just threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> haha yea i recommend this to give away as a present to a 5-15 year old not for yourself&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t blow hard enough and it hurts your finger to be pressing for so long.</li>
    <li> It is pretty cool, but it took like 8 years to get here.</li>
    <li> It is a little misleading because the air actually comes out of a hole in the monkey&#x27;s stomach and not out of its mouth. Besides that, it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> Very cute little monkey blower. Does not blow out of mouth as it looks but blows out between bottom feet. Great for a little girl just starting to do her nails. Cute gift idea! Works ok but don&#x27;t blow the strongest. GREAT item for price!</li>
    <li> tiny, good for someone who has really small hands and only good enough for one finger at a time. i gave it away to a 6 year old i babysit and she likes it.</li>
    <li> Not bad.  More for decoration since I collect Monkey things.  Haven&#x27;t really used it to dry my nails so I can&#x27;t rate it on that.  Seems like it&#x27;d be slow though.</li>
    <li> Works good but hard to position nail for best air contact</li>
    <li> Very cute!  It was worth the money.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. it was cute but mostly just for show. Not really going to be used to dry nails because it would take to long.</li>
    <li> It was for my cousin who wanted it. It was small and cute and it was a nice gift for her.</li>
    <li> I didnt think this would be high quality, but I at least expected it to function when i got it.  It never worked out of the box.  Piece of Junk.  But, i guess what can you expect from CHINA-- Garbage!</li>
    <li> I got this this little guy for my granddaughter who just turned 14. She loves it and it really works.</li>
    <li> Got this monkey as a gift for a little sister and she loved it! Immediately searched for batteries and painted her nails.  It does the job but is a little noisy. I used it too of course :)</li>
    <li> This is a cheap plastic monkey that blows a little air. It looks as pictured, although the air actually comes out of a hole under the mouth where the middle finger tip is in the product shot. This was done to save money on the mold I am sure, but it does reduce the effectiveness of the product as the air blows right at the tip of the finger rather than over the top. A small child would have better results if their fingers are small enough. The lower hole also looks strange and takes away from the esthetics of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I was was lucky, when I put the batteries in the fan did work, the button to activate it was really loose but when pressed hard enough near the back it did turn on the the small fan inside. The air is about what you would get out of those little handheld mister fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for a kid, or a monkey fanatic but the novelty of using it runs out fast. I don&#x27;t think it has many uses in it before it will break but I guess we will see.</li>
    <li> This product arrived before the estimated delivery date. I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to mess with on off switches. You just press down on the bananas and the air starts as soon as you lift your finger up the air stops.</li>
    <li> I WAS HOPPING TO GET A CUTE MONKEY BUT WHEN I OPENED, THE BOX WAS CRUSHED, THE FACE HAD YELLOWS AND BROWNS SPOTS, A LITTLE SUPPORT IN THE BACK SITE OF THE MONKEY IS BROKEN AND WHHEN FINALLY I PUT THE BATTERIES ON IT DIDNT WORK AND THE MONKEY FALLS BACK...THEN I READ ALL THE REVIEWS AND I GET MORE DISAPPOINTED SO I WAS FRUSTATED... I PUSH REALLY HARD AND IT FINALLY WORK, BUT THE AIR IS SO WEAK... I DONT THINK IM GONNA DRY ANY NAIL, REALLY BADDDDDDD.</li>
    <li> Not super sturdy but it was not expensive. Perfect for a teenage monkey collector to have in her collection of different items.</li>
    <li> For something cheap? 2.50 I got 2 of them and not to bad for the price. Buy or or don&#x27;t. But price is good for a collector.</li>
    <li> Love this monkey blower. Super cute! Doesn&#x27;t blow a lot of air and will take a long time to dry your nails.</li>
    <li> Well worth the $3... it&#x27;s not top of the line, but it works just fine. And the bonus is it&#x27;s so stinking cute.  :)</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, and the fan inside is louder than I expected it to be. You have to apply a lot of pressure to get it to work, but for the price you really can&#x27;t expect much more.</li>
    <li> This was soo cute, and the girl who got it loved it.</li>
    <li> it works it came on time</li>
    <li> I never expected \\&quot;professional quality\\&quot; from this, but I at least expected it to work. I inserted fresh batteries and nothing happened. I sent it back and was refunded right away.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these for granddaughters&#x27; birthdays. Very cute for young girls. Not sure it is very effective, for drying nails, but happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for any girl that needs a faster way to dry their nails. Perfect for any lady that does her nails constantly. Guys, also a great gift for the special ladies in your life. They&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend love this, it is small, don&#x27;t wait for a big blower system</li>
    <li> It is very cute, but it took quite a while to get here and now we can&#x27;t get it to work. Not worth my time or money to try and return it.</li>
    <li> Oh it is very cute looking, but you have to hold down the button so hard it completely doesn&#x27;t work!  Total piece of junk!!</li>
    <li> This item was cheap, and you definitely get what you paid for. The button is hard to press down but it works. and it very cute!</li>
    <li> Warning!! This is a good way to throw away your money!! Never worked....not even for a second! You people should be ashamed of yourself! Buyer bewar all these people want is your money! Stay away from this crap!! Very very pissed off consumer!!! One star is to much!</li>
    <li> When it arrived in the mail I was uber excited so I brought it inside I popped some batteries inn it and it didn&#x27;t evern work.</li>
    <li> Its cute and all but it doesn&#x27;t work to well; in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t dry your nails very well or quickly. Also sense it doesn&#x27;t dry very well you have to be pressing the button for quite a while and than the air it blows starts to smell. But I like it, its cute, cheap and unique and it does eventually dry your nails after like 30+ seconds</li>
    <li> my daughter-in-law loves anything with monkeys and she polishes hers and her 3 year old&#x27;s nails all the time and when she saw this she squealed with delight.</li>
    <li> It comes late by 3 wks ! I&#x27;ll never think to order from them again ! Also the package was damaged bec it comes in a plastic cover inside it cartoons so baaad !</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of them and neither worked with brand new batteries. Awful product.</li>
    <li> Smaller then I thought it would be but still cool</li>
    <li> This was for my 9 year old daughter.  We received it in March 2014.  It&#x27;s cute but the air that it blows is not significant enough to do more than what air drying does.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to have the monkey because it looks so cute, but when I got it, it&#x27;s so small.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the cost. It&#x27;s super cute and it actually works. Got it for a friends birthday and haven&#x27;t heard any complaints!</li>
    <li> Cute something to have for the teens. Works well, haven&#x27;t had any issues other than taking a while to get here.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
    <li> Received a broken product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect - put batteries in and it&#x27;s so adorable. Just waiting for her to come visit!  But may decide to mail for Valentines day,</li>
    <li> It is smaller than i expected, but its okay needs batteries and does not have much power</li>
    <li> Too cute!  Doesn&#x27;t work very well but everybody loves it anyway because he is so cute!</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I were underwhelmed by the quality and power of this item, which I bought as a Christmas gift for her.  We laughed at how little air comes out of the little mouth.  You can only dry one nail at a time.  You&#x27;d be better off just blowing your nails yourself.</li>
    <li> The air comes from below so it hits the tip of the finger, not down on top of the nail as it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put new batteries in and it has already stopped working. She never got to use it.</li>
    <li> Very cute novelty item, but it barely blows any air out.</li>
    <li> bought for a gift and they loved it!!!</li>
    <li> It came out perfectly as what it was said. However, since the box was not put in an amazon box. The box the product came in was crushed.</li>
    <li> I originally saw this product on Wanelo, and it reminded me of my sister soI had to get it for her. For some reason I thought it would be a little bigger than it was, as I could grasp the whole dryer in my fist. Nevertheless when it arrived, I tried it out before sending it to my sister. It had a good steady stream of cool air, and would serve its purpose well. It&#x27;s small, cute, and cheap. Overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money. Do yourself a favor and dont even buy this junk. You can barely feel anything come out, and its not hot air. Listen to the other reviews. This product is so bad, Amazon shouldn&#x27;t even sell this.</li>
    <li> The monkey is super cute but barely blows out any air so it definitely doesn&#x27;t dry nails any quicker. If I would have spent more money, I would be very upset...glad it was a cheap purchase.</li>
