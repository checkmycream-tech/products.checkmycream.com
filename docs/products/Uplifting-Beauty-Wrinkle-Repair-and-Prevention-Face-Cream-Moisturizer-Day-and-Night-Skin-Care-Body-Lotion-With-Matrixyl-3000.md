      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>I really noticed a difference quickly with this because it was a very soothing &amp; hydrating cream.</li>
      <li>Many anti-aging creams I have tried are too heavy or have a strong scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Matrixyl 3000, Argireline, collagen and hyaluronic acid. Argireline contains amino acids that help to relax facial muscles and get rid of wrinkles.  Some anti-wrinkle creams are designed to treat wrinkles that already exist and restore youthfulness to aging skin. Other anti-wrinkle creams function very well as a preventative, for younger people looking to slow the signs of aging and keeping their youthful appearance longer. I enjoy using this (fast results or not) it is soft and refreshing feeling and does not clog pores. I do not have deep wrinkles but lines around my eyes and fingers crossed starting now will prevent those wrinkles getting deep.</li>
    <li> I have been hearing a lot of hype about the Matrixyl 3000® lately and what a great anti-aging ingredient it.  Luckily, I have been fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of some great products that contain it like this Resurrect Anti Aging Moisturizer that Uplifting Beauty sent me for free to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  Matrixyl 3000® has had some really great results in studies that have been done such as: significant reductions in wrinkle depth and skin roughness and improved skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;The Resurrect Anti Aging Moisturizer by Uplifting Beauty is a really lightweight moisturizer that is easily absorbed and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and makes fine lines appear less noticeable.  It also has a nice, subtle peppermint scent which is very refreshing.  In addition, I have very oily skin and this moisturizer helps balance out my skin and wears really well under makeup!! This product is a WIN for me!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a while now, I have not noticed that is has helped any with my wrinkles or crows feet, however this is great moisturizer. It has a nice clean smell to it, and it does a great job of providing extra mosioture where I need it most, around my nose and eyes. It also leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I love the feeling.</li>
    <li> Uplifting Beauty Resurrect Anti-Aging Moisturizer comes in a handy pump that dispenses just the right amount product to use to cover your face. The moisturizer is packed with natural anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents, along with powerful skincare ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid and Matrixyl 3000. These ingredients work together to increase collagen production which, in turn, increases your skin&#x27;s elasticity and minimizes wrinkles.  Uplifting Beauty Resurrect Anti-Aging Moisturizer provides intense moisture which deeply penetrates your skin. After applying you are not left with a &amp;#34;sticky feeling,&amp;#34; because the moisturizer is quickly absorbed. The company states that it takes 4-5 weeks of consistent use to see results.

Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> Since it has been winter, my skin tends to be more dry and dull looking. This moisturizer contains sodium hyaluronate which helps keeps my skin more hydrated and looking better. You can even use it all over your body to keep your skin firmer, such as your thighs and neck. Another benefit with this moisturizer is it&#x27;s natural anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents.It is a nice light creamy texture which goes on silky smooth. There is no greasy or oily residue after I use it and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I received free product for review purposes and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my mom to try. She is 68 years young and has beautiful skin to begin with for her age. She has been using Matrixyl 3000® for over a month. I seen her last week and I even seen a difference in her skin. She said she used it twice a day and it made her skin feel soft. Resurrect Anti-Aging Moisturizer provides intense moisture which deeply penetrates your skin. I did not see really less wrinkles but her skin tone was more even. She had slight darker patches on her face and they did fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom said it absorbs in her skin fast. She does suffer from dry skin which also made her skin less drier. She did also add a moisturizer after applying. She is happy with the results and I am glad. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my moms unbiased opinion and review</li>
    <li> I’m always on the lookout for new ways to change up my facial routine, but it’s hard to find a lotion that stands out, usually to me a lotion’s a lotion, nothing special, don’t expect much from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent the Resurrect Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Uplifting Beauty to review, and was pleasantly surprised by it! The thing I love most about it is the scent, it has a faint peppermint scent, which does sound a bit strange at first in a facial moisturizer, but I really like it. Plus the smell perks you up in the mornings when you’re still waking up :) It comes in a pump bottle, which makes it easier to get the exact amount you want, and you’re sure to get every last drop of product out of the container instead of having to scrape around for the last dregs. It’s a semi-light moisturizer, I have oily skin most of the time so it’s perfect for me, if I’m having a dry day I’ll reach for something heavier, but this is great for everyday use. The amount I have on my fingertip is how much comes out in one pump, that’s more than enough for my whole face and part of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this lotion, it’s pretty great!</li>
    <li> Amazed at this Anti-Aging Moisturizer at first use.  I felt a tingling feeling when I applied this great smelling cream.  It has a perfect  consistency for an anti-aging cream and it went on smoothly.  You don&#x27;t need much of this to feel the effects; therefore causing it to last much longer.  This cream gives you that added moisture you need during the day to ward off the harsh weather elements that try to leave your face dry. It is enclosed in a cute designed bottle which is perfect to carry in your purse.  I have been using for a short time but impressed thus far.</li>
    <li> Cream based moisturizer that hydrates with anti-aging properties. I&#x27;ve noticed hydration and smoothness to my skin. Minimizes the appearance of fine lines. Has a mild peppermint refreshing scent.  Comes in a easy to dispense pump. Not greasy and absorbs in nicely.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for review. The first day I put it on, I was shocked to feel it firming my skin within seconds of putting it on my skin. Seconds. I wash my face every night, then I use product. Never have I had a product do anything instantly other than cause a olfactory memory at best. This one was unlike all the others. It truly had a tightening effect-- a little face-lift in a bottle. They call their product Resurrect and I can see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told my aunti about this one I just knew she would love the lift and tightening I felt on the first and every day after.</li>
    <li> Glides on easily and absorbs quickly. After just a week of using it, it has hydrated my skin so well, I feel like I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I live in a harsh, dry climate. The sample of vitamin C eye gel that comes with it is a nice bonus which indicates a company that takes care of their customers. I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Can not be happier with this product. Many anti-aging creams I have tried are too heavy or have a strong scent. This one very light and has a very light pleasant scent. Also appreciate that a little goes a long way. Price is very reasonable and not only do I like it my husband does not know I am using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Moisturizer that really helps improve skin tone, brightness, lines, and firmness. This product contains Matrixyl 3000 and packs a powerful punch, targeting all the issues that women can have with their skin- especially as they get older. I really liked the feel and consistency of the product which was thick, yet easily spread into a thin layer for application on my face and neck area. I chose to apply once in the evening after cleansing and other facial products such as my serums, were applied. It did not take much product at all, as the formula is high quality and spreads well. It does take a few minutes to dry, about 5 for me, but this is around normal for moisturizers usually on my skin! The only drawback I could really find with the product was the smell- it could have been improved- I would NOT say it was bad at all, but I felt that a simple organic fragrance or oil could have been added to aid in that. The container itself it very nicely made as well, with a metal outside shell and pump handle underneath with an easy pull-off top! Although this Resurrect Moisturizer contains Matrixyl 3000, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin as some of the beauty products containing that ingredient have done in the past. If you&#x27;re searching for a good moisturizer that&#x27;s really effective AND moderately priced, I would definitely recommend this Resurrect Moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several creams in the past and find this one as the absolute solution to my skin problems. My skin was so dry, but with its High Quality Matrixyl 3000 cream, my face feels so soft &amp; refreshed. I find it more efficient by giving the moisturizer about 20 min. until my skin has fully absorbed it before putting my make up on in the morning. There I saw a significant line reduction and even some wrinkles around my face fade away after using this cream. My partner can&#x27;t stop looking at me now and everyone keeps on commenting how nice &amp; young I look. Feels good to to have found a product that perfectly works for me! I highly recommend it to others.</li>

After a few days I did see my skin starting to look very fresh &amp; well moisturized. I really noticed a difference quickly with this because it was a very soothing &amp; hydrating cream. There was no irritation experienced with this product. I feel that this is a really high quality skin cream that provides a very good level of hydration.
