<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent, can say better!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really keeps my hair moisturized, shiny and healthy.  I don&#x27;t use it every day as it makes my hair so soft it can become a little limp.</li>
    <li> Used this with its companion conditioner and didn&#x27;t need any other &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;. After blow drying my hair, it no only looked great, but was soft and silky - and I am 66 years old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;, but I will not use it every time, because after I have used it for  a couple of shampoos, my hair gets oily the next day after. I alternate with Pureology every third shampoo. If you shampoo everyday, it should be no problem.</li>
    <li> Both me and my daughter have fine, curly hair that can be frizzy, especially my 4 y.o. who still has her baby hair.  Enhanced our curls and eliminated the frizzies.  Really was shocked at how impressed I was with the product.  I tend to think all shampoos/conditioners are the same.  This changed my opinion of that.  My husband loves the smell.  He even noticed the differences in mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair texture.</li>
    <li> I started using these products (Moraccanoil) about five months ago and I love them.  My hair is a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccanoil products. I use their shampoo, conditioner, mask and oil. These are the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever tryed. They leave the hair clean, smooth, managable and smelling soooo good. They are worth the price.</li>
    <li> stumbled on this product in hollywood Fla and have used it ever since.  buying though Amazon is easy; its at my door in a day or two. love the smell and moisturizing properties in this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My first encounter with this shampoo was at my hair salon, my hairdresser uses it professionally.  I have dry hair and is moisturizing without weighing my hair down.  Great smell too!</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo!  Will never use another again.</li>
    <li> Love the Moroccan Oil Shampoo as it smells so good and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and so manageable. Amazon price cannot be beat either! Have not tried the Conditioner yet but am ordering it now.</li>
    <li> After having been very happy with the Moroccan Oil, I tried the shampoo, conditioner and curl creme and I have to say I am 100% dissatisfied.  The shampoo strips the oil from you hair, dries it out, and the conditioner is not nearly rich enough to return it.  The curl creme?  Good grief..save your money.  I have naturally curly hair, and all it did was make my hair dry (on top of the very drying shampoo and conditioner) and certainly did nothing to enhance curls or reduce frizz. With the exception of the oil itself, these other items in the line are no good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product line.</li>
    <li> I had an excellent experience. I received my orders in approximately four days from the order date. Great job. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I started using this after I got The Brazilian Blowout treatment. My hair is straight, but will get frizzy unless I flat iron it. I was sick of the heat damage, so I got the treatment. The Brazilian Blowout sells and recommends their own line of shampoo and conditioner, but after using it for a couple months, I hated it. It&#x27;s $38 per bottle and doesn&#x27;t even smell good. My hair felt dirty and weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with Moroccan Oil because it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates, which is necessary after The B.B. treatment. I am enjoying my hair a lot more and will keep using this shampoo, conditioner, and the oil. I am very impressed with it.</li>
    <li> I had my hair treated and was told I needed a phosphate free shampoo. The salon recommended this product. It works very well, you need a small amount for good lather and it cleans well. The smell is just OK. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used a variety of shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners that don&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair or that don&#x27;t dry it out you much. It is a very difficult task. I am pleased to say that this product works great to help keep my hair from drying out you quickly, but also cleaning it. I love this product. Goodbye Redken.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this shampoo. The clean smell and the way my hair managed after shampoo makes this a highly rated product in my review.</li>
    <li> This shampoo will make your hair feel incredible after just a dime sized portion.  I bought this product for my wife and used it myself.  It really is a fantastic shampoo......pricey yes but what do you use that is fantastic and super cheap?  I say try it once and you&#x27;ll understand why everyone is using these products with Argan oil in it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is absolutely fantastic!  More than worth the price - works on my coarse, unruly hair - it should work on every hair type.</li>
    <li> The moroccanoil line is awesome.  I love this shampoo, y hair is all silky after washing it and then I use the hydrating mask or conditioner and my hair is good for a week.  I am so happy I found these products.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisture repair shampoo.  My hair has lots of highlights and it always looks smooth. Smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product and was delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> What can I say, Moroccan Oil products are awesome!!!  Unlike other products that claim they repair your hair but only act as a bandage, Moroccan Oil products actually repair your hair and improve the look and feel.  They also smell amazing.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo it cleans with out leaving my hair feeling either  unevenly dry or oily which a lot of shampoos I use tend to do. I have thin long hair and this shampoo seems to give just enough moisture and it smells great too. I did the ceratin straightening treatment about a month before trying this shampoo and since it&#x27;s looked like it did when I first did the treatment. I recommend using the conditioner as well. The only downfall to this product I would say it the cost.</li>
    <li> Best darn shampoo for curly hair ever!!! And it smells phenomenal!</li>
    <li> The day before I tried this shampoo I was ready to shave my head-I couldn&#x27;t do anything with my hair at all.  I used the shampoo the next morning, styled it with just my hands ( short hair ) and when it dried it was beautiful.  It was perfect-waves working like they should, no frizz.  I love it and I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have used.  I use every shampoo and my hair never needs repair.</li>
    <li> After just 2 uses, I have seen MAJOR difference/improvement in my hair. Love the smell!!!</li>
    <li> As expected, thankyou</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product, it leaves my hair very soft, and it feels silky.  I love how it smells. I think it is gentle with the hair, it doesn&#x27;t feel harsh or too strong. The only disadvantage is that price is just a little high.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this product. It contains no sulfates, which is good for those of us with sensitive scalps. It&#x27;s concentrated so it takes very little to work effectively. In addition, it smells heavenly. It&#x27;s several dollars cheaper at Amazon than at my salon.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Have,thick, wavy hair that ends up frizzy with other store bought shampoos for curly hair. I use shampoo &amp; conditioner of this product, after washing, I use oil and scrunch my hair &amp; let my hair dry naturally &amp; end up with curls instead of frizzy. Great price &amp; quick ship. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The Moisture Repair Shampoo was received from this Seller 8/10/11.  Noticed the labeling did not look professional and the emblems could be scrapped off.  Called Moroccanoil Headquarters -1-888-700-1817 (x262) and was told these are absolutely counterfeit and should be discarded and NOT used. They previously tested Moroccanoil Shampoos purchased on-line and found them to contain detergent, and oils.  Customers called complaining of rashes and swollen eyelids. All MOROCCANOIL Products can ONLY be purchased through Beauty Salons or Beauty Supply Stores which have salons.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo for curly hair, and he was absolutely right about it.  It does not dry out my hair, and I usually don&#x27;t need to use conditioner if I use a gel or mousse for coaxing more curls.</li>
    <li> I use maroccaoil shampoo and conditioner for damage hair for about 6 months and I buy from Amazon. It&#x27;s the best shampoo and conditioner I ever used, I have dry hair and damage, but I am trying to take a good care now, and yes this product works. A little bit  makes a lot foam, because it is quality stuff. Tip: The Macadamia mascara and oil can be a good touch for your best hair along with maroccaoil shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Xoxo</li>
    <li> Today my wife do not life without use brand products,  congratulations  to Amazon for the brand in their inventory for sale recommend</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, and oil a few months ago from a local salon - smells like heaven, so indulgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I purchased the same items at the same salon today - smells/feels like completely different products with hardly any fragrance :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to determine the differences - I tested the older vrs newer product on each hand, and the older product was clearly more fragrant. The smell/consistency on the newer was just off, not thick and creamy as before. I also noticed the older bottle states, &#x27;made in Canada&#x27; - and the new states, &#x27;made in Israel&#x27; ...which leads me to believe they have production in both places?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I don&#x27;t think the issue is completely due to fake products and online orders, but perhaps factory related?</li>
    <li> EDITED 11/22/11: I should learn not to review a product in the first 24 hours! The smell is still an issue with me. But the effect on my hair ended up looking amazing as the day went on. I completely love the way it smoothes my very course hair. I would recommend giving this product a try, and I would now say it&#x27;s worth the price!  Previous review 11/20/11: I&#x27;m sorry but this was a disappointing product for me. The smell of this shampoo is really just a very strong laundry detergent smell that I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash out of my hair after smelling it all day. The effects on my hair were no better than other shampoos I use. So I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on this product unless you really, really, really, like to smell like clean laundry.</li>
    <li> Based on the price I paid from my salon, I wanted so much to like this shampoo. I bought the shampoo, conditioner and 2 masks, the intense hydrating and the weightless. I used the masks 2-3 times per week leaving it on for 5 mins each time. My hair is color treated and I straighten it almost every day so I need something protective. These products make my hair like straw. It is crunchy, not soft, and I can&#x27;t even run my hands through it. It feels even more damaged, and like it will break off at any second. I much prefer the silkening shampoo and rinse from Aquage which leave my hair soft and flowy. I threw all the Morrocan oil products away, wasting about $100. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> It is a good shampoo but it just doesn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and always go back to this one! I love it! My hair gets its shine back! Healthy shiny looking hair. My hair is straight and thin and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. 100% recommended</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel healthy. The smell is pretty too. If you want a good shampoo then this one is fir you.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Not only makes hair feel good, but smells wonderful</li>
    <li> very satisfied with product &amp; seller</li>
    <li> This stuff will certainly make your hair look and feel great, but don&#x27;t get it confused with a natural morrocan oil product.  There is a tiny fraction of morrocan oil compared to a long list of chemical ingredients.</li>
    <li> We love Moroccanoil shampoo, conditioner, styling products and the oil itself.  it&#x27;s a must Have in our household.  Than you</li>
    <li> makes my hair to tangley after shampoo and the conditioner does not help much</li>
    <li> Very expensive shampoo smells good, but does not do anything special for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only using the shampoo, but like it so much that on the next order, I plan to buy the conditioner as well.  Can see a huge difference in my hair!</li>
    <li> was using kerastasse bain oleo for years, skin on face/ hands became irritated (but hair was always in great shape).  This does not cause any skin reactions, but hair is not as soft / moist as kerastasse.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo love the smell and how it makes my hair feel and look after using it and my hair smells great all day. Only have to use a little bit at a time and it lasts. I have long blonde hair (middle of my back) and it does wonders for my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Leaves my hair feeling healthy and clean.  Nice light fragrance!</li>
    <li> Great love it!! It is a great shampoo i love how it smells and it came really fast im satisfied</li>
    <li> for some reason when they used this shampoo at the salon i loved it! it made my hair so shiny and soft and just gorgeous! but after i used it a few times at home it made my hair super greasy and i got tons of dandruff! idk why this happened but i dont want to use Maroccanoil anymore :(</li>
    <li> I really like Moroccanoil products but be careful with anything with keratin.  Overuse of keratin will cause breakage.  Unless you have extreme damaged hair, stick with the moisture therapy.  If you have very damaged hair, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil is a go-to product for me! It never fails me. I highly recommend you give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product restored my hair.  My hair was so dry and brittle from coloring by indifferent stylists that it was hard to believe how it brought it back to life.</li>
    <li> I like to switch Shampoo and Conditioners now and than and i really like how this repaired my dry split ends ,my Hair is soft and smooth and also i noticed less Frizz that&#x27;s a plus for me since my Hair gets dry really easy.I also Love the Scent.</li>
    <li> This product has made my dry hair come to life, I was about the invest in the Keratin treatment but decided to try this first. Wow, I am glad I did! Keratin costs $300, this costs so much less and no hassle.</li>
    <li> Good and nice smelling shampoo. Seems to work better on some than others, but it is just fine.</li>
    <li> It is not any better than regular supermarket brands.. Just more expensive.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma and it leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  There just isn&#x27;t enough I can say about it.  It is good for color treated hair.  It smells like heaven.  It is very expensive but the results make it far worth it.</li>
    <li> Small amount does a great job. Just don&#x27;t expect tons of suds like a old typical shampoo. Winter weather normally dries my hair but this miracle worker leaves it alive with body</li>
    <li> I love every one of their products I have tried.  Living in Florida, the sun takes a toll on hair.  This product reverses that!</li>
    <li> I love how gentle this shampoo is on my color treated hair.  My hair color lasts twice as long and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for the past four years and simply love it.  It makes my hair shiny and manageable.  I really love the smell that lasts for days.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> best shampoo on the market!</li>
    <li> Complete FAKE. Color, smell and even texture is FAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still had some of my original shampoo left, so it was very easy to compare. I could not believe!&lt;br /&gt;I wasted money of this junk and they over charged me for shipping too.&lt;br /&gt;What a crooks!</li>
    <li> Love they way my hair feels!!</li>
    <li> I love Moroccanoil and use it daily so I decided to give their other products a try.  Shampoo is really nice, moisturizing and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> The Item itself is very good, but came in wet box, it was leaked.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo, a little goes a long way which is saying something for me because I have very thick hair and usually have to use a lot to get my desired result. I like this shampoo but.....as I said in my review on the Intense Hydrating Mask, Sally&#x27;s argon one n only brand works just as well at only $10 however, in the case of the shampoo it is a thicker consistency than the Sally&#x27;s brand so I don&#x27;t need as much so I&#x27;d more than likely purchase the Morroccanoil brand because even though it costs more I&#x27;d probably have it longer. Overall, I was pleased but I still say more expensive doesn&#x27;t mean better.</li>
    <li> Despite what those discount brands would have you believe, it really is worth spending a bit extra on your shampoo. Hair is seen by everyone every day, and when it&#x27;s a mess, so are you. Splurge on this wonderfully scented product. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I had never know my hair can feel so soft...&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally very dry, has been all my life. I always tried to find solutions but nothing ever worked until I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s very expensive, but it&#x27;s absolutely worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone with a problem of dry/damaged hair!</li>
    <li> Well her hair is still in her head, so I guess its alright with her, she still uses it.</li>
    <li> This purchase does not smell like the Moroccanoil oil shampoo that I have purchased before, it normally has a very strong pleasent smell ,this has a very slight not to nice smell ! lathers up good and thats it !</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and the texture of my hair after using.  I found this product about a year ago and have not found anything else to compare.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo bit pricey but I think worth it.  I am disappointed I didnt buy the conditioner from the same vender believe I was ripped off does not work or smell as good as the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good. I have very curly hair - that I straighten - which seems to dry it out a bit.  Moroccanoil shampoo leaves my hair nice, moist, and not dry.  not \\&quot;fly away\\&quot;.  Expensive, but i&#x27;m hooked now.</li>
    <li> I have used the Moroccan Shampoo and Conditioner for around 3 years.  The Moroccan products are great and help to keep my hair healthy with a lot of shine.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo because it was recommended as being safer for pregnancy by the book &amp;#34;belli beautful.&amp;#34;  it is one of only a few safer products that I will continue to use when pregnancy is no longer an issue, as I love it just as much as my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo.  Too bad it&#x27;s a little more expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil for several months now and the change in my hair has been remarkable. I have corse think hair that I straighten daily. After using this shampoo for a few weeks my hair maintained shine consistently. I know longer have frizz or fly aways! I would recommend this to anyone with complex hair :)</li>
    <li> (using my husband&#x27;s account on here) Got this one when i put keratin on my hair and was recommended this by a friend! Loved the smell of it so much and it went really good with my hair !</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Love it even more when I can get it at a better price than from my stylist! Will be back!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell and does what it claims!!! I give it the highest rafting possible.</li>
    <li> This is not good if you live in Humid climates like I do in South Fl, however does work well in dryer climates such as cooler climates and your hair is less frizzy.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair so greasy and rough if i don&#x27;t wear the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;smell goes away fast. I have to pour a lot of shampoo in order to get my hair soapy.</li>
    <li> I will never use another shampoo ever after using this shampoo it leaves your hair so clean and it helps restore moisture</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it leaves my hair feeling silky. It is also great for preserving hair color. This is the best shampoo I have ever used and I don&#x27;t mind paying for it!</li>
    <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product, I am not sure if it is original one. The smell is so strong, and my hair look like I put some kind of gel on them in couple hour after I wash them. I wanted to return it but it is a no return policy product. Such a waste of money</li>
    <li> Fantastic product line.  I use their shampoo and conditioner for Moisture Repair.  I also use their deep conditioner twice a week.  I do have extensions and this product is amazing as it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients that can deteriorate the life of my extensions.  My hair is happy and healthy.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Expensive but it seems to be good and my wife enjoys it. I&#x27;d say to accomplish with what it promises.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo with pleasant fragrance.  A favorite.</li>
    <li> Excelent product one of the best i&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Got this initially as a recommendation from my hair stylist and after using my initial bottle, bought it from Amazon - was cheaper and with my Prime membership, I got it very quickly.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Too Expensive !!!!!!!  Way over priced ! Bought as a gift per request !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d reccomend this product to people with coarse, damaged, curly hair. I was getting the keratin treatment until I realized this shampoo works the same way. It contains keratin and replenishes the hair folicles.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,smells gr8!</li>
    <li> Arrived just as discribed. Quality was as expected, if i had purchased it at a salon for full price. thanks</li>
    <li> Got this for Mom at her request. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I am a 51 female who after years of processing her hair basically destroyed it all.  My new hairdresser, who is my age recommended the morccanoil products along with a SHORT hair cut in order to repair the damage, with cuts every 5-6 weeks. Also, needed to toss out the curling iron.  Wasn&#x27;t to thrilled with the idea of short hair but she convinced me I needed short hair, I must admit the cut was incredible.  She also spent two hours educating me on the care of my hair, how to use the products and how to style this new hair cut.  Have been Using the following Moroccanoil products for about 18 weeks: Moisture Repair Shampoo, Moisture Repair conditioner, Intense Hydrating Mask (twice a week), Hairspray - medium finish, treatment oil light and frizz control.  Just starting to have to replace the products after the initial purchase.  Next replacement purchase will be the hairspray, still have half a bottle of conditioner, 1/3 jar of mask, half bottle of oil, 3/4 bottle of frizz control. The products are pricey however, the results are well worth every dime.  The condition of my hair now is that of a 20 year old.  All of the products leave your hair soft, shiney and of course the smell is awesome.  I can&#x27;t count the number of compliments I have received regarding my hair.  I am a believer and will continue to use the Moroccanoil products.</li>
    <li> My hair is colored, course and dry.  This shampoo is softening and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another shampoo.  The fragrance is great and it has repaired my hair, completely.  I use the matching conditioner as well: c my review it is more complete.  I am 62yrs old and since using this, my hair no longer LOOKS like the typical 62yrs old hair.  My recommendation would b for post meno. women: STOP coloring and perming, get these products and c/feel the difference.  Even your hairdresser will notice the difference.!</li>
    <li> I have hair that tends to look dry and this shampoo helps .  It smells great!  Safe on hair that is colored.</li>
    <li> This is amazing shampoo. Smells great, too!</li>
    <li> Recommended!!!  I have used this for six months and am very pleased with the results, smell, shine.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get your hair very clean. I also use the brand&#x27;s curl product and love it also. Read my response on that if you want another good product.  I will order this again and again. I used to use the non-shampoo hair cleanser TV item and stopped due to the cost.  This is so much better and lasts longer than you think. A little goes a long way and wonderful shine and silky hair. Smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> I first experienced this shampoo when my hairdresser used it and inquired about it and the cost.  I found it on Amazon and decided to order it because it worked so well when my hairdresser used it.  It leaves your hair silky and smooth, tangle free and soft and manageable.  Not to mention the price that Amazon charges is the cheapest I have found.  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It really does work on the day you apply it. But the days after it doesnt rly do much for your hair... it goes back to dull and dry. I probably wouldnt buy again...</li>
    <li> The price was affordable and good for this size and I do really like morrocan shampoo and the rest product ! Thanks</li>
    <li> The BEST shampoo I have ever used. My hair is very dry and tends to frizz, winter or summer! This shampoo leaves my hair feeling soft and makes it shiny in a good way. I&#x27;m happy I discovered it. I also use the Moroccanoil leave-in Treatment before styling my hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo! The smell is fantastic! And it nourishes my thick hair like no other.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is heaven in a bottle</li>
    <li> Love this one!!!! Works great!!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo, great price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo hands down. I love the way it makes my hair feel, soft and manageable without weighing it down and the scent is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Macadamia Rejuvenating Shampoo is much better.......</li>
    <li> Not the real deal. My hair is completely dried out. Should have listened to the other comments about it. I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes your hair soft and healthy and it costs a lot more in my salon. You should try it.</li>
