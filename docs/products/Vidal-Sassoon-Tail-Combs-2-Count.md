      <li>I love a good bargain and when you can get 2 for the price of one it is even better..</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>I wouldnt purchase these again since I am sure there are better tail combs on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Better than the cheap $0.50 ones you can buy at Sally Beauty Supply.  </li>
      <li>then it&#x27;s just so easy to cut.</li>
      <li>These are nice to use and actually pretty rugged.  </li>
      <li>Takes less time and makes a perfect line.</li>
      <li>Great overall product.</li>
      <li>These combs are cheap, sturdy, and do the job.  </li>
      <li>They are cheap and work well, I recommend them without reservation.</li>
      <li>Time is important when you are trying to get a toddler to hold still.</li>
      <li>basic sturdy rat tail combs good price</li>
      <li>Overall, the combs are ok for parting, great for detangling, but be careful how close you get to scalp.</li>
      <li>They work pretty well.</li>
      <li>I saw a pack of several little nice combs for better price.</li>
      <li>They feel solid and fit in my toothbrush holder, too easy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For just under a buck, can&#x27;t really complain about the price.</li>
      <li>but these are no where near as nice as the Kent combs - which shouldn&#x27;t be expected given the price.  </li>
      <li>The ends are sharp so i can feel them scratching my face (when brushing beard) and the top of my head.  </li>
      <li>There are very cheap, but they are made of a cheap thin plastic.</li>
      <li>Highly priced.</li>
      <li>Personally I don&#x27;t really know what to do with the second one, but I guess it&#x27;s a back up in case anything happens to the first.</li>
      <li>and I have a fairly sensitive scalp.</li>
      <li>Mainly bought these because they were Prime and only had 2 (only really need 1).</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t show it in the pictures, but if the pointy ends of the comb fins are facing you, the fins are pretty wide, they don&#x27;t come to points.</li>
      <li>He has very sensitive skin and a comb is the only thing that he&#x27;ll let me use on him.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are not rough on the scalp</li>
      <li>Simple comb, worked as expected, lasts until one of my children carries it off and it gets lost in that whole in the ground that contains all the socks!  </li>
      <li>I also am not able to comb all the way down to my scalp which is strange because my previous, almost identical comb is able to.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend them and wish I could return!</li>

<li> My scalp is sensitive but these don&#x27;t seem sharp or cause any discomfort.</li>
<li> These will last a long time.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t get what people were saying about these scratching their scalp, as these are very wide and flat fins.  </li>

<li> These combs work as expected.</li>
<li> wet</li>
<li> There isnt too much of a story behind this purchase.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sturdy enough but not too harsh on your scalp.  </li>

<li> Not awesome, i really dont get why its so sharp.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re just your average tail combs.</li>
<li> You just need to put this through the running water and comb your hair to make it a little</li>

<li> I could to show you what I mean.  </li>
<li> I bought this along with a scissor for cutting my bang.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think that the teeth are painful at all</li>
<li> I no longer use them since the experience is too painful.</li>

    <li> basic sturdy rat tail combs good price</li>
    <li> Love these. I use the end to part my 2 year olds hair. Takes less time and makes a perfect line. Time is important when you are trying to get a toddler to hold still.</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to.</li>
    <li> The way these are packaged is a wire through the middle of the comb, splitting the teeth which I thought over time would straighten out, but it didn&#x27;t. I also am not able to comb all the way down to my scalp which is strange because my previous, almost identical comb is able to.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend them and wish I could return!</li>
    <li> These combs work as expected. I don&#x27;t think that the teeth are painful at all and I have a fairly sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. My scalp is sensitive but these don&#x27;t seem sharp or cause any discomfort. They&#x27;re perfect.</li>
    <li> Simple comb, worked as expected, lasts until one of my children carries it off and it gets lost in that whole in the ground that contains all the socks!  Inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Mainly bought these because they were Prime and only had 2 (only really need 1). Overall, the combs are ok for parting, great for detangling, but be careful how close you get to scalp. Teeth are extremely sharp. I wouldnt purchase these again since I am sure there are better tail combs on Amazon.</li>

    <li> Just as described.  Good value.</li>
    <li> There isnt too much of a story behind this purchase. I just needed a comb. There are very cheap, but they are made of a cheap thin plastic. But for a broke college student, as I am, these get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love a good bargain and when you can get 2 for the price of one it is even better..These will last a long time.They are not the hard plastic that tends to break,these are flexible.</li>
    <li> After growing my hair out a bit, I had determined that I needed a comb. I used to have an old black tail comb that disappeared a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to find a replacement...the amazon search returned few results that were similar to the one I used to have at a decent price. Then I stumbled across these little gems. They feel solid and fit in my toothbrush holder, too easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 of them&lt;br /&gt;They work well&lt;br /&gt;They are not rough on the scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a comb. Actually it is 2. They are cheap and work well, I recommend them without reservation.</li>
    <li> For just under a buck, can&#x27;t really complain about the price. They work pretty well. Personally I don&#x27;t really know what to do with the second one, but I guess it&#x27;s a back up in case anything happens to the first. Been using this almost daily for the past 3 months and they&#x27;ve served me well.</li>
    <li> These combs are cheap, sturdy, and do the job.  Given my penchant for misplacing combs, they were the perfect buy.  Will buy again if (when) I manage to misplace these ones, too</li>
    <li> I have no complaints this product works well for its price great for styling my hair hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it involving my scalp. Great overall product.</li>
    <li> This may sound weird, but I use this to comb my cat! He has very sensitive skin and a comb is the only thing that he&#x27;ll let me use on him. The tooth size on this comb is perfect for his fur.</li>
    <li> These are nice to use and actually pretty rugged.  They don&#x27;t show it in the pictures, but if the pointy ends of the comb fins are facing you, the fins are pretty wide, they don&#x27;t come to points. I took a picture as best I could to show you what I mean.  I don&#x27;t get what people were saying about these scratching their scalp, as these are very wide and flat fins.  Feels quite a bit different when using it, takes a little getting used to to get the same results as a pointy thinner finned comb.</li>
    <li> Great price but these are no where near as nice as the Kent combs - which shouldn&#x27;t be expected given the price.  I use these to &amp;#34;just for men&amp;#34; my hair every now and then and they work well for that purpose.  It&#x27;s sturdy enough but not too harsh on your scalp.  Better than the cheap $0.50 ones you can buy at Sally Beauty Supply.  Buy a Kent to comb your hair though.</li>
    <li> Purchased these combs because I couldn&#x27;t find them in a set of two, kinda sharp on the scalp when using them. Great price, excellent shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a scissor for cutting my bang. Works great . You just need to put this through the running water and comb your hair to make it a little wet then it&#x27;s just so easy to cut. It can also be used for a wig .</li>
    <li> Kinda flimsy.  I would go with a different product if I had it to do again.</li>
    <li> Its good for partitioning hair when applying color or henna.&lt;br /&gt;Also, works good when you want to make your hair smooth.</li>
    <li> Highly priced. I saw a pack of several little nice combs for better price.Do not buy this!</li>
