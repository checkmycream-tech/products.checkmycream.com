<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought the brush head would be bigger.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! It gives a perfect airbrushed finish with my liquid foundation. I use half as much foundation and have twice the coverage compared to the kabuki brush I was previously using. The customer service of this company is amazing. The first brush I received did not work for me at all. I wrote a negative review and received an email from the company the same day apologizing that I was unhappy. They offered to fully refund my money or send me a new brush at no charge. I opted to try a new brush and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Somehow the first brush I received was faulty, it didn&#x27;t spread my makeup and after I washed it the bristles didn&#x27;t dry after two days. But thanks to the amazing customer service of this company, I was able to get a new brush that is absolutely amazing. Buy this brush.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Just purchased this brush and I love it! Its very soft and dense. The bristles don&#x27;t shed or anything!! Will definitley be repurchasing brushes from beauty junkees!!</li>
    <li> I went with all the other positive reviews and was not steered wrong!  Awesome brush!</li>
    <li> not using cause it doesn&#x27;t get my pressed powder foundation on thick enough</li>
    <li> The brush works good, but it came unglued from the handle a couple weeks later. I&#x27;m not rough with it or anything and washed it once as directed.</li>
    <li> Even after following the cleaning instructions, the bristles came out and handle came loose. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of brushes and this was the worst one. Never buying from this company again.</li>
    <li> I love it. Good quality brush.</li>
    <li> Fabulous brush!!!!! Will definitely purchase from this seller again</li>
    <li> Item arrived prompty and packaged very securely.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and plan to get some more of this brand&#x27;s brushes :).</li>
    <li> Brush is awesome and worked perfectly for applying my liquid foundation.  Brush is of quality with soft, but sturdy bristles.</li>
    <li> Great Kabuki brush. It makes applying foundation so easy. Good sturdy handle with soft bristles. Lovely sellers. They go above and beyond in their customer service. A wonderful experience. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Brush is super soft and seems very high quality. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out!</li>
    <li> This is the first flat-top foundation brush I&#x27;ve used - I used an angled brush before but watched a makeup tutorial that recommended the flat-top brush for applying foundation.  For me, the tutorial was right, and this is a great brush - I love it!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this at first because the price was so low, and usually when I&#x27;ve purchased cheap things on Amazon they turn out to be bad quality. But this had tons of reviews and I finally decided to go with it, instead of purchasing the Sigma brush I was initially going to buy for $24. I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times now and I really love the finish, it&#x27;s dense and gives great application of the liquid foundation I use. It is very soft on the skin and I have already recommended it to many people. An overall great brush for foundation. I wish I would have bought this earlier because now I prefer it over my $30 Cargo Magic brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Very soft and flawless makeup application! So good I ordered another one a few days later and an additional size. Won&#x27;t apply my makeup with anything else.</li>
    <li> This is a solid brush.  It cleans up beautifully and still looks good 3 months later. I don&#x27;t think I have yet to lose a bristle. Applies makeup easily and beautifully without soaking up product.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim since I had a coupon code, and I am very glad I did. Shockingly soft, and dense, it&#x27;s exactly the kind of brush I enjoy using. The only reason I did not give five stars is because it smelled overwhelmingly of paint/chemicals when I first opened the package. It was fixed easily by rinsing with baby shampoo, so no lasting ill effects there.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It had replaced all my other brushes for applying my foundation. It is so soft on my face &amp; creates a flawless look. It&#x27;s also easy to clean. I will be getting a backup - I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> In compare with other foundation brushes - this particular brush is&#x27;t dense enough. In my opinion, it&#x27;s great for powder or blush, but not for a liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic! I love the way it feels and it helps my liquid make up go on to look flawless.</li>
    <li> I just loveeee this foundation brush, very easy to apply my foundation now 👏🏼👏🏼 happy girl 😁😁😁</li>
    <li> I was thrilled with the brush! Works great, cleans easily, does all that I ask from a foundation brush! The price for this brush makes it a winner in my book! I haven&#x27;t had any problems with bristles falling out or some of the other concerns described.</li>
    <li> good quality for this price point.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very dense and soft. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation brush! This is actually the second one that I&#x27;ve purchased. I wanted to get my mom a brush that I knew she would absolutely love. It leaves and airbrushed look and blends beautifully. It has taken me years to find a foundation brush that I love this much.</li>
    <li> Started to shed after 2 use. I got fed up of buying cheap brushes. This did it for me. If you have the money I&#x27;d recommend buying top of the line brushes. You will save money in the long run vs having to continue buying new brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not extremely comfortable. But considering the price, it is a good deal. If you are a beginner, get the five-piece set, it&#x27;s a good start to practice with.</li>
    <li> this is a great product I love it...soft brush and nice coverage</li>
    <li> Only a couple months after getting this brush all of the bristles fell out! Very unhappy</li>
    <li> Nice dense buffing brush. I use it to apply my foundation and it does a wonderful job. I&#x27;ve washed mine a few times now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding. The price was so great I ended up getting another one since I don&#x27;t particularly like using dirty brushes. No complaints for this brush.</li>
    <li> Works really well for an inexpensive foundation brush. I went looking for one of these after a Sephora employee used one to apply foundation in-store and I saw how beautiful the finish looked. This seemed like a perfect choice for the price and I have not yet been disappointed. It works best with true foundation, though; tinted moisturizer or BB creams seem to have too much liquid and make the brush a bit spikey.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush- have had mine for over a year and now I give this regularly as a gift to all my fellow makeup junkies.</li>
    <li> So soft and a surprisingly dense brush! I purchase this to replace my Sigma flat-top brush and I am quite happy. This brush seems more durable and its going to last long if you take care of it.</li>
    <li> The application with this brush is flawless and I really love the look of my foundation with it. I use this brush to apply my primer as well as my liquid foundation. I have gone through 2 of these kabuki brushes unfortunately. The first one began to shred excessively. The last brush Ive had for over a month and now I am very gentle with it while applying makeup and while I cleanse the brush. Now this last brush completely fell apart in my hands while I was doing my weekly brush cleaning. I am so disappointed and I would not suggest these brushes anymore.    UPDATE:  The companies customer service is excellent and very quick.  They immediately helped me and gave me multiple options to resolve this issue including replacing my faulty brushes or a full refund. Much appreciated!</li>
    <li> Honestly I was pretty hesitant to buy this brush only because since I&#x27;m not the type to really ever splurge on anything, I want to make sure that what I&#x27;m getting is going to be good quality especially with something so inexpensive. It took me weeks of watching and reading other reviews for this brush and I finally got myself to buy it. I just got it in the mail so I hvent experienced any shedding but from all the reviews I&#x27;ve seen, id be shocked if it did she&#x27;d anytime soon. I did, however, get lucky and came across a discount code. I was so surprised because I actually ended up getting this amazing brush for even cheaper!!!! This is definitely a must have if you are on a budget like I am! I can&#x27;t wait to try out their other brushes!</li>
    <li> This brush applies the foundation quickly and flawlessly. The foundation application is a breeze as the brush head itself is a bit bigger. I already washed this brush 2x  and it had not shred. The fibers are very smooth. I would recommend this brush to a begginer as this is both a good price, good quality and inexpensive compared to name brand brushes.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast! Brush if just as described and very soft. Excited to use and try other products from this company. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush! It did have a slight plastic-ish smell when I opened it, but as the instructions read, you should wash it before you use it anyway. I use it to apply my liquid MAC foundation, and it makes my skin look flawless with no streaks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush for my liquid foundations. It work really well for now, since this is my first time use of it. I will keep an update as I use it more and wash to see how it holds up.</li>
    <li> Great brush, so soft!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush if I was able rate a 10 I surely would this brush applies a gorgeous flawless application delivery was very fast a little pricey for a synthetic brush....however will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s just as nice as my IT Cosmetics brush, but much more affordable.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever, doesn&#x27;t leave hairs all over my face and goes on smooth and even!!  The best brush I think I have ever had!  The ONLY complaint I have is that the bottom became unglued within a few months, I love it so much I don&#x27;t care, it is the only brush I use even if it is in a shorter version!</li>
    <li> Loving this brush, just ordered my daughter one and the eye set for her xmas stocking. The brush is very soft and applies makeup beautifully at a great price. I have several bare mineral, it, and tarte brushes. This brush is equal to them for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush!!</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for me.  It is a high quality and requires much less foundation on the bristles than the typical shape of foundation brushes.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. I have one of similar design from Sigma, and for the money I would take this over that one. Beauty Junkees was great to do business with, and they communicate with you in a very personal way. One of the big pluses besides the better price over the Sigma brush is I think this cleans up much easier. I have a hard time getting all the foundation out of the Sigma brush. All in all I think it is a great brush with a great price.</li>
    <li> Handle separated from the ferrule the very first time I washed the bristles.</li>
    <li> Great! Super soft great price</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and the quality is great!! Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> this is really really good!!!! I never use brush before to apply my foundation. This is amazing. it makes my foundation smooth and natural. Love it.</li>
    <li> It is amazing! I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it was</li>
    <li> Very good brush! I use it for liquid foundation and it works very well. It is easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation on my eczema prone, extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Brush exceeds expectations.  I would definitely recommend !</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. The bristles are really soft and leaves your makeup flawless. It&#x27;s a must-buy!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH! I have all kinds of recurring skin complaints which have been the bane of my existence. This is the first applicator that allows me to control my coverage yet helps me apply it quickly, no matter what my skin has going on that day. It has cut my morning application time considerably. Cleaning is great but it does not fully dry quickly. Best to dry hanging upside down when possible for fastest results.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever bought! Applys foundation and powder so flawlessly! I&#x27;m going to buy an other one!!!</li>
    <li> I love this new flat top kabuki brush as foundation blending brush.  it feel really nice and even softer than the Real Techniques Buffing brush.  I would definitely recommend getting a couple of these as back ups.  I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t wash this brush yet so cannot comment on how well the brush hair are attached.</li>
    <li> An updated review  After using and owning this brush for several months, I&#x27;m knocking two stars off. This brush doesn&#x27;t wash well and has started shedding after washing like crazy! The last time I washed it, at least ten or more hairs came out. I highly doubt I&#x27;ll be purchasing anymore brushes from this company.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this brush as it is really dense and super soft! It feels amazing and after washing it held up great! I have high hopes for this brush :) hope I&#x27;m not as disappointed as I am with my other round top kabuki brush from beauty junkees whos ferrel broke off when washing it only once!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It flawlessly applies any of my foundations/ BB cremes/ CC cremes.  The bristles are so soft and densely packed.  I like that the bristles aren&#x27;t overly long.  This brush is a steal.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great brush easy transaction!😄</li>
    <li> Great brush. Application is easy and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great seller and top quality brush, I would recommend, and i&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Had to edit my review from the one below because after a few months the bristles starting coming out pretty bad. I was washing it the recommended weekly amount, so maybe I was washing it too much?  Way better than my bare essentials loose powder brush. I got a new pure pressed base mineral foundation and needed a flat top brush so that the powder did not get stirred up unnecessarily. This brush is softer than my other one and applies the foundation evenly. Works great for what I needed!</li>
    <li> Before reading my review, you will need context:    1. I just received this brush, so my review is based on one day&#x27;s use. I will have to update this review periodically to detail its durability.  2. I only own one comparable brush. It is an off-brand travel-size flat top kabuki that I bought at Marshalls for 10 dollars (it came with a cheapie beauty blender that I tossed.) That brush is also great, so it confirms my suspicions about well-marketed overpriced brushes.    On first impression I am impressed and happy with this brush. It deserves a high rating, but I&#x27;m awarding it 4 stars instead of 5 because of one drawback. As others have mentioned, it has a strong chemical smell, which makes me wonder about the way it was manufactured, and how a smell could linger for so long during its shipping process.    Also: does its chemical smell indicate toxicity? Is this detrimental to use on my face? These are important questions to ask, and merit further investigation.    But for purposes of functionality, I&#x27;ll put the smell factor on hold and focus on the brush&#x27;s functionality.    This brush is immediately excellent. Though it arrived smelling horribly, after a wash the smell subdued.    Pro: The package gives you clear instructions on how to wash the brush. The package is also ziplock like, so you can keep it for travel. (But realistically it&#x27;s not all that functional if you have a brush collection or makeup bag.)    I purchased this brush after doing extensive research for a week on alternatives to the more popular Sigma F80. I had started immersing myself in the makeup world, and all of the Youtube Beauty gurus were recommending the Sigma. However, it&#x27;s hard for me to trust a group that is paid to hawk products. So I went searching alternative brushes.    I also believe, after some research, that many of the branded brushes are manufactured in China or elsewhere by the same companies. So it&#x27;s possible to find replicate products. They just won&#x27;t be branded.    That&#x27;s what this brush is to me. A great product that could be on the market with another brand name on the handle.    Specs:  It is very soft.  It applies both my primer and foundation well.    Questions I have about it:  -How much product gets stuck in the bristles? I once almost purchased the Bare Minerals Perfecting Face Brush, but the sales woman recommended I get a beauty blender instead because the brush is extremely hard to clean. This brush may have similar issues--the foundation may end up getting stuck because the bristles are dense and close together. However they aren&#x27;t so tightly packed that you can&#x27;t wash it well.  -Will there be fallout?    Regrets:  None. I am VERY happy with this brush. It it excellent quality for the price I paid (about $7 with a discount code.) If the company just works on the smell, it will have a winning product on its hands.I hella don&#x27;t need a Sigma now that I&#x27;ve got this thing. Though I would like to try one for comparison purposes, I don&#x27;t feel I am missing out on quality</li>
    <li> Loved the brush! Evenly applies liquid foundation. I will be purchasing a second brush!</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account. This is a great brush for the price. I bought it for my mom and she loves it. She had me to order her another one.</li>
    <li> fabulous make-up brush.  easy to use.  doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> Great brush, which for the low price, makes it that much greater. Works perfectly for applying my liquid foundation for an airbrushed look.</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush. Thick and soft. Good for a medium coverage.</li>
    <li> It has a little bit of a weird smell when you first open it, but it has gone away since I have started using it. I absolutely love it and it is a great quality brush for a great price.</li>
    <li> Blends Perfectly! This brush is super soft and works wonders!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I can only agree with what has already been said.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> Quite soft. Arrived on time too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in doubt. But.... I received it even early and I was so excited to use it and when I did, it was perfect! It is so easy to control the makeup with this brush and applies it evenly and looks so flawless. I love it and it&#x27;s super thick and not even a stran of hair has been released yet. Very good quality brush I&#x27;m very satisfied. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this brush is so soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for creamy makeup like a CC cream. It evenly spreads the makeup across my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased the five set kabuki brush which I&#x27;m realizing now was a little overkill (how many kabuki brushes can you have?) but I was highly intrigued by the set and the companies dedication.    First impression. The packaging is great. The brushes come individually packaged and the brush holder all come in a box filled with pink confetti and a very cute sticker (that I won&#x27;t spoil for you:), this would make a perfect gift for any makeup lover.  When I opened the bags for each brush they emitted and awful smell. Seriously they smelt awful which was an initial turn off. I immediately washed them my preferred way, with baby shampoo, and the smell was gone. I am still not fan of the idea that the brushes came loaded with chemicals but this is the only con.    The brushes are AMAZING. Incredibly dense and full yet incredibly soft and pick up makeup so well. These apply effortlessly and really give your skin an airbrushed look. So easy to use yet so effective. These brushes are far better than Sigma&#x27;s kabuki though somewhat different, Sigma&#x27;s have a slightly larger head and are fluffier however these are denser and equally as soft as Sigmas and I find the denseness gives a better application. I won&#x27;t be using my Sigma again any time soon. These brushes also have a great weight to them. Very heavy duty wood handle with a sturdy metal ferrule, you can tell the quality just by holding them.    On top of this Beauty Junkees has some of the best customer service I&#x27;ve ever experienced. When I received the kit the leather tube was too small to hold all the brushes and I was very confused. I contacted the seller who responded right away and said they had made their brushes denser which in return caused them to be larger and they no longer all fit in the tube. She told me they were in the process of making a new larger tube and offered to send me one when they were completed in a few months. Well during this time the seller kept me up to date on the production of their tubes andsure enough I received one via priority mail wrapped in pink tissue paper. This tube is perfect for holding all the brushes and is a beautiful leather and very very solid. Beauty junkees truly cares about their customers satisfaction and was extremely kind and prompt in their response. I have since bought several of their other products because I value their great quality and great customer service.    Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush or this company.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for how it helps to apply my liquid foundation.  It saves product and creates a really smooth, even application.  I&#x27;ve found the brush a bit hard to clean though - need to experiment further for a quick and effective method to clean it.</li>
    <li> Love this foundation brush!! Blends out my foundation beautifully and makes my make up look absolutely flawless.</li>
    <li> Really excellent for a lot of foundations and money well spent. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I&#x27;m hopeful this brush does not fall apart like the other brand I bought in July.  I&#x27;m being careful to exactly follow the cleaning directions.</li>
    <li> I just received my brush a few days ago. I&#x27;m already in love and planning on purchasing more from this brand. My foundation goes on flawlessly, as well as quickly and easily. I love this brush!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  It is extremely soft, all the while it allows to use less make-up but foundation actually lasts all day! Such a great brush for the price!</li>
    <li> Perfect for applying liquid makeup.  Love the finish it creates.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, and the seller was very helpful with suggestions and instructions.</li>
    <li> Great product for the cost! Feels works just like a costly professional grade makeup brush. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for a quality brush.  I had recently ordered one from a top line department store w/brand name of 3 letters, the cost was 47.00.  In the meantime I saw &amp; ordered this brush from Amazon &amp; actually received it before the other one.  After comparing the two before using either, I tried this one.  The other one is being returned for a refund as this works wonderfully.  The difference of using this brush for my foundation is amazing!!!!  Looks so smooth &amp; covers my flaws &amp; redness wonderfully.  Would highly recommend buying this to quality brush!!</li>
    <li> I previously purchased the Sigma F80, only to have the brush hairs fall out and concave inwards after six months of use. Mind you, I wasn&#x27;t even using the brush on a daily basis. Needless to say, after getting this brush off of Saaammage&#x27;s recommendation, I definitely won&#x27;t ever be repurchasing the Sigma F80. This brush is exactly what I wanted and is at such an affordable price. Definitely planning on getting the tapered kabuki next since I love my Sigma F86 so much!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush. High quality &amp; so soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute;, and she swears is the best brush she&#x27;s over owned. And she&#x27;s a model, so that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT . The bristles are so soft. I use liquid foundation and when I applied it using this brush it went on so smoothly and it left no streaks at all. I am just in love with this brush. I will definitely be buying the rest of the brush set.</li>
    <li> This does a great job with my various liquid make up(CC creams, foundations). Makes a little go a long way, and wonderful, subtle coverage! Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;And VERY (I mean VERY) quick shipping! WOW!!!</li>
    <li> This brush worked great for me when I first got it. However, after washing it a few times it now sheds like crazy. I cannot use it anymore. I wash my brushes using olive oil and a gentle soap so I know the brush wasn&#x27;t damaged by what I use to wash them. Unless water entered the brush (doubtful) then this isn&#x27;t as hyped as people have made it to be. I would still buy/try other Sigma brushes though.</li>
    <li> Believe the reviews!!! I LOVE this brush :-) I use it to put my foundation on and it really does help it go on flawless. The brush is sturdy, the bristles are very soft, even for the under eye area and the width is perfect for foundation application!! I normally use MAC brushes but they didn&#x27;t have a Kabuki in MAC and I&#x27;m glad because I don&#x27;t think they would be able to beat this lol.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to make-up brush for many months now.  No shedding at all!</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush, new favorite!</li>
    <li> Only had it/been using for 1 week but so far I am very impressed and loving it--can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> I love this! I been using this with my kat von d foundation and gives me perfectly even coverage! I actually have been enjoying this more than my Urban decay good karma brush! I definitely recommend this to everyone, especially for the price and quality :)</li>
    <li> This is the best brush ever! The short, dense bristles are extremely soft which makes this brush great for stippling cream-textured products such as foundation.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, LOVE this brush. Cannot go back to sponges, fingers, etc ever again.</li>
    <li> Great brush at a great price! Love it so far. It&#x27;s not scratchy at all and doesn&#x27;t shed. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Great brush! It&#x27;s so fun to use and makes your face look fabulous. The only drawback is that you definitely use more foundation using the brush than your fingers (but less than a sponge) but it&#x27;s great for special occasion uses or if you don&#x27;t mind using a bit more foundation than usual. So soft, cleans very easily, and just FUN to use!</li>
    <li> This brush is AH-MAZING. So soft and perfect to blend foundation. Would totally recommend this to my friends!</li>
    <li> I use this for my mineral foundation and it works well.</li>
    <li> I love the softness of this brush. My foundation goes on smoothly. Best brush I&#x27;ve bought so far!</li>
    <li> I love my brush &amp; the emails about cleaning the brush are most helpful...the service from Amazon was excellent ...Thank you</li>
    <li> I liked it initially, but after washing it a few times the bristles completely fell apart and out of the brush.   After posting this review about both the flat top brush and the angled flat top brush, BJ&#x27;s customer service contacted me giving their apologies and even offered replacements or a refund. I would definitely buy from this company again just because of them being so helpful!!</li>
    <li> I finally used this awesome Kabuki brush. I had it for almost a month before I used it and I don&#x27;t know what took me so long. I must say that this brush is so soft and my makeup application came out FLAWLESS. I used it with my Marc Jacobs Genius Gel foundation and I was in totally awe when I was done because my makeup was amazing. This is a must have for your beauty bag and the shipping was standard but I got it very fast. BUY THIS MAKEUP BRUSH!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, and great utility.</li>
    <li> Works well for the price paid, the bristles are not as dense as expected.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have had expensive brushes prior to this such as the sigma flat top kabuki brush. This brush is almost an exact dupe and I will say that I actually prefer this one to the sigma brush. The sigma seems a bit more dense then this brush and a touch lighter. I use drugstore and high end products with this brush and they buff out perfectly. I find that it helps to keep in mind when using this brush that there is no need to push the brush on your face and keep a light touch. If you push too hard you lose the flawless look that this product can give you. The brush works if you use a heavier foundation with major coverage or a regular bb cream. Also cleaning this brush is an absolute breeze. With the synthetic bristles it hardly soaks up any product. Plus it&#x27;s so soft and has absolutely no shedding which is a major deal because who enjoys picking peices of their brush off their face every morning? I would definitely recommend this to a newbie in makeup application and a pro alike.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so soft and it blends my cream makeup well. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Its my new favorite!  The bristles are very soft and it applies foundation flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many foundation brushes and have never found one that I LOVED! I&#x27;ve tried the really cheap brushes (drugstore brands) that are so rough on your face it feels like sandpaper! I&#x27;ve tired the really expensive brushes (Unlta, Mac, ect.) that are really nice but cost you a arm and leg! But honestly this Brush is AMAZING!!! It&#x27;s so soft and buffs you&#x27;re foundation out like a dream! Seriously you can not beat this price!!</li>
    <li> Great brush! Great price!</li>
    <li> quality brush. Feels firm, but has give to it when applying. Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Excellent to buff in foundation on face. So happy I got this. Pricing was excellent for quality.</li>
    <li> Lovely brush which does a terrific job smoothly applying foundation.  Also appreciated additional info from Beauty Junkees regarding usage and care of brush.  Has close, soft bristles which do not cause itching, previously a problem for me with some other brushes.  Followup review:  This brush was great until August 2015 when all the bristles started coming out.  I had cared for it as the seller indicated.  I used it every day and it was still a great purchase for as long as it lasted.</li>
    <li> I like this brush but the handle came apart after a couple months.</li>
    <li> Best foundation makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever used!  Excellent value - I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m liking the Flat Top Kabuki brush. I can certainly a more full coverage with my touch foundation then just utilizing my fingers! The feel is great! At this point, no bristles hanging out with my face but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times!</li>
    <li> I really like the Beauty Junkers Foundation Flat Top Brush. I love the soft bristles. Using this brush allows me to spread my makeup evenly.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this brush,it blends even and smooth. I will be purchasing another for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.  It has a good feel and is a great value for the price. I looked at other brushes that were twice the price and this one is better.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide the coverage I was looking for or hold powder as well as I expected:(</li>
    <li> This foundation brush is excellent. I was introduced to a foundation brush in Sephora when I was purchasing foundation. The sale person applied the foundation using a brush. I was not willing to pay the price Sephora was asking and decided to look for a brush online. I ordered this brush based on the reviews and I am ecstatic! My foundation goes on flawlessly. Previously I used a sponge for the application and I now use way less product with this brush. So I look great and I am saving money as my foundation will last longer. Do not hesitate, buy the brush. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> This brush is great -- it&#x27;s so soft and applies makeup smoothly and easily.  It&#x27;s washable -- I would highly recommend to anyone. Price is great and it was shipped promptly from the seller.</li>
    <li> not as good as the reviews say it is. not dense at dosent really blend well. i was expecting way better results</li>
    <li> I received my brush and immediately liked it. It is really soft and it seems fairly dense. I have only used it once, but it did a good job applying my foundation. I will have to use it for a while before I decide if I love it, but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> Love my brush. No loose hairs on my face left from the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this one</li>
    <li> Flawless and fast! Wow, this Kabuki brush is absolutely amazing! I was very surprised with how incredibly soft it was and how gentle it was on my sensitive face. I love how it feels and it is so very versatile. I can apply concealer, foundation AND powder within a couple minutes and my finish is flawless. The brush transitions so easily through the steps. I am always crunched for time and my make-up is done in no time! Does not leave an \\&quot;overdone\\&quot; but a very natural look! Also, after my make-up is applied with the brush my face feels so soft and smooth! This brush rocks!</li>
    <li> I never really put a lot of emphasis in makeup brushes. I just thought it was something you HAD to have and quality really didn&#x27;t matter. I hate when bristles fall out or clump or don&#x27;t smooth out my massive mistakes with blush or powder. This combats all those issues I had. Great unbelievable soft feel, heavier brush with some substance to it so you really feel like you are getting what you pay for. I love it. Definitely worth the value and overall functionality.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I use it everyday. I have yet to wash it so I&#x27;m not sure how much/if it&#x27;s sheds after cleaning but I&#x27;m not disappointed yet. Would love to see this in a short handled/travel version.</li>
    <li> Love this! I mostly use powder and prefer a light coverage. I have found most brushes scratchy with uneven coverage that drops product all over my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is soooo soft and feels wonderful on your skin. I generally swirl it in my powder and then buff it onto my face in circular motions. It gives great light coverage that is easily buildable in certain areas and it doesn&#x27;t drop as much product as other brushes I&#x27;ve used. The brush is very easy to clean and dries quickly as well. I generally use somewhat inexpensive products but this brush makes my coverage look effortless, professional, and clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent qualify. Very dense. Applies foundation beautifully. Washed many times and lost no bristles.</li>
    <li> If you are debating whether or not you should buy this brush or not, let me save you the time and just tell you to go ahead to make the purchase!! This brush is perfect for blending out foundation and I even use it to blend out my cream bronzer. BEST investment I have ever purchased and for such a great price. In regards to the seller, 5 stars in themselves! E-mailed me multiple times to ensure their product was working effectively and included great tips and tricks. Will definitely be buying other brushes from them!</li>
    <li> I have tried many foundation brushes, but I have to say that I absolutely love this brush. It provides great coverage and it&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to more expensive brushes and works just as great</li>
    <li> I was originally going to purchase a Sigma kabuki brush because my last makeup artist used it and I was in love. It was a bit pricey for one brush though and I found this one as a nice substitute. It does the same job as the Sigma kabuki and it doesn&#x27;t shed which was one of my concerns. I am very pleased with this brush and will be recommending it a couple of friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, she uses liquid foundation and has very dry skin. She absolutely loves this brush! It is better than some of the name brand brushes such as Mac, BareMinerals, etc. Perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  Extremely soft.  Blended my YSL ink foundation much better than a very high end flat foundation brush I had been using.  I am officially a Beauty Junkee Junkie</li>
    <li> I bought the flat top kabuki brush and so far I love it. It holds mineral powder well and distributes it evenly. The bristles are soft. I am ordering the angled blush brush now.</li>
    <li> great brush - zero shedding!  I love the way it covers with my mineral powder.  Excellent value - just wish it wasn&#x27;t made in China...</li>
    <li> This is great for a blended look. I use after liquid foundation and then after I brush on my mineral powder for a flawless look around my jawline, nose and other small areas.</li>
    <li> I have been watching how-to videos online and recently discovered putting on foundation with a flat brush yields way better results than using your fingers. This brush does exactly what I needed it for and is well constructed. Doesn&#x27;t lose fibers.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING!!! I usually purchase MAC brushes, but after seeing all the wonderful reviews about this brush, I wanted to give it a try.  I can honestly say that this is one of my FAVORITE brushes and will be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected.  It&#x27;s amazing how much less foundation I use per application just by applying it with this brush.  I don&#x27;t see brush marks in my foundation when I use it.  If you need a foundation brush, don&#x27;t hesitate.  Great brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect. This brush works really well and the buying experience was good.</li>
    <li> Looooove this brush ! Doesn&#x27;t take a ton of the product away from my face and helps product go on flawlessly. If you&#x27;re looking for a dupe for sigma F80 you&#x27;ve found it ! Only thing is WASH YOUR BRUSH BEFORE USE if you don&#x27;t usually.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush because the bristles are not to stiff and not to soft. They are just right! It makes applying my foundation easier with a better result. The price is really good to - the department store wanted $45.00 for a similar brush and that one was really stiff.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I got a chance to use my brush for a while before writing this so that my review was creditable! Now that I have had it for a while I will start by saying that I love it! The description states that it can be used for liquid or powder foundation. However, I use it primarily for powder foundation. Since I apply my powder after liquid foundation the brush works great for smoothing out the liquid that I may not have applied thoroughly. The bristles are soft but hard enough to apply efficiently. The handle has a comfortable fit. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> The brush is so soft!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing super soft blends great, my new favorite!! I have been on the hunt for a good flat top kabuki, so glad I found an awesome one!! Great alternative to spending way more on the sigma one!! So give it a shot and try it out you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Amazing, for the price you will not find anything better then this. It&#x27;s just an amazing brush. Get it!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush that works wonders with my BB cream and liquid foundation! You can definitely achieve that airbrushed look with this brush! I also appreciate the great customer service and helpful tips the team provides in regards to maintaining the brush!</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to pay for the Sigma F80, and Saaamage recommended this brush and also gave a coupon code, so I got the flat top kabuki brush. The brush is very soft and cleans easily. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding yet. It works very well with liquid foundation and leaves a smooth, airbrushed look. Make sure to exfoliate well beforehand and don&#x27;t rub too hard with the brush or you&#x27;ll create flakes.</li>
    <li> One of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. Worth every penny. Just as good, if not better, than high end brushes like Sigma, MAC, Sedona Lace! Will definitely be ordering more from this brand! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> nice brush but i not the right kind for my needs. my mistake for not reading the description well. still usable, just needed another  brush for the original need.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Soft and dense.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use heavy makeup or foundation, but it works great for applying my tinted moisturizer with a smooth and luminous look. I read reviews on this brush also being great for powder application. I&#x27;ll try it out with my mineral makeup and update this review. Good price compared to other competitive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;**Use coupon code SAAAMMAG for $5 off! ;)</li>
    <li> This is just as good as the sigma f80 brush for a lot less. Such a good value and brush. I was shocked that it was so good. My go-to foundation brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I used to use Bare Minerals brushes but this one is awesome and like it even more! And, best part is is doesn&#x27;t shed!</li>
    <li> Good for liquid foundation, blends well</li>
    <li> This brush is everything they said about it and more. I love the way it applies the foundation. My skin looks flawless. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Sorry took a long time to leave feedback, but this make up brush is awesome! I love it. I&#x27;m ready for another one. I use this brush to apply my Bare Minerals foundation powder and it covers great without keeping all the making up on the brush, and without streaks, etc. Great coverage. Price is right!</li>
    <li> Loveeeee this brush! Came quickly and it literally works perfectly. It&#x27;s a necessity, every girl should have one.</li>
    <li> I received it in a perfect condition. Packed nicely and neatly. And on time! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and washed it twice already. The bristles are not coming off and it goes back to its shape when fully dried... At it applies mineral make-up nicely too. BUT it says on the description that the current $11.97 price is an introductory price only, and will go up to $29 maybe after they reach there \\&quot;quota\\&quot;. I bought it coz it&#x27;s cheap considering it has a lot of great reviews... so I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again if if goes more than 15-20 bucks! Sorry.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s great quality, has dense bristles and is very soft. Foundation goes on smoothly. I have purchased several makeup brushes recently, and this is my favorite by far.</li>
    <li> Tried this product for the first time and it is GREAT. I love the way it makes my foundation application so smooth and natural looking and this brush is very sturdy and soft. Will definitely be purchasing more of their products.</li>
    <li> This brush upon first impression is so soft!  Lovely in making an airbrushed effect!</li>
    <li> Being a beauty guru, I have tried MANY flat top kabuki brushes for foundation. This brush BY FAR has been the greatest yet. The hair is so smooth &amp; just glides the foundation on your skin for a flawless finish. No shedding, no irritation, and no streaks! Definitely a &amp;#34;must buy.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I&#x27;ve never found a foundation brush that applies make up so well. Most leave it streaky or cakey. For the price, this brush is a wonder.</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush! So soft &amp; apply the foundation so evenly &amp; effortless! Worth every penny &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, nice packaging.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a week now, no loose bristles.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Really soft!! I would say it&#x27;s as good if not better than the sigma flat top! You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price</li>
    <li> This brush is too short so all the makeup gets stuck in one place, even with tapping to remove excess.  When applying, it leaves a huge plume of makeup where you put the brush on your skin.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> First one was broken when I received, and had to return it. But second one works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my MAC branded brush purchased some years ago.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It&#x27;s soft yet strong and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Always wanted a foundation Kabuki brush, but never knew where to buy one that was good quality at a decent price. So glad I waited...this brush is amazing! Cant wait to buy a blending brush next!!!</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail and I love how soft it is. my old brush fell apart so I needed to buy a new one and after reading many reviews I decided on this one. I will update when I actually get a chance to use it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery reat product would order again</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!! Great purchase.This brush does NOT shed and I wash it weekly and sometimes twice. Dries fast with no odor and hold it&#x27;s shape well. Great for liquid foundation. I wish there was a whole set of these brushes available thru Amazon because I would purchase them immediately.</li>
    <li> wonderful brush, didn&#x27;t shed with the 1st use, very soft, holds lots of makeup.  I&#x27;m been very happy with this brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of awkward with make-up - this is a game changer. It totally changes the way my foundation looks (for the better)</li>
    <li> This brush was made very well but doesn&#x27;t hold enough mineral foundation as my alima pure brush. It seems to such up the foundation and blush. I do believe it was constructed very well and is very soft. Maybe there would have been a better brush for me to try from them. Very well constructed.</li>
    <li> Love this brush - I use it everyday with foundation application - works well for me!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this brush!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Good value.</li>
    <li> The brush is soft &amp; applies make up smoothly. The bristles are a perfect size for applying my foundation. The handle is easy to hold &amp; doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I bought the brush, but that all changed when i  received it. The brush was delivered really fast and the packaging looked great. Oh, this brush is really soft on the skin, which is a plus since I have sensitive skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is amazing! Works great!</li>
    <li> Great way to start your day with a new foundation brush that covers your face to perfection!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush! The best one I ever used..</li>
    <li> I forgot which YouTuber mentioned these brushes, but after I heard her mention them I automatically went and purchased this brush. Turns out this YouTuber was completely correct, they&#x27;re amazing! They&#x27;re super soft and they give me a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> The best brush ever 💃💃💃nice and soft blends beautifully</li>
    <li> I have been using this make-up brush for about 5-6 months now and I absolutely love it. I use it to apply my powdered foundation and it goes on very well. This brush is great at spreading the product on your face. It is also incredibly soft! I have used cheap brushes in the past and, with my extremely sensitive skin, they always irritated me. This brush absolutely does not do that; no red patches or itchy skin! I have also not witnessed any bristles coming out of the brush which is awesome! Absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Apply my Clinique foundation with this...I actually use less with this brush, and it goes on very nicely!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.  It is long lasting and feels good on my face when applying my foundation.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a brush to apply foundation before.  It blends in the foundation well.  I just have to remember to wash it every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. So soft and still gets the job done. Didn&#x27;t shed at all. Amazing price too!</li>
    <li> Just perfect! Really great quality with great application and flawless finish. Seriously surprised it doesn&#x27;t cost many times more! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I use it to apply my coverfx natural finish foundation and it works perfectly. I wash it weekly since September with little to no bristle fallout. It&#x27;s got dense bristles, feels sturdy, and I don&#x27;t feel like my product is being wasted. Also used it with my Diorskin Star foundation and I liked the coverage better then with the beauty blender. Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a brush like the Sigma F80...but better!</li>
    <li> When i got the brush i was excited of how it looked and felt. It was sturdy, the bristles were soft on my skin and it was just the right size to use with my mineral powder. I&#x27;m really satisfied with my order and most likely buy more brushes, its not pricey but it&#x27;s still quality.</li>
    <li> This brush is thick and makes your make up look flawless</li>
    <li> I have been lusting after the sigma F80 brush for a while now but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to drop that much money on a brush so I watched a ton of YouTube videos and came across one that mentioned this brush and how comparable it was to the sigma one so I immediately ordered it. I can&#x27;t compare this to the sigma F80 but I can&#x27;t imagine a brush gets much better than this honestly. The bristles are extremely dense and soft and apply foundation beautifully. The handle is sturdy and has a good solid feel to it which really shows this is well made product and not a knock off to a more expensive brand, this brush blows away any brush I&#x27;ve used in price range. I&#x27;ve already washed the brush twice and had no shedding whatsoever. I also want to mention that beauty junkees sent me an email with info on how to use and take care of the brush which has been the first communication I&#x27;ve ever had like that in the (what seems like ) hundreds of purchases I&#x27;ve made from amazon and it really shows that they are a company that cares about quality and customer satisfaction. Buy this brush you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Ordered the brush 2 days ago and it already arrived! I love it. Great brush for the price of it! Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush it is so so so soft if you are hesitant just buy it! It makes my foundation go on AMAZING</li>
    <li> Great brush for use, love it so much</li>
    <li> I usually read the reviews before I purchase something online and this time I am thrilled! It is the FIRST time that something works for me. I have always applied my foundation with my fingers but using the Flap Top brush has changed the whole thing. It is faster, easier and the result is just perfect. The brush is so smooth and I don&#x27;t get bristles on my face. I love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush! It got here in the mail right on time and I was not disappointed at all when I used it. I bought it for my liquid foundation and it works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I reviewed many different foundation brushes. Many people compared this brush to the Sigma F80 brush so i decided to give it a try. When i received the package i was very astonished to find that the bristles were very compact and very soft. I immediately used it as i had to go to a party and i loved how my foundation looked practically flawless on my skin. Before buying this product i would use my fingers but would often feel the product would go on unevenly. This brush is definitely a keep and I would highly recommend this brush to beginners if you want a good quality brush since it is not expensive.</li>
    <li> This brush makes a huge difference applying make up  because there is even coverage.</li>
    <li> Love it. Applies nicely and doesn&#x27;t use so much product.  It&#x27;s nice and dense. Comparable to pricier brushes.</li>
    <li> Good brush, and good quality. Happy with this brush and use it everyday!!!</li>
    <li> Got it same day!!.  Was exactly as described. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this make up brush. I have tried several brands including Sephora, smashbox, coastal scents,Sonia kashuk and real techniques brushes. This brush is dense, soft and has absolutely no fall out. I notice since purchasing it i use this brush to blend my foundation the most. The price is incredible and If your thinking that is a reflection of the quality than your wrong.i honestly would buy the entire set busy based off the quality of this brush</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have about the brush is that it should be a little more stiff.  Not sure I would order again only because it is too soft when swirling foundation. I am using it though.  Will be looking on Beauty Junkees for a similar but stiffer brush.  Totally pleased with Beauty Junkees price and service.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use with my Dior Airflash foundation. It works perfectly. I had initially purchased the Dior brush for 4 times the cost and decided I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for a foundation brush after I read reviews of this brush. I made a great choice. I&#x27;ll have to try some of their other brushes.</li>
    <li> Very nice but shouldn&#x27;t be used for Bare Minerals makeup, it makes a mess on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the quality of these brushes and look forward to professional results!</li>
    <li> Great brush for liquid foundation!  Absolutely flawless, perfect coverage no matter what brand of foundation you&#x27;re using.  Looks like airbrush!  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Beauty Junkees brushes! Great quality and affordable, this brush is super soft and perfect for applying powder or liquid foundation. I already have one but it&#x27;s quickly become my fav brush so I had to order an extra!</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush.  The results with a translucent powder are amazing! I highly recommend this makeup tool....</li>
    <li> the brisles are just a little longer than I expected, which ended up being a good thing for buffing in foundation. Blends nicely and evenly. Worth the price</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent service from Beauty Junkees. Wife happy.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Love my new kabuki brush!  Soft and feels nice on the skin. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday to apply my foundation since I received it.  My best friend commented last night how nice my skin looked.  Wonderful quality and definitely comparable to other high end brushes.  A+ experience with this seller.</li>
    <li> Best makeup brush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Blends beautifully!. I try it with a bb cream and also a foundation, its flawless. Got it on time, has tips for cleaning it. Its very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it looks so professional, the bristles are soft to the touch and when I blend out my foundation there are no streaks or lines on my face from the brush, it looks like an airbrushed finish and I look flawless. I highly recommend this brush if you wanna save some cash!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this brush when using for liquid makeup!  Great for powder also.</li>
    <li> Such a great brush! Doesn&#x27;t shed so far and the bristles are so soft and dense. Density is important so that you get even coverage and aren&#x27;t left with streaks. Also, foundation won&#x27;t be sucked into the brush. I just find this brush an absolute pleasure to work with. I will definitely keep getting this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It made foundation application and blending extremely easy. I was about to give up on my trusty foundation, but I wanted to try a new application method, and this brush was the answer. The brush is just the perfect amount of softness and stiffness. I am definitely going to try more of their products.</li>
    <li> Just received my Flat Top Kabuki brush. It came right on time, packaged nicely and it didn&#x27;t have any sort of smell upon opening. The brush is really soft and felt really good on my skin. I have pretty textured skin due to scaring and break outs, and this blended my foundation flawless. Already love this brush and I hope to try out the other brushes available very soon!  UPDATE: Unfortunately I now have to retire this fantastic make up brush. The brush hairs have now started falling out like crazy. It lasted quite some time through cleanings and daily use. Loved this brush and sad to see it finally go. Hoping to get around to purchasing another one soon.</li>
    <li> Most amazing brush Ive ever used! You use soooo much less product and it blends in like your real skin!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this.  I purchased this as suggested from a makeup artist on YouTube.  I&#x27;m SUPER glad that I did.  It makes my makeup look so much smoother.  I had previously been using a rounded brush</li>
    <li> Love this brush...and I work in the industry and am super jaded!  Has enough movement and covers enough surface area to really buff in foundation for a natural, flawless look.</li>
    <li> I used this brush and it was more than what I had ever expected. I took a leap of faith and bought the brush because it looked appealing, and the price was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t own any foundation brush, only miscellaneous ones for eyes, brows and blush. I always used my hands and I&#x27;ve seen YouTube makeup artists use sigma and thought why not. But I saw the cost of them and I&#x27;m like might as well get a MAC one then. But I came across beauty junkees and what caught my attention was the price which is half the price of other makeup brushes, and I read the reviews which claimed to be like The Best Brush Ever, Every Girls Gots To Has This. Obviously, that hyped me up. Yet, I was still apprehensive because I&#x27;m not comfortable with buying brushes online, like I have to feel the texture of the brush. Is it soft? Too soft? Is it stiff? Will it streak!? There was a lot of question going through my mind, but how will I ever know the truth if I don&#x27;t test it out myself. So I bought it, because it was a beautiful price and reviews was claiming it&#x27;s the bomb. It came in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler Alert: Packaging is thick, clear in the front/metallic on the back. Just want to warn you that once you open the package, this incredibly strong chemical odor hits you and you MUST wash your brush before using it! God knows what will happen to your face if you skip this step! You would probably be the only one writing a bad review because you didn&#x27;t wash the brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is absolutely a great buy! I use products from high end to drugstore, and lately my favorite&#x27;s been in the drugstore. When I first applied my foundation with my hands I can see the product on the surface of my skin (even after I prep &amp; prime), however, after I used the same foundation with this brush, WOW. Made my skin look flawless, I mean like as if my skin absorbed the foundation. It buffed in the foundation, and I don&#x27;t see my pores like I did before. The brush is SO easy to use, takes me like30 seconds to buff in the makeup all over, giving me medium-full coverage. The weight of the brush is quite heavy, and the brush comes with instructions on how to wash and take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed and totally satisfied with this product. Also came with a coupon in the packaging, so I&#x27;m just mind blown. Thank God, for leading me to buy this and saving me money! Great product! Must have!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, the brush is soft and works well.</li>
    <li> LOVE!! I cannot say enough good things about this brush! Best Dupe of a more expensive brand. Before, I used my fingers or a makeup blender, but that always left me with a &amp;#34;mask.&amp;#34; This helps glide my makeup on, and even does great with my liquid bronzer and mouse foundation!! Wish I could afford the others right now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush, but I find that no matter how many times I go over the bridge of my nose and try to blend, I get brush marks! Maybe it is not compatible with the particular brand of foundation I was using. I don&#x27;t have this problem on another part of my face, so it&#x27;s a bit of a mystery.</li>
    <li> This brush is so luxurious that I just wanted to brush it against my skin even when I wasn&#x27;t applying makeup! When I applied makeup however, I was impressed at how it gave me a soft look, not at all cakey or overly done. It&#x27;s convenient to keep in my purse to touch up my face throughout the day when the humidity of the South takes it&#x27;s toll. I&#x27;d definitely recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Got the brush today. Used it - amazing! Never thought foundation could look so flawless - honestly, so soft.. I got the flat brush for foundation, will probably get the others as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got the flat brush, very soft, looks fancy. Will try my hourglass liquid-powder foundation on.</li>
    <li> I bought this really wanting the sigma one but I cannot afford those brushes. So I got this one and WOW. It&#x27;s very nice and just amazing quality. I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months now and I&#x27;ve never seen it shed a hair! It&#x27;s very easy to clean with baby shampoo too. It&#x27;s very dense and makes my make up look air brushed. I would recommend this to anyone and I think every girl should have this brush! Very important to your face regime. Just as good as sigma, I promise, just get this one! Amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  so soft!  the only thing I wish was that cleaning instructions would have come with it... I washed it and submerged the whole thing ... hope my bristles don&#x27;t fall out now :(  I will definitely order more of these brushes.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised with the quality of this brush. It was very soft and dense. It applies my foundation like a dream. I have no issue with blending, shedding, and it cleans very easily. I recommend this brush to anyone and everyone looking for a great foundation brush. Shipping time was great too. I didn&#x27;t have to wait too long! I would buy from Beauty Junkees again due to the quality.</li>
    <li> This brush is everything I&#x27;ve wanted and more. I bought this to replace my old foundation brush because it was leaving streaky marks all over my face. This flat top kabuki leaves my foundation and BB cream on flawless! I feel like a new woman when I apply my makeup with the brush. It is just the right size and the bristles are packed super tight just like a kabuki is supposed to be. The handle is just the right amount of weight. I recommend this brush to anyone who wants their foundation to look flawless. I was a little hesitant to buy it at first because the price was so low compared to other high-end beauty brands but I was definitely not disappointed.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush it has been a life saver to applying makeup. For someone who doesn&#x27;t know much about makeup application THIS is the tool you need. It is sent with instructions for use, and instructions on how to clean. Blends my makeup perfectly even in the creases and no one notices. Awesome product and seller!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to use and soft . Will recommend this product to all. Highly satisfied and recommend the same to all</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a flattop kabuki brush. After watching Jacklyn Hill youtube make up tutorials, I saved on Sigmas brand and so far its been great quality and it was fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten into makeup and have tried to find an affordable option to apply flawless foundation. I&#x27;ve found it.  This is amazing, blends foundation flawlessly and didn&#x27;t really soak up any extra (I used the same amount that I usually use). I would recommend it for anyone. If you&#x27;ve gotten any high end bushes, I couldn&#x27;t compare because I don&#x27;t have any, but this is very fluffy, dense, easy to clean, and seems sturdy.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this brush. It&#x27;s great with a powder foundation too. Especially it&#x27;s not expensive and works great as the other branded brushes. I&#x27;m going to keep buying brushes from beauty junkees!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It came quickly and came in it&#x27;s own little box so there wouldn&#x27;t be any damage to itself. It&#x27;s so so soft and I love the way it feels on my quite sensitive face. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product, I just dotted it around my face and buffed it in and it was flawless! Super happy.</li>
    <li> This brush is really well made and is perfect for applying my liquid foundation. It gives me that smooth photo finish look I love!</li>
    <li> bought a flat kabuki and love it to bits! intro it to my fren who is very pleased with it too.We could see a difference when we used it with our foundation, there&#x27;s an airbrushed look about it. I can&#x27;t do without it now and couldn&#x27;t imagine how I did it with fingers back then. LOL. Will be getting the full set after this review.kkk</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing high quality brush that blends my foundation so well. The bristles are very soft. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Thanks to saaamage for helping me find such an amazing brush and brand. I plan on buying the face and eyes sets next.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first brought here because I was first buying the Sigma brush. After reading and watching the reviews I decided to give this one a try and I definitely don&#x27;t regret it. The brush is really soft yet firm enough to get the job done. I apply my foundation with this brush and it leaves a very smooth finish. So I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush.  I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of foundation and felt like it might look blotchy.  When I use this brush after applying my makeup, I know it is blended and smooth - no matter how little foundation I use.  Look forward to purchasing other brushes from Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> This brush is great, I use way less product than with other foundation brushes that I have used. The price is great, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. Its very soft yet firm enough to evenly and properly apply makeup.</li>
    <li> I like this brush.  Even foundation application. Soft and plush.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Bare Mineral powder foundation, and I like it better than the Bare Mineral brush that I purchased last year. The BM  brush sometimes doesn&#x27;t apply the powder evenly and my face would look blotchy.  I was surprise how nicely the brush got the powder on evenly without caking, I didn&#x27;t have to use a sponge to even out the application. As other reviewers noted, the brush is soft, so it feels better on my skin. and the dense brush may have help even out the powder? I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase - at half the price of the name brand brush, this is a great buy</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush very excellent quality</li>
    <li> Very well made! Had to try it right away! It is very soft and application flawless!</li>
    <li> I like this brush, it is soft and works well with my foundation. I will buy again in the future!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good makeup brush. It applies foundation really smooth and evenly. I really like it.</li>
    <li> When I saw this brush being used by one of my favorite youtubers I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brushes, higher end and drugstore, and while some worked well I always go back to by beauty blender. However, this brush is beyond amazing!&lt;br /&gt;  The shipping and processing was so incredibly fast. I ordered it Sunday and got it wednesday!! The quality of the brush itself is outstanding. It&#x27;s so soft and thick. Honestly it&#x27;s softer then the mac or sigma brushes. It hasn&#x27;t shed even a single fiber!  It works with lighter bb creams or with thicker full cover foundations. It&#x27;s worth the leap to try it. You will NOT regret it!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is EVERYTHING! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Beautifully soft and a good size to handle. Makeup goes on flawlessly. Washes well without losing bristles. Will def buy their products when I need brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft. Great application ! I absolutely love this brush and very inexpensive compared to most other brushes of similar quality .</li>
    <li> This awesome brush is the best I have ever held in my hands!!! it applies my cream and liquid foundation beautifully!!  My foundation looks flawless!</li>
    <li> Just received this brush in the mail yesterday. When I opened it, it had an unpleasant smell, however nothing seemed off about it. The bristles were really soft and I used it today to apply my foundation and it was not streaky at all. Overall it&#x27;s a great purchase and I&#x27;m looking to try out other brushes in the future.</li>
    <li> Just like the sigma f80 flat top kabuki. I have both. :) The only thing is the handle is getting loose. I am careful when washing it so I don&#x27;t know?</li>
    <li> Great quality, so happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush! Does the job well, super soft bristles and just the right size. Perfect for foundation and setting powder. I was looking for a good brush that wouldn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and this is it. Will definitely come back for more brushes in the future. I also like the size of it, all I can ever find in affordable but good kabuki brushes are really huge and bulky and often short. This isn&#x27;t small, but I like that it isn&#x27;t extremely difficult to store.</li>
    <li> I just recently started wearing makeup and a friend highly recommended this product .. I received it yesterday and used it today .. I loved it!!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! My foundation was evenly applied with this brush! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Received my new brush in about a week or less and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase! I&#x27;m beginning to rely less on my fingers and more on brushes and this kabuki brush really does all the work in applying my liquid foundation. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but would definitely recommend this to any of my friends!!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprise by the quality of this brush! i was so tired of paying so much money on brushes and decided to give this a try and im glad i did!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing, especially for the price. i love it!</li>
    <li> I loved how soft this brush felt on my skin. I&#x27;ve washed it a couple of times (had it for almost a weeks so far) and there was not shedding. This brush had no odors. I have been using it to apply liquid foundation. the bristles part is dense but not super firm it is flexible so that the bristles are bendy as you move the brush in a circular motion around your face.  This is the first kabuki brush I have used and I am happy that I purchased this brush.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my daughter in college and she LOVED it!  My younger daughter borrowed it and also LOVED it, so this is the 2nd one we have ordered.</li>
    <li> Perfect Brush! I love its delicate texture and it makes my makeup routine super easy in the morning. Great with BB, CC creams, so much easier to use than sponge. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s dense but there is movement to it.  You can make your foundation sheer or add more for fuller coverage.  Some brushes could be so dense that it causes my dry skin to lift and show more.  This brush is perfect for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, ordered the brush on a Wednesday and got it Friday! Love the brush- it&#x27;s very soft and distributes my make up evenly.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet but I&#x27;m totally stoked &amp; I&#x27;m very excited to try.</li>
    <li> I love this Kabuki Brush as it is very soft, very easy to use. Does not harm my skin when i brush it onto my face. This is my 1st Kabuki brush ever and definitely no regrets on buying it! Beauty Junkees are also very generous to share some pointers regarding cleaning and how to use the brush!</li>
    <li> Ordered it on Saturday and got it on monday!! The brush felt great, blended my liquid foundation very well. It works so much better than my MAC brush and it doesnt shed!</li>
    <li> Received my brush very promptly and I was amazed at the quality and density of the bristles; especially at this price point. Applied my foundation for a lunch outing and I am thrilled at how flawless and quick this brush gets the job done. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Good quality especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Have been using this brush for about a week now and loving it so far! I am using this brush to apply Bare Minerals gel based, liquid foundation. Application takes a little longer than powder foundation and needs many strokes (as it should) but final look is flawless. There is no heavy deposit on the brush so cleaning will probably be easy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is that it was squashed in the package when it arrived making it more of a rectangular brush than a round one! Note to amazon/supplier to take care of these things because these things do matter!</li>
    <li> Love it...What great coverage.. Very happy with my brush</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this brush.  Bristles are just the right kind of soft for me.  Also like the wooden handle on this brush.</li>
    <li> I just received this brush today and I was pretty pleased with it! It is so soft and well made! I tested it out with my favorite foundation and it applied so easy and blended everything out so easily!! Will definitely be buying the rest of this collection!</li>
    <li> This is everything I hoped it would be! The bristles are soft and dense. It gives a smooth clean finish on your skin.</li>
    <li> Works great, slides on my foundation smoothly.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is my first time using a kabuki brush and I really really love it! It gives me a great finish and makes foundation really easy to apply! I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s not as expensive as other makeup brushes but it gets the job done exceptionally well!</li>
    <li> Really happy with this brush and the price.  Makes putting on bb cream so much easier. Just squeeze a little out directly onto the brush and then I use it to blend on my face.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Super soft! I use it for my foundation and it goes on smooth. Very easy to clean (i just use regular blue dawn dish soap).</li>
    <li> Love love love this product....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! Applies my liquid foundation so flawlessly! I have had the sigma flat top kabuki and this 1 by far surpasses it! Definitely would recommend this brush line to anyone looking for affordable and awesome makeup brushes!</li>
    <li> Great flat kabuki brush to apply foundation, similar to my sigma F80. Flawless finish!</li>
    <li> Great quality!!!  I  use this brush everyday to apply my foundation. Works like a charm. Doesn&#x27;t shed and feels very soft. Gives a great finish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush a few times and so far I really like it. It&#x27;s not as good as my more expensive brushes, but I&#x27;m fine with that since this is much cheaper. There were a few loose and bent hairs when I received it and it lost a few more hairs when I first washed it, but it still looks sturdy. I haven&#x27;t used it for powders, but it works very well for my liquid foundation. Overall great brush at the price.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Looking forward to trying other brushes from this company. It is on my top 10 brushes to use regularly!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, one of my favorites.  I will definitely purchase more items.</li>
    <li> I love my new Flat Top Kabuki Brush!  The bristles are so soft which are perfect for my overly sensitive skin.  This brush is great for applying my light mineral powder for a flawless finish. I would recommend anyone buying this brush!</li>
    <li> AHHH! I love this brush already! It&#x27;s so soft! And feels like I&#x27;m touching my face with silk! Hurry! Get them all! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft yet dense.  I lightly dip the brush, and briskly and lightly brush in a circular motion to give even coverage. Best way to apply foundation. Love this brush!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and good for blending. The customer service was excellent as well. Overall, very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> I received my item on time.... wow I was immediately blown away with the quality of the brush at such a low cost. Ladies this brush is on the same level as sigma brushes the only difference is the cost. Using this brush I immediately notice the difference flawless finish without the shedding. Awesome I love, love, love absolutely love it:)</li>
    <li> I actually use this brush as my foundation brush and powder. It applys my foundation evenly and sets my powder smoothly. I use scream foundation and I have found that I use less product now then when I used my fingers to apply. I recommend anyone to use this brush it is a quick and easy tool to have in your make up kit.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised at how soft the bristles are and how evenly it spread my foundation.  I used it with BB cream and to apply powder.  It works well with both.  I will probably be buying a second one very soon because I have a feeling my daughter will soon be claiming this one as her own!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!</li>
    <li> This made a huge difference in how I apply my makeup.  No more streaks, and no more problems blending into my neck.  Blending into your neck with your fingers is pretty much impossible without having weird streaks and patches.  The bristles COULD be tighter packed I think.  But not bad!</li>
    <li> Best foundation brush can&#x27;t beat the money either iv always used big brands that r way to expensive and now only go to this one. My friends are hooked on this too iv had to reorder several as gifts</li>
    <li> Love it! I use this as my liquid foundation brush and it is not only high quality for such a great price, but it works really well. My coverage is flawless whenever I use it. Would totally buy more of these brushes.</li>
    <li> A very soft brush... works great.</li>
    <li> The best foundation brush I have ever owned! And for the price, forget buying the MAC and LORAC brushes. It has not shed once and has held up for 2 years now</li>
    <li> Its good brush but after months of using it. wash it once with soap and water. It came apart a few days ago. The little brush hair just keep falling and i no longer can use it somehow my other brushes have lasted longer even after wash....</li>
    <li> best foundation brush and best price</li>
    <li> Almost identical to my sigma brush. This brush I use for powder or liquids. Great brush.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush several weeks ago. The.shipping was super fast which I loved! You MUST follow the initial instructions before first use. The brush smells funky when you receive it, however I followed the prep instructions to a T and the smell was gone and I was left with a lovely brush which was densely packed and super soft. I&#x27;ve never used one before so I was a first timer trying a kabuki brush. I figured it out quickly. It takes a little longer to apply foundation than by hand but the finish is so much better. All in all, I love this brush and highly recommend over a more exspensive product.</li>
    <li> Great makeup coverage but can not get it clean.</li>
    <li> The bristles keep falling out.</li>
    <li> I use this makeup brush every single day, or at least every time I apply foundation. It delivers a smooth airbrushed look. The bristles are super soft and it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product.</li>
    <li> Incredible quality for this low price!  As good as my pricy MAC foundation brush👍</li>
    <li> Brush is very soft and not harsh on my sensitive skin...so far so good</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have never used a brush before for my foundation. Someone told me about it so I bought this one because of the great reviews. It&#x27;s all true! I absolutely love this brush! Their customer service was really good too! Will buy from them again!</li>
    <li> This brush is PERFECT for applying cream or liquid foundation.  It blends it very easily and evenly.  A definite must have in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I felt like I had to for this brush. I was leery of all the good reviews because I&#x27;ve learned that not all reviews are from actual users. So, I thought I should write a review since I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a few months. I LOVE it! It melts foundation into your skin with very little left on the brush. When I wash the brush, I&#x27;m always amazed at how little product is left on the brush. It feels wonderful and buffs your makeup with a completely flawless finish. I would never want to apply my foundation now without it! If you&#x27;re on the fence about this purchase, buy it! You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> Workes amazing better than any sponge! Doesn&#x27;t soak up and of my makeup and goes on like velvet and looks natural with very good coverage! Don&#x27;t even have to use a powder on top anymore. One draw back it did shed like 3 little things but not a big deal!</li>
    <li> originally bought this brush because it was a great price, but wow its the best brush I have ever owned.  I use it with my Tarte Amazonian Clay Smoothing Balm.  The brush is soft and gentle yet firm enough to blend the Balm onto my face very well.  I plan replacing all my brushes from Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase until the handle fell off</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a brush for foundation, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try. You get the same coverage but you don&#x27;t need to use as much and it looks better. This is a great quality brush. The company even sent an email with use and care instructions and followed up to make sure I received it when I was supposed to. I&#x27;d definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to give this brush 5 stars, but after only a few months of use, the bristles are coming off all over my face.</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush.  It is my 2nd one I purchased.  The first one I purchased, I killed it. Somehow when I was cleaning it, it completed shredded and fell apart. I cried and called my girlfriend who purchased the same brush as me at the same time, her brush was perfect! So I came to a conclusion I messed up the brush. But I was so much in love with it because it give such a fabulous application to any foundation,  bb &amp; cc cream , even tinted moisturizer.  I even recommended  this brush to so many of my friends. It lead me to create a YouTube Channel.  So now with my new purchase,  I can do a Beauty Junkees haul on my brush! Love  it to the moon and back.</li>
    <li> Great brush, so far holding up really well no problems for past 3 months.</li>
    <li> Very soft, never irritate my skin, or shed. Can&#x27;t believe it just cost a little bit more than 10 bucks. I will definitely purchase another brush from this brand.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly no problems here</li>
    <li> I have used top named brand brushes from Bobbi Brown, MAC, Sigma, etc.. I have to say this brush is awesome! It applies my foundation flawlessly! It is perfect size and not cheap by any means except the price! I am so glad I purchased this brush it is definitely one of my Favorites!</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush, wonderful quality. I had never used a good quality make-up brush before because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money. But this brush was such a bargain and had good reviews elsewhere that I gave it a try. Do it, spend the money and see and feel the difference![[ASIN:B00F008GFQ Flat Top Kabuki Brush By Beauty Junkees: Perfect Liquid Foundation Brush, Get Full Makeup Coverage Every Time, Vegan Friendly, Works with Creams, Powders, Liquids, and Mineral Makeup. Synthetic Dense Bristles That Do Not Shed, Quality Compares to Sigma and Mac.</li>
    <li> This brush works great and is less expensive than other Kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve seen.  I like the longer handle as it&#x27;s easier to work with.  Best part is the bristles don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> First the price and shipping are first class. This product got to me on the estimated date of arrival, which was within days of ordering. The price is amazing and half that of the Sigma brush. The quality is pretty good, I am not sure yet if it is what I was looking for when applying my foundation, but is a good quality brush! I would recommend this product to a friend!</li>
    <li> So I have been looking for a liquid foundation brush like this forever. I hate the traditional paintbrush like ones. I have some acne scarring and large ish pores and this brush is amazing for stippling (lightly dabbing) the makeup into my scars and it makes my skin look flawless, airbrushed almost. The bristles are super soft and don&#x27;t shed at all. I wish I found this sooner!</li>
    <li> I am in love with my brush! It leaves my face looking flawless. I definitely plan on investing in more of the Beauty Junkee brushes. I love how Beauty Junkee sends out emails confirming if you&#x27;ve recieved your brush yet and tips on how to properly care for your brushes.</li>
    <li> They no longer make the sonia kashuk giant flat kabuki brush I used.  This isn&#x27;t as big and although I would prefer the one I had before, this does a fine job as a &#x27;runner up.&#x27;  Very happy with this purchase! Update 4-7-2017 - I bought another!  My first one is just now beginning to shed, so I wanted to make sure I had another!</li>
    <li> I use to think using my fingers to put on foundation was quicker, but stifling is so much faster and you end up using less foundation!</li>
    <li> Brush exactly as described. Works really well, dries faster than expected. Handle perfect length. Bristles soft and securely attached. Company almost too customer service oriented. Very enthusiastic.</li>
    <li> Perfect feel, compact, soft bristles with a strong lush feel. Very impressed. I have not put it to make-up yet, I bought it for blush ( I don&#x27;t like usual &amp;#34;blush brushes&amp;#34;). I really like it! also arrived right away, and was nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering another one of these brushes as a back up. Terrific quality!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite brushes. I use it as my primary brush for my mineral foundation. The bristles are very compact and there is no fall out. I have been using the brush for over a year and a half and it is still going strong. I will purchase a new one in the future if mine fails. I use this brush as often or more than my high end brushes.</li>
    <li> I, like many other reviewers, am very particular about my makeup brushes. I was actively seeking the sigma F80 brush but was concered about pricing when Beauty Junkees, popped up on my similar products, and I am so glad it did! This flat kabuki is so incredibly soft, steals no product, and applys foundation flawlessly. I could not have asked for a smoother complection after using this brush! Highly recommened, and great customer service from Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no make up guru but I like this brush. It does do a great job in smoothly applying foundation. I honestly don&#x27;t even wash it as I should and its still doing fine.</li>
    <li> I love it! This is the best brush I have used so far! I will definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> Love it! Super soft and applies makeup nicely. I am very please with this product and the price I paid for it</li>
    <li> This is my first kabuki brush and i love it. my make up looks flawless. Would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Shipping was 2 days off but that&#x27;s fine because they added an extra product. The extra product was a brush gloves, and they&#x27;re quite handy actually. The brush is exactly as seen and exactly as described (A++). I&#x27;ve used it twice and I lOVE it! Leaves makeup looking smooth. I also used it for powder application which it&#x27;s great for(: The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is when I opened it, the brush had a spray paint odor but that was an easy fix by washing it. Overall, great product and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase (;</li>
    <li> I love this brush. At first when I purchased it, I was a bit skeptical because I had never heard of the brand. Also I thought it was a reasonable price, so I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it. When I received the brush, just when I opened the package and held it, it has a really nice feel. I would even say it can be similar or even better than those expensive brushes. The bristles are very soft and they don&#x27;t fall apart and it leaves makeup looking flawless. I would buy the entire collection if all the other brushes have the same feel. I am happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush, I loved it to death, but I had it for maybe 9 months and the handle detached from the head. A good brush for beginners but if you want a pro brush that&#x27;s gonna last, look somewhere else. And yes, I washed it properly being careful not to let water seep through. The head was always wobbly. Eventually it just came off. I still used it for a while without the handle but eventually pitched it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush.  It is so soft!  It truly makes a huge difference using a brush.  It makes your foundation look flawless.  I am so happy I decided on this  brush. It didn&#x27;t take long to decide because this brush had great reviews for good reason.  Look no further for a fabulous foundation brush ,  this one is IT!&lt;br /&gt;And &amp;#34; Randall&amp;#34; is my husband and he doesn&#x27;t wear makeup! He wanted me to clear that up!!! :)</li>
    <li> I had never used a brush to apply liquid makeup before; but since I felt I wasn&#x27;t getting enough coverage with my mineral makeup any longer I decided to switch but didn&#x27;t want that awful &amp;#34;makeup line&amp;#34; that is soo obvious if you don&#x27;t apply the liquid stuff correctly. This brush is absolutely wonderful! You just buff the makeup in using little circles all over your face and it really does work beautifully. This brush is cheap in price but great in quality. A must if you use liquid foundation. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am NOT a makeup girl, and I literally know close to nothing about makeup. I recently started wearing a light cream foundation with SPF, and this brush applies it flawlessly. I bought a lot of brushes that claimed to do this and wasted a lot of $, but they all felt scratchy on my face and didn&#x27;t apply better than my fingers. This brush is totally different and gives me that &#x27;airbrushed&#x27; look the youtube beauty gurus are always talking about!</li>
    <li> This served its purpose well enough. After using it for awhile and leaning more about brushes I started noticing that my foundation was sticking more to the brush than my face. So I went and bought a sigma brand kabuki  which I&#x27;m in love with. My foundation goes on my face so much better and after using it like 10 times it&#x27;s time to wAsh it as opposed to this one where after one use it needs to be washed. I couldn&#x27;t hardly bring myself to purchase a makeup brush ( sigma kabuki) that cost more than it takes to fill up my car but I&#x27;m sooo glad I did.</li>
    <li> Great Kabuki brush...I&#x27;ve had others and for the price this one is perfect!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend using this brush if your looking for that airbrush look...the bristles are nice an soft an they dont shed..which I think is important, there is nothing more irritating than when your trying to put on your foundation an there are little black bristles left all over your face. So if your a beauty junkee like I am then this is one brush you should have in your makeup kit.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation brush i have  ever owned. Your foundation looks liike its airbrushed on when you&#x27;re done.No lines or cakiness...just absolutely  flawless.Thank you Beauty Junkees for a great product. Also had to mention delivery was excellent before time actually and customer service was excellent...thank you Julie!</li>
    <li> I use a tiny bit of foundation and use the brush to even it out across my face.  With this brush, I use less foundation and the consistency of the application is amazing, almost airbrushed.</li>
    <li> The handle of the one I got looks different from the pictures. Mine is round at the bottom not flat like the pictures and you tube videos. The ferrule is also fargo and has dents when I barely use it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Makes applying my liquid foundation so much easier and more even. :) I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get this sooner.</li>
    <li> Ok first let me say that I am a frequent buyer on Amazon and this is my first review. I felt this product was that good! I loved this brush that much! I&#x27;ve been wanting this brush for a while and had been eyeing the other more popular brands, but this one popped up and I&#x27;m so glad it did!!! It&#x27;s an amazing brush!!! None like I&#x27;ve ever experienced, super soft bristles and IT REALLY DOES GIVE THAT AIR BRUSHED FLAWLESS LOOK! I&#x27;m going to buy another just because! I absolutely love it! Fast shipping, great customer service and an instructional email was sent to me on how to use it, and the price was soooo ridiculously reasonable!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality! This brush is so soft and when I ordered it on Saturday night it literally came the next day. I can&#x27;t wait to put it to good use! Thank you so much for your kind businnes!</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this brush. It is so soft and blends my (admittedly more expensive) cream foundation. I take my makeup seriously and I don&#x27;t think I will ever but another blending foundation brush again.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! Ordering several more due to fast two day delivery and excellent product.</li>
    <li> Nice brush for a great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this brush. This was the first time I heard of this brand and I&#x27;m glad I did. After a couple of searches, I found a new brush to apply my foundation and powder with. I will continue to learn more about this company and purchase another brush!</li>
    <li> Wish the brush was a lot firmer and not so flimsy , still gets the job done</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush! I was going to go with a expensive Sigma brush but this one caught my eye and I am so glad I got it. It blends beautifully and didn&#x27;t break the bank! I am so pleased to have it in my make up routine and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have a pretty extensive brush collection, both high and low end. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great brush to add to my collection, and this flat top kabuki brush did not dissapoint. The bristles are soft yet dense and do not shed when washed. My liquid makeup goes on smootly and coverage can be built up easily.  This is an excellent, quality brush.</li>
    <li> This brush makes my foundation finish look much better than with my real techniques brush. When buffing, it is very precise and gives a nice flawless finish. Also, the company was awfully nice by sending me a detailed description of their brushes and an explanation on how to use each one, including the one I bought. They were really considerate and overall polite? I&#x27;ve bought several products here on Amazon and I&#x27;ve rarely ever gotten such treatment before and after buying their product. I am very pleased by the product, manners, and overall, them. I will definitely recommend and check out the rest of their brushes, and hopefully buy more things from them in the future. A+!!</li>
    <li> This brush is super soft! I like it so much better than the Sigma Flat Kabuki and it is also so much cheaper! Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> This is an extremely good brush. I had never used a brush to apply foundation before. I saw a video on YouTube and just had to try it. I must say I like it very much. It applies the foundation flawlessly. So far I have not noticed any shedding within the month that I have been using it.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush, very nice price! I will be checking out more of their brushes!</li>
    <li> I just got this brush a couple days ago; shipping was quick. I used it once so far and I can already tell that I&#x27;ll be reaching for it more often. I used it with a liquid foundation. The only con that I see so far is that I noticed I had to use an extra pump of foundation than my regular routine with this brush; I&#x27;m not entirely sure if the brush holds on to a lot of the liquid product. On the other hand, I can tell that if you use this brush with powder, it will definitely work well. I saw a youtuber use this and wanted to try it out. Overall with the price, not bad. No regrets.</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely amazing! I was very excited when I ordered this because I was really looking for a foundation brush that would give me that natural airbrush look without having to use so much product. I would use sponges to apply my foundation and found that the sponges would  soak up my product rather than directly apply it to my face, plus, I&#x27;d break out a lot even if they were clean or new. When I&#x27;d use my (clean) hands, I would find a lot of uneven patches on my face after applying my foundation. So after hearing about how amazing flat top Kabuki brushes are by many renowned makeup artists, I decided to give it a try and honestly I am very satisfied with the results I got using this brush. When I used it for the first time today I literally didn&#x27;t need no more than a quarter sized drop of foundation to cover my face beautifully. It was enough to cover my acne scars and made my face look really fresh! I&#x27;d definitely recommend others to purchase this brush!</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush!! I use for cream and liquid foundation. Very large and soft!</li>
    <li> Compared to a Sigma it is more dense. Still an OK brush</li>
    <li> Why was I drooling over out-of-reach Sigma brushes when this has been here the whole time? I love how soft this is. It works way better than my Real Tehniques Expert Face Brush for my thicker, more matte foundations. With this, I can blur my oh so large pores and acne pockmarks better. The foundation still settles in but I blame that on not having a better primer. Anyways, I get amazing coverage and don&#x27;t have to spend a long time blending and buffing. Overall, this is just the best so far. I am looking forward to spoiling myself with the set plus brush holder(:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion I do have is maybe make more colors. I love brushes that have a rose gold/copper look more than the silver. I think it would make the brushes look even more gorgeous. Or even change the color of the handle for a limited time. Like instead of black, have dark red or mint or baby blue. Or put some sort of fancy design like roses or lace or swirls. Anything that would add that extra special feel whenever you pick it up.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft &amp; non-irritating to the skin.  It also really gives you an airbrushed finish!  Would recommend buying an additional (smaller) brush to apply foundation &amp; concealer for the areas around the nose &amp; eyes.</li>
    <li> This brush is actually pretty good, especially for the price.  It is actually very good quality.  It&#x27;s better quality that the Pur Minerals flat top foundation brush.  I like that the bristles are very compact and the brush is extremely soft.  It applies both liquid and powder as well as BB cream pretty good.  It also worked well for stippling and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks after blending.  I&#x27;d say overall, great brush for the price!  I&#x27;ve also purchased the angled blush brush from beauty junkees since I liked the foundation brush so much and it is just as good as I thought it would be...the bare minerals angled brush I currently have applies blush in a blotchy fashion and is kind of straw like...this brush is soft and blends the blush in so much better even with a lot of blush on the brush it doesn&#x27;t create harshness on the cheeks...it just blends right in...will definitely buy more brushes in the future!!</li>
    <li> the best foundation brush i ever owned. received it so fast.</li>
    <li> I love this more than my Mac brushes</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for over a month now, and I absolutely love it. It is very well made, very soft, and most importantly no leftover hair from the brush on your face...I put the liquid foundation on the back of my hand and pick it up with this brush, then I go over my face with circular motions, the foundation comes out flawless!  I have washed it about 5-6 times already and it&#x27;s still new like the first day...</li>
    <li> Good brush, well made.  Evens foundation well.</li>
    <li> This is simply the very best to apply liquid foundation.  This Flat Top Kabuki Brush is marvelous!!. I would never in a million years have thought of applying foundation with a brush.  But is so very easy plus  the makeup looks like it is your own skin [not makeup].  You really have to see it to believe it.  Received so many compliments on my &amp;#34;improved looks&amp;#34;.  The Flat Top Brush is the answer to making your face look un-made up. Just a quick tip: apply moisterizer to clean face - wait at least 10 minutes [or even 3 hrs.] Put a few dot of the makeup on strategic places on face and quickly swirl the brush all around your face.  The makeup applied this way, will last so-o-o-o long you won&#x27;t believe it. Thanks Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! It is VERY comparable to the high end brushes...especially one in particular (Sigma)... which I just purchased and received as well. I hope beauty junkees comes out with more brushes! I would definitely purchase!!</li>
    <li> Applies foundation flawlessly, easy to build on if you need more coverage. No streaks or spots. I apply by putting small dots of foundation on a section of my face, then lightly tap in a stipple movement until its well blended. Cleans easily (I usually clean every 3 days or so). This is the best brush I&#x27;ve come across for liquid foundation, for the price it is a great deal. Ive owned since january and it continues to hold up well, even with everyday use.</li>
    <li> I recently invested in some fancy CC cream that they recommend be applied with a brush. I considered buying brand X&#x27;s but the cost was too much for me to stomach. I know good brushes can be an investment but $40+ is just crazy. So instead I took a chance on the Beauty Junkees kabuki brush (at a fraction of the cost) and - wow! - I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s become my go-to tool, and I&#x27;m definitely going to add some more of their brushes to my collection. Also, and perhaps this is a bit silly, but I liked that the follow up email from the seller included some very helpful cleaning tips. If you&#x27;re looking for a good foundation brush that doesn&#x27;t cost as much as a Sunday brunch, definitely give this one a try!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush.  Excellent quality.  Feels great on my face and really blends in my tinted mosturizer into my skin.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever used! I recommend it to everyone! Leaves a flawless finish everytime</li>
    <li> Very soft yet sturdy. The bristles are the perfect density for smoothing on liquid foundation. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foundation brush!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now,  I have tried it with several different foundations and I get a beautiful, smooth and even application every time.  Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Very happy</li>
    <li> Like the Sigma brush everyone in make-up talks about. Very soft but tough and foundation application is flawless. When putting on liquid foundation i suggested putting a penny size amount on the back of your hand and just tapping the brush in it. A little goes a long way. Love this kabuki brush!!</li>
    <li> The FTKB is AWESOME!  The bristles is extremely soft and I love the way the foundation glides on my face.  I only need to apply very little foundation to get a full coverage.  This FTKB brush is much better than the foundation brush I have that has the flat bristles.  The FTKB is a must have.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery!  The brush feels great on my face and is very soft.  It is perfect for applying my foundation.</li>
    <li> These are good quality brushes and deliver just what they promise! The different shapes are perfect for all your make-up needs. My favorite part is having no loose bristles falling out on my face,they are also super soft and feel so good on your skin. The brushes do not soak up your product ,but simply apply it to your face ,leaving no brush strokes behind.Great for applying my make-up, keeping my hands clean.I would definitely recommend these brushes !</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes, and excellent customer service!  It&#x27;s true that Beauty Junkees stands behind their product, no questions asked. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing from them again!</li>
    <li> I really love this brush! It works well with my foundation. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ve ordered two more just in case.</li>
    <li> Handle fell off brush.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brush are amazing and high quality. I gave it a low rating because the base detached from the handle the 2nd day of use. A bit disappointed and I just don&#x27;t have time to return it so I&#x27;m eating the cost of the brush. :-(</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Customer service gives great tips on use of the brush and cleaning.  Bristles are soft and gives a nice coverage.</li>
    <li> Received my brush super quick, I was very happy with the quality of the brush - especially for the price.  I am still getting used to it, I use with my cream foundation.  I received an email with directions on how to use the brush even before it arrived!  The bristles are extremely soft and I did not have any fallout, so glad I purchased this item.  If you are on the fence about buying this flat top brush, I would recommend that you go ahead and purchase.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I was looking to experiment with flat topped brushes, so I didn&#x27;t want to buy one that was too expensive. It ended up being a super high-value and awesome choice of brush. It applies makeup very well and my skin has never looked clearer. It&#x27;s soft, easy to use, easy to clean, and seems to be holding up very well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend trying it, even if you&#x27;ve never used a stifling brush before.</li>
    <li> I have used this on both liquid and powder and its perfect for any use. The bristles are soft and I have only noticed one or two getting loose and falling out and I have washed it 5+ times. The packaging is quite cute and sleek too. Mute have brush in your collection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so soft! This is my first brush and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush to put liquid moisturizer on it. It works perfectly!! Item was shipped and received on time and the packaging was great. It was even better than described!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts but this is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had. I can&#x27;t believe I got it for such a low price. Make up goes on so smooth!!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing, my make up has never looked better. It blends perfectly onto your skin and it looks soo natural. Extremely happy with his purchase. It is better than Sephora brush I paid $40 for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fabulous little brush to apply my liquid foundation.  I love it! No shedding, and I get a lovely, even soft finish.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to using a sponge, again!</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and brush seems of very good quality.  Beauty Junkies send follow up emails asking about service and providing tips on use and cleaning of the brush (who knew to use olive oil!)</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic. It&#x27;s extremely dense and puts on my whipped foundation flawlessly. I believe I can say it has tremendously improved my makeup world ;)</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this brush, it apply my foundation evenly and does not suck up the product at all.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING!! I love how well it blends my liquid foundation, I haven&#x27;t had ANY issues with it at all. I&#x27;m definitely a fan!</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! I use it faithfully and I featured it in one of my YouTube videos. Thanks You Beauty Junkees for making such a fine Flat Top Brush!</li>
    <li> Great product, and it does not leave behind any of the tiny little hairs that other brushes do. My make up looks flawless!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this make up brush because I have previously by highly rated make up brushes on Amazon but yet when I receive the brushes they are of cheap terrible quality. However that was not the case with this brush. This brush is worth the amazing ratings it has received! I am amazed by how smoothly this brush blends my concealer and foundation. This brush is definitely worth the price and I am very glad that I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush for applying my liquid foundation. I&#x27;ve tried different brushes that made me look too caked on, this gives a nice airbrushed look and the price makes it even more perfect (for me anyways)</li>
    <li> Works like the more expensive brushes</li>
    <li> I just ordered my 2nd kabuki brush because not having a back-up gave me anxiety!  I love, love this foundation brush. I am quite pale so every blemish is noticeable.  I have been using one of those sponge wedges to apply my foundation for YEARS until I started looking for other ways to apply make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is the perfect length. The bristles are incredibly soft and bound very tightly. No worries of ever having to pick little stray bristles adhered to your face by foundation.  The circumference of the brush widens after a few uses but the bristles don&#x27;t separate enough to the point where it makes it difficult to isolate a specific spot on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the 1st brush I bought for over 3 months and after a few cleanings, it works as great as it did the day it arrived!  I have no expectation of this one expiring anytime soon but just the thought of something terrible happening to it (me losing it, cat thinking it is a rodent, etc), terrifies me! :)</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever used. I use it to apply my foundation and to blend my highlights/contours. It makes my makeup look light, smooth, and professional. The brush is very well made.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using sponges to apply my foundation, but wanted to try something different. I&#x27;m so glad I came across the Kabuki foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It blends foundation flawlessly. It is my favorite makeup tool.</li>
    <li> I have never used a brush to apply liquid foundation, but the reviews were so good that I had to give it a try. This one definitely did not disappoint, and I&#x27;m so glad I made the purchase. I applied make up forever foundation and it went on flawlessly with this brush. I typically use the beauty blender sponge, which I love, but this is a great option to apply liquid foundation as well.</li>
    <li> This brush is super soft. This flat kabuki brush feels like silk on my skin.The brush is nice an thick  and will hold its shape , the handle has a nice weight and is very comfortable to the touch. The price was so affordable so no need to pay those high end prices with another company, this brush is a 5 star all the way!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t apply make-up well at all.  Not dense enough and the hairs are coming out</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush. This was 2nd attempt at a foundation brush and I&#x27;m glad I found a good one. It is firm and bristle-dense as well as soft at the same time. I use it with cream foundation and it works perfectly fine, does not strictly need to be liquid foundation to use it. Brushes do come in a package and smell like fresh paint (which is really strong for me) I had to wash them before using them but they provide excellent step by step tips on how to wash your brush if you&#x27;ve never have.</li>
    <li> Great flat brush , blends well , great price too lol. and the hairs doesn&#x27;t fall out when I wash it . Definitely recommend to whomever .</li>
    <li> I was originally looking to buy a Sigma Flat Top Kabuki brush but I&#x27;m not a big makeup user (just some foundation, concealer and eye shadow here and there) so I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend $30+ on a brush. I came across the Beauty Junkees Foundation Makeup Brush Flat Top Kabuki brush and when I saw the price of $12 I almost didn&#x27;t want to take a second look but I am so glad I did! I read review after review raving about how great this brush is and how it compares to Sigma brushes! I originally thought this brush was going to be hard and rough (as some Kabuki brushes are) but it is SUPER soft!! When I use this brush to apply foundation, it leaves a flawless finish. I also own the Real Technique 4-piece brush set and used to use their Foundation Brush but it often leaves my foundation looking cracked and chappy and streaks are visible. This is the one brush I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t do that. It had a very strong rubber/plastic smell which makes sense as it came in a thick plastic envelope but after a wash and letting it air dry, the smell was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this brush! 5/5</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for less than a month now and was obsessed with it when I first got it. After every time I used this brush I would clean it, like how many do. But when I had recently washed this brush it started to shed A LOT. I never submerged it in water or flipped the brush upright when washing it. Sooner or later the brush kept on shedding and later feel apart. I am disappointed that this amazing brush lasted for a short amount of time. This brush is amazing for foundation, but one should be very cautious when taking care of it.  UPDATE: Beauty Junkees quickly contacted me regarding my issue with their brush. Their customer service is quick yet efficient. I really appreciate their efforts to help out customers, so they can further improve their company.</li>
    <li> Man this does the job right.</li>
    <li> I found out about Beauty Junkees from Hot&amp;Flashy on you tube. She said these brushes are comparable to ones by Sigma and It Cosmetics for less money. I ordered it and just loved it. My make-up looks so much better. I ordered this one for my daughter. She is thrilled with it. They are really great brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this flat top brush. My foundation blends flawlessly using this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush for it&#x27;s price, soft bristles, blends my foundation really well I like it! And it arrived really fast</li>
    <li> Great quality and good size. Got this to add as a travel brush for my foundation but will come in handy at home also.&lt;br /&gt;The makeup did not absorb in the brush.</li>
    <li> So soft and applies my liquid foundation so easy without looking caked on. Beauty junkees has been so helpful too since I&#x27;ve ordered.  Love this brush!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! It gives me the foundation coverage I have been wanting, and it&#x27;s soft. Love it.</li>
    <li> I wrote the following review for the &amp;#34;Flat Top Kabuki Brush&amp;#34; but I also bought the &amp;#34;Concealer Makeup Brush for Eyes&amp;#34;.  I wish now that I would have bought the entire set because I love these two so much.  All I can tell you is to BUY THEM!  They&#x27;re great brushes and I could not be without them!  I LOVE them!&lt;br /&gt;********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 50&#x27;s and I guess you could say I am a make-up newbie.  Well, sort of.  I used to wear make-up years ago when I was working every day but I got out of the habit of &amp;#34;making myself up&amp;#34; after retiring early and sort of ... ahem...well, I let myself go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I have begun to see the results of age on my face and have not liked AT ALL what I saw looking back at me in the mirror!  Not only wrinkles, which is a whole other story, but my pores seemed to have grown to gargantuan size.  I know I had some acne scars from my teenage years but they seemed to have grown much larger with age.  So back to the department store makeup counter I went and picked up a bottle of liquid foundation that promised to give me that dewey look of youth.  The sales woman told me I absolutely needed to use a foundation brush to apply this new foundation [which she would sell me for $36.00] but I thought it kind of weird to use a brush to put my makeup on and politely declined.  [I figured I could just do it the old fashioned way - with my fingers - which cost me nothing.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought applying makeup after getting out of the habit for so many years would be like riding a bike.  But, truthfully, it just didn&#x27;t look like it did when I was younger.  After viewing some professional online make-up tutorials in which brushes were used, I thought about buying one but frankly the prices seemed so steep, especially since I needed all the other products one needs to keep a face looking beautiful.  But once I bought all the basics one needs in the makeup department I kept wondering if I would get better results with a foundation brush.  That $40 bottle of foundation was not hiding those acne scars [so much for the &amp;#34;dewey look&amp;#34;, I thought] and I figured I had just wasted my money on a product that did nothing for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I came across this brush, the Premium Foundation Makeup Brush - Flat Top from Beauty Junkees [LOVE that company name!].  It had stellar reviews and was quite inexpensive so I decided to try it and another brush.  [I flip-flopped back and forth about getting the whole set but thought I would just try one or two first.  Now I wish I would have purchased the whole set.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use a foundation brush to apply my makeup but after viewing some more online videos I decided just to jump in.  After only about 5 minutes of practice I really and truly was blown away at how well those acne scars disappeared using this brush!  With a simple &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34; and twisting motion I was able to magically fill in those acne scars!  I then used another brush to apply a light coating of powder and my skin actually looked flawless!  I felt like I had lost ten years off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on these brushes are so thick and so soft!  The brushes, themselves, are very well constructed  For someone who is &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to applying foundation with brushes I found them very simple to use and with the large, hefty handles, very comfortable to hold and to work with.  They clean easily and dry fast.  And they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so grateful to have found this foundation brush and at such a reasonable price.  I recommend this brush to anyone who wants to get rid of the appearance of acne scars.  I never thought that a foundation brush could make such a difference but it truly does.  I am simply amazed at how, with the right tools, one can change the face of time.  I couldn&#x27;t be without it now.if I would get better results with a foundation brush.

    <li> A great foundation brush. Much softer look after using the Kabuki to apply foundation. This is a keeper; sorry I didn&#x27;t get it sooner. The difference in the &#x27;look&#x27; after application is noticeable!</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush! it makes my foundation look flawless &amp; it cut down my application time to seconds &amp; my fingers are no longer full of foundation. best brush I own!</li>
    <li> I really love this brush for applying BB Cream...the brush did come out of the wooden handle after only a couple of uses, but a little tab of super glue and it&#x27;s perfect, washes up really nicely.</li>
    <li> This kabuki is just as good as my sigma.It appears to be made of the same fibers. The only difference is that the handle is a little different.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping &amp; great quality brush.  I&#x27;ve finally found a brush that offers flawless application of my foundations.  I got away from mineral makeup for a while and have been using airbrush to achieve that flawless look.  While I love my airbrush I still prefer applying my makeup by hand and with this brush you can do so confidently that it will turn out perfect each time.  I really appreciate the checkup emails as well offering more brush tips &amp; tricks.  Every makeup lover needs one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super soft, very well made and my foundation looked great. I would have given it more stars if it was more dense.I have been using the same brush from Sigma, and this is a great alternative, but not a dupe as some called it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush!</li>
    <li> Fabulous brush! Works the same as sigma f80 and cover fx liquid foundation brush but is a fraction of the cost (and it&#x27;s cruelty free!!!!!). Easy to clean, no shedding. Used with cream and liquid foundations with great success, very nice finishes. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong with this brush. It is currently my second favorite (first is my Sigma kabuki)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I TAKE IT BACK IT IS MY FIRST PICK. MY SIGMA 3D KABUKI HAS BECOME MY 2ND.</li>
    <li> From the way that all of the other reviewers were talking, I half expected this brush to be a little more life-changing than it was.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a great brush, but it&#x27;s not like you will suddenly look airbrushed!  I use a higher end popular mineral foundation, and have always used the brushes that came along with that. I recently decided it was time to phase in some new brushes, as my old ones were getting a little scratchy. This was a very good purchase, and I strictly use it for powdered foundation instead of blush. It is soft and easy to hold. The reason I took off a star is because sometimes I feel like the bristles are long enough to contour to my face as needed. Overall, a solid brush, and I will look into more from this line.</li>
    <li> It was all right, but not thrilled at all.  I&#x27;ve been used the more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; foundation brushes in the past and wanted to give this one a try.  Well, it&#x27;s OK when apply to relatively large surface.  However, it does not have the &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; to do tiny areas which you certainly needed on some part of face.  More important thing is that it uses more fundation than my previous &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; fundation brush.  It doubled amount of usage.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH. I use it with liquid foundation and it goes on so smoothly every day with circular brush strokes. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I recently lost my favorite foundation brush while traveling, which was perfect because I was already planning on buying and trying out a new foundation brush. This brand was recommended to me by a one of my favorite beauty gurus on YouTube (saaammage)! She always uses this brush to apply foundation and the application is always FLAWLESS! She also had a coupon code for it, so I decided to order the flat top kabuki brush.  UPDATE: I loved this brush because it blended so nicely. I have used this brush for 6 months now and I have experienced SO MUCH shedding. It&#x27;s a shame because it worked so well, but the shedding was annoying. I just washed my brush today and the bristles twisted out of the ferrule (the metal part of the brush) and I tried to twist it back in place, but the bristles ended up going deeper into the ferrule and I can&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> Love it (: super soft and great to blend in the foundation to make it look natural! Highly recommend! !!!</li>
    <li> I thought that perhaps because it was so cheap that the quality would be cheap as well- but no that isn&#x27;t the case at all. I love this brush. It shed very very little at first and after that it was fine. It&#x27;s thick and dense and doesn&#x27;t suck in too much product as some brushes can do. I kinda almost want to buy a backup brush- that&#x27;s how much I have enjoyed using this one. It comes in a resealable bag and it also comes with a brush cover. I honestly believe this was a great buy.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic and great price as well.  Perfect for applying liquid foundation! I would definitely recommend this brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a beauty expert, but this is a great brush. It applies foundation (both liquid and super-fine mineral powder) very evenly, and it looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other soft face brushes that didn&#x27;t work because the bristles were too long (the powder/foundation ended up trapped in the middle of the brush instead of staying near the tips) and I&#x27;ve also switched back to sponges, which apply makeup a little too heavily. I love the coverage of makeup, but since I live in Florida and the sun affects my skin tone day to day (despite sunblock) it has to look natural. This brush is the best way I have found to apply everything so it looks even, natural, and not caked or painted on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as durability, the brush has not shed, which is a big deal for me. I hate it when makeup brushes shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> OBSESSED with this brush.  It&#x27;s my go too.  Works amazing with BB cream to get more coverage</li>
    <li> brush is soft and dense. Great for my mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> Foundation goes on smooth and natural looking.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes I have washed them and they did not shed im going to order anthor set.</li>
    <li> I just got my order and tried it for the first time and the result was amazing! I got this flawless finish bc of this brush!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to substitute for a Sigma. For less the half the price, it&#x27;s pretty amazing! I was wary, but the reviews were good and now there will be another to help substantiate the fantastic quality for first time buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Arrived as expected and was packaged well. Even included an offer for free brush nets.&lt;br /&gt;-Upon first inspection, it looked great. Just a few bristles sticking up a bit taller than the rest (not a big deal). Ferule was/is nice, tight, and secure. It has a good weight to it and definitely feels and looks to be good quality.&lt;br /&gt;-3 months down the road and we&#x27;re still going strong. I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristle loss or any more sticking up past the rest. Ferule is still good. It seems to be holding up well under daily use and semi-regular washing.&lt;br /&gt;-Works like a charm! This was my first time purchasing a flat-top kabuki. I use it almost every day to apply liquid foundation and it always gives me such a flawless finish. Just what I was looking for! Sponges can apply to heavily or be blotchy. Fingers can be streaky and unsanitary. For me, this brush is my holy grail for liquid foundation application. Furthermore, it blends out very, very well and makes a little bit of product go a long way. It really is quite lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush, buy it again, and/or give it as a gift. When I need to replace it, I would definitely consider buying it again. Furthermore, I plan to purchase some of the other brushes (maybe even the 5 piece set)! 3 months strong, and I&#x27;m hoping to get many more out of it.</li>
    <li> Puts on my liquid foundation flawless. bristles are really soft. I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it with foundation, and a couple of drops will do!  It blends it in much better than my usual foundation brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I used many methods in the past and have found this brush to be the best application for my liquid foundation. It applies it smoothly with an even finish. It&#x27;s extremely well made and super soft. The price on top of all of those things clinched the deal. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a foundation brush. Looking forward to trying more items from Beauty Junkees! :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent Product....</li>
    <li> Got it and used it about three times and I noticed it started falling apart. The silver brush attachment was wiggling and the next day it broke off from the wooden handle. Emailed them, never got a response. Not happy would not recommend</li>
    <li> Most amazing brush! Put on makeuo to look smooth and brushed!</li>
    <li> I loved it. I loved how prompt the shipment was.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this brush!! Foundation goes on perfect and really covers and gives an air brushed look. Can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now.</li>
    <li> I have the flat top and round top brushes and they are soft.  Better than expected.  Holds product and provides perfect blending.  Washes clean without bristles falling out.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about makeup brushes.  This brush is great!! It doesn&#x27;t shed, blends wonderfully. Even some of my Mac brushes shed.</li>
    <li> Honest opinion. This was my first experience with a Kabuki brush and I love it. Changed my world of make up permanently. Thank you Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> great material and stiffness for powder and liquid foundation application!</li>
    <li> It is very nice soft brush but not as dense or stiff as I was hoping.  Brushes can be stiff and still be soft. I am glad though I purchased this.  I am using this for applying setting powder and using a sponge (a beauty blender dupe) to apply my foundation, which is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I had a great buying experience with beauty junkees. I received my item faster than expected and I absolutely love the foundation brush I purchased! It works so well and was not expensive. Beauty junkees also emailed me information about usage and care for the product. I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the money.  My foundation goes on 100 times better with this brush!</li>
    <li> Beautiful in quality. Great price. Would definitely have to try the other kabuki brushes as well.</li>
    <li> Works like it says.  Seems to be good quality</li>
    <li> I so love my brushes!!! I will definitely buy from this seller again!!!</li>
    <li> This brush feels nice and sturdy in my hand, and it made applying my liquid foundation much easier! It&#x27;s very soft and I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out. It&#x27;s much better than my old brush.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush! So far, I&#x27;ve used it with liquid foundation, and with a tinted moisturizer. This brush helped me achieve pretty much flawless coverage, and there was absolutely NO shedding! This is super important to me because I have spent far more on other brushes, and they have shed like crazy.  The bristles are dense, the handle seems very secure, and the brush overall just feels nice in the hand. I was very pleasantly surprised at the great quality at such a good price. I bought the flat top kabuki, but I could easily see myself coming back for the angled flat top as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> There was a slight problem with my order but I can guarantee that the customer service from Beauty Junkees is impeccable! I have their contoured brush which I absolutely love. The bristles on these brushes are super soft to the touch and are really good quality. Once purchased Beauty Junkees also goes beyond the call of duty...I&#x27;ll let you be pleasantly surprised as to how. I would not hesitate to make purchases from Beauty Junkees and can&#x27;t wait to see what other products they offer!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a makeup brush like this for awhile now and I was very excited when I found this online for such a great price. I&#x27;ve been using it for three days now and it is amazing. It is everything I was hoping it would be and it makes my morning routine much faster and easier.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome for foundation. It&#x27;s dense and soft , and it picks up the product without sucking it in. It&#x27;s also a very sturdy brush and it provides your face with a flawless finish!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far to apply &amp; blend my foundation and love it. Great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> Been using this a few weeks. Have washed it twice. So far it has not fallen apart like others have said. If it does, I will surely send it back! I use it with Tarte foundation and it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> This is a great foundation brush!  It doesn&#x27;t shed, it super soft and blends my makeup on my face very evenly.  I love it.  Great product for the money!!</li>
    <li> works very well; no shedding</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great with liquid foundation!</li>
    <li> This brush makes my mineral makeup go on flawlessly and evenly.  It is such a wonderful, soft brush!  It feels good just to brush it over my skin with nothing on it!  Would highly recommend this brush, and Beauty Junkees specifically, for your beauty needs!  They sent a wonderful email on the use and care of this brush as well.  I have never received that type of email after ordering this type of product, so it was most appreciated!  I am makeup stupid!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I got this brush! It&#x27;s my favorite foundation brush! I wanted the Sigma F80 but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price. I read the reviews and found that this is said to be a pretty good dupe. I&#x27;m very happy with it! It doesn&#x27;t shed, washes very well and makes my foundation look flawless!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! so soft and does a great job of smoothing out the coverage! can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I use many types of brushes at different price points - from good ol&#x27; drugstore Revlon (still going strong after many, many years) to spendy Jane Iredale -- as well as faves priced in the middle (RealTechniques and Japonesque).  Almost every brush I have offers value in its own way, as long as I respect just how that particular tool works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT-  I&#x27;m pickiest about my foundation brush, as this is what &amp;#34;sets the canvas&amp;#34; for everything else. My current foundation brush, wearing out from repeated, almost daily use over 10 years, is Jane Iredale&#x27;s &amp;#34;The Handi.&amp;#34; Replacing it proves expensive enough that I decided to first shop around --- and man, I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Junkees&#x27; Flat Top Kabuki is hands-down, the best and most versatile brush I have ever used - regardless of price. When I pulled it out of its package, I was blown away because, while hopeful based on other reviews, I was simply not expecting the level of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heft and balance: perfect. The handle is satisfying to hold, with a very substantial brush head so dense, it doesn&#x27;t splay when you push down hard on it. This is a large brush, but not overly so - I carry it in my makeup bag daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: no scratching, it&#x27;s one of the softest brushes I have and feels like teddy bear fur!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shedding: it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used it every day for several weeks and not a hair has come out that I&#x27;ve noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Media: works exceptionally for any kind of base (BB cream, creme or lotion foundation - and powdered minerals, which I use most often). Works with setting powders, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vegan friendly - yes. All synthetic (surprised me, as I thought I could never give up my squirrel hair brush!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: a snap. A dab of olive oil and soap, rinse -- and it literally dries in 2-3 hours! (The brush comes with use and care instructions, too - very handy. I&#x27;ve also used a regular brush cleaner and it works just fine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: insanely low. Meaning every single gal on a budget, can afford to have at least one fantastic make up brush in her arsenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kabuki is an incredible value. Don&#x27;t miss out!nsanely low.

    <li> I love the bursh.  I think its great! I have no problems with it whatsoever and I will definitely be buying from Beauty Junkees again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this brush. I own high end brushes and this one knocks those out of the water. The brush is really soft and my foundation goes on so flawless. The customer service is amazing! I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to buy this brush since I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this brand.  Once I received it, I was thrilled to give it a chance.  I loved the quality of this product so much that I went ahead and purchased a second brush right away.  Also, their customer service is the best by far.  I am a quality concious consumer and I highly recommend this Foundation Brush by Beauty Junkees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love it, perfect for liquid foundation. It is so soft, my foundation looks flawless and easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> Great brush, use it all the time</li>
    <li> I am loving this brush.  Unlike the other one I tried, this does not leave streaks and blends foundation evenly and smoothly.  It appears to be very well made and the bristles are soft and do not shed.  I, too, appreciated the follow-up email from the seller with tips and suggestions for using the brush.  I have found that it also works well to dab the brush lightly in your foundation, dot it on several places in one area of the face (such as the forehead or cheek) and buff it out smoothly in a circular motion.  A great product that I am extremely happy with.  Thank you Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> I love all beauty junkees brushes! They are dense and extremely soft. They don&#x27;t make my face itch and the quality is awesome. They are definitely worth more than the price I paid!</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s made really well.</li>
    <li> i love how smooth this brush gets my make up. it doesnt take too much product to give me a perfect finish. it did however take a very long time to get, and it went three days past the delivery date estimate. was very well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Great brush - texture, shape, weight and density...has become one of my most-used brushes - especially for liquid foundation and BB/CC creams!  I hope they expand their line, I will definitely be watching for more as they become available!</li>
    <li> It does what its promised to do like in the description. It puts on your makeup evenly and it even helped hide my pores since I consist of having big pores. I really love it! ¢¾¢¾👌 I do recommend this product to my friends and you guys too.</li>
    <li> I own a couple of real techniques and eco-tools brushes and  recently puchased the flat top kabuki foundation brush from beauty junkees. The brush is good and does what it is claimed for. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star rating is because of the price. I do not think it is worth the 11.95 I paid for it since the real technique (face expert as well as the foundation brush) cost less and do similar job. Beauty Junkees has a great customer service and for that they deserve Five-stars rating. The price of the brush need to be lowered so it can fairly compete with the other similar ones in the market.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for about a week now, and it is amazing!!  I have absolutely no regrets!  It is extremely soft and works very well on compact foundation and blush.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> So, there used to be a time when me and a special brush from a brand starting with an S used to be besties.... not anymore. This one is not only cheaper BUT soooooo much higher in quality! It&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll only see if you use it for a while, as in the beginning they seem to be exactly the same (which I think is already great considering the price difference between them!)&lt;br /&gt;BUT, if you use them on a regular base, which I do, wash them 3-4 times a week, which I do too, you&#x27;ll start to see a difference. Two things I love about this one: No hairs shed from the brush, it stays in shape, it dries very fast and doesn&#x27;t pick up a weird smell, the two last things did happen to me with the S brush. I dries a lot slower than this one and after using it for 6 months I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of that smell and as I said, I wash it 3-4 times a week, which is pretty much after every use. So that&#x27;s a BIG plus for the Beauty Junkees one! Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it. So much i ordered 2! Great soft brush. It is just the right length for my small hands. Really easy cleanup and applies my makeup beautifully. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The brush makes appling make up fun. Being older, I worry about caking etc., but with this brush problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;The people at Beauty Junkee&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t be more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you give them a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the same reason I buy all other products on Amazon, the high ratings. Big mistake! It was okay until it fell apart after a month. I was washing the brush under running water when all of a sudden the bristles came out! Yeah, not worth it. Stick to Real Techniques, those have yet to fail me. Hope this helps. Happy shopping!:)</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product. The bristles are falling out and I&#x27;m finding them all over my face along with my foundation. I will not be purchasing this item again. For this brush being a little pricey and not a good product, I might as well go to the dollar store for a brush.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush. I followed the directions that were provided of washing the brush before use. It is super soft and good quality. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it and it has applied my makeup like a breeze. I definitely recommend it. I use it to put on liquid foundation in circular motions on my face.</li>
    <li> Best foundation application ever with the brush. Absolutely love this brush.... I use it daily ... makeup applies flawless and seamless with this brush .... it&#x27;s perfect! Try it makeup junkies you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I use it for my mineral powder foundation, liquid foundation, and concealer. It blends like no other brush I have ever used. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Make up brush is very nice</li>
    <li> I was shopping for something else and this product was among the suggested products at the bottom of the page and I always have to check those out.  I liked the brush but was hesitant to try this for foundation.  I&#x27;ve always used sponges and I don&#x27;t exactly embrace change...lol.  The brush appealed to me, though, because it was reasonably priced and got great reviews, so I decided to try it out and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else to apply foundation.  It&#x27;s soft and dense and smooths on the foundation beautifully.  I DEFINITELY recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention this was the best seller experience I&#x27;ve had to date.  Amazon is always fantastic.  The independent sellers can be hit or miss, sometimes.  This seller was ON the ball.  After Amazon sent me the notice that my order had shipped, I also received an email from the seller telling me my brush was on it&#x27;s way, thanking me for the order and a set of tips/instructions for how to use and clean the brush.  Nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m very please with my brush and with this seller.</li>
    <li> Incredibly impressed with the quality of the brush. Much nicer than a few of my name brand brushes. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush and how the heck do you beat this price? Really soft, but not too mushy. Applies foundation beautifully. Would absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used liquid or powder. Great service as well. Ordering more</li>
    <li> I bought this on the suggestion of my sister-in-law who does make up. I love it I have had foundation brushes before and do not like the flat kind . This brush distributes make-up evenly and feels great on my face. I can tell a difference in the coverage and look of my foundation. Much improved!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this brush..easy for her to apply liquid foundation - and it was a good price compared to high end store brands</li>
    <li> Great brush for foundation. Love the finish. Application much easier with the brush. Would buy it again. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED MAKEUP WEDGES FOR YEARS TO APPLY MY FOUNDATION.  I FOUND THIS BRUSH BY ACCIDENT AND IT HAS CHANGED MY MAKEUP ROUTINE FOREVER.  MY FOUNDATION NO LONGER JUST SITS ON MY SKIN, IT SEEMS TO BECOME A PART OF IT. I USE A SECOND ONE FOR MY CREAM BLUSH AND MY MATURE SKIN JUST GLOWS.  I REALLY BELIEVE THESE BRUSHES ARE WHAT MAKE MY MAKEUP LOOK SO GOOD AND I WOULDN&#x27;T HESITATE TO RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH TO EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  This brush is very soft and dense. My makeup goes on flawlessly.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding. This is a good brush if you don&#x27;t want to spend 50 bucks for one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It is soft and I use far less foundation than before.  Perfect.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna confess right away that I&#x27;m a little (okay, a lot) obsessive when I&#x27;m buying products. I research reviews like crazy, and this time I actually bought multiple brands of flat top kabuki&#x27;s to see which one I liked best. I heard about the Sigma F80 but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much if I could get something comparable for less. So I ordered an inexpensive kabuki set from Royal Care Cosmetics and this Beauty Junkees flat top. I want to save money, but I don&#x27;t want cheap quality. Right away I could see that the Beauty Junkees was better quality: heavier, denser bristles, and very soft. I have a food scale for baking, so I set each one on there to check the weight difference. RC Cosmetics 31 grams, Beauty Junkees 44 grams. (Both weighed before use to keep product build up from confusing the weights.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thought when I applied my foundation with the BJ brush: \\&quot;Where have you been all my life?!\\&quot; I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve spent years applying foundation by hand. I have tried a traditional foundation brush before, but it was tedious and still streaky. This flat top is like a dream. The foundation goes on so beautifully and the brush feels amazing on the skin. It&#x27;s also nicely weighted in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m taking off one star is that when I washed the brush there was the tiniest bit of looseness in the ferrule. Five stars for customer service, though, because they immediately sent out a second brush. The second brush has a secure ferrule but is slightly less dense than the first. I popped it on the scale and it was 41 grams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got worried that I was missing out on something special with the Sigma F80, so I ordered it for comparison (I told you I was obsessive). It is the same density as the first Beauty Junkees brush I received but I think the Beauty Junkees wins on softness. There&#x27;s something about the Beauty Junkees that is more gentle when pressing flat against the skin. The Sigma F80 weighs 39 grams, and my impression is that the handle is lighter than the Beauty Junkees handle, since the F80 bristles are definitely as dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No shedding from the Beauty Junkees flat top through use and three washes. The Sigma had four little hairs sticking up that would need to be trimmed level. Both Beauty Junkees flat tops had exactly one hair that needs to be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I&#x27;m keeping my Beauty Junkees flat top and returning the Sigma and RC Cosmetics brushes. I&#x27;m not missing out on anything, since I have a fantastic brush from Beauty Junkees. Beauty Junkees is in between the price of the other two brands, which makes it a perfect choice for quality and price. Because they are more affordable than Sigma but very similar quality, I plan to buy the other Beauty Junkees kabuki brushes as well.handle is lighter than the Beauty Junkees handle, since the F80 bristles are definitely as dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No shedding from the Beauty Junkees flat top through use and three washes.

    <li> This brush is the perfect size, I even get my foundation liquid on quicker and smoother with this.</li>
    <li> U live this brush and it shipped with no delays</li>
    <li> This is just a good as advertised! First, the bristles are very soft and feel good on the skin. Most importantly, though, my foundation looks much better when applied with this brush as compared with a flat &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; style brush or my fingers. I also find that I&#x27;m using less foundation to get a good full coverage. The method I&#x27;m using is to dab a bit of foundation on part of my face and then blend it in with the brush. Just FYI, I&#x27;m using Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked Skin liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Great foundation application with airbrushed finish</li>
    <li> Blends makeup beautifully!</li>
    <li> I effing love this brush. Perfect density and no bristle fall out!!! Will buy another one for my liquid foundation. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> This a fantastic brush. I did the thumb test and the bristles were/are even, pliable,bounce back and especially nice to the face. Application of product assisted by this brush is better than expected and compares to my other two &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; priced brushes. This one is sure to join them in my work routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is great here (not like some I have dealt with and was a pleasant surprise) I will order from this place again. If you are sitting on the fence about this brush---DON&#x27;T!---click PLACE ORDER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it four stars because the only thing that would have made it a five star product would be that it would be &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34;. Maybe next time.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. I&#x27;ve only used the brush twice because I just got it but I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. I started to buy a more expensive brush. Glad I saved some money because this brush does the job!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the sturdiness and extra softness of this professional grade, foundation Flat Top kabuki brush!  My mineral foundation goes on more beautifully, and evenly than ever before. I&#x27;ve owned other makeup brushes, and these makeup brushes by Beauty Junkees are the absolute best I&#x27;ve owned! By far the best foundation/makeup brush, I&#x27;ve ever compared to high end makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, soft but dense and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap!</li>
    <li> UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon would not allow me to review different brushes from the same company so they are combined below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered 7/20/15. Review: 3 STARS - Flat Angled Kabuki Brush...&lt;br /&gt;I had success with Beauty Junkees Flat Top Brush so I thought it would be nice to have the Angled Brush version as well. I was a tad disappointed with the Flat Angled Kabuki Brush. It arrived with a few small indentions on the metal grip. Some of the hairs were sticking out oddly but the overall bunch seemed intact well so at least it&#x27;s usable. Other than looking a bit beat up, it could be a clone for the application of the Flat Top Kabuki Brush, down to the hairs holding makeup in odd places. It&#x27;s been helpful in contouring and cutting back on cleaning frequency when combined with the Flat Top. Although I admit, I like the Flat Top better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered 6/27/15. Review: 4 STARS - Flat Top Kabuki Brush...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush only a handful of times but wow! Not only is it less time consuming than a sponge but the application is flawless and non irritating. So far, I&#x27;ve used this with high end mineral foundation, drug-store foundation, tinted sunscreen, AND a creamy highlighter. I wear make up four to five days a week and tinted sunscreen every day. I dot the product I am using directly onto my face with my finger first (literally a few dots onto each area - cheeks, chin, nose, forehead) then use the flat top kabuki to blend. The brush hairs are soft and make blending effortless. The hairs do seem to hold makeup in odd spots (pictured) after using, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the appearance of the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush arrived promptly thanks to Prime shipping. In my opinion, the size was just right. It has a heftiness that high end brands have. There were a few uneven hairs I had to trim away (pictured) and a couple came out during its first use. Thankfully no others have shed and it&#x27;s kept its integrity so far after being reused and washed. It is early but I am optimistic that this brush will last a long time. The price is amazing for the quality (so far!) you receive AND if you get your hands on a promotion or coupon, it is hands down THE best choice. I am looking forward to trying more products!long time.

    <li> This brush is great. Very soft and helps to create nice coverage. Great with liquid foundation. So glad I found this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about two months and the handle just fell off. I like the brush itself but the construction should be better.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to be disappointed since finding a good brush is hard to do, but I love it!!  Applied my foundation just right.</li>
    <li> I love love this brush it gives me that flawless air brush kind of effect when used with my liquid foundation. Would definitely recommend this brush. .I only regret is not purchasing two lol.</li>
    <li> Kabuki Brush to thick and a little heavy.  I like real Techniques Brush  by Samahtha  better. I would not purchase this item again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! I am not a makeup artist or professional by any means, but I am one of the countless women who strive to achieve that flawless foundation look.&lt;br /&gt;THIS BRUSH IS FANTASTIC!&lt;br /&gt;I received my brush in a cute plastic ziplock type bag (a lot nicer than just a ziplock baggie, thicker protective plastic kept my brush safe during shipping with my other amazon items), and the brush itself had a bristle guard on it. So there was no way this brush arrives damaged unless someone lights it on fire.&lt;br /&gt;I opened it and let it air out a bit because it had a chemical odor to it. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the brush itself or just the packaging it had been in. Either way, the smell dissipated within a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I used the brush to apply my liquid foundation, and I could not be happier with the results. The bristles are SO soft, but firm and well packed, so it&#x27;s perfect for stippling your foundation onto your face. It also does a great job buffing, etc. Basically anything you need from a brush that applies liquid foundation, this does it professionally.&lt;br /&gt;I also forgot to mention that the company is AWESOME. As soon as your order ships, they send you a personal email with instructions on how to use your brush. -awesome .... After a couple of days (meaning you had time to play with the brush) they send you instructions on how to clean the brush!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing from this company again, and I would highly suggest you do too :)</li>
    <li> Love this brush seriously wish i had had it sooner !! I wanted to get the sigma F80 but after using this i&#x27;d rather stick to this one , you just cant beat the price. Great quality!! Super soft! Dense! And doesnt shed at all!</li>
    <li> The Beauty Junkees Kabuki Brush was one of the smartest choice I have ever made in makeup tools. This brush is just...perfect! I used it for the first time the other day going to a family breakfast and everyone asked what did I do to make my skin so smooth and even-toned. I went to go look at myself again in the mirror and my skin looked flawless. I have been using my makeup brand for years, but it has never looked so good on my face as when I used the Beauty Junkees Kabuki Brush. This is a must have makeup tool, even your old everyday makeup will look like perfection if applied with this brush. I can&#x27;t wait to try so of the other brushes offered by Beauty Junkees, I am a fan!!!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for foundation and gives a much better finish than a sponge, fingers or beauty blender. The quality is surprisingly great for the price point! Will definitely be buying more</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic!  The bristles are thick and concentrated for full coverage but are loose enough that it&#x27;s not too much make-up on your face.  The flat top is so soft - none of the pin pricks that you can get from other brushes, especially around the eye area.  I use the brush all over my face even around my nose and eyes and it works beautifully.  The brush really does make a huge difference, and I love this one so far!  I use it with mineral concealer-powder foundation and it is by far the best brush/application method I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I just got my brush today and could not wait to use it. I stumbled upon it as I was getting ready to buy another Sigma F80 brush that I swore I would never buy again because the bristles in mine fell out within a couple months of having it and Sigma would not do anything for me even though I WAS a loyal local (Minnesota) customer. After the F80 fell apart I tried the beauty blender and a couple other foundation brushes but the F80 was superior. So I was getting ready to suck it up and buy another then this baby popped up! And oh.my! I am so glad it did. The Beauty Junkee brush is solid and feels amazing, so soft. WAY better than the F80! And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I am going to order another just to make sure I always have one and take a look at their other brushes. Since ditching Sigma I&#x27;ve been buying MAC, but Beauty Junkees may be my new go-to...</li>
    <li> If a foundation brush is what you use for foundation, this one is exactly right. I don&#x27;t know if it has to do with  the height, density yet softness ,or all combined, but this one is a keeper.  Good purchase!</li>
    <li> This brush feels like a mink coat om my face. I look forward to buying more of these brushes.  Cherry on top , free gift. Love that.</li>
    <li> super soft and amazing ... wow I&#x27;m not buying sigma lol</li>
    <li> Looks like a nice brush. It will be a Christmas gift, so haven&#x27;t used it yet. I should&#x27;ve bought a couple more by the looks of it...great idea for last minute gift or to have as a Christmas game present for a female.</li>
    <li> I love the density of this brush! It feels amazing and blends perfectly. I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other brushes they carry.</li>
    <li> I would love to give this brush 5 stars however two weeks after its arrival the brush separated from the handle.</li>
    <li> Love this foundation brush, super smooth application.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  Great quality!</li>
    <li> I will stand by this brush until the day I die!! I&#x27;m always hesitant to try brushes that aren&#x27;t professional expensive brushes but I was completely blown away by the high quality it has. Definitely doesn&#x27;t make your makeup look heavy and goes on super sheer. I Used to use about 2.5-3 pumps of foundation (I know, I&#x27;m heavy handed) before but this brush doesn&#x27;t hold any product and distributes everything evenly and fully, so now I only used about 2 pumps total for my whole face. Definitely glad I bought this brush based on other reviews, I&#x27;d give it 100 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of using the same amount of foundation I would use if I were using the beauty blender to apply my makeup, the result was a bad cake face. I started over using a fraction of the foundation I would normally use and this brush created the most flawless, full cover finish I&#x27;ve ever had. This brush is excellent, not only because it applies foundation beautifully but also because it does not soak up any product!! I bought on the recommendation of a YouTube vlogger, she was right, this brush is amazing....</li>
    <li> I loved it, the bristles are soft handle is solid. Wow !!!</li>
    <li> Handle Broke within a month.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I have had NO problems with shedding, and get a beautiful finish with my foundation. I will buy another.</li>
    <li> The brush is so soft and does give me great coverage. I love it! But I found it pretty funny how they sent it in such a big box, it kept the product safe though!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush to apply foundation with. It helps to apply it evenly and the bristles are soooooooo soft. There is no fallout and i use this brush every single day. Will be ordering another one ( or two) to have just in case I lose it. Would recommend trying it out. You too will fall in love.</li>
    <li> I was used to blending in foundation with my fingers, so I decided to switch it up and see the difference a brush would make. It was definitely a noticeable difference for me so I will continue to use this brush. Great product and I also love how it gives you advice on how to clean it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I use it for liquid foundation and BB cream, and it does so much better than flat foundation brushes or stifling brushes. I love that it buffs the product onto my skin for a really flawless finish.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the most perfect, the most durable and the best possible make up brush money can buy. This brush is very well-made and the high quality shows clearly.&lt;br /&gt;The Marchant is also very honorable and has a lot of integrity. The merchant constantly communicated with me to make sure that I received the shipment and that the quality of the item was up to my satisfaction. I am satisfied beyond anything I expected. Excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! In the past I had always used my fingers to apply my foundation. Wish I had been using this sooner! Foundation goes on smoothly and I can easily blend it under my chin and in smaller areas. I use less foundation than I used to with better coverage. I also appreciate the cleaning tips that came with it. I purchased another one for my sister because I liked it so much.</li>
    <li> i loved this brush as soon as i tried it but when i washed it all of the hairs come out of the metal. I was so sad because i read really great reviews about this brush and using it was nice until that happened. Plus i barely washed it and when I did I would use warm to cold water.</li>
    <li> Love it! This brush has just the right amount of softness and firmness to make a great foundation brush! I will purchase more from this seller!</li>
    <li> Love this brush!…. especially for the price.  Quick shipping and communication.</li>
    <li> I have to wash it weekly, but it&#x27;s good as new everytime!</li>
    <li> It is a good brush! A five star brush! So flawless when you apply foundation using this brush. At first, I was thinking twice if am gonna buy this brush...coz I really want a good brush plus good prize as we&#x27;ll. I am so happy I bought Beauty Junkees brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. My foundation just seems to settle into my skin more. No issues with any shedding.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I actually own the Sigma F80 brush (and unfortunately paid full price).  When I used the Sigma brush, it was so dense, and the bristles were so thick, that it literally exfoliated my extremely dry skin. (No matter how light of a touch I used, or how much I primed and moisturized, the brush was so dense it would literally cause my skin to start flaking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase this brush, but figured I would try it and see if it was better.  I am SO glad I made this decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on this brush are MUCH softer than the SIgma F80.  This brush doesn&#x27;t absorb nearly as much product as my sigma flat top, and it isn&#x27;t too dense so it leaves a flawless, poreless finish WITHOUT exfoliating/drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so so so happy with this purchase, and I am 100% sure that this brush is BETTER than the Sigma F80, not only in quality, but also in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was it had a slightly chemical scent, but it went away after washing it once which is what the package suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, and are looking for a really great foundation brush without having to spend a lot, this brush is for you.  Now I&#x27;m going to save up so I can buy some more brushes in this set!</li>
    <li> Works flawlessly.  A good bush for the price.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! It feels amazing, soft, and high quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I got the Kabuki Brush by Beauty Junkees for my wife to try out. Based on her feedback, she found it was different than what she was used to, but it was definitely a high-quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s used to a brush with stiffer bristles, and the white tips of this brush were softer and offered more drag and coverage with the foundation she was using. Once she got used to that difference, she liked the effect and result. There was no bristle shedding, and the handle was comfortable and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, she thought the Kabuki brush was a very good brush and much cheaper than what she would expect to pay elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Retailer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
    <li> I recently tried BeautyJunkees Kabuki Brush and I have to say I am impressed. The flat top brush has a great feel to the handle and the bristles are dense but oh so soft. The bristles feel great on the skin and disperse powders nicely. I do not use foundation but it seems that the product should smooth on nicely from the look and feel of the brush fibers. Normally, I use Bobbi Brown brushes which do a great job with makeup application but this brush is a serious contender at a fraction of the price. My BB Kabuki brush was around $40 and I have used it for years so it was well worth it. This brush comes in at around a quarter of the price. Time will tell how it holds up.But certainly worth a try considering the price point and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is the manufacturer recommends you wash the brush every day. Well I am sure that is best but it is not realistic for most. The packaging is simple but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is synthetic - vegan friendly which is a consideration. Some other brushes are made of animal hair which does not appeal to everyone. All in all this brush boasts quality bristles, a nice hand grip, easy on the pocketbook price point and it works beautifully. What more could you ask more?</li>
    <li> Great brush that is super dense and spreads and buffs product in really well!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping &amp; customer service was great!  The brush was less dense than I thought but after using it 3x so far I absolutely LOVE it!  Blends my foundation flawlessly.  One hair needed to be trimmed and no shedding at all!  I would absolutely recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> Amazing , love it 💛💙💜💚❤️</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I bought it to replace another Kabuki brush by another company that I had used for many years which had a much shorter handle and fatter brush...I love that the head on this one is the perfect size for my face and areas that my old brush was actually a bit too big for. This brush is soft, holds product well and is a joy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft, blendable, and affordable. I like how the strands are close together and there are no hair fallout when blending foundation. I put dots of liquid foundation on my face and blend it in with this brush and it works perfectly! I can&#x27;t compare to high end brushes, because I never spend that much money on my makeup, but it does the job and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> Seriously best foundation brush ever. I&#x27;ve used some of the morphe and sigma brushes and I always seem to reach for this brush more. It&#x27;s super soft and it makes blending such a breeze.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been wanting a brush like this one for a while. The price was really good for the quality of this item. Also, the description and images were very helpful in determining that this was the right brush for the job. Finally, Beauty Junkees were very prompt in their communications and delivery of the item. They even checked in with us via email to make sure that we had the item, and gave us helpful beauty tips for makeup application, and cleaning the brush. Overall, a great buying experience -- we would buy from them again!</li>
    <li> A well made, gorgeous brush at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Love this foundation brush.  I have always used a sponge until recently when I was in a large department store and the makeup assistant shared about the foundation brush.  I quickly went to Amazon to check and found this one.  I purchased it based on previous reviews and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Use less foundation and smoother finish.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.Its very nice and sturdy. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great... very soft and good quality.</li>
    <li> I had never purchased a foundation brush but this product works wonderfully ! It applies so smoothly, no complaints with this Kabuki!</li>
    <li> Received the product on time&lt;br /&gt;the brush feels super soft , since I received I have not used any of my other brushes&lt;br /&gt;an excellent buy, will definitely purchase other Kabuki brushes&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it 5 stars as I have not had the brush for a long time, but so far so good have few days now</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price.  Very soft.  Puts my foundation on well.  Washed it twice and it holds up great.</li>
    <li> I use it to apply my foundation and blend with my concealor. I love it! So glad I decided to order before buying from MAC. Works just as good</li>
    <li> Love it!!! So well worth the money! Compares to bare minerals new brush very well without the cost!</li>
    <li> Great brush! I use it every day with MAC liquid foundation. Customer service was very nice as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Love love love the way my foundation looks when I use it. Great company, too. Product shipped promptly and they followed up to make sure I was satisfied. HIGHLY recommend both the product and the company.</li>
    <li> I recently accepted that my aging skin needed more coverage. Using this brush to apply liquid foundation is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> So far so good, no complaints. I like how it applies product and there aren&#x27;t any loose hairs!</li>
    <li> It is very soft. I was impressed with the quality for the price of the brush. A nice surprise for once.</li>
    <li> My friend, who is a make up junkee too, bought several of your brushes and suggested the flat kabuki to meet.  I really like it. I love the fact that you give such good instructions.  I am older but want to look smooth and attractive and this brush does it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a similar shaped brush once from Walgreens that was cheaper, but it left streaks and made my foundation look horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is great! It really blends well and doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking like a window washed with water. I use it with my Makeup Forever Face and Body Makeup and it works great!</li>
    <li> Great brush for liquid foundation, great quality brush for an affordable price ! Its a must have brush 😍😍😍😍 yay</li>
    <li> This brush does exactly what it says it does. It gives you a smooth finish and leaves your face flawless.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for my liquid foundation. Full coverage without feeling to heavy. The customer service/support from Beauty Junkees is great, as well.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love it! It makes my face look flawless and light!! Perfect brush for foundation brush! I recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A MUST HAVE IF YOU WANT A GREAT MAKEUP BRUSH FOR A GREAT PRICE. AMAZING PRODUCT. WORKS GREAT, NO SHEDDING, NO LOOSE BRISTLES, JUST WONDERFUL. SO HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. THANK YOU BEAUTY JUNKEES</li>
    <li> I just love it. The price is right, it&#x27;s great quality, and it applies my foundation like a dream. I love it so much I&#x27;m buying another one but angled. There is simply nothing better for foundation application than a flat top kabuki, and there is zero need to spend a fortune on a name brand one.</li>
    <li> Got my brush in the mail so fast ! Great customer service, emailed the owner with a question &amp; was replied back to very quickly. High quality brush, softer even than my real techniques brush. Great for stippling. Hope this brand makes some new products soon!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to spend 25$ on the sigma flat top brush and I was looking for alternatives. I stumbled upon this brand from YouTube reviewers praising it highly. took a chance and bought the brush thinking 11$ is not much to lose. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase! the bristles are densely packed to the perfect extent and it&#x27;s so so soft. it blends my foundation out so well making it very smooth with no streaks. now I&#x27;m looking into purchasing their eye brushes!!</li>
    <li> It is the worst brush is own. It leaves so many streaks on my face and not dense. Horrible</li>
    <li> Great brush, applies foundation flawlessly and coverage is easy to build.  Love it! Great price!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> This is a quality brush and blends liquid foundation easily.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush because I&#x27;m trying to convert from powder to liquid foundation, and this brush does a nice job applying my new liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Purchased this due to the awesome reviews and I agree with them! The brush works really well, and has quickly become my favorite brush. I usually use it with my bb creams, and it applies really well. It does leave some streaks sometimes, but it is easily buffed out with my beautyblender. It did smell a little strange upon opening the package, but a quick wash with my cleansers took care of that.</li>
    <li> A Nobel Prize to whoever thought of shearing off a kabuki brush!  This Beauty Junkees brush is, hands down, the best all around makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s very soft, and the bristles are very short.  This combination means that there&#x27;s not a terrific waste of product, which has been my objection to using a foundation brush in the first place.  I&#x27;m using it with Korean BB creams, and it&#x27;s fabulous!  I dot on the BB cream, and if you&#x27;ve used them before, you know it doesn&#x27;t take much; I blend with the brush, and the finish is perfect.  There&#x27;s very little product left on the brush--the flat top means you just use the tips of the bristles--and I think it was designed for someone who uses makeup as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions insist on cleaning the brush after each use.  I&#x27;m pretty bad about cleaning my makeup brushes, but promise I&#x27;ll do better.  The outstanding communication this company gives its customers recommends cleaning oil based makeup with olive oil, on the theory that oil cleans oil.  That makes sense, but I think my beloved BB creams are water based, so I&#x27;ll use soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve used Kabuki brushes for years, but this one is the Thinking Woman&#x27;s (or man&#x27;s) go to foundation brush.  Many pros, no cons.  My brush was provided for review.  My opinion is mine.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush for foundation!  I now use it for my foundation powder or my liquid foundation.  It is super soft and blends well.</li>
    <li> i originally wrote a review 3 months ago, saying this foundation brush was great...well after a couple months of use it started shedding, and by the end of 3 months it was completely unusable..i do not recommend this brush..although the feedback from the seller was great and they gave good make up tips..i have now bought the Sigma F84, lets hope this one holds up..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for my mineral foundation. It really blends beautifully. I would definitely buy another Beauty Junker brush and their customer service is terrific. Great company, great brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  I now feel daft for putting off owning a real good makeup brush for this long.  I will end up buying more as gifts!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole using-a-brush-to-put-on-foundation world and this brush has worked better than I could have possibly imagined. It&#x27;s super easy to use and makes my foundation look fantastic. Love it!</li>
    <li> I did not like this brush.</li>
    <li> Very soft, and allows me to control the coverage that I apply to my face.  I say it is worth the extra bucks!  Get this brush!</li>
    <li> Good quality brush but not good for powder or blush use.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! It is hard to find a quality foundation brush that is not ridiculously priced so I was hesitant to order this without actually seeing it myself. I am glad I did, the brush works great and my cousin who saw it even ended up ordering one for herself. Its easy to clean and dries right back to the way it was when I purchased it. Great purchase with fast shipping and seller even emailed me care instructions on how to wash and instructions for best way to use it!</li>
    <li> Initially I loved this brush but after a few months of use it started to shed and completely lost its shape. It&#x27;s supposed to be a flat top but the middle is about 1/4 inch shorter than the outside now.</li>
    <li> love this product... will buy another</li>
    <li> I am simply obsessed with this brush! The bristles have not fallen out, the handle is strong, and I am definitely using less foundation, this brush is amazing, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever go without one!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush after seeing it on several beauty blogs that I follow.  I figured for the price if I didn&#x27;t like it then at least I wouldn&#x27;t be out too much money.  Well, was I ever surprised.  I use it to stipple on my foundation and it always (at least now) comes out flawless.  I ordered a second one that I use for blending when I highlight and contour.  I have already cleaned it and it still does a wonderful job.  Love this brush and can&#x27;t wait to try more from them.</li>
    <li> Decided to get this from the great reviews already, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It is as said extremely soft and because it is not tapered to the sides, you can get close to your eyes/ other hard to reach areas to buff out product without having to use a concealer brush as well. My only qualm (which doesn&#x27;t bother me thaaat much) is that I wash my brushes with a tiny amount of shampoo first then with olive oil, is that it takes forever to wash out, how it&#x27;s so dense- it just keeps \\&quot;sudsing\\&quot;. Drying time is a lot longer than other less dense brushes also. Workaround- get two!</li>
    <li> I currently own all three of the Beauty Junkees brushes, the tapered, flat top and angled. I have Sigma and other higher priced brushes that I don&#x27;t even reach for anymore. All the reviews are on point with these brushes, they are super.&lt;br /&gt;All of the brushes are full, soft and both pick up and &amp;#34;deposit&amp;#34; really, really nicely. They also feel nice in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;I use the flat top for my liquid foundation and I love it for several reasons. One, it does not sop up all the foundation causing my to use up twice as much as I would need to. Two it blends PERFECT. Your skin will look AIRBRUSHED with this baby. Three it cleans up really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I find it beyond any expectations I would have for any brush, let alone one for this price.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes shipped super quick, arrived sealed in their own little bags and the company is lovely to deal with. They send a follow up email on with care and tips for the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with them, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great brush, I have used it with my BB creams, foundation and mineral powder.  Works wonderfully and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush.  It has very soft bristles which do not fall off when applying makeup.  It is great for applying and blending. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love my Kabuki brush! I use it for both my liquid foundation and loose powder. It makes my face look flawless. Now I have to get another one for my daughter so she stops taking mine!</li>
    <li> great product, arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Leaves an air brushed look,  doesn&#x27;t make the make up look Cakey. I can use it with any Foundation, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> It is such a great brush!!&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;good price  nice service!!</li>
    <li> Product works wonderfully!  Much appreciated the follow up email on how tips and how to take care of the brush. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> it was here 2 days as promised. well packaged! love the feel and provides great coverage... and of course you cant beat the price..</li>
    <li> I meant to order sigma but end up loving it.</li>
    <li> This product put my mineral powder on so well.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! I love the handle--it&#x27;s very easy to use and the handle is comfortable and does not tire out the hand. I use this with liquid makeup and BB/CC creams, sometimes used together. Also, very easy to clean. The bristles are tightly packed together and I haven&#x27;t had any fall out as of yet (used this brush 4-5 times).&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this brush performs as well as its more expensive counterparts and is well worth this small investment.</li>
    <li> This is one of my first make up brushes. I was looking for a foundation brush to give me a flawless finish, and this thing is awesome! Came quick, perfectly fits in my fingers, has a great weight to it, the brush is SO SOFT. I am in love. Great with liquid foundation on oily skin. Love love love!!!</li>
    <li> I Love this brush it&#x27;s so soft and very smooth gliding. I can put the foundation on with out any problems.</li>
    <li> Other sellers have said this is very soft but I find it PACKED with bristles making it firm for liquid foundation use, for which it is recommended.</li>
    <li> product arrived quickly and was just as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This brush is very thick and holds a lot of product. Too much for me. My foundation cost too much to hold so much product. I find it okay for blending but love my Elf blending brush much more.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft and works great.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price!  I use it everyday and have had no problems  It&#x27;s soft and it perfect for applying foundation.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  My make up goes on so smoothly with this brush.  I use my BB cream and it goes on so nicely!</li>
    <li> I was previously using a beauty blender, but I was worried because I was unable to keep it clean.  I have had foundation brushes in the past, but they always left my face streaky, requiring the beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush completely solves that problem.  I am able to use a light amount of foundation and because of the density and softness of this brush, I can achieve the airbrushed look that I previously could only get with the beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good brush at a great price to use with any foundation.  It will give great coverage and a nice finish.</li>
    <li> Nice brush and affordable.</li>
    <li> This is the very best brush for applying foundation.  This brush is better than cheaper imitations because of the density and quality of the bristles.  I highly recommend you add it to your collection.</li>
    <li> good brush. Bought one for myself and my mother. Once I received it I realized its very similar to another brush I bought on Amazon but for a different company. All I have to say is follow the directions precisely or you will be very pissed if you dont.</li>
    <li> Great brush, super soft and great for blending. The price point was also amazing. The service was good and it arrived fast.</li>
    <li> OMG. I love this brush. It is well made and high quality for an awesome price. I would really love to get all their brushes. &lt;3 I have sigma and mac brushes but this brush is soooo soft and amazing for liquid foundation. I have problematic skin and this brush is perfect because it gives me full coverage, super soft for my sensitive skin and can be used for powder/mineral foundation as well. I just love this brush so much and looking forward to purchasing more from this company.</li>
    <li> Very soft and makeup looks great</li>
    <li> Great tool I like to use for my liquid foundation.  However I noticed the brush soaked up a lot of product.  When I put product on my face it left streaks. This brush is very soft though and easy to hold.  Overall It is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Great brush and good price</li>
    <li> amazing brush! I use it every day, it never sheds, and blends my makeup perfectly. I would recommend to friends to purchase!</li>
    <li> High quality makeup nrush. Very soft and full. Works great.</li>
    <li> Nice I like it , it&#x27;s one of the stuff that sure I will buy again  , and nice price too</li>
    <li> I love the brush. Very soft and thick works well w my foundation and it got to me very quick. I will be purchasing more of these brushes.</li>
    <li> Very surprise with the quality, I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Beauty Junkeer&#x27;s brand after I try this brush I recommended it to my friends. And I&#x27;m looking forward to get all the line.</li>
    <li> Overall great brush, soft puts my makeup on great!!</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, quick shipping, haven&#x27;t interacted with customer service but they send out helpful tips for using/caring for the brush without being spamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle of the brush developed long cracks after about a week. This may be because I was storing it upright after washing instead of laying flat. The integrity of the bristles do not seem to have been affected.</li>
    <li> perfect brush and i clean it and it still remains the same when i apply my foundation</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely amazing. The bristles are super soft and dense enough that they don&#x27;t scratch my skin at all. It buffers my makeup smoothly and gives a nice natural glow. I love it! The customer service is also great!! Don&#x27;t waste money on expensive, designer name brushes - this is a steal - you won&#x27;t regret having this brush as part of your beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I love, love, this brush! It is great for liquid foundation. Works as good as top brand brushes if not better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m reiterating what everyone else has already said, but the brush is of superior quality, the bristles are soft, my makeup gets buffed out easily and flawlessly, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  The handle isn&#x27;t as heavy or posh-posh as some of my more expensive brushes, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.  I find myself reaching for the flat top kabuki more frequently than I do my Sigma brushes.  Excellent brush!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! I ABSOLUTLY love this brush. I love how it feels on my skin. I love that it does jot waste any of my Foundation. Even my bf kept rubbing it on his face when I jjust got it. Really fast shipping. Absolutely recommend this brush and buyer.</li>
    <li> Love this flat top foundation brush! Makes my makeup look flawlessly blended. Received it fast and so happy to get this much quality for the price! Comparable to pricey competitor versions!</li>
    <li> This is my go to brush for everything. I apply my contour with this brush, as well as my powder and liquid foundation AND my blush. I have 2 brushes in my carry makeup kit, this one and my eyeshadow brush, and thats all you need. The brush is super soft and easy to clean, it also has a lot of bristles so it stipples perfectly. Gives you a nice even finish and for a great price, don&#x27;t go spending money on the SIGMA brushes, this is the real deal right here.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brushes, and this one has been my favorite.  Its&#x27; a good product and reasonably priced.  It&#x27;s an awesome brush for foundation. the brush stays firm and applies the product evenly.</li>
    <li> Love it, just like the high priced makeup brushes. Will buy more soon too add to my collection...sweet.budget friendly buy</li>
    <li> Good product but  don&#x27;t see any difference. Not unique.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked this brush as it seemed really stiff compared to the one I had been using (Sephora Pro Airbrush #55).  I kept using it for the rest of the week until I realized it was just very different and I needed to get used to it.  I currently use this brush with my MAC Face and Body liquid foundation and it goes on great!  I can either buff it on or stipple it for more coverage.  I was ready to purchase another brand and this brush came up on Amazon for half the price and now I can clearly see why it got such great reviews.  LOVE IT!  This is definitely a staple in my daily routine.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and have cleaned it several times.  The bristles are in great shape and it&#x27;s very easy to keep clean.  Glad I found this by mistake!</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush, it is one of my new favorites! Doesn&#x27;t shed and is very soft and dense. I may have to buy a backup!! I&#x27;ve used many different brushes from drugstore to high end, and for the price, I honestly don&#x27;t think you can beat it!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!! I definitely recommend for everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my new brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Amazing quality!!! Will definitely buy more</li>
    <li> This brush is so good for the price. It is very soft and blends nicely. I definitely reccomend.</li>
    <li> The bristles of this brush are so soft, and it works well with both powder and liquid foundations.  The first brush I ordered fell apart after just a couple uses, but the seller was quick to reach out and replace it for free.  Happy all around!</li>
    <li> Love this make-up brush!  Foundation goes on evenly and smoothly.  The brush is so soft and feels wonderful on my face.  I would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced and good quality brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is gorgeous.  I&#x27;d never tried a makeup brush for liquid until a friend recommended it.  I am hooked and will buy from beauty junkees again.  Love the product.  Very high quality.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It gives me a flawless foundation application and is so easy to clean.  I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Great quality brush for a good price. It works great with my favorite liquid foundation. I will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Works very well, even for a novice like myself.</li>
    <li> I already have a flat top kabuki which I use daily and since I love it I thought I&#x27;d get this angled kabuki for contouring.  These brushes are very dense and the bristles are a bit shorter than other brands that I have.  They clean up nicely but take just a couple of hours longer to dry because of their denseness.  It works nicely with my contour powder, very happy!</li>
    <li> Omg, this brush is EVERYTHING!! Perfect application, even when it needs to be cleaned! I love it!</li>
    <li> Very good brush. Smooth cover.</li>
    <li> Great makeup brush!  I use this for my mineral powder foundation and it spreads beautifully.  I have already purchased a back up!</li>
    <li> Great for applying liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Best brush I ever had!! Just love it!!</li>
    <li> my make-up goes on great. The brush is so soft, it feels great on my skin!!! :)</li>
    <li> love it! loveit! this brush is the best.. blends foundation really good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a little more than a week now and I have to say, it&#x27;s a decent brush for the price. However, I docked a star because of how difficult the brush is to clean. That could be because of how dense and thick this brush is, but after washing it for a few minutes to make sure I got all of the product out of the brush, it was quick to dry, which I really liked.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that minor fallback, this is a very good brush- very soft, picks up a good amount of product, and applies it evenly on my skin. I love how this brush doesn&#x27;t cake on product, but also doesn&#x27;t leave very little product on the skin either. The application process is flawless, and leaves a nice airbrushed look to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;As far as shedding goes it did shed just a little bit when I initially washed the brush, but other than that it has barely shed at all, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would DEFINATELY recommend this brush to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay $30 (or more) for a sigma brush!</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush!  Soft and no shedding, so important to me.</li>
    <li> Soft, plush, dense fibers. Perfect for quick foundation application!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush at a reasonable price.  I use this brush to apply a loose mineral foundation, and it buffs very well.  I would not spend more for a high-end flat top brush when this gets the job done for less!</li>
    <li> As good as it gets here as far as kabuki brushes go.. I would highly recommend it if you are picky about your brushes, and like brands like mac and stigma. . It is of similar quality and has become a staple in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to put on my powder foundation.  I like it, but I think I was expecting stiffer hairs.  It does work very well though.</li>
    <li> This brush is priced well for a pretty good brush.  It hardly loses any bristles. It works well for applying my Tarte Amazonian Clay liquid foundation.  My only complaint is it makes my skin kind of itchy right after I use it, but I have very sensitive skin. So if you&#x27;re not too sensitive you would probably be fine.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.  I haven&#x27;t had any shedding which is great, and it has given me very nice clean coverage and finish. Really great price too!</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, good coverage and I had my new brush within just a few days.</li>
    <li> I received my order sooner than expected :) I absolutely love this foundation brush :)</li>
    <li> Love the brush and great customer service!</li>
    <li> It was a great brush for the first couple weeks, but now bristles are coming out like crazy. I&#x27;ll get at least five hairs on my face each time I put my foundation on now. Dissapointing. I&#x27;m willing to be the reviews saying they changed the product quality are correct.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have several others and this is better than my bare minerals kabuki.  It has replaced my bare mins. brush.  I use it to apply both powder and liquid bare minerals.</li>
    <li> Wow. Finally I have stumbled upon a really great little makeup brush.  I use liquid foundation sometimes, and sometimes I use a foundation that is very nearly a dry cream foundation (kind of hard to describe, it&#x27;s almost dry but not quite) and this brush works great for both of them.  AND it doesn&#x27;t soak up all the liquid foundation into the brush.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  Gives a nice smooth finish.  I will be purchasing some of these to give as little Christmas remembrances to some of my favorite female friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> Great brush for applying foundation since it leaves your face streak free!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush !!!  You get an absolutely a flawless finish.  Great quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know applying foundation could be so easy.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Bristles are so soft, easily evens out my foundation even the heaviest of kind. Arrived super quick</li>
    <li> Amazing. It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve had and I&#x27;ve used sephora and Mac brushes !  There&#x27;s never a time when there&#x27;s little hairs on my face.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. It applies evenly and is easy to clean.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush ever. So soft and non irritating. I use it with my pressed mineral powder and it gives perfect coverage.</li>
    <li> Very soft and blends beautifully, thank you so much for an affordable alternative to sigma :)</li>
    <li> Love to use this one for foundation.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to discover the wonderful difference this brush makes in how foundation looks on my skin!  Previously, foundation seemed to pool in my pores no matter how expensive it was.  With this brush, I lightly dab it on and then swirl in small circles to spread to get a silky look.  The company I purchased from, Beauty Junkees, even sent me a separate email with very clear directions on how to use and care for the brush.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using this brush for months with no shedding and excellent results!!!  SUCH A BARGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;Additional Update:  My daughter tried it, loved it, and I bought one for her, too, 9 months later (and no problems with my brush at all)!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase! I have been looking for a flat top kabuki brush and I was happy to find this reasonably priced one. Especially considering the quality! It&#x27;s the first foundation of its kind that I&#x27;ve ever purchased and am happy I did. I feel so glamorous applying my foundation with this instead of my fingers. It feels great on my skin and really does improve the overall look of my skin. I do wind up using a bit more than I would if I were to use my fingers BUT wind up with a more &#x27;pulled together&#x27; face so that must be why. The makeup sleeves are also wonderful and help keep my brush&#x27;s shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to try the Tarte foundation brush similar to this one, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay the nearly $40.  I&#x27;m so glad I ran into this brush.  The bristles are soft and densely packed making application of liquid makeup fast and easy.  I find I need less foundation for the same coverage.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles falling out and the construction seems to be sturdy as well.  I often use e.l.f. brushes, but I find that it&#x27;s not uncommon for the brush to easily fall off the handle after regular use (maybe I&#x27;m just too rough).  In my opinion, this brush is a high quality brush without the high price tag to go with it!</li>
    <li> I use Jane Iredale products and own a few of their brushes.  When I was offered this brush to review, I knew the standard that I wanted to hold it up to.  A Jane Iredale brush is a fantastic product ... but price wise it is also 4X as much.  Given that, you are getting a great and versatile brush with this Flat Top Kabuki that does an absolutely stellar job.  I use it specifically with my JI &amp;#34;Dream Tint&amp;#34; which is a very light tinted moisturizer.  I have used it as my foundation.  The Kabuki Flat Top handles it perfectly.  The brush cleans up easily and well.  Feels good in the hand and has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat this functional brush.  Look at that price!  Grab it and go.</li>
    <li> Very impressive brush (flat top kabuki)! I have a few foundation brushes which are very similar (Sigma F82, Real Techniques expert face brush, Dior fluid foundation brush), all have highs and lows but this is overall the best, both quality and value performance.    Pro:  -Perfect density- picks up good amount of foundation, Sigma 82 &amp; Dior are both a bit more dense, which picks up a teeny bit more product, I personally like thin layers and therefore I prefer this one better.    -Fantastic bristle quality- The bristles are very fine, it applies evenly &amp; feels soft on face, unlike the Real Techniques&#x27;, which feels spiky and foundation looks streaky. The bristles of Sigma &amp; Dior are also very fabulous, Dior feels softest on face    -Perfect bristle length-Beauty junkies&#x27; bristles are longer than sigma&#x27;s, I like the longer length because it allows me to apply without pulling my skin too much, Sigma is very very similar except for this part, the shorter bristles pulls my skin a bit more when buffing, especially when the brush is not just washed.    -Synthetic material &#x3D; no cruelty, if we can live our lives without harming others, why shouldn&#x27;t we?    -Low maintenance: Very easy to clean, dries quick, minimal shedding, I washed it 3x so far and just a few strands sheded around the ring.    -Affordable-Great value performance    7/19/14 update:  After 3 weeks of using it everyday I still love it, but it has been shedding a little more than the 1st week, I wash it every 3 days and the loosen bristles tend to come the outter ring.    7/30/14 update:  After using it for more than 1 month, it shed more, there is loose hair almost every time I use it, it sheds even more when I wash it (I wash every 3-4 days), so I have to take 1 star off.    9/10/14 update:  Beauty Junkee proactively asked me to contact them and they replaced the brush, very superb customer service. Will post update after I use the replacement enough to conclude.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush! I have only had it for a couple days now but, I can tell this brush will be with me for the long run. The bristles are amazingly soft and, I find myself petting them more than I do my kitty. In the past, foundation brushes I have used ALWAYS seem to shed leaving me with unflattering lines on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, in additon to the awesome product the customer service and attentiveness provided by BeautyJunkees staff is awesome as well. They really want to give you the best customer service possible (my brush came with some free brush bags, very helpful) and I truly admire that. No doubt that I will be ordering from BeautyJunkees again!!</li>
    <li> Applies multiple types of foundation perfectly! The handle it great and the bristles are packed nice a tight, providing an even distribution.</li>
    <li> This is such a great, dense brush. The quality really impressed me, especially for the price! I highly recommend the angled flat top kabuki.</li>
    <li> I rarely take the time to write a review but this product warrants it. I purchased this based on all the rave reviews but, after a month of use, all the bristles have started to fall out! It works fine for foundation delivery although I found that you have to dab rather than spread or it leaves streaks. Given the quality, however, I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Definitely medium to heavy coverage, so be careful how much foundation you use with it, but it&#x27;s perfect for covering ruddy skin tones and zits. Not great for eyes and nose (for obvious reasons which I didn&#x27;t think about before I bought it--it&#x27;s flat and its dense) but I ended up buying their sponges for my more sensitive skin areas and was totally impressed with those too. Really great quality from this seller for an off-brand.</li>
    <li> This Beauty Junkees Flat Kabuki Brush works very well. I recently switched to a Mineral based Matte Foundation and was looking for a brush that would make application quick and easy. This brush is silky soft and made my base look flawless. I am very pleased will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush!!!  I have worked for Estee Lauder, and Clinique as a counter manager and they have nothing that compares to this brush.  The application is easy, and can give you light, to medium, to heavy coverage depending on what you want. It cleans so easily, and it&#x27;s not from an animal on my sensitive skin!  Never thought this grandma could have such a flawless make up look !!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Definitely better than any other brush I have used.  I do love how it helps to blend in blush as it was demonstrated in the video.  I would definitely recommend Kabuki to others.</li>
    <li> Love the Flat Top Kabuki brush.  Flawlessly applies cream foundation and mineral powder.  Great quality brush. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to enhance their make up application!</li>
    <li> i had to indulge after using the blending sponges. If I don&#x27;t use my sponges in the morning, I feel totally off. Anyways, after loving the sponges so much, I had to give this a try. I&#x27;m very picky about my makeup brushes, needless to say I&#x27;ve had the same ones for about 5 years now, and every time I purchase a new one I can&#x27;t get rid of the old ones...because I hate the ones I just bought. So I was pretty nervous about buying ANOTHER makeup brush. Luckily I&#x27;ve come to find that this makeup brush ROCKS. My biggest pet peeve is when the brush sheds all over my face. I&#x27;ve used this brush many times now and still no shedding! Which is a huge deal for me! Now, with this brush, I do not apply my foundation with (because I can&#x27;t stop using my sponges) BUT after I have my foundation on, I use this brush to buff over my face and blend my makeup down my neck and jawline. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the only one that finds it hard to blend that area, so this brush does a wonderful job! Thank you Beauty Junkees for introducing two amazing products into my makeup application regimen! Now I&#x27;m spoiled and can&#x27;t go back:)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! You got to try it.</li>
    <li> So I been experimenting with new ways to apply my foundation for an airbrushed look and thought that I would try this flat top kabuki brush. It is a very nice brush, but honestly I cannot figure out how to use it to get the look that I want. I recently tried the beauty sponge from Sephora and OMG! That is perfect and easy to use. So I really don&#x27;t have a use for this brush now.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Well worth it for the price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shopping around for a flat top foundation brush for a long time. This one is perfect! It does not shed, it&#x27;s soft, and gives my face an airbrushed finish. Very easy to clean too!!</li>
    <li> I got this brush to blend cream blush into my cheeks.  I use it this way because it is flat and makes the blush look dewy and natural.  Not many bristles come out when I clean the brush and it seems to be holding up well.</li>
    <li> The brush is of great quality and and works wonderfully!  I received emails on how to care for the brush as well as who to contact if I had any problems.  Great customer service!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Got it last week and have since thrown out all of my other foundation brushes. I have used it with liquid foundation, and with finishing powder, and it works great for both. Every other brush I have had has shed bristles, and this one doesn&#x27;t! I love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that this company starts making MORE brushes! I would buy them all.... They only offer an angled and a flat top kabuki brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve used this brush for apply liquid foundation on my face, it&#x27;s awesome for this.  It gives an airbrush finish.  I&#x27;ve also used it a little for contouring around my face and apply bronzer/powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make-up brushes are SO expensive, especially the name brand ones.  This brush does an awesome job and I&#x27;d put it right up there with MAC, Sigma, etc as far as quality.  No bristles are loose, it&#x27;s nice packaging, bristles are soft but not too soft so it keep a shape to do it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make more make-up brushes besides the two offered! I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Its a very nice brush  good for blending foundation  great price love it  would recommend to anyone wanting a pro look</li>
    <li> I bought this at the same time as buying the Sigma F80 flat kabuki brush that I had wanted for a while.  I will soon have a side by side demo/review posted on YouTube (@HoweAboutBeauty) but I will say it here first, I wish i had bought two of these rather than this and the sigma one.&lt;br /&gt;I am a makeup brush junkie.  I am constantly buying new brushes to try things out, and since i loathe deep cleaning them, buying more makes sense to me (don&#x27;t ask :P).  This brush grabs product and is amazing at buffing it into my skin easily and flawlessly.  I do find that it&#x27;s more difficult to clean than my sigma one, but that is just because it&#x27;s more dense (which is better in my mind).&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more brushes from Beauty Junkie.</li>
    <li> Thanks this is a great brush.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this in the mail but when it came, it was loose, like it had a twist off feature. I just adjusted it so it locked back into place and it&#x27;s been fine ever since. This brush is very soft and does not shed. It provides decent coverage. I am happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> It is truly an amazing brush! I recommend all those makeup lovers who want a flawless coverage to go with this brush! It won&#x27;t disappoint!!! Gives amazing coverage</li>
    <li> This brush is superb.</li>
    <li> Nice brush. Not the best ever but good deal for the price</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  I have never used a foundation brush for liquid foundation.  I am shocked at how smooth and flawless my face looks. I LOVE this brush!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for about four months now for liquid foundation application. I find it easy to clean and use and made of high quality materials. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it every day, does not shed at all, super soft, recommended</li>
    <li> Very soft, yet provides smooth sheer coverage with a dewy finish--not cake-y. Clean edge allows to get close under eyes.  Flat top, as expected, but slightly larger than I thought it would be,though still fits into powder compact well. Feels substantial, not cheap. Good item for the price.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product , very smooth and glides really well in the skin!</li>
    <li> Dense and soft.  Full coverage.  Better than many professional brushes!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Sometimes I use it by itself to apply my foundation, and sometimes I use it just to get into areas that my Beauty Blender can&#x27;t. If I use my beauty blender, I always go over my face with this brush to remove any excess foundation. It&#x27;s very soft and has no shedding! It&#x27;s firm enough to spread my foundation evenly. I love it, and always recommend it to friends! Such a bargain! If I didn&#x27;t know better, I would think it was a Sigma brush!</li>
    <li> The best foundation brush I have used yet! Blends my foundation perfectly!</li>
    <li> Nice brush. Feels good in my face when applying my</li>
    <li> So far so good...comparable to high end brushes at a great price!!</li>
    <li> Love love love it. Best brush for a cheap price. I used to pay over $50 for a foundation brush and they did not last long. This brush however is different. Never expected for something that cheap working very well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and delivery</li>
    <li> Super soft, and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush, works great for both powder and liquid.  Beauty junkees have also emailed me tips that have  been fantastic, i will order from them again and again</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the price of this brush - especially with the coupon codes all over the blogosphere.  It&#x27;s a little bit less dense than the sigma f80, but buffs foundation in just as well and dries in half the time.  No shedding at all and I wash it everyday. I don&#x27;t know how they are making any profit off of this, but hurry and pick one up.  The reviews are accurate. Bought 2 of them already</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this brush. Does a great job. Glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> The brush broke within a week of arriving. Had to glue the metal and silver part back together.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush for a really good price. I love using it for all of my foundations and it gives me a really good coverage. The hairs are super soft and do not irritate my skin at all. If you are looking for a solid foundation brush, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one. It works really well and I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have been looking or a great kabuki brush for a long time. This brush works so well and applies my foundation evenly and smoothly. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the soft bristles and how it evening spreads the foundation!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! Only been using it for two weeks so i cant give a detailed review, but so far its great! It reminds me of the sigma flat kabuki brush, they feel pretty much the same but this is way cheaper! i am so glad i found it. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I used to love my MAC 187 brush, but this has replaced it.  The bristles are super soft, I haven&#x27;t had any shedding, the handle is just the right size and overall- there is great value in the price that is sells for.  I will admit, when I first opened my package, I was taken aback by the diesel like smell, but after a couple of uses that quickly dissipated.  I use it to put on my liquid foundation, which I generally dot on to my face, pat, then buff.  Because the brush is so dense, it helps to quickly place my makeup without missing a spot.  It gives me a air brushed look that again rivals any high end makeup brush from the department store.  I received this very quickly (thanks Amazon Prime) and I was thoroughly impressed with the company&#x27;s customer service as they followed up to ensure I had received the package and was happy with the product.  If you are in the market for a new makeup brush and are put off my department store prices- look no further this is a great brush that will quickly become a staple in your makeup routine.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite brushes! Fast shipping, great customer service. Will definitely be purchasing from Beauty Junkees again.</li>
    <li> Great price and the brush works really well with liquid foundation. I use a daily brush cleaner spray, and wash my brushes once a week. I&#x27;m only giving this brush 3 stars because after using it for a year, the bristles have started falling out.</li>
    <li> As long as I keep it clean, this baby applies my BB cream with a flawless finish! It looks very natural, and my face no longer looks like a cakey mess! I could never go back to sponges or finger application after using this!</li>
    <li> Love the brush! It makes my foundation go on flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great word of mouth about this brush, so I finally gave in and purchased one. It&#x27;s very good, doesn&#x27;t make my face itchy afterwards like my previous foundation brush. My makeup also goes on much nicer, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that a synthetic brush actually works better than animal bristled brushes.  I absolutely love this brush.  the length of the bristles are perfect to achieve that airbrushed look when applying foundations and powders.  Absolutely no streaking, no bristles have fallen out, and it is so dense.  I can&#x27;t believe it was only 12$.  I will be purchasing more of these brushes for my kit.</li>
    <li> this brush is great for foundation.  I washed it and left it to dry flat on its side and it didn&#x27;t lose its shape. way cheaper than other similar brushes I have looked at and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> My first Kabuki brush and it&#x27;s amazing! Very good quality and so soft! Such a good price as well.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Works great. Looks even better with use of primer beforehand. Why is there a word requirement on reviews?!</li>
    <li> Have used this for 1 week now and love how my foundation looks.</li>
    <li> Great blending brush! It gives you that clean airbrushed look in my opinion. Super easy to clean! I use it almost everyday.</li>
    <li> They always say that the best tools are your hands, when it comes to applying foundation, and I used to think that was true until I tried this brush. This brush is fantastic and worth much more than I paid for it, though I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s reasonably priced! My foundation looks so much better than it ever has before.  The brush doesn&#x27;t absorb all your foundation and helps keep the application flawless. I no longer have too much foundation settling into my peach fuzz! This brush feels great too. It doesn&#x27;t have that prickly feel when it touches your skin, it&#x27;s nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t leave bristles behind. I highly recommend this brush and this seller! I got my brush within 48 hours of placing the order and appreciated the email from Beauty Junkees with tips for use and cleaning. They go above and beyond to provide a great experience. Definitely will order from them again! Thanks Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> excellent brush, easy application in seconds! I love this! Flawless look achieved! No need to pay a higher price! Functional easy brush that does what it says it does!</li>
    <li> I m super impressed with the Quality of the product as well the Customer service  Well This is my second purchase with Beauty Junkees after being super happy with the sponges .&lt;br /&gt;One day i used this brush for liquid foundation ,  The other day i used it slightly damped for the application of  cream foundation ,this brush does wonders . Yes the difficult part is around eye area but one can always blend it with fingers . But i m super  happy the way it blends the foundation evenly and gives you airbrush finish .&lt;br /&gt;The tips suggested by Beauty Junkees are perfect , I wash my brush with little bit of oil and then using a soap..</li>
    <li> Got this for my lovely wife. She was at first miffed, believing she had chosen a Sigma brand kabuki brush. She quickly grew to love this brush after using it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my own observation and feel, the brush tips are light, fluffy, and dense. My wife is able to use less makeup to apply an even and light layer of foundation. The visual results are rather impressive, even for me as her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Beauty Junkees store, this was our first order from them and I have no complaints. Prompt shipping and good communication throughout the delivery process. They even do a good job of following up with tips on brush care and cleaning. I&#x27;d recommend Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> Great Brush! Soft, smooth great coverage, easy to clean.  The only reason I gave it four stars was it had a production type chemical smell to it when I received it. I was however able to wash it in vinegar and water solution and the smell went away.  And now it&#x27;s perfect especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. I have very sensitive skin and this brush is very gentle on it. I&#x27;ve encountered some brushes that just feel too rough, but this is definitely not one of them! It has soft, dense bristles that are not even a hint scratchy. Liquid foundation blends flawlessly without any streaks and makes it look great. This brush is on par with high end brands such as It Cosmetic, Mac, and Zoeva brushes. For the price, you honestly can&#x27;t beat it. I recommend these 110%.</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t have much hope for this brush due to the price being rather on the cheap side but my god I was mind blown! i tried this brush out with my liquid foundation. The application was very smooth and even. There was no streaks on my face left from the brush. I couldn&#x27;t believe how flawless my foundation looked on my face and also very airbrushed. With other brushes that i used before for my foundation it took a while to buff in the foundation and apply evenly but with this brush it takes seconds to get your foundation spread evenly across your face. This brush works wonders with liquid foundation seriously, everyone needs one of theses brushes in there life. you&#x27;ll be very surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9/26/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I washed the brush twice the bristles on the brush started to come out and the bristles came out all over my face. I really wanted to love this brush but for the price that it is worth the brush doesn&#x27;t last long and with time it starts to fall apart. Sadly I had to invest in a more higher end brush instead.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn foundation regularly because it was so hard to get it even.  A cosmetics counter gal convinced me to try again with a really good brush.  This one is amazing!  Perfect coverage, no &amp;#34;poking&amp;#34; of harsh bristles, easy to use and maintain.  And a great price, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated hearing how to clean it in a follow-up email from the merchant.  Friends can&#x27;t place what&#x27;s different, just that I look more rested.  Wish I had discovered this long ago.</li>
    <li> Love this beautiful brush, its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I red tons of reviews and i was about to order the sigma f80 i think its called like that, well then i saw this one and i dont regret buying it its a great brush and leaves my foundation flawless. Take the risk its worth it.</li>
    <li> Works really nicely thank you</li>
    <li> Good brush love it this is the brush</li>
    <li> Best buffing brush in the market. Don&#x27;t waste your money expensive brushes. I have ben using this brush for over a year and it hasn&#x27;t shed at all.  Best foundation brush out there for a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> This is the best Face Brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I use a combination of Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and Urban Decay Foundation as my daily face makeup.  It gives me perfect coverage and doesn&#x27;t look botchy at all.  Very smooth.  My MAC brush was put to the side after this bad boy.</li>
    <li> Super soft and does a great job!</li>
    <li> came quickly. had a strong chemical smell but i think it was the packaging, left out for a couple of days to air, then the smell was only slight. I don&#x27;t really notice s smell now. how to clean the brush instructions in the email were helpful - i dont use brushes &amp; this one recd great reviews so i decided it was a great place to start! i do find that brushes use a lot more foundation than i care to put on my face, but guess i&#x27;ll just use on certain places instead. knocked off a star for the unusually strong chem smell.</li>
    <li> Foundation slides on like butter!! Love it</li>
    <li> Great makeup brush and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I probably got the wrong type of brush. I need one for bronzer and mineral blush. I used this one on my mineral blush. The powder sticks on the brush in lumps and does not spread evenly.  I thought it works on powders as well.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush once so far. Application of foundation was very smooth and easy. I found it works better with the &amp;#34;dabbing&amp;#34; technique rather than smearing it around. It really covered my pores good.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush. It has become my everyday brush for applying my YSL liquid foundations. It goes on very smoothly. I feel like the brush holds the product very well and it spreads it around my face nicely!</li>
    <li> The quality of the brush is good and very comparable to other companies with the same brush.  First wash went very well, no shedding, and no smells.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!! Soft and applies product great</li>
    <li> Awesome brush, no complaints!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush.  I am able to blend my foundation so evenly.  The finish is flawless.  I had tried other brushes, but the brush fibers were always all over my face.  I read the reviews about this brush and decided to give it a try.  It works so well.  I cannot believe I had been applying my foundation with makeup sponges previous to this brush. No more makeup sponges!!!  You will not be disappointed if you order this brush.  It is well worth it.</li>
    <li> reviews are consistent with my experience. nice brush</li>
    <li> This is my first makeup brush and I am incredibly impressed! Before this purchase I always applied makeup with my fingers, thus I had a sheer look from liquid foundation that I had to keep layering on over and over, THEN cover with a powder to get some semblance of coverage. Nevermore with this brush in my life! Now I only have to apply my powder foundation with this brush to get full, long-lasting coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is extremely soft and feels great on the skin. I&#x27;ve noticed other reviewers mentioned a strange smell to the brush, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that. Either way I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> As a former MAC employee I was skeptical but I  would have to say that I absolutely love this brush, My MAC brushes shed like crazy and I LOVE how soft and supple this brush is and it doesnt take a lot of product to get that flawless look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used a foundation brush for my makeup application. I generally just stick to using my hands or the beauty blender. I was really impressed with this brush and it gave a very nice seamless application and I even got compliments for how my makeup looked. I might even be ordering another one for my sister I like it so much. I have yet to wash it and see how it is after that but so far after about a week of use its very good. The price point is a great plus I don&#x27;t have the money to be spending $30 on a makeup brush. This does the job in less than half the price of most similar brushes! The only con i would say is that it smells a bit when you first open the packaging but after a few uses the smell is gone, it is probably from the dye used on the bristles but I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by it. I would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brush at a great price! I will be ordering the entire collection. Love this makeup brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Feels great on your face. I would 100% recommend it and would definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It works great for any powdered foundation.</li>
    <li> This brush is of excellent quality--and at a bargain price. It perfectly blends and buffs foundation. Beauty Junkees is a very unusual company with top notch customer service. Their communication is fabulous--as soon as you order they send you an email with instructions about how to care for your brush and links on how best to use it. I received it quickly. Very happy with the purchase--but even more happy to know that there is a still a company out there who goes that extra mile for their customers.</li>
    <li> The bristles are so soft, my foundations looks flawless and it blends really well. I like that they are synthetic bristles so the foundation doesn&#x27;t get absorbed by the brush.</li>
    <li> I just received this brush and cannot wait to use it! The bristles are pretty soft and I hope it does the work it says it does!</li>
    <li> One of the softest brushes I have ever purchased. It wasn&#x27;t too expensive and I am happy with the quality of the brush especially for the price it cost. My go to product was a beauty blender sponge but now I have something else that it contends with. I will more than likely purchase some of the other brushes that they sell.</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have to give it a 5 star is amazing I use it with my concealer foundation and my powders it goes smooth gives you that matte look on your face and so easy to use I love it wish I had this brush before it has so many uses thank you</li>
    <li> This is my go to foundation brush. It last for months four to five months under daily (sometimes two to three times a day) use. It applies smoothly, easily and buffs out pores like a charm. This is my go to liquid foundation brush.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to apply foundation evenly to my face. The brush is well constructed with a sturdy handle and very soft bristles. Applying foundation with this brush is a breeze and a delight! It goes on very evenly and the bristles are very smooth to the touch. Beautyjunkees even emails you some basic instructions on how to use and care for your brush. Furthermore, the pricing is very competitive. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush. It spreads out matte foundation evenly all over my base, and distributes powder really well too! The hairs feel great on your skin and I haven&#x27;t come across any hairs falling out yet. Love it. Am going to buy more!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! I was definitely skeptical that a kabuki brush would work as well as the flat makeup brush that I previously used. I prefer to use Jane Iredale liquid mineral foundation on days when I want less coverage and Revlon Photoready liquid makeup when I need more coverage. I have had problem skin for many years, but this brush makes my skin look absolutely flawless. I can go back over areas that require more coverage without my makeup looking caked on, and the finished result is an airbrushed look. I could not be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So soft and provides great coverage at a very reasonable price!!!!</li>
    <li> I had a real problem with Amazon sending the wrong product the first time I ordered this product.  However, I really wanted to try it based on the positive reviews so I ordered it again.  Boy, am I glad I did!  I&#x27;m new at applying liquid foundation with a brush, but this seems to do the trick!  If there are any issues, it&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m still learning the technique.  Thank you Beauty Junkies for a great product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush from the recommendation of Lisettesbeaute on Youtube.  The main selling point for me from Emily&#x27;s review was that the brush did not absorb liquid easily.  Having used the brush now, I definitely agree.  I have been using Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki for over a year, and the main issue I have with it is how much product it absorbs and how hard it is to clean.  It takes a long time to wash out all of the foundation and over 12 hours to dry.  Washing the Beauty Junkee brush was much easier, less dry time, and no shedding so far.  I may prefer the bristles to be a little more tightly packed as they are a little looser than the F80, but it still gets the job done without near the hassle of constantly cleaning the Sigma F80.  Customer service has been excellent with the company.</li>
    <li> This foundation brush was excellent. Comparing it to my Sigma flat top it was easier to use and there was no shedding even after washing the brush. It is a remarkable value and definitely worth purchasing. Very, very pleased with my purchase and I will buy more brushes!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, its now my favorite foundation brush and for the price its amazing!</li>
    <li> Really great brush for the price, nice and full with soft bristles. I use it for liquid foundation and the coverage I get is really nice.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!  The smell of the brush was really strong at first but after I washed the brush (followed instructions) the smell didn&#x27;t linger anymore. Works great!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!!! OMG it is amazingly soft!! Blends my liquid foundation beautifully!</li>
    <li> Unreal!!- I used a brush for foundation years ago- but, I guess- it was a wrong type- never created a great finish- it was a flat surface- and I &#x27;painted&#x27; the foundation on- I find patting it around face w this brush creates a airbrush finish- I had been using a beauty blender- which cannot cannot compare to this brush!!!</li>
    <li> Gives me even coverage. Skin looks flawless! Love love love this brush!</li>
    <li> It is definitely a great brush! Exactly what I needed! Very soft on my face.</li>
    <li> This brush is SOOO soft and dense. My foundation goes on smoothy and evenly and the bristles don&#x27;t poke and scratch my face. I own a whole bunch of brushes and this is now one of my favorites. It kind of reminds me of Too-Faced&#x27;s Teddy Bear Hair brush, but it feels more airy/light.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for covering up my redness, acne, and acne scars.  It is easy to blend the foundation with this brush and helps to not make the foundation look caked on.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush! Makes my cream foundation look air brushed</li>
    <li> This brush provides better foundation coverage than any other brush I own. It is so soft and dense. I use this to effortlessly stipple on my foundation for a full, even finish.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a good brush overall. I&#x27;ve been using mine for a couple weeks now and still haven&#x27;t noticed even a single hair shed from the brush. It&#x27;s very soft so it doesn&#x27;t drag on your skin, but full enough that blending is fairly easy.</li>
    <li> Soft brush. Applied makeup evenly and the fact that they tell you how to care for it and what the brush is best used for and how to apply it is wonderful. Worth the money</li>
    <li> Better then I expected!!</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this brush I was guilty of using my fingers. I use expensive foundation and felt like i was burning through it too quickly and that was what drove me to buy this brush. Honestly don&#x27;t know how I lived without this. I&#x27;m only using a pea sized amount of my foundation now and it gives me a very natural finish. I&#x27;ve never used makeup brushes prior to this but I highly doubt I&#x27;ll try another since this works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I received this brush and the quality is great. I wish I would have done my research before I spent tons of money on other high end brushes. I received my brush the same day I ordered it via same day shipping and was extremely happy with the overall brush. I only had a minor issue which wasn&#x27;t anything that affected my outlook on the brush quality more so the packaging. It comes in a plastic sealed package which can squish the brush hairs. (Maybe Beauty Junkees could look into adding a harder plastic topper on the brush.) I noticed it didn&#x27;t have the rounded look after I took it from the package so I thought maybe give it a day or two and it will take shape. But it didn&#x27;t so I contacted Beauty Junkees and left a message. I spoke with Christy and she was awesome. She&#x27;s sending me another brush and apologized for the inconvenience. Their customer satisfaction is great. I received emails explaining how to clean the brushes and also to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. I definitely plan to purchase the whole kabuki set and also the mini kabuki set. I used the brush once and even though it wasn&#x27;t rounded it still gave a flawless application with liquid foundation. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like this flat top kabuki brush much better than others that look like paint brushes. Although, I was hoping the foundation would not stain it but it did despite washing it following the instructions I received. But it still works great and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Cheap and the best makeup brush ever. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive name brand ones when this one is just as great. Absolutely love it. Customer service is great too! And came earlier the expected :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve been doing my makeup for so long without this brush. My foundation looks a million times better than using a regular flat foundation brush.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of expensive brushes for my makeup. This brush is my new favorite. I will only buy these brushes from this company from now on. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love it. I replaced my Sigma brush with this one and this is half the price. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Super high quality brush for a fraction of the price. I used to use all MAC brushes but decided to give this a try. This is the same quality and the brush gives me the SAME wear and look as the MAC brush. Never going back</li>
    <li> First, about the brush: It is wonderful, I use it everyday for my finishing powder, it is perfect for it.  It&#x27;s not too stiff but not to soft, absolutely perfect!&lt;br /&gt;This company is so awesome too, I have received 2 emails from them, the first with a thank you and instructions, the second to make sure that I received the product, am happy and with cleaning instructions.  It&#x27;s nice to deal with a company that cares about what they are selling!</li>
    <li> Loove this brush! I am. Makeup snob I must say. I was replacing my Mac brush, love the coverage it gives for my foundation!!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is great - I use so much less makeup than I normally would and the coverage is very good. Also - great customer service from Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> amazing quality. Amazing price. Very soft brush that buffs in my foundation flawlessly! So far no shedding. Love!</li>
    <li> It was great!...... While it lasted which was less than a month. After that ALL the bristles came off and i mean ALL OF THEM!</li>
    <li> **UPDATED REVIEW** I had to change my rating... since I washed my brush, the bristles shed like crazy and applying foundation is now incredibly messy and frustrating. Hairs are loose and all over my face and sink, I remove at least 20-40 daily, the density of the bristles has really suffered. I was hoping to post photos of the bristles that fell out in one day and how ratty the brush now looks, but I don&#x27;t see a place to upload on my phone app. Awesome brush until I washed it :(&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous brush. This thing is HUGE, a lot larger than I had expected, so is a little awkward at first to get used to. Very happy with application of my cream foundation, my old brush made a mess of it. Will definitely check out what other brushes this company offers.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these brushes. The price is unbeatable. I was shocked with just how soft they were when applying my makeup. I purchased the flat top kabuki and the angled kabuki for my blush, and everything just goes on so effortlessly. I really could not be happier. These are more than worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful brush...making flawless and quick work for a beautiful face.  Buy this one and trash all your others. Make up like a pro.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush!  I can&#x27;t believe I was once stupid enough to buy an over priced brush from MAC!  That brush left little black hairs all over my face when I used it.  MAC laughed it off telling me that&#x27;s what that brush did!  Never again!&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to find this brush!  Great quality, love the customer service touch with the email you get after purchasing with tips and guide.  I use it every morning, my face looks flawless and when I am washing the makeup off my hands, I use my hand soap to quickly wash this off too.  I let it dry throughout the day and its perfect for the next time I use it!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Should say posted by Paula..Ed&#x27;s my hubby.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is awesome!  Perfect for applying foundation. High quality.  If your thinking about getting it, don&#x27;t hesitate. Makes applying foundation a breeze!</li>
    <li> Soft, dense, effective brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price. I use the flat top kabuki to stipple on my MUFE HD foundation and then buff in circular motions. Results in a beautifully smooth finish. Brush feels very nice on the skin. The bristles are very dense which means that drying it takes some time after washing (but it&#x27;s so important to wash your brushes!) and surprisingly, the bristles have held up well without none coming out. Wonderful brush.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of brushes! I bought this as I needed something to fill up the price to be eligible for free amazon shipping.This one gives me a better result than sephora air brush pro and the real techniques buffing brush and expert face brush. Probably because the bristles are so dense. I used it  with tom ford cream foundation and also liquid foundations. The flat top allows me to push the cream foundation on to my skin and then buff it in. Love it! And for such a reasonable price at that! This makes me want to check out their other brushes. Amazing find!</li>
    <li> I got this on the suggestion of one of my favorite beauty gurus Saaamage and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This is a great brush, very soft and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding even after washing. It seems like a really quality product and the customer service is amazing. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Great brush blends foundation well.</li>
    <li> First brush I&#x27;ve ever used to apply foundation but I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a bad habit of not washing my brushes enough and being super rough when I do. This brush has been holding up really well considering I bought it a few months back. Little to no shedding, and it&#x27;s soft and excellent for foundation. I even received email tips, which while a little obvious and unnecessary, was still nice to receive. When this one dies, I&#x27;ll be buying another.</li>
    <li> Love love love this foundation brush. Gives me awesome full coverage. It is easy to clean and the quality is amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for my liquid foundation</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for quite sometime however I am a stay at home mom and only use the brush maybe twice a month. The brush hairs are falling out like crazy and I don&#x27;t think it should be doing this with such minimal use and good care.</li>
    <li> nice good quality brush.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these kabuki brushes, one for me and one for my eighteen year old daughter. We&#x27;re both very happy with the quality. This is a excellent brush at a great price.</li>
    <li> Very nice proffesional looking make up brush which works well with liquid foundation to give you an air brush like look. The brush tip is very soft but stiff enough to put on the make up flawlessly with its flat top edge. This is my first time using a brush of this kind and I am very impressed. I also was impressed with the price as it was extremely reasonable at $12 compared to simular brushes selling for much more. I also was impressed with the seller who sent me an email thanking me for the purchase and gave me tips on how to use and care for the brush. After I received the product I received another email telling me again how they appreciated my buying from them and asked me to write a short review. I have only received a thank you one other time from a seller and it is refreshing to know you are not just a person who bought one of their products but they valued you as a customer. Rating this seller as a Number ONE on my list. Since I have only used the product one time I may come back and add more comments as I continue to use it. I recommend this brush to you if you want a quality product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much! It works perfectly, the bristles are soft and it distributes the make up really well.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I was looking to replace my sigma F80. The Sigma F80 is hard to clean and the bristles are too hard my face. This brush far exceeds the Sigma F80 brush! It is so much softer and blends beautifully - at a fraction of the price! I can&#x27;t wait to try the other brushes!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible brush. The handle broke on the second day of use! DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> the brush is really soft and easy to handle and clean. i have only used it with loose powder and it works evenly..... seems great so far....will see if in the future i get breakouts.</li>
    <li> I bought this makeup brush for my young teen daughter, as I was tired of her making off with my brush all the time! Plus, it isn&#x27;t really a good idea to share brushes like that. She loved it, and it really suits her needs at this point. The delivery was speedy and service was no-hassle.</li>
    <li> I have waited a whole year before writing my review because I truly wanted to use it and see how it performed over time.  5 stars!!!  Many of the kabuki brushes I have bought in the past have lost many bristles and have gotten coarser after daily use and occasional washing/drying.  I have not lost one single bristle from this brush, and it has retained its original softness.  It also has maintained its shape better than other brushes.  This is definitely a must buy for all mineral powder users!</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great brush! I use it as a everyday foundation brush and im pleased with the results i get!!</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about buying this brush, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted this or the sigma f80. After reading reviews for both, I decided to get this brush and I love it! I was amazed the first time I used it at how evenly it spreads my foundation. I was afraid from reviews that the bristles would come out, but I havent had any problems with that or the handle coming off.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews bit this brush is AMAZING I have dry skin n my foundation alwasy clumped on my dry spots and streaked everywhere else. The brush is dense and applies beautifly. No more streaks now a nice smooth all over coverage. It smells so weird when you get it but everthing else is great. Haven&#x27;t washed it yet but so far no fallout and no breaking like I saw on a few reviews. I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells like toxic chemicals when you open it. Other than that, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and sturdy in your hands and the bristles are very soft on your skin. Perfect for applying powder foundation or setting powder! If you&#x27;re thinking about buying one of their brushes, do it!!</li>
    <li> Better than brand-name brushes that sell for so much more. This brush is perfect for buffing and if you clean it often, will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Just received my brush in the mail today! Super fast delivery and the brush feels amazingly soft. Can&#x27;t wait to use it :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me awhile to write this.  I was not sure if I liked using the brush at first because it was different than using my fingers but now that I am used to it, I love it!  I feel my makeup goes on more evenly. I was worried at first that I&#x27;d use up my makeup much faster but I just put my makeup in spots on my face like I always did and found it didn&#x27;t take anymore.  The quality of the brush is great.  It cleans real easy as well.  I got several emails from Beauty Junkees with tips and reminding me to clean my brush after each use. I just keep some DAWN dish liquid under my bathroom sink and after I put my makeup on with the brush, I put a couple of drops in the palm of my hand with warm water and clean the brush it in my hand by swirling it around and then rinsing under running warm water.  The price was fantastic as well.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> So incredibly soft and appears to be very well made.  I plan to enjoy this for years to come!</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these brushes and love them. The company is great for giving tips on care and how to use them as well.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, and the bristles are densely packed I was astonished.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommended to my friends and I&#x27;ll be looking in to more brushes of this brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush to apply foundation. It blends everything so smoothly. Also, I would recommend buying from beauty junkees they provided excellent customer service along with a great product.</li>
    <li> EDIT November 2016-ish The brush has begun to shed excessively. Disappointed :(  EDIT 8/22 The handle of the brush came off completely, reminding me of the $1 ELF brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. Bear in mind that I wash and dry my brushes very carefully, taking great pains to tilt it a certain way so water won&#x27;t loosen the glue holding the top and handle together. I know it won&#x27;t be an issue to superglue the handle back to the brush, but this occurrence was quite a disappointment.  ORIGINAL REVIEW I absolutely adore this brush. When I first got it I wasn&#x27;t too sure how to use it most efficiently, but after a few uses I got the hang of it.  Dot your foundation/BB cream all over your face or on the brush itself, then stipple the product onto your face. First few stipples won&#x27;t be perfect, but just continue to lightly stipple (not buff) and the product will blend seamlessly. It&#x27;s a little difficult to get to the crevices of your face (around nose, inner eye) so I&#x27;ll be trying the angled kabuki and we&#x27;ll see how that goes.  Overall, a really great brush and a great price. Washes well, doesn&#x27;t shed. Alot of product gets stuck in the brush though, so remember to wash it thoroughly until water runs clear, or not you&#x27;ll be stippling your face with old product.</li>
    <li> So far so good. After a slight bleep with my first brush and awesome customer service....it looks like things will be fine. I did use the original brush 2 times and I think I am going to like this brush. Thank you Julie for resolving my brush issue. :)</li>
    <li> I washed this brush with soap and water after the first time I used it, figuring it would be dry by morning.  It felt almost completely dry within an hour or two (the bristles are so soft I wanted to touch and admire it).  I plan to use it with my foundation, then spritz brush sanitizer on it and use it with blush - it dries that fast.</li>
    <li> 4.5 stars, rounded up for great price and fast shipping.  This brush was exactly what I was looking for:  it was soft, dense and the perfect size for applying foundation.  Didn&#x27;t have any trouble using or cleaning the product.  The only reason I knocked off half a point was because there was a weird chemically smell coming from the handle of the brush. Kind of reminded me of the smell of paint?  After a few washes, the smell went away.  The brush itself was fine and didn&#x27;t have that same smell.  Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for an excellent brush at such a great price.  I love it.  Thanks for the fast shipping and follow up.  I will definitely be back for more of your products.</li>
    <li> This Kabuki brush is just as good as the high end foundation brushes that sell for a much higher price! I love how easy it is to apply my foundation, and it is super soft! My buying experience from the product to the seller could not have been any better!</li>
    <li> The only foundation brush that I would ever use.  It is soft and it puts on foundation evenly and naturally.  I love this brush so much 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Love it will order more</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic brush! Works just as well as the expensive ones from MAC!</li>
    <li> Completely blown away by this brush!! I&#x27;m a beginner-intermediate makeup applicator who is always too busy to really sit down and really practice applying makeup BUT I am a beauty lover and I know a lot about makeup. That being said, I&#x27;ve tried many brushes and even the popular sponges but NONE were as easy, fast, and versatile as this brush is. It&#x27;s amazing! I have a few medium size red acne spots that this brush completely covers up even with my Garnier BB cream! And I have the Estée Lauder foundation which is my full coverage and with this brush, it&#x27;s been the only way I have actually achieved a non-makeup yet full coverage look. And like I said I am a beginner-intermediate user! I highly recommend this to anyone starting off, and for the price, I love it and I&#x27;m sure you will too! I am fixing to buy more as a Xmas present to all the beautiful ladies I know!</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation brush....</li>
    <li> Love this, works just as well, if not better than the sigma F80. Blends foundation out perfectly and doesn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! The bristles are very soft and even and the value is unbeatable.  It applies makeup very well.  I would definitely recommend this brush</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this brush! I think I might love it more than my Sigma F80 &amp; my Real Techniques brush. It&#x27;s super soft and blends so nicely! I was a little hesitant to purchase it because I&#x27;ve never purchased from this brand but I&#x27;m so glad I did! I definitely recommend it if you don&#x27;t wanna splurge on Sigma and it was cheaper than Morphe because of the code I used. Love it! I will be purchasing the other brushes they have!</li>
    <li> excellent no streak coverage, well worth the money</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;d like to say that I LOVE the fact that this brush was delivered to me on a Sunday (we don&#x27;t receive mail on Sundays), so I tried it out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I normally use an angled kabuki flat top from ecotools, which works great, but I find that the foundation or bb creme seeps into the brush, making it difficult to clean and uses up a lot of product. That&#x27;s not the case for this brush. Very easy to pick up the right amount of product I want, and the coverage it provides is great! I have a lot of scars that are difficult to cover up, and a lot of times end up looking too cakey because of layering, but this brush doesn&#x27;t have that problem. It leaves a flawless finish with no lines, and I&#x27;m able to add layers without it looking like it&#x27;s too much. I also use this brush to set my makeup with pressed powder, and it works out great!&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is a lot bigger than I expected, which makes my routine a lot faster. The bristles are extremely soft and not irritating to the skin at all (and I have very sensitive skin). It&#x27;s also very easy to maneuver around the under eye area, unlike other flat top brushes I&#x27;ve tried. Cleaning is extremely easy, I either use oil or a face wash. Overall a fantastic brush, my new favorite!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought any beauty products offline before. When I bought this I thought it was either gonna be a scam or really really bad. However this product is great. I use it with Kat Von D foundation everyday . It&#x27;s extremely soft and I just wash it with soap about once a week</li>
    <li> I love it! the bristles are so soft and it applies my makeup so flawlessly that I gear towards this brush more than my beauty blender! Will definitely repurchase and try out their other brushes!!</li>
    <li> This is the first Kabuki brush I have ever used with my foundation.  I absolutely LOVE it!  Makes my foundation look flawless when I put it on.  It&#x27;s makes my morning routine so much quicker!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little larger than my real techniques brush. Foundation was flawless in less than a minute. WTF? How did I not find this sooner. Just ordered more!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. It makes blending my foundation so easy. My makeup looks flawless thanks to the bristles being so densed. I have put down my Crown brush, and made this one my new fav. Can&#x27;t wait to try the rest of the collection.</li>
    <li> Really great brush. Before this brush, I used a beginners brush set. I bought this brush to expand out of the &amp;#34;beginners&amp;#34; category and start building my collection. Very happy with my choice. Amazing brush.</li>
    <li> This is my second brush from Beauty Junkees.  They are both exactly what I wanted, and much cheaper than other alternatives.  I am very happy with my purchases.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin and amazing how it provides such great coverage. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great brush love it !</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft and handle is sturdy. Distribution of my alima powder foundation was smooth. I was also provided with clear instructions on cleaning and maintaining this brush</li>
    <li> It is a great brush...no falling out. I blend my makeup with Olay regenerating serum on the back of my hand and use the brush to pick it up from there. I can use less makeup and I don&#x27;t look over done. I should have had one years ago.</li>
    <li> Nice brush.  Good quality, easy to use.  Allows for great coverage.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush, very thick bristles could beat any overpriced brush</li>
    <li> for not spending much money, this lil guy is great.  only issue I had was the base broke off from the top...took a bit of glue and was good as new, but still sort of frustrating.  other then THAT ive loved the brush itself.  it does a wonderful job in helping apply an even cover with my powder foundation.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this brush on my face!</li>
    <li> Affordable brush that won&#x27;t leave bristles behind while applying liquid foundation!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Very soft and dense.  Cleans well without shedding. customer service is very helpful too.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Good quality and great seller!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. So soft. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft!! I love it!  Although the handle is a bit bulky to fit in my pencil case and brush jar.  I wish they made this with a smaller handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush makes me feel so luxurious whenever I put on foundation, it&#x27;s so soft I can&#x27;t wait to use it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope the bristles don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after hearing about it in one of my favorite YouTuber&#x27;s monthly favorites video.  She said it was softer and denser than the Sigma F80 brush (which I had been eying for a long time but never jumped on it because of the price). All the reviews on here also raved much the same things, so I had to give this brush at half the price a try! Upon receiving and opening my Beauty Junkees Flat Top Kabuki brush, I fell in love.  The bristles are soooooo soft and dense, I almost want to sleep on them! My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get the full set :)</li>
    <li> Great price and awesome brush!</li>
    <li> Great price for a foundation brush.</li>
    <li> Very good brush! Spreads foundation easily and evenly. Don&#x27;t put too much liquid foundation for application; a little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush will be back to buy more thanks !!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. It is so soft and does not feel as though it&#x27;s cheaply made. Leaves a flawless coverage.</li>
    <li> I use this for my powder and liquid. Very sturdy brush, good quality with a great price. Easy to clean and bristles stay put. My other brushes, even the more expensive ones, have bristles that fall out so im very happy with this product &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this brush. It is honestly such an amazing brush and for the price of it you can not bet it. The bristles to the brush are dense and it is extremely soft. I am obsessed with this brush and also the application of this brush it so simply and it goes on so smoothly and gives me such a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and applies all kinds of makeup perfectly! I&#x27;ve used it with cream makeup from a tube and with powder foundation. Perfect for both! Easy to wash and no hairs come out! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this for liquid and dry powder, best brush I&#x27;ve used for both gives a flawless look!</li>
    <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s super soft and is good quality at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and works so well</li>
    <li> Great brush and it blends well</li>
    <li> Wife likes it, no complaints. Received it incredibly fast too.</li>
    <li> This is a great and high quality product. The company who sells this product provide great information about the product and also great cleaning tips! Beauty junkees goes above and beyond in their customer service and provide quickly, helpful, and friendly responses. I highly recommend this product. One can&#x27;t go wrong with the wonderful quality and wonderful customer service.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush it works better than my beauty blender. I lost the first one so I had to reorder a new one. The brittles of the second one I ordered fell out after I washed it three times. I contacted the seller and she offered to send me another one. Overall I have been pleased with this brush.</li>
    <li> We have used a great variety of brushes and sponges throughout the years.  Simply put, these are great brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first opened, I notice a slight smell that went away fairly quickly.  The brush is balanced perfectly and is manufactured with quality.  This brush excels (at least for me) as a foundation brush.  The brush does not spread easily in use.  It is very dense.  The brush is large, while not excessive and we experienced no shedding even during very heavy usage among three girls and a mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- we love this brush and brand. Note- sample was provided for testing and a no obligation review.</li>
    <li> This has replaced my buki brush- no shedding and excellent full coverage. LOVE THIS!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever bought and I must say I&#x27;m over the moon pleased with this brush. I bought it to apply my foundation and get away from sponges. This brush applies it so evenly and is super easy to clean. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Would highly recommend.  I have used for my IT Cosmetics Celebration powder foundation and also for some liquid foundations.  It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it. it really blends my foundation nicely onto my face, allows the foundation to give me better coverage. The brush is really dense and soft, and gives my foundation an airbrushed finish.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for my contour !</li>
    <li> Great brush! Works well with my liquid foundation!</li>
    <li> The first day I used this with my regular foundation, I noticed the difference. Supplies great coverage without making my skin feel loaded up with product. Would recommend to anyone looking for a perfect staple foundation brush.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and seeing this brush used by someone in a makeup review video i went ahead and purchased it.  The thing is when I first used it I found that it applied much more foundation than I would normally wear and I ended up washing it off and reapplying with my sponge.  I assume this brush is great for people who are really into makeup wear.  It&#x27;s not a bad tool.  I just think it applies more than I want to wear and achieved a look that I thought was unnatural looking.</li>
    <li> I started using Lancome Teint Miracle foundation putting on with my fingers. Then I saw a You Tube video recommending this brush. I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. It does a great job of smoothing out my foundation and blending. Would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Very soft, dense, and high quality!</li>
    <li> Without a doubt this is the best makeup brush I have ever used.  I had recently purchased a new liquid foundation; I just wasn&#x27;t impressed with it which didn&#x27;t make sense, because it&#x27;s a high-end foundation and came highly recommended.  To apply it I was using a $30+ foundation brush.  I was frustrated with the streaks, the &amp;#34;gloppyness&amp;#34;, etc.  So I started researching foundation brushes; read all the great reviews for the Beauty Junkees Kabuki brush, reasonable price, so I gave it a try.  Eureka!  Now I love the liquid foundation!  I&#x27;m telling you, ladies, this little darlin&#x27; of a foundation brush makes all the difference.  My foundation now looks flawless.  I am in my mid-60&#x27;s.  Yesterday I spent the day with my soon-to-be-40-year-old-daughter.  I see her only a few times a year.  She thought I had something done to my face.  She wanted to know why my face looked so smooth.  The only thing I had changed was using the Beauty Junkees Kabuki brush.  I kid you not.  I absolutely recommend this brush without hesitation.  Now my daughter is ordering one for herself.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price</li>
    <li> The compact bristles help give a full coverage with foundation and it buffs very smooth into your skin giving it a flawless look. It is definitely a great brush for the price, I have Sigma and Marc Jacobs brushes and this brush actually gives me the flawless look that I want, and I don&#x27;t have to pay $30++ to achieve it.</li>
    <li> i waited to fill this out till i had used my brush for a month and have washed several times. I really am 100% impressed with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;It is soft and dense and makes my face makeup look soooo smooth.  I&#x27;m going to purchase another as a  backup and one as a christmas gift for my sister.</li>
    <li> Well the reviews were right about this brush.  A dense, soft brush and a good price.  I like it so much better than the Mac 187.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! I have very very sensitive skin and this brush is the only one I&#x27;ve been able to use with out having any allergic reaction. The bristles are soft and very few have fallen out. I use this brush with my liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> this is the prefect foundation brush&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;thick, dense bristles that don&#x27;t fall out&lt;br /&gt;thick wooden handle&lt;br /&gt;cleans up quickly&lt;br /&gt;foundation goes on smoothly and looks flawless&lt;br /&gt;the best brush I ever bought&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;none</li>
    <li> good density,doesn&#x27;t shed, good price!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush!! It works so well in blending foundation and I actually use less makeup.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best make-up brush I have ever used. I absolutely love it! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this brush to apply my spray foundation and it works great. The brush is soft, yet sturdy and doesn&#x27;t shed. It&#x27;s very well made and you can&#x27;t beat the introductory price. I also appreciate that the company emailed tips on how to use and clean the brush. I recommend this for anyone who wears makeup. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase more products from Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the makeup brush. It applies the liquid makeup beautifully. Would recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft and easy to clean - I just swoosh the bristles through water and baby shampoo in a small paper cup and rinse.  My liquid makeup goes on perfectly and the brush is not irritating to my skin.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered 2!</li>
    <li> Hands Down..Compared to the High end brushes.Its been few days but i am loving it already</li>
    <li> When I originally reviewed this product, I absolutely loved it. However, after a month or so of use and regular washing it not was a smell to it that won&#x27;t leave. The brush does not dry well at all either.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife.  It shipped quickly and was exactly what she was wanting.</li>
    <li> Super Soft and love the instructions on the packaging. Very nice for the foundation looks very nice</li>
    <li> Amazing brush! It gives a super flawless finish and is very dense.I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect dupe for my sigma kabuki brush #80</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works really well with liquid and powder foundations.  Makes buffing foundation into pores super easy for a flawless finish!  I bought two and bought two more for my sister and her daughter.</li>
    <li> Nice and dense.  Wonderful for putting on foundation.  No fall out.  Thanks Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> This brush came right on time ! I was so excited I&#x27;ve never had a kabuki brush ever. When u first opened it it had a strong medicine like smell.. really over powering just saying that&#x27;s okay I washed it let it dry and I&#x27;ve never had my foundation go on so easily !! It really evened out my foundation giving me a flawless look. I&#x27;m so in love !</li>
    <li> Works great! Really soft and durable</li>
    <li> I have used many makeup brushes but always felt the foundation went on streaky looking.  This one really smoothes the foundation in....  I Love it!!</li>
    <li> I really love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and easy to use especially using the brush in a dabbing motion my liquid foundation applies flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Not a favorite..doesn&#x27;t work as good as I had hoped</li>
    <li> I thought the brush would be a little bit more dense but it&#x27;s soft and does the job. I like it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush, I might order another one!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice foundation brush gives lovely even coverage.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality!</li>
    <li> I am not a professional makeup artist. I&#x27;ve been a tomboy most of my life (I&#x27;m 27) and just within the last year or so I&#x27;ve really gotten into learning about beauty and makeup. Like most people, I watched a lot of youtube videos and most beauty gurus would recommend MAC or Sigma brushes. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have the money to spend that much on makeup brushes. I saw the rating and reviews on this one and knew I needed a synthetic flat top Kabuki for my foundation so I took a chance on this one. I am not disappointed. This brush blends fantastically. No streaks, easy to build, and a great polished and flawless look. My old drugstore foundation brush would shed all over my face and always soaked up the product, I haven&#x27;t had any of those issues with this one. Maybe in the future I&#x27;ll have a little extra money to invest in professional brushes, but in the meantime this is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I almost bought the Sephora make up brush but I figured I&#x27;d try this one first and that was the best decision ever! Quality is not sacrificed at all with this low cost alternative. I&#x27;ve had this brush for a month and it has never left a bristle on my face nor has one fallen out. My face looks fresh every time I apply make up with it (I&#x27;ve tried it all: concealer, foundation, powder). I wish I had bought this brush sooner!</li>
    <li> in my opinion i love my beauty blender better, i am not crazy about this brush but its good for the price though</li>
    <li> love the product!  Beauty Junkees even took the time to send me an email on how to use the new product....great service!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good liquid foundation brush for months and I finally gave up and have just been using my fingers to blend for awhile. I was debating between buying this brush and another pricier, name brand brush but decided to go with this one instead. I&#x27;m so glad I did! The coverage with this brush is full and beautiful! I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t be going without this brush for a long time :)</li>
    <li> The flat kabuki brush is the best brush I have ever used to apply foundation! I love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price :)</li>
    <li> This took a few weeks to get to me . But the packaging and quailty of the brush is impeccable!  It looks so professional and is soooooooooooooooo soft yet dense .i love the way it applies my liquid foundation!  Plus it comes with more then a handful of brush gloves to keep the brushes shape. And a cute&amp;#34; i am beautiful&amp;#34; sticker. (That i put on my brush) it was a toss up between this and the sigma f80. Im glad i choose this!  This was also cheaper then the sigma.</li>
    <li> Blends my makeup beautifully!!! Love this brush</li>
    <li> This brush is on par with the bareminerals $40.00 brush! It was a realistic price, and it applies powder flawlessly. I&#x27;ll be switching my future brush purchases from bareminerals to Beauty Junkees.</li>
    <li> Works great for mineral foundation.  The bristles are soft and I&#x27;ve never had even one bristle fall out.  I&#x27;ve washed it once already and it washed up and dried beautifully.  The only thing I wish it came with was a plastic sleeve for travel.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I haven&#x27;t had it for a long time but I actually really, really like this brush! It hasn&#x27;t shed and it&#x27;s very soft. It did a great job of buffing in my foundation and stippling it in where I needed the extra coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for longevity since I haven&#x27;t had it for long. I also can&#x27;t say how comparable it is to the Sigma, but I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying the Sigma brush now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had all types of foundation brushes that range from really inexpensive, to very expensive, and I must admit I&#x27;m very impressed with this brush and would recommend to it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft and full and did an amazing job. This is the third foundation brush I&#x27;ve purchased in the past 2 months and I think I found the perfect one!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a foundation brush and am glad that i got a perfect one. It blends the foundation well  to your skin making it flawless. I would repurchase this product</li>
    <li> Great brush for liquid foundation! Enables me to get full coverage without applying too much. I used a flat paddle brush before and prefer the coverage of kabuki over any other method or brush I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Soft brush and applies foundation well. I am new to all of this brush stuff but it was super easy to apply foundation with it.</li>
    <li> I used this brush for the first time today and I love it... I&#x27;ve been using the sigma f80 for a little over a month and I like the beauty junkies brush better... It&#x27;s really soft and my foundation glides on so much better... I recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product!! Loved the email I received before my package arrived advising me on how to care for my brush!</li>
    <li> great brush at a great price</li>
    <li> High quality brush, came in time and works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Best brush for liquid foundations, period. I will not use any other brush from now on. I have tried for the last couple of years to find a good, sturdy, high-quality brush for applying my Lancome foundation. THIS is the brush. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This brush is terrific.  The customer service was great as well---the brush arrived quickly, with a very helpful tutorial.  I will probably order another just to keep in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I liked how soft the brush was, but the packaging made the brush come in a weird oval shape.</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into makeup brushes for liquid foundation. . . have always used a sponge - this is much better for blending and an even, natural finish. Feels great on the skin! Plus comes with care instructions to make your brushes last longer!</li>
    <li> I love this brush . It&#x27;s a must buy</li>
    <li> I love,Love, this brush I use to use wedge sponges,, I never thought to use a brush because I use liquid foundation but OMG it spreads my foundation like butter.. And I love the fact that I can wash it and reuse it The sponges use to get to mushy and build up, also came quicker than expeected.. But I didn&#x27;t get the little net to put over it, I&#x27;ve been cleaning it with make up wipes because i only had it for a week but this weekend I will be doing the deep clean.. and the that will be the true test for me to order more.</li>
    <li> Works really good, I&#x27;ve used it both on mineral foundation and liquid.</li>
    <li> This brush makes putting on my foundation quick and easy. The bristles are thick and I don&#x27;t lose alot of product when using this, so I&#x27;m really happy about that. Such a cheap price for such an amazing brush. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for a great price!! The costumer service seems great they contacted me right after I recieved it to follow up. The quality is comparable ro mac and sigma but the price is amazing!! Definitely worth buying!!</li>
    <li> There is really nothing bad to say about this product. I follow a beauty guru on Youtube and she recommended this brush saying that she liked it better than the Sigma F80 which I had been eyeing for some time now because I&#x27;ve always wanted a flat top kabuki but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to fork over the money since I was already using the Real Techniques buffing brush (which I would also rate 5 stars in terms of price and functionality), so I decided to try this one out because the Youtube had a 5 dollar off coupon....so really...5 dollars off and free 2 day shipping? The brush came out to $6 plus some change so why not just give it a go? The only difference between this and the RT one is that the RT one is more rounded and fluffier and this is a straight flat top and more dense. Both apply beautifully though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, when I opened the package, i was really surprised by the quality of the brush. It&#x27;s one of the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever felt...even softer than the RT one which I already think is super soft. It had a really strong plastic smell when I removed it from the package but after I washed it, the smell went away so it didn&#x27;t really bother me. Application for my MUFE foundation was amaaaaaazing. Flawless airbrushed finish without looking cakey...I was so surprised by how well it applied that I kept looking in the mirror thinking I missed something but nope....it was THAT good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even without the coupon, the brush is still pretty cheap. I would have bought it without the coupon knowing how amazing this brush is. No fallout. Perfect application, Good quality/feel. Softest bristles ever. Fast, prompt delivery. 5 stars all around. Could not be more pleased with this purchase! Skip the Sigma F80 or any of the other super overpriced brushes and just go for this or the RT one! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Works great! Loved the price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love the smooth finish this gives me when using mineral makeup.  Would highly recommend to anyone who is questioning whether to purchase or not.</li>
    <li> Great Great Brush!!! Its so soft and it makes my foundation look flawless on my face. I love it!!! Will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I fell upon this brush pretty randomly by web browsing (wasn&#x27;t actually even looking to buy one) and then I saw the great reviews and decided to give it a shot. Very happy and a great price point too.</li>
    <li> Can not say enough about this company. I don&#x27;t always write in reviews but felt it was necessary this time. I&#x27;ve never ordered something off amazon and had someone from customer service email me just to pretty much tell me a little info on the product and offer tips or tricks to help. Or if I had any problems how to contact them personally. Truly amazing customer service. Now for the product, it is my new obsession. I&#x27;ve been eying up the stippling brushes/flat tops for a little while. I normally always used a liquid foundation brush. I noticed the difference immediately when I tried it with just a little cream concealer yesterday. I do NOT have perfect skin. (A few scars from bad acne when I was younger) this brush helps MUCH more covering them up then the normal foundation brushes. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this makeup brush!  Bristles are very soft and not as uncomfortable as I was afraid they might be with this type of makeup brush.  This brush does a great job to make my makeup look more natural and not too overdone.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have dozens of high-end brushes. This one is a fraction of the cost of most of my brushes and it is super soft and does exactly what it says it does. I use it to put my powder on and blend everything together. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a better blending brush for foundation then get this one! If it&#x27;s your first time applying foundation use this brush as we&#x27;ll! It does a perfect job at applying little bit of makeup to cover the entire face</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Fast shipping and good deal. It&#x27;s a dual fiber brush, dense and little too no shedding. It is similar quality to more pricey brushes. Definitely recommend this brush for anyone looking for a good foundation brush.</li>
    <li> The best makeup brush I have ever used! Before using this brush I was using brushes from my sigma collection. My stigma F50 brush; which is what I use to apply my foundation does not compare to this brush. My makeup is flawless!!! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am sure I would have loved this brush..had the wooden portion of the handle not broken off on the first use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush daily for two weeks and love it for liquids and for mineral powder. I was using fingers before and never got the kind of application I was hoping for. This brush gives a smooth finish to both liquids and powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels nice in the hand when you are using it, too. Using this brush is saving me money on foundation, because I need much, much less when I use the brush. I don&#x27;t look cakey, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use RCMA or Revlon Color Stay cream foundations in liquids and Loreal mineral powder in powder. I also use this brush to buff in my RCMA blush color, following the directions in the Kevin J Bennett RCMA YouTube video: http://youtu.be/WmYTtZ3R3F4 I was able to duplicate his results, using this brush. The blush looks very natural as applied with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush feels soft on my face and cleans well, though it is so dense that sometimes it takes me a bit of extra time to get all the color off it. It is a low shedding brush, too. I find it only sheds when I try too hard to get it clean, so I&#x27;m learning to be gentle with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush for the price and it has a money back guarantee, too, if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a better foundation brush for quit some time. Finally I found one. This is the prefect foundation brush. thick, dense and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out. Easy to clean, foundation goes on smoothly on my face. Would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Well Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I tried the Beauty Blender but due to the dampness of the sponge, it makes me look more dewy and eventually extremely shiny as the day continues. This brush gives me an airbrushed finish and does not add extra moisture to my face. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I was using the blender sponge to apply foundation, however I was never 100% satisfied. With this brush, the foundation was applied smoothly and flawlessly without using too much product. It does not shed and the handle feels right.</li>
    <li> Okay i love this brush... I own a similar style in sigma, mac, elf, bh cosmetics, real techniques, sedona lace, etc and this one wins. It&#x27;s not too dense where its hard to clean and stiff while buffing out your foundation. it&#x27;s also not flimsy where you feel like its not really buffing it into your skin. Its the happy medium and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect, it makes my foundation look soo much better! I was recommended this product by saaammage on youtube, and I will most likely buy like 5 backups of this in the future!</li>
    <li> The brush is very soft and applies my bb cream and liquid foundation in a thin even layer. Buildable coverage.</li>
    <li> Blends flawlessly. Super soft, great price for the quality</li>
    <li> Perfect brush, at an incredible price.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush and a great price.  Item arrived quickly and was nicer than I thought it would be!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 7 months I started noticing the quality of the application was diminishing with each wash. Only washed it about one a week at most, sometimes I&#x27;d go longer without washing it. I also started noticing the handle was becoming loose and today it completely broke. I would save the money and buy something better with more durability.</li>
    <li> Almost bought the sigma brush when I saw this. So glad I found this because its such good quality and saved me tons of money.</li>
    <li> no complaints! i love everything about this brush. It applies my liquid foundation flawlessly and i love how it&#x27;s super affordable for something so deluxe! Delivery was fast as well and i&#x27;m so glad i purchased this. I&#x27;m going to buy more for sure</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Doesn&#x27;t shed or get mushy. I will buy other sizes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for 4 months now but about a month ago now the metal portion that connects the brush to the handle fell off. It looks like the two pieces are held together by glue so I could just use a hot gun on it, which I probably will do but I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last very long before it fell apart. I went with this brush because it was the less expensive of the two I was looking at. Unforunately it looks like I should have gone with the other one.</li>
    <li> Not that long ago I wrote a review saying how much I loved this product but at the same time I was a little disappointed with the brush shedding. I received a phone call from Beauty Junkies to talk about the issue. Less then a few days later I received a replacement that I have had no trouble with along with an angled kabuki brush just to say thank you. I most definitely look forward to buying more products from them in the future. #averyhappycustomer :)</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. It applies foundation with an airbrush finish. I am glad I bought it. It is also sturdy but smooth on the skin. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This brush was amazing. I&#x27;ve used much more expensive brushes and this by far is the best!!! It applies the foundation even and the quality is just perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a make up brush.</li>
    <li> Affordable but great quality!</li>
    <li> I ordered both the Flat Top and the Angled Top Kabuki Brushes by Beauty Junkees, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I truly love them.  They hold their own against my beloved Sigma brushes, and that says a lot given my sensitive skin and subsequent abhorrence to anything scratchy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I should note that the brushes were packaged well and had no strange odors or discolorations upon opening.  The initial washing went well with no fall-out or unusual residue.  The texture and shape did not change after the washing (often a problem with cheaper brushes) and there was no shedding after drying.  The bristles are appreciably dense (no “plastic” feel) and the handles seem to be solid, making the brush well weighted and comfortable to use.  The handles are the perfect length – 5 inches from butt to ferrule rim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the most important part – they work exceptionally well.  Most of the reviews that I had read prior to purchase raved about the effectiveness of the brushes when applying CREAM and LIQUID foundations; however, I use a mineral powder foundation (bareMinerals) and I was very concerned about how well the brushes would work for me.  After 2 weeks of use, I can confirm for the powder and mineral wearer that the brushes work as well or better than the “flawless” brushes that come with our products.  The bristles are synthetic so they don’t overly absorb (and waste) lots of product, yet they are soft and spread the products smoothly and evenly.  Fantastic! 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> Coming from a Mac, Sephora, and Sigma brush owner I can tell you that these are fantastic brushes. After I read various reviews about these brushes instead of only buying one I went ahead and purchased two brushes. One for my best friend to give to her as a gift and one for myself. The first thing I noticed when opening my brush is that there were a few loose bristles but that&#x27;s pretty normal in my opinion so no complains there. The only thing that bothers me is that the handle is a bit loose which is the only reason I&#x27;m not giving this brush a five star rating but besides that I have no complaints what so ever. The customer service is AMAZING, after you purchase your brush(s) you will get an email with tips within a few days if not the same day you purchased it. They aren&#x27;t required to do that but they do and that&#x27;s a huge plus. Overall in my opinion these brushes are amazing definitely don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Please don&#x27;t question buying this brush ladies and gents! After viewing my review a lovely lady named Julie contacted me via email about how they wanted to send me a new one! How amazing is that? I&#x27;d like to add how they are one of the few companies that actually reply to their customers and are honestly concerned about their customer&#x27;s satisfaction, they want them to be happy with their purchase. I am extremely happy with this company. Their customer service is wonderful and for this price you won&#x27;t find a better brush anywhere! Five stars, they have earned a returning customer. :)</li>
    <li> Great customer service with instructions on how to use the brush for best results. Very nice brush for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> my daughter and i both love this brush.  I am thinking of buying another.  She is so excited she got</li>
    <li> I really like this flat top brush. It is very full and does not shed its bristles.  Great for applying the mousse type foundation I use.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, good value and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love it! The quality is amazing and so is the price! Brush is so soft and puts my foundation on amazingly  smooth!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve had quite a few of them including the B.E. one (yuck, so rough!).  It feels like heaven on your skin and applies your makeup absolutely flawlessly.  I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this brush.  If you wash it according to the directions they give you, it will last a very long time.  (dry upside down, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even used it with liquid foundation and it&#x27;s amazing.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I use this brush for liquid foundation, and it works pretty good. I have 3 brushes for my liquid foundation, one is high end brand, and I don&#x27;t see much difference. I like very natural look, so I don&#x27;t apply much foundation, and this brush just works right.</li>
    <li> You cannot do without a proper foundation brush, and this is that brush. The bristles are soft but they are packed tight to stay straight  so that foundation can be buffed for a perfect airless finish. I can use far less foundation, get better coverage and have a very natural look.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a great brush for liquid foundations. Looks like it will last for a long time, I will definitely be purchasing again. Service was also great I received helpful tips from seller. Thank y</li>
    <li> I use this for application of foundation.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Got my order super quickly and I love it. It&#x27;s very soft, light and feels good on the skin. Good price as well!</li>
    <li> These brushes don&#x27;t feel like my other kabukis.  The flat top means you really have to use a stippling stroke.  If you swirl the brush on your face, it takes your makeup off.  Probably just me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brush for foundation but now I&#x27;m hooked.  Love this brush. Very soft and smooth. Makeup goes on evenly and my skin looks better than ever. I do wash out with soap and water after every use but haven&#x27;t tried olive oil yet. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Great brush and great price! Really helps foundation go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the perfect dupe for the Sigma F80 Kabuki brush! I love this brush and its so much more affordable then the high end ones. It gives the same flawless finish. The bristles are so soft, yet dense enough to give you a smooth streak free finish.</li>
    <li> Great brush! It&#x27;s so soft and my makeup applies so well with this brush.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush ! I feel like this really helps with making my foundation look flawless .</li>
    <li> Shocked with the quality, I own sigma brushes, Wayne goss and several other high end brands. The brush exceeded my expectations, I could currently afford the $50 foundation brush I had been looking at so decided to try this one, reviewers are right it&#x27;s a great brush I would have guessed it was more than the price I paid. Happy customer :)</li>
    <li> This is my third foundation brush because I keep looking for the ultimate tool to apply my bb and cc creams and now finally, I think I&#x27;ve found it!  It is very easy to use and the company goes a step further and emails the buyer instructions on the care and use of the brush, which is very easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed with this brush. I received the item on time and even got a email that same day by the company giving me step-by-step instructions on the best way to use it and clean it. The brush itself came in a cute little package and it&#x27;s very dense and soft. It makes my foundation look flawless and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Brush is great quality at an exceptional price. Wonderful customer service. Had an issue with my brush and it was resolved quickly and professionally. Pleasantly surprised. Would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Best cheap brush ever bought that being said I would still save your money for a good one you could buy at Sephora but if you&#x27;re tight on cash this is the brush for you</li>
    <li> Fell in LOVE! Long story short, throughout the day, I got compliments on how well and smooth my foundation looked. Shipping was super quick, bristles are really smooth, packaging was great. I love how they emailed me tips on how to use and care for my brush! I was a bit skeptical since I had never used a Kabuki Flat Top for foundation but I have zero regrets and look forward to doing my makeup everyday with this brush&lt;3</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this no stars, this was a horrible waste of money. The bristles of the brush starting falling out after the first use of the brush... Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> So soft! No hairs fall out at all. Nice dense brush.</li>
    <li> Decent brush for the price. Wish the bristle were a little denser. You could probably get the elf powder brush for $3 if you want something similar, the elf brush bristles are just a bit longer, and the handle quality is not as good.</li>
    <li> Great brush that works just as well, if not better than brand name brushes that are 2x the price. I will definitely be repurchasing more brushes from this brand.</li>
    <li> I think the only reason these brushes received such high reviews is because the company offers a free gift when you give them a review.  That seems a little dishonest to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is okay. Since it&#x27;s so inexpensive I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.  But it doesn&#x27;t replace my MAC brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have good quality brushes (ie the only brushes you have came from the makeup section in a grocery store) then you will be pleased with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not apply heavy coverage.  And it&#x27;s not the best for mineral powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is very soft and does not shed. Easy to clean and the large brush offers fast application for light coverage.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush. It put on my make up so nice &amp; smooth</li>
    <li> Favorite brush! Great price too.</li>
    <li> This is an incredibly soft makeup brush - perfect for foundation. I have used it with both liquid foundation and tinted moisturizer. It buffs the foundation into the skin, leaving it looking soft and smooth.This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> love this brush it blends my foundation really good !!</li>
    <li> excellent service!!!! great brush!!!! thank you.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Love you service.  Your tips are helpful.  Brush is of good quality.  Glad I purchased it.  No regrets!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush about a month ago and I have no switched back to my domed stippling brush by Sephora (which was my all time favorite!) This brush was very cheap! I will be buying this for my sisters for Christmas a long with other beauty favorites of mine! Thank you Beauty Junkees! I will be buying more soon!! Recommendation</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much. It works great with powders, creams and liquids. It gives such a nice clean smooth finish. I bought the first one a few months ago and just ordered another. This brush definitely holds up against big name brands. It&#x27;s such an amazing price for the quality.</li>
    <li> I love how this applies my face foundation! Love the product and highly recommend for the price!</li>
    <li> I was looking into a flat kabuki and debated between this one and the Sigma F80. I regret not paying a little extra for something that I knew would love. This brush is decent. But if you have oily skin you will have to wash it after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is soft and dense. But I expect a brush that I buff with not to feel so heavy. I felt like everything was being sweeped around and not actually being buffed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compare this brush to my $3 elf powder brush and I reach for my ELF one instead of this one. I will continue to do so until I decide to spurlge on Sigma&#x27;s $24 brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has such great reviews. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this brush.  Very soft and blend the makeup beautifully.  would highly recommend!!!! AAA+++</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the beauty junkees collection.  I am trying to obtain all of them one at a time!  This brand is probably my most used brushes.  This brush in particular works great for contouring or adding a little warmth in the face.  I love the softness and density it offers.  It picks up the right amount of product and blends very easy.</li>
    <li> Bristles are so soft, don&#x27;t leave marks when I apply my foundation,  gives an airbrush look. I would recommend this brush over the sigma and it&#x27;s great price.</li>
    <li> Its a very nice brush. It is very well made. However, it doesn&#x27;t smooth in foundation as well as a stippling brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Doesn&#x27;t shed like others I&#x27;ve owned, and blends very well. Good quality brush at a good price.</li>
    <li> So far this brush has been perfect. No shedding and its kept its shape. In the past I had used foundation brushes that were flat instead of fanned out and I much prefer this style.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Unbelievable price and super fast shipping! I will be recommending this brush to friends!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  Feels/works just like the sigma f80. Would definitely recommend, it&#x27;s a great quality brush. I&#x27;m ordering a second!</li>
    <li> I was going back and forth between buying this brush or the Real Techniques &amp;#34;Expert Face&amp;#34; brush to apply my BB cream (which I use as a foundation), or tinted moisturizer for lighter days. I am soooo glad I went with this brush. By far the best makeup brush I own/have ever owned, and for such an amazing price! Seriously, this brush gives such a smooth, clean, even look. The bristles are soooo soft, and I love that this brush doesn&#x27;t shed like others have for me in the past. Now I cant say anything about the real techniques &amp;#34;expert face&amp;#34; brush, because I have never used it, but after discovering this brush I can&#x27;t imagine buying/using any other brush to apply my &amp;#34;foundations.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> it broke after 2 weeks of use, I swear I didn&#x27;t beat nobody up with it, it just got loose and moves around one day.</li>
    <li> Love the silky, soft feel of this brush - it does a great job with my foundation and powder.  And, best of all?  No shedding!</li>
    <li> Love this kabuki brush. Have used it with liquid foundation and mineral powder. Works great for both. Much better than other expensive brand brushes that I have tried. A must have for makeup. Also tried the cleaning method suggested - oil and soap which works very well.</li>
    <li> This brush has made foundation and concealer application fool proof. I never have streaks or uneven areas. I love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is the only brush I use to apply my foundation. It works great and leaves my face looking flawless! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I received my brush early this morning and I am in love with it. I think the packaging was nice and it held the brush nicely. The bristles are soft and my foundation glided easily on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this needing to replace my sigma flat kabuki brush. Wow, it&#x27;s so  soft and it applies my foundation flawlessly. I can also use it then quickly wash it, and use it again right away. It does not absorb product so there is no waste. I highly recommend this brush</li>
    <li> The best brush ever ! Truly a must have, better than sigma!!</li>
    <li> So impressed I ordered the angle kabuki brush two days after. It is so worth the money!</li>
    <li> The kabuki brush is really soft on the face but firm enough to hold the foundation I use. It is perfect for my daily use. You have to wash it so that it lasts longer. The brush distributes the foundation on my face pretty equally. The hairs don&#x27;t come out either!! +1 Very happy with this product. Will buy another one once this one is worn out, which probably won&#x27;t be for a while.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time today &amp; its amazing! Got my product blended very well and easy and the brush is made with great quality! I will re-purchase!&lt;br /&gt;-Queen</li>
    <li> It works really well. Does what it says. Hopefully I will purchase more soon.</li>
    <li> I just received this today, which is awesome cos I just ordered it two days ago! I applied some foundation on my hand just to test it and it blended it right in, leaving my skin looking smooth and even. Love how soft the bristles feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few scattered off brand foundation brushes so naturally this one has exceeded expectations for me. I use Revlon Colorstay Liquid Foundation paired with MAC Concealer and a lighter shade liquid Revlon concealer to brighten under my eyes. This does it all. It blends beautifully with minimal effort, the bristles are wonderfully soft and it applies the product evenly and with awesome amount of coverage. I was worried it might be too big but it&#x27;s actually perfect. So far I love the brush and would definitely repruchase.</li>
    <li> Shocked by quality of brush for the price. It rivals any of my Chanel or Bobbi Brown brushes and is perfect alternative to the pricier Shiseido style brush!!! I have taken to using daily for foundation and concealer for melasma spots bc this brush allows me to buff to desired coverage. I plan to order another!</li>
    <li> I just got this brush today and used it to apply my liquid foundation..it is so pleasantly soft but still dense enough to give great coverage many of my other flat top brushes sometimes feel too stiff but this one doesn&#x27;t .. if my opinion changes later on I&#x27;ll definitely update but so far I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush! I have bought 4 for friends and family who have used my brush. BEST foundation brush I have ever used! Works great with mineral make-up for a flawless finish! I would recommend this brush to anyone!</li>
    <li> Best experience purchasing this item. It literally arrived in two days. Great packaging and quality for the price. It is very similar or better than the sigma f80.</li>
    <li> The brush of my dreams, no streaks and no uneven distribution. I can feel worried free when going out on dates with my hubby knowing my foundation looks flawless(:</li>
    <li> I just received the brush a week ago and have used it twice, but so far I think the brush is excellent. I am a beginner when it comes to makeup. I really love that this brush helps my skin look flawless even though I have many imperfections (large pores, acne scars, uneven skin tone). It is amazing that I can use this brush with little skill and drug store foundation and still achieve a great look. The bristles are soft, yet still hold their form. I was able to use foundation in a few spots of my face and buff it out with the brush without getting streaks. The icing on the cake was that the brush was very affordable. People like me that are starting out with makeup can get a great quality brush without spending too much. I really like that the company is proactive in seeing that I received the brush and that I was happy with my purchase. All in all 5 stars from me so far.</li>
    <li> Love This brush! It&#x27;s definitely a dupe for Sigma f80! This is a bit softer but can handle my liquid foundation better than the Sigma brush! However, I recommend cleaning this ever other day. I washed it aster 2 weeks of use and the foundation did not budge from the bristles inside.</li>
    <li> I hate when people do reviews and its not their honest opinion because they were paid or because they getting crap for free. I bought beauty blenders from this company and I had nothing good to say about it but my husband got me a set of brushes and the first time I used them I was blown away because they remind me so much of my sigma brushes the quality of these brushes r just awesome I had to order this brush just because. I&#x27;ve recommended these brushes to friends  and family and they just cannot stop raving about them. Beauty Junkees I hated ur beauty blenders but u definitely won me over with these brushes like I can&#x27;t even tell u. I will definitely look forward to trying anything u introduce to the market. I hope some gorgeous eye shadows that r very pigmented is next on the list.</li>
    <li> Finally a brush that doesn&#x27;t leave Brocken fibers on my face!!!! Love it ! Perfect control, even coverage and soft.</li>
    <li> The brush has a good quality and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Foundation goes on smooth. Better than some I have paid more money for. Thank you</li>
    <li> Soft bristles feels nice. Giving as gift with makeup so can&#x27;t rate on actual use quality.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great brush! The bristles are very soft and dense, great for foundation. Only complaint is that when it came, the brush shape was flattened out and I had to reshape it.</li>
    <li> So, I have recently been getting back into wearing makeup, and I had been hearing people rave about the sigma f80 brush. So, I decided to look into getting one. 24 DOLLARS! I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much. So I was looking here on amazon and saw this brush. I noticed that it overall has a better rating than the sigma one, and it is half the price. I decided to just take a risk and buy this one, and OMG! I LOVE THIS FREAKING BRUSH! It applies foundations and BB creams flawlessly. It just goes to show you that you don&#x27;t have to pay an outlandish price for makeup and makeup tools to get good high quality results. I TOTALLY recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush. Love it. Makes your face look airbrushed. Arrived in 2 days!</li>
    <li> Great brush and great seller :)</li>
    <li> Great brush, and very cheap! I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> Love this brush ! Shipping was wonderful .. Product is great too ..&lt;br /&gt;Blends in the foundation really well and feels smooth when blending</li>
    <li> Works great!! No streaking</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! Better than Sigma in my opinion. I actually did a whole review on it here :)[...]you&#x27;d like to see it in action!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush! I have multiple brushes, but beauty junkees beats them all.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation brush I have ever used. I don&#x27;t do the buffing motion but instead, I stipple the foundation on and my makeup comes out air brushed. I am so in love with this brush, I&#x27;m going to order some more (just because) I Iove it. Best foundation brush ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it is great for foundation application.  I still have to smooth under eyes with a sponge which is so much better than using sponge for all my foundation app.</li>
    <li> Awesome foundation brush! It is super soft and nice handle. Shipping is fast. The product is Nicely packaged. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This brushes gives a full coverage when applied with liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> The brush is very soft and dense. A little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  This is the best brush I have ever used with my bare minerals makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush and a good buy!</li>
    <li> Awesome! This is my go to for all my makeup powder application.</li>
    <li> Great brush overall!! Mine was shipped within two days thanks to Amazon Prime. And such a great deal for a high quality brush! I opened mine right away and the bristles were soft and no brush hairs have fallen out from use or cleaning.</li>
    <li> Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
    <li> Great brush! It&#x27;s very soft and plush. I&#x27;m very impressed with quality and value. Has an dense, silky feel, and picks up a lot of product. I&#x27;m a beauty junkie, and am very suspicious of cheap tools and products. I&#x27;m always thrilled to find one that outperforms the pricey brands. A +!</li>
    <li> I just recently converted to mineral powder foundation and I needed a flat top brush. I bought the one from Beauty Junkees based on reviews and price and I Love it! The bristles are very very soft and they don&#x27;t shed and the foundation goes on smoothly and flawlessly. Perfect brush!</li>
    <li> Best brush to purchase when in need of a foundation brush, but dont want to spend so much money. I never contacted the supplier but i did recieve the brush on time . This brush is excellent when i apply my liquid foundation. Perfect so far.</li>
    <li> I love this flat kabuki brush! Provides great coverage and gives an airbrush look! Great dupe! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was considering buying a much more expensive brush similar to this one, but after seeing a good review on YouTube I decided to try this one out. So far I haven&#x27;t tried many makeup brushes, because I have areas of dry skin that don&#x27;t do very well with them. So I&#x27;ve stuck to applying my foundation with a damp sponge (which has worked pretty well). I tried using this brush for the first time today and I think it&#x27;s really good quality––I&#x27;m glad I went with this one. It blends the foundation in a lot more quickly than using a sponge. Unfortunately even after exfoliating, applying moisturizer AND a primer, the dry patches still became more pronounced even with careful application. But I chalk that up to my skin, not the brush. I look forward to trying it out more and seeing how well it works with different foundations. I definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re considering buying a more expensive flat top kabuki brush, get this one instead. If you have really dry skin however, just be aware that no brush can change your skin&#x27;s texture!</li>
    <li> Mine came unglued from the handle the second I used it, which was dumb. But other than that the brush works great!</li>
    <li> Brush is amazing. It&#x27;s incredibly soft and dense, perfect for applying my liquid foundation!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice brush that feels so soft against the skin &amp; makeup goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> This brush is fabulous! Bristles are so soft but sturdy at the same time. Feels really good on your face. I will definitely keep buying these brushes.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical buying this for a few reasons: There are SO many good reviews and I get nervous whenever that happens. Especially because if you review the product the company supposedly sends you a free gift. And because it&#x27;s cheap.    I have been pleasantly surprised. I was debating between a sigma, mac, and Dior brush ranging from $25-$45, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one for less than half the price. It seems like a quality brush, only time will tell.    I use this with my MAC studio fix fluid foundation, and it works very well. I previously used a stipple brush and this gives a much better application and finish. I feel like this brush doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;eat\\&quot; as much product as the stipple brush did. The foundation goes on very evenly. I also like the look of the brush, it looks very professional unlike some of the cheaper brushes on the market.    All that being said, if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, then you can&#x27;t really lose at this price point!    Edit: I forgot to add that there has been no shedding on this brush, which is important! And that it is incredibly soft, which I love because I have sensitive skin and I HATE it when brushes poke you in the face, and while it&#x27;s soft its very dense, which was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!  It&#x27;s very dense and makes your foundation go on super smoothly!  I recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! The coverage is amazing and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess with my powder foundation like so many other brushes do. I am so happy I found this!</li>
    <li> I really like this kabuki brush. I&#x27;ve been using a MAC brand kabuki brush for MANY years and have found this brush to be very comparable if not exactly the same. You can get a lighter application with a brush by using less product. I would recommend this brush to anyone that wants to save a lot of money on a great quality brush without paying for the big brand name. No shedding, easy to apply and great coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really enjoying this brush for applying my foundation. It&#x27;s synthetic, so it&#x27;s easy to wash and it works great with liquids. I&#x27;ve tried it with thick, full coverage foundations and liquidy, light-medium coverage ones, either way it manages to blend the foundation into my skin. I prefer this over my beauty blender and my real techniques brushes, it provides the correct amount of coverage, doesn&#x27;t look streaky, and doesn&#x27;t ruin the finish of the foundation. To apply, I dot foundation over one part of my face, then stipple it to cover, then buff it in for a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a really nice brush for foundation, especially if you are on a budget!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! Much less expensive but same quality as the other online brush retailers. I paid almost twice as much for a flat kabuki from Sigma and it shedded like crazy. I will be shopping again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> not as round as the picture shows but still works bristles feel like they drag more makeup than apply but functional Best when stippling!</li>
    <li> i no longer use 3 of my brushes, because they were replaced by this brush. It blends beautifully &amp; flawlessly. It is a crucial make up tool!</li>
    <li> Worked well for a while, but when I washed it few times the bristles hair fell out.</li>
    <li> I usually use sponges but they don&#x27;t blend your makeup in all that well and the brush doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores and my makeup feels much lighter and i find myself using less foundation with the brush because it doesn&#x27;t absorb the liquid</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fairly decent brush for the price. Not sure exactly why but it doesn&#x27;t apply foundation as well as other brushes I&#x27;ve used like it.</li>
    <li> Just received my shipment today.  Shipping was quick.  The brush is dense yet soft and blends foundation easily.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> High quality brush that looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price!</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for a couple of months now and it is by far the best brush I have ever owned. I have owned Bare Minerals, Clinique and other high priced brushes from high end beauty stores. Even coverage. Soft, thick bristles. Cleans up great. NO stray bristles left on my face. I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! Just as good if not BETTER than the sigma F80 brush! Soft, durable, easy to clean.  NO shedding. Great deal!!! Will buy more from this company!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my Sigma F80 which is my holy grail foundation brush.  While I absolutely love the Sigma brush, I have been having issues with shedding so I figured I would try this brush out.  I had to wait a while for it to be back in stock and when it was finally delivered I was very disappointed.  It is no where near as dense as the Sigma F80 and it soaked up so much of my liquid foundation that I actually had to use double the amount I usually use to get the same coverage.  I am still on the hunt for a new foundation brush as this one will definitely not be it.  I will probably end up giving it away because it is not worth all the extra foundation I would have to apply in order to use it.</li>
    <li> One of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;m a professional, and have used brush  ranges by Make Up Forever, to Sigma, to Real Techniques. This brush is almost identical to the Sigma flat top. It really is a top both brush, at half the price. I&#x27;ve owned it for almost 2 months now, and it&#x27;s been my go to. Very pleased and will purchase more from this line.</li>
    <li> This is an Amazing brush!  It&#x27;s suuuper soft, doesn&#x27;t shed and super dense! It rivals my Sigma F80 brush without the price tag (I bought it for $11.97). One thing to mention though, it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as my real Techniques brushes, which is also made from synthetic taklon bristles. But that&#x27;s not even a big issue,  overall I&#x27;d recommend. 😊</li>
    <li> Wish I would have known about this a lng time ago. Luv this</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how I got by without this brush. I use it for liquid foundation. It&#x27;s amazing - I use much less makeup yet get a better, smoother coverage. It also saves me a lot of time in the morning because applying foundation is super fast and easy with this brush. It&#x27;s soft and extremely dense, and doesn&#x27;t absorb the foundation like other brushes tend to. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy the powder brush from this line next.</li>
    <li> I use this for foundations and BB creams and it gives me a flawless AIRBRUSHED look. I love that because it looks more natural and suitable for an everyday effortless look.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best brushes I have ever owned. And I have had many. So soft and applies liquid foundation flawlessly.</li>
    <li> June 2015 Updated: Beauty Junkies customer service contacted me and replaced my brush. I am bumping my review back to 5 stars because of the great customer service and a possibility of a defective brush that will be replaced.  I only wear foundation/make-up about once a week so this brush go very infrequent use. When I purchased this brush it worked pretty well as a foundation brush for my liquid foundation. After a couple of months, the bristles have broken down, become very &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, and bundle together when I apply foundation.  Bottom Line: These brushes may be cheaper but with the repetitive purchasing it equals out to the same price as a quality brush.</li>
    <li> It was just okay....for a price I guess it&#x27;s pretty good. I used to own a Kabuki Brush from Everyday Mineral and it was so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> This makeup brush is amazing! When I picked it up, I could feel how dense the bristles were and how professional the brush was. It&#x27;s smooth and soft, and the bristles never fall out. You can use it for anything, and the cleaning of it is extremely easy! To me, it&#x27;s the perfect size for doing anything on your face- no matter how your features are. Everything about it is amazing, to the packaging in a nice little bag, to how pleasing to the eye the brush is. Compared to the Sigma f80, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the same, if not even better. Buy this brush!</li>
    <li> Great quality! I use It everyday and I like It.</li>
    <li> I really loved this brush until the brush head totally came off. I purchased in Feb and expected it to last longer than 4 months.</li>
    <li> I love this kabuki brush! It is great for the price. I would advise to be extremely careful when cleaning the brush since the material for the handle is not very durable. Also, a few bristles come off when I am applying my makeup, but I think this is due to my cleaning technique! I also find that this brush works best with be creams instead of regular foundation. It does work with foundation but it&#x27;s a little more difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Great brush, works wonders for powder foundation.</li>
    <li> I think this brush is great. It thick and strong. I put my foundation in it and it cleans well. A+</li>
    <li> Oh my god can&#x27;t express my love with this brush.delivery was on time and packed so nicely thanks to Amazon.i find this brush way better than sigma.winner of all high end kabuki👍🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ My life saver brush my foundation was never so flawless .....I honestly recommending to everyone price is affordable and stands above the high end brushes. No bad smell silky application on face ......no words can do fair with this beauty junkee😊blown away 😊many many thanks to Amazon ....and the winner of my experience beauty junkee👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻I wish if I can give more stars to this brush😄 so 100 stars to this winner 😃😃😃😃</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. The texture is smooth. The bristles are sturdy but soft. The best brush I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it daily and can not say enough about how soft and wonderful it is.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  I never knew makeup application could be so quick and easy!  Very effective and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Worked ok but came apart in less than 2 weeks. It was probably used 6 times. I would not purchase this item again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush. My liquid foundation goes on smoothly and buffs out beautifully.  I have tried several foundation brushes and this one is by far the best -- and oddly, the cheapest!  It is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s soft and blends out my foundation very well. I also use it on my clients, they love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this just from reading all the positive reviews on it and it definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint. I really like this brush, it&#x27;s soft and dense which is perfect for blending out cream foundation. And the price was phenomenal so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great dispersion of my liquid foundation. Gives the best coverage I&#x27;ve had. This brush is wonderful so far, it has only been a week.</li>
    <li> I got the brush a day earlier then expected.  The service was awesome.  I love the way my makeup went on this morning.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft and get the job done well and easy , as a new beginner with make up I must say this is the best brush I loveeee it</li>
    <li> While I had an issue with the brush within a few months, customer service worked quickly to remedy the issue.  With that being said, the fact that customer service was outstanding and cares about their customers, I would buy from them again despite the issue with the first brush.  I would recommend buying this brush as it applies makeup very nicely.</li>
    <li> No.. I won&#x27;t buy this again.. Cause the quality is so good I don&#x27;t think I need another brush anytime soon... I have all three of there brushes, Angled and the tapered foundation brush... I wash them after every use and have not seen any shedding so far.. I do sort of dampen the brush before applying foundation.. but it does give a beautiful finish.. Definitely recommend it to anyone who would like to try a high end product at an affordable price..</li>
    <li> This brush is super soft and it applies my liquid foundation flawlessly. I will definitely repurchase this brush and I recommend it to anyone that likes a nice finish!</li>
    <li> I ordered this not so long ago and it came in sooner than I thought. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I was totally wrong. It is perfect! I use it for liquid foundation and it blends it in really nice. I definitely recommend this item :)</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It also comes with instructions for at home cleaning. I usually just apply my foundation with my fingers. This brush has changed my whole game. I never liked brushes because I hates the fact that you also needed brush cleaner and all these other things in order to get them clean. Once you order the product. The company emails you a list of beauty tips as well as cleaning tips. Must have.</li>
    <li> This is the second foundation brush I have ever purchased (the first being an ecotools flat foundation one) and I am absolutely in love with it. Because I had never used a foundation brush to apply my foundation prior to purchasing the ecotools one, I thought that one was amazing. And although that brush was not terrible, it was streaky but I ignored it because I assumed that was the case with all foundation brushed. Well when I finally decided to order the Beauty Junkees foundation brush I realized how I had wasted my time because as soon as I applied foundation with my new brush I was in awe. Firstly, the bristles are soooo soft. Secondly, because it is very thick and dense, the coverage is really good and it is not streaky at all. Also the top of the brush is pretty big so I can apply my foundation way more quickly. Essentially, I wish I had purchased this brush way earlier and also you can save 5 dollars off any Beauty Junkees brush I believe, if you use this code: SAAAMMAG  which was provided by a Youtuber by the name of :saaammage. So with the coupon code it was such a great deal!! Hopefully the code will still work as I used the code about 7 months after her video and it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush and received it the next day which is amazing! The brush feels great makes applying my foundation easy as well as gives amazing coverage. I actually have an hourglass no 2 brush that is supposed to be for foundation application and cost almost $70. I regret buying the expensive brush when this brush is 10x better! The Beauty Junkees sent an email with information on how to use and care for the brush which was much appreciated. I hope they come out with more brushed because I will buy them all :)</li>
    <li> good brush.This is my first makeup brush, and I think it is very good, I want to try other type of brush of this brand.</li>
    <li> Totally in love with this brush and the price. Makeup goes on so smooth and natural looking. Excellent quality brush.</li>
    <li> This brush gives you the best airbrush foundation cover on your face! You will look flawless at any time! Also will need less product to complete the look</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!! It&#x27;s soft, dense, and applies my liquid foundation perfectly.  Shipping was fast and the price was great too.</li>
    <li> Really like this brush used with liquid foundation gave flawless look and smooth. Very glad I purchased it</li>
    <li> I recently got &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; makeup and was looking for a good liquid foundation brush. I almost went with a sigma brand, but this brush, at half the price, was recommended to me instead. While I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to yet, it gave a beautiful finish with three different foundations and no shedding! I&#x27;m actually thinking of buying more from this brand.</li>
    <li> The best foundation brush I have ever used! Unbeatable price and EXCELLENT customer service. Thank you Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just getting used to using foundation brushes and this was an excellent first choice. I give a 5 star because I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but the bristles are soft, they&#x27;re in firmly, and glide over my face perfectly. I have no complaints about this brush whatsoever!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this brush and highly suggest it for liquid foundation. It creates an amazing air brushed finish and is soo soft! Will be purchasing more!!</li>
    <li> i felt its little harsh for my soft cheek !</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have found out there and I am an Ulta and Sephora devotee.  I use it to apply a mineral foundation and the coverage is flawless.  The density of the brush is very high quality and most definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Brush is very nice quality and blends perfectly.</li>
    <li> So I got the flat top kabuki brush with a Saaammage&#x27;s discount code. I was worried that the brush size would be to big for my face and that I would end buying another under eye brush or maybey even he Sigma F80 (it&#x27;s the same brush style but a smaller circumference). But when I got it it was perfect and the bristles are suuuuuuper soft! LOVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I gave it only 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t actually tried it yet</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  It easily,  and smoothly applies my foundation. No streaks, less make up is used, and I am very happy with it. I won&#x27;t ever use a sponge again !</li>
    <li> Very good quality brush for how cheap it was! Super soft and leaves very little product behind.  I would strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush purely based on its Amazon reviews. I&#x27;ve never heard or seen this brand before. Believe what you read! Great price, great brush! Glad I tried it, as I most likely will stick to this for my foundation powder going forward.</li>
    <li> This brush is the WAY TO GO. It helps cheap makeup look expensive! I love mine and I ordered another one!</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks now and I love it more than ever!! In my previous review I said I still preferred sponges for cream and liquid foundation, but I&#x27;ve changed my mind! This dense, sturdy brush is the PERFECT applicator for cream and liquid foundation. And although it may seem counterintuitive to some to use a brush for anything other than powder, humor me just once and try using this Flat Top Kabuki to apply your liquid or cream foundation. You&#x27;ll thank yourself!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this. In my experience, the Flat Top Kabuki works best for mineral powder (it works pretty well for liquid and cream-based foundation as well, but I still prefer sponges for that). It&#x27;s excellent quality and I love not having tons of little bristles left on my face after putting on makeup. It is a bit smaller than I expected, so while it&#x27;s great for foundation, it&#x27;s probably even a better size for blush, contouring, etc. But regardless of what I&#x27;m using it for, everything goes on smoothly and evenly. The little package it comes in is actually resealable, which is convenient for those of you that take really good care of your brushes :) There was a faint chemical smell when I first opened it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was just the packaging (not the actual brush) and it went away after a few seconds.</li>
    <li> Great quality price, for fractions of the price! Fullness and softness are incredible. A little foundation goes a long way with this brush. I like that I can build my coverage flawlessly with this brush.</li>
    <li> I just got this brush yesterday and I love it! I love the way it applies my foundation and the application it gives me. I&#x27;m definitely considering getting more beauty Junkees brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush it&#x27;s so soft and foundation goes on so nice :) I recommend it for all the ladies</li>
    <li> I just got my flat kabuki brush today and I&#x27;ve already used it! It&#x27;s so soft and my make up goes on perfect. My best friend already has had this brush for so long and she recommended that I get one and her make up is always nice so I thought why not and yes this brush was such a great buy. I absolutely love it and would 100% recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> very nice way to apply your foundation, makes it easy to spread your makeup evenly and lightly. I like I like !!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the brush!!</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush -- my make up looks awesome!</li>
    <li> The brush is soft, well-made and absolutely lovely to work with.</li>
    <li> Love the brush..  I used to only use the Beauty Blender but this is much better ans easier to use.  I need to get another one for backup!</li>
    <li> This brush is great. It really spreads the foundation evenly.</li>
    <li> I had never owned a flat top brush before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. This brush was a very pleasant surprise!  It is very soft, and it really helps my foundation go on smoothly and easily.  I&#x27;ve cleaned it a few times, and it always comes out looking like new.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding issues, either. It&#x27;s hard to believe they don&#x27;t charge more for this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush based on the reviews. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it and try it. It was amazing. The best foundation brush that I&#x27;ve had. The application tips sent were easy to follow and the foundation coverage did not appear caked on or too heavy. It appeared to be very smooth. Would definitely recommend this Kabuki brush!!</li>
    <li> I bought the flat top kabuki about a year ago and now the set just a couple weeks ago. They don&#x27;t seem as soft as they did a long time ago but they are still super soft and love them better than some more expensive ones. I do highly recommend these and will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> this is way better than all my expensive foundation brushes i have bought before. Love this brush!</li>
    <li> Amazing! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I ordered a ton of these! Very good brush that applied makeup evenly.</li>
    <li> this brush is incredible, is the first one i own so wouldnt b really able to compare it with other brushes, ive used the other regular shape and with this one i get an awesome look pretty much effortless and very very quick and its very even as well, not a single thread has come out of it and is to easy to wash and dries very fast as well, i love it :) i was advised was going to be late but vendor somehow managed to do magic lol and here i got my brush on time !! TY beauty junkees!!!</li>
    <li> At first I was a little miffed about it taking so long to get here, but turns out they were temporarily out of stock. I can tell why, because the brush is AWESOME! The packaging was great also, and they threw in some brush gloves to make up for the delay. I am going to have to get my sister one soon or else she&#x27;s gonna steal mine! I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase. This was my first time purchasing any beauty junkies products, but I will be purchasing again. I can tell they take pride in their products. From the packaging to the brush itself, it&#x27;s great quality!</li>
    <li> It did take a bit for the brush to arrive; however, there was a nice letter of apology along with the brush and a free gift!  This brush has easily pushed its way to the top of my list of favorite make-up/beauty items!  I just recently started using a brush for applying my foundation and was amazed at how evenly and completely my foundation looked compared to using my fingers.  I had previously tried sponges but was just not happy with the look.  The only downfall I could see with the brush I was using was the amount of time it took to get that even application.  But then I received this brush...A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!!  1/4 of the time and the look is even better!  Where has this been the last 20 years of my life?!?!  :-)  I&#x27;m buying this for all of my female friends - Christmas shopping 2014 done!</li>
    <li> How did I ever live with out this brush!?! Best foundation applicator available. If you do not use one of these drop everything and buy one today! I cant say enough good things about this brush. I got a quality product from this seller and fast shipping. I can&#x27;t wait to shop with them again.</li>
    <li> By far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased....even better than my pricey ones .My foundation went on flawlessly with no shedding of fibers, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this foundation makeup brush, I use it to put my liquid foundation and it blends very well.</li>
    <li> The best brush I have ever found! Feels great on my skin and leaves a flawless look! Just Absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> Provides good coverage and no shedding.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazingly soft and a nice weight to hold - not too light weight but enough to feel comfortable in your hand.  Used it for the first time this morning and my foundation went on easier than usual and I love the coverage.  Would buy again when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> The brush works great and Beauty Junkees seems very dedicated to customer service.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a brush for concealer.</li>
    <li> Great, soft brush which makes my liquid make-up go on nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush for the price! Haven&#x27;t washed it yet, but so far so good. Would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Best foundation brush. Makes my liquid makeup go on evenly, with much better coverage than using my fingers or a sponge.</li>
    <li> I love the way the brush feels on my face....but then I noticed that where the metal part meets the wooden handle, it was wobbling. So three days into using the new brush, it broke completely off of the wooden handle. Very upsetting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company responded immediately and sent a FREE replacement within 2 days. Great customer service and great product.</li>
    <li> This brush is very nice for the money...was looking at a similar brush at Ulta for twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I ordered this one.  I use it to apply my foundation and it works wonderfully.  Just as nice &amp; soft as a natural hair brush&lt;br /&gt;for a lot less $$$.</li>
    <li> This brush is just great. Exactly what I ordered at a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Yet another disappointing amazon purchase. After LESS THAN 2 months it fall apart. I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s past the 1 month mark. I&#x27;m sorry but a makeup brush I hardly have used should NOT fall apart after less than 2 months. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product or seller after this experience.</li>
    <li> This brush is definitely not as dense as people are making it seem. I think it&#x27;s more for powders. I tried it with liquid foundation and it seemed a bit awkward to blend. Spend a little more money and get a better brush.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! It works amazing!</li>
    <li> Love love love my makeup brush! I had never bought makeup brushes online and I was a bit hesitant but I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews and decided to give it a try. The quality is great and when I applied my foundation with it the outcome was absolutely flawless hence which is why I ordered another set of brushes from them. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> Nice brush... I purchased this and a set of Kabuki brushes by the same maker. I had been using Sig*a 80 and it kept so much of my foundation on it as it&#x27;s so very dense which this doesn&#x27;t do. It is a bit softer, but has a good bristle count and does the job well with my EX1 liquid foundation and less foundation lost on the bristles. Will definitely be a lot easier to clean! I stipple then blend a bit and it&#x27;s nice. In the batch of Kabuki I got by the same maker I did like the angled round Kabuki a bit more for my foundation, but will use them both equally as I wash my brushes often and this will keep me from having to do it constantly as now I have several!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for longevity yet as I&#x27;ve had it a short time, but no bristles left behind on the face which is NICE! Will get back on the longevity at a later date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve owned this brush now for a while and love it so much I&#x27;ve purchased another so I don&#x27;t have to keep on cleaning the one I have. It is my favorite for liquid foundation. Fantastic price for the quality, great bristle count and easier to clean than most when using liquid foundation. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I intended to buy another brand of brush when I came upon this one in the style that I wanted. I bought it because of the positive reviews and could not be happier with the product. I have another shorter brush for foundation from Bobbi Brown that cost more than four times what this did and that one is not as good. This brush is thick and soft with absolutely no shedding. I would buy it again. I had an email from the company within hours of how to use and care for the brush. Shipping was super fast. I would highly recommend this company to deal with.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to comment on. The brush I got is two separate pieces..and there is no way to twist them together.. maybe some glue will work.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best brushes I have ever owned. So versatile for liquid cream or powder. Easy to clean and feels so luxurious on my face.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush, it does really smell when you take it out of the package, but, I washed it really good with Dawn dish liquid and vingar and the smell went away immediately.  I use if for both liquid foundation and powder foundation and it applies it beautifully.  I bought 2 of them.</li>
    <li> So soft and doesn&#x27;t shed! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for many uses.  No shedding, nice size, and great for stippling.  I&#x27;ve used it for both liquid and cream foundation.  Creates a flawless look with no streak marks.</li>
    <li> This Kabuki brush from Beauty Junkees is very soft and plush.  The synthetic sable fibers are hygienic and cruelty-free.  They have just the right amount of stiffness for applying and blending any powdered makeup and can be used for liquid foundation, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall length of the brush is six inches.  The metal ferrule has a polished finish.  The handle has a 5/8 in. diameter and is smoothly-finished, so it easy to grip and maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this makeup brush does an excellent job, feels comfortable in the hand, is easy to wash, and there is no shedding, so I can easily  recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Junkees provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Great brush! I get even coverage every time!!!  If your thinking of buying any foundation brush, this is a great brush for your money!!!</li>
    <li> Smooth application and the brush is very soft!</li>
    <li> I love love just like the Sigma F80 brush (: I like the brush and how it feels and how it is good to apply and how it leaves your face</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It softer than velvet and applies well. Cheaper than Ulta or most other stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent service starting with ordering all the way to receiving the package. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better! The brush is exactly what I wanted and more! &amp;#34;AND MORE&amp;#34; meaning they added in a free set of brush gloves to protect my brushes! Keep up with the great service Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> My favourite brush. It&#x27;s wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t shed like my Mac brush does. Will definitely repurchase from seller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush. I liked it. It applied my foundation great. It had a bit of paint smell to it but I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it.</li>
    <li> It works very well and I appreciated the free brush gloves that was sent with it</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I loved this brush. However, I&#x27;ve had it less than a week, and the brush and metal has already detached from the handle. I followed all of the instructions provided by the seller, so I&#x27;m not sure what happened.</li>
    <li> This brush makes my mineral makeup application go on very smoothly.  The brush is soft to the face and feels wonderful.  Customer service is excellent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so please with this foundation brush, it does a great job cause it&#x27;s soft yet firm and blends well.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal brush...love it!!!!</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Loving this brush so far...</li>
    <li> The brush bristles are quite soft on the skin and I have not had any issues with shedding. I use the brush to apply compact powder foundation and it buffs it on nicely. The price is very reasonable for such a high quality brush.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, no fall out, smooth application of my foundations. I would certainly purchase again. I had been looking at the Sigma F80 but this definitely competes well perhaps softer. Either way I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Flat Top Kabuki Brush, I have used this everyday since i got it. Its amazing for foundation, it creates a really pretty &amp;#34;naturally flawless&amp;#34; application. I&#x27;ve recently started using it with the Loreal True Match Lumi Finish Foundation. It&#x27;s beyond beautiful, it gives a flawless dewy luminous finish. I just adore this brush. If your looking for an all over application foundation brush you should get this one. I&#x27;ve had minimal brush fallout, plus it&#x27;s SO soft and dense.</li>
    <li> Best brush for me.  I do use powder.</li>
    <li> Great brush, soft bristles!</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush, plus it arrived well packaged and quickly. Excellent value!</li>
    <li> When I had received this brush in the mail, I was excited to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking it out of the package it had a funky latex paint smell from the brush but wasn&#x27;t bothersome at all after leaving the brush out for a little while...It was probably just the way the brush was packaged with the plastic. I also found with this brush that I had to clip a couple of the synthetic bristles down because they were longer than the rest of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this brush out with my current foundation that I am using which is Urban Decay Naked Foundation. Applying the foundation first onto my finger then dabbing it onto spots all over my face, afterwards I&#x27;d take the brush and buff the foundation out in circular motions..annnd found that it doesn&#x27;t work very well in that method. I&#x27;d find minor..and I mean MINOR streaking in my foundation doing it in that method like all the other girls would with their Sigma F80 brush on youtube (which I have never owned but I could compare this very brush to that Sigma brush and I am CERTAINLY IMPRESSED)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST method in applying your liquid foundation with this brush is by dabbing your foundation onto your face with your finger then quickly taking the brush and using a stippling motion all over your face with the foundation. You&#x27;ll get a GREAT flawless looking full coverage with this method!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall..I am super super glad that I had bought this brush! Super soft and yet dense...Didn&#x27;t hurt my wallet much either buying this! ;) Instead of the Sigma F80 for the name! I&#x27;d definitely recommend these products to more friends with these kinds of prices! NO REGRETS in buying from Beauty Junkees! Also, I&#x27;d like to say that this brush does not soak up a whole lot of your product wasting it away like your typical drug store brush!</li>
    <li> This is my first foundation brush and I&#x27;ve only had it for two days, but it seems like a very high quality product.  It arrived very quickly, and the customer service has been outstanding.  Before it even arrived, I had received an email from the supplier with complete instructions on how to use this brush (very helpful!), as well as complete cleaning instructions.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Hello,  I really like the brush a lot, it really makes a huge difference on how my liquid foundation comes on however, I was disappointed to find that the silver/metal handle has a huge dent in it.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was not damaged so this product was sent to me damaged from the warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, its a great brush.</li>
    <li> I came across this product looking for something else. I had been on a hunt for a good foundation brush. I read the reviews and decided to give a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m not a pro make up artist but I love the application of my foundation with this brush. It applies evenly and smooth and doesn&#x27;t flake. I highly recommend this brush. I also love that the seller reached out to you with tips on how to clean the brush. I was overall very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Love the price even more. I use it for blush and foundation. It&#x27;s nice and soft, also cleans well.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will provide coverage but will still look natural, and this does just that. Plus, I ordered it on a Thursday and got it on Monday. ANOTHER great plus is that the owners provided me with sample brush covers and tips on how to use the brush and clean it. When looking for beauty products again on Amazon, I&#x27;m definitely going with Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t do reviews but I had  to on  my foundation brush,this is a great brush and it gets the work done beautifully and should be compared to those expensive high end brushes</li>
    <li> Softest brush ever. After purchasing one, I regretted not getting the entire set.</li>
    <li> Smells bad!  I don&#x27;t know if it was the packaging or what, but this is unacceptable. Yuck! Also, the metal rings is loose.  Poor quality!</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This foundation brush has become a staple in my routine. It is pretty dense and soft. I clean my foundation brushes every day and this one has been holding on well. It&#x27;s absolutely worth the price (and it isn&#x27;t even that expensive as far as brushes go). I also have found that stippling your foundation with this works if I want slightly more coverage from usual products. Customer service went beyond my expectations and I have been very happy with this product. Try it!</li>
    <li> This Was A Gift For My Gf. She Saw This Brush And She Wanted It. She Loves It So 5 Stars I Guess</li>
    <li> Great brush! Flawless coverage!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this type of brush and for smoothing out foundation, I love it. I feel like it helps give it a more even tone with it versus a regular foundation brush, sponge or hands.</li>
    <li> This Flat Top Kabuki brush has changed my makeup life! I&#x27;ve used regular foundation, stippling (skunk), traditional kabuki, brushes, and sponges but their finish doesn&#x27;t compare to this Flat Top Kabuki brush! I use a fraction of the amount of liquid foundation than before and the coverage is even, soft, and natural. My face doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s been painted or have brush strokes. I also use this brush to blend out my blush and my highlighter &amp; bronzer for conturing.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft and extremely dense which gives the even coverage. The brush is of a nice quality and with proper care I believe will last a long time. I recommended this brush to a friend and she loves her too! She uses the brush with a pressed powder foundation and has found wonderful results as well! This is the only foundation brush I use now, I just love it!</li>
    <li> Great brush! The bristles are super soft. It blends my foundation flawlessly! Its a great price and definitely as good or even better than the high end brushes.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every high end makeup brush you can imagine...and can honestly say that this brush matches up to (and, in some cases, even exceeds) all of those high end, expensive brushes.  I&#x27;ve liked it so much that I&#x27;ve even purchased more than one of these, so that I&#x27;m never without one while waiting for another one to dry after washing.  In fact, they could justifiably charge much more for this brush if they wanted, so I&#x27;m thankful they&#x27;ve lowered the price point so more people on a budget can try it out!  It is incredibly smooth, soft and luxurious.  Yet it&#x27;s also just firm enough to not require too much pressing and doesn&#x27;t splay out.  I used it with a stippling motion, with my liquid foundation.  In the end, I got a very smooth, streak-free and airbrushed finish that really blurred my big pores (and gives moderate to full coverage).  In fact, I looked so good after using this that during a dinner date, my guy actually asked if I&#x27;d done something different because I looked especially pretty!  (so it&#x27;s a bit of a myth that men don&#x27;t notice these sorts of things...that was a nice bonus).  It&#x27;s also well made and doesn&#x27;t shed bristles.  Cleaning it was much easier than I thought, with some olive oil and a mild shampoo or soap.  I was concerned it would be difficult to clean because of how dense it was, so was pleasantly surprised at how easily the makeup came out while washing.  I also love that it really requires very little foundation to cover the face.  Unlike many sponges and other brushes, It doesn&#x27;t soak up too much of the foundation, so more of it actually ends up on your skin.  This will help save money in the long run when you can use less foundation each time, so a bottle lasts longer.  It was also easy enough to clean with some cleansing oil and shampoo.  The only possible drawbacks I can think of is that people who want a lighter weight handle and lighter coverage may want to look elsewhere.  Overall, though, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
    <li> The best foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever used!! Looking forward to buying more brushes from this line</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality! Soft, think, and put together well!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush gives me an air brush finish. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I loved this brush at first. It applies makeup like a dream. However, in less than 4 months it has started shedding like crazy. I loved how it applied my foundation but very disappointed with the quality of the brush.  UPDATE: The customer service was very nice to send me a replacement for this. However, four months later the second brush is also shedding badly. I wish the quality of this product was better.</li>
    <li> Great makeup brush! I have been using the Bare Escentuals kabuki brush for YEARS! I got so tired of picking the bristles off my face and after paying a large amount of money for my most recent brush, it thanks me by coming completely apart! This makeup brush has worked well great so far and no bristles are on my face!</li>
    <li> I use Sublime liquid foundation by L&#x27;Occitane and this brush works great with it.  It does not leave any streaks and blends quite nicely.  The brush is soft and smooth to the face.  Beauty Junkees Co. is great too.  They sent me an email immediately after my order and even provided directions on how to use and clean this brush - super simple.</li>
    <li> This brush was super soft and gentle on my face. It also picks up a lot of product!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation brush.  I blends foundation for a professional look on your face and the price was very reasonable!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Good price for an amazing brush! Makes my makeup look flawless!</li>
    <li> Brush is kind of hard to clean it, makeup stains the brush even if you clean it every time and doesn&#x27;t feel as soft once its cleaned either, But does work great for even powder application</li>
    <li> High end product for low end price! I highly recommend this brush. Beauty Junkees customer service and deliver time are impeccable. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the first brush I have purchased from Beauty Junkees. The bristles on the brush is super soft and dense. Using this brush for my liquid foundation makes it blend in nicely. I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone. As for the price, its a steal!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush...I LOVE IT !!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s dense and perfect for applying foundation. I don&#x27;t know what I did before I owned this. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Luv it. Nust what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Loved the flat Kabuki Brush! Can&#x27;t wait to try it :)</li>
    <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t end up going for the more expensive Sigma version. So far, this one has held up great and I love the way it makes my foundation look. Hard as heck to wash but that&#x27;s to be expected with a buffing brush this dense.</li>
    <li> Great product! !! I am new to wearing makeup and found this brush to apply my foundation flawlessly!  Bristles are very soft and easy to manuver. Also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Seem like great quality! Excited to try them out! Have a weird chemical smell to begin with though!</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, soft, yet sturdy.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this brush! I absolutely love it. It is perfect for applying foundation. I actually have one of the Sigma brushes and this one works just as well. Very minimal shedding.</li>
    <li> I always use a beauty blender sponge and was recommended to me to try a Sigma F80 brush.. well I didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money for one... I saw this while shopping and rating were good so I though OK, well I ordered and had some issues with amazons shipping in just a padded envelope and it was damaged, got an email from Beauty Junkees direct.. can i saw they have AMAZING CUTOMER SERVICE... SHE WAS THE NICEST AND MOST HELPFUL!!  OHHH AND I AM NOW IN LOVE WITH THIS BRUSH!!!  waiting now for the eye shadow and eyeliner brushes to be released to purchase.  Order this brush and you wont be sorry!!</li>
    <li> Great quality brush, I bought this one and concealer brush. I have a very expensive foundation brush and never like the application it applied was always too heavy. Until this I was using a sponge applicator. This produces a beautiful Finnish I use it with Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer and its perfect!</li>
    <li> bought this item for someone else, it did not work well for them. I spoke with Julie when wanting to return the item but she was extremely helpful and professional assisting me.&lt;br /&gt; I will definitely be making other purchases from Beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush.  It is absolutely divine.  The brush is super soft and bristles don&#x27;t seem to fall out all all.  AMAZING brush.  It is a a must have!!!</li>
    <li> omg I love this brush and I am not kidding</li>
    <li> I have to admit, when I first opened this I was concerned because it smelled a bit, but that was the plastic and gone in a day. Once the plastic smell went away I found I loved this brush. I also had concerns about a foundation brush outside of a mineral sort of makeup. I thought it might push the foundation into all my wrinkles and not be even. I have used sponge type applicators for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my worries the foundation went on beautifully, very even coverage, possibly because the brush is short and not super flexible like a regular makeup brush, making it perfect for putting on liquid or mineral type foundation. The bristles are not falling out leaving brush bristle all over my face, the handle is very nice to hold and use for application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is an excellent foundation applicator, I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it would do such a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided, opinion my own</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft I could just keep swirling it around my face for hours! It has quite a strong and sturdy build and the supplier is kind enough to send instruction emails for the usage and care of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remarkable quality of the brush is that it reduces the cakiness I have encountered with other brushes or just using my hands. It quickly and evenly spreads my BB cream all around after I warm it up with my hands and dot it around my face. When I used my fingers or a thin flat brush, the spread would be uneven and streaky and I was concerned if I put too much or too little and it would result in cakiness. This brush helps regulate the amount used which saves money and time. Since it helps create such an even streakless spread, the problem of cakiness has lessened dramatically. It is still there for me though, since I still haven&#x27;t found a good enough moisturizer or cream for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only foundation brush you&#x27;d need, it&#x27;s that wonderful.</li>
    <li> My most favorite foundation brush. LOVE it. Even had to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this brush.  This is an amazing brush. The quality is perfect as well .  I cannot believe how easy it is to now apply foundation. So much faster and better results than using my fingertips as I always had in the past.  It totally speeds up the time process of applying makeup and the results definitely look like my makeup has been airbrushed.  Extremely pleased and wished I had ordered one a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Clear description, excellent product and backup support plus follow through.</li>
    <li> Great brush and a great price .. Love this brush for foundation .</li>
    <li> So far my brush has stayed in great shape.  Hasn&#x27;t been shedding and nothing is loose.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this brush 5 stars is because I feel like it steals some of my foundation.  It doesn&#x27;t blend in as well as I&#x27;d hoped and I&#x27;m using more than usual.  I also have trouble stippling with this, so I do larger spots and just blend blend blend.  This is a good deal though.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality brush, would definitely repurchase. Extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very clean and great quality.</li>
    <li> Super super soft! Absolutely love this brush for putting on foundation.</li>
    <li> this brush is AMAZING! i have never in my life known a foundation brush like this! i don&#x27;t know how i lived with out it! you MUST buy this brush!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using a brush for foundation and I LOVE it! The foundation goes on so incredibly smooth and I&#x27;m using less than I did applying it with my fingers.  The brush washes out easily and no bristles have fallen out yet. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is great. It is nicely priced and leaves an even balance on my face when I apply foundation.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s amazing, the company I bought it from amazing!!! I only have good things to say about this product! Thanks beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> The entire experience surrounding this purchase was wonderful! Excellent customer service and they provided great tips on how to use the product. THIS is how shopping should be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great. I used it for BB cream, and it&#x27;s great that it doesn&#x27;t fall apart leaving hair fibers on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this brush !  I&#x27;ve tried many other foundation brushes and this one is by far my favorite.  The bristles are very dense yet very soft.  It spreads the foundation very well, leaving no streaks or blank spots.  I would definitely compare it to the popular Sigma F-80 brush that usually runs about $40.00 -$48.00 and I got this brush for an amazing $19.00 !!!  So, if you need a foundation brush, this is one to buy !</li>
    <li> As soon as I received my order I started using it and I absolutely love it. I also got tips and tricks from beauty junkees as an added bonus, not to mention great customer service! I read all the great reviews and wasn&#x27;t sure to get this one or the sigma brush. I&#x27;m so glad I saved my money and purchased this. Totally worth it! I definitely recommend to everyone who loves make-up!</li>
    <li> I have only had the brush for about a week now but I have used it everyday and I am very impressed. I was looking for an alternative to the beauty gurus favorite sigma f80 flat top kabuki. I can&#x27;t speak to the sigma brush because I don&#x27;t own it but I am liking this Beauty Junkees one quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft and densely packed which is great if you&#x27;re looking for medium to full coverage. I have used it with my bare minerals powder and liquid foundation. It works well for both. It is important to wash it after each use because the product does tend to stay on the brush. That&#x27;s not to say that the brush is absorbing all the product but it is a synthetic brush so you can see how much product is being left on the brush due to the white bristles on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a quality flat top foundation brush.</li>
    <li> Best foundation brush I have ever used! Way better than $35 sephora brushes!</li>
    <li> This brush is great. It helps get the coverage you need without using a lot of foundation. Much better than using your hand or a sponge applicator. I would definitely recommend. I have had no issues with bristles falling out and have cleaned it a few times without any issues.</li>
    <li> This brush worked well for the first few months, but then the bristles started falling out. I cleaned it with the soap and olive oil as instructed, and made sure that the brush was tilted down to not collect water. I am not sure what I did wrong. The brush is also super soft and did work well before.      Update: This company was kind enough to send a replacement and some bristle protectors. I have not had a chance to use it, however, I appreciate a company that will replace a product.</li>
    <li> I am delighted to have found this brush! It works beautifully with my mineral foundation powder, hugging and gliding along  the contours of my face, unlike other brushes I have tried. The shape is terrific and the bristles soft and silky yet not flimsy.  The company that sells them, Beauty Junkees, is attentive to their customers and very eager to please. They welcome communication and are available to answer any and all questions.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. This is my second one. I purchased a new one so I would always have one on hand if the other needed to be washed. This brush is so soft. It is dense and provides medium to full coverage. I like to use it to stipple my foundation on if I want the fullest coverage or use it in a circular motion for medium coverage. It has held up beautifully after many cleanings. This is my favorite foundation brush hands down.</li>
    <li> The Best Foundation Brush Flat Top Kabuki is a wonderful all around kabuki brush. Its soft bristles are dense for great coverage. There is absolutely no shedding with the Beauty Junkee&#x27;s brush and the brush is a great quality. I use this for powder but it can be used for any make-up application with ease, blush, powder, foundation, and bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is an excellent brush considering you could pay a lot more for the exact same product. I&#x27;ve had no problems with this make-up brush. It&#x27;s well designed and it&#x27;s a quality product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this brush to try, and I really like it. The next time I, or my daughters need any brushes I will check out the assortment of low priced, quality brushes from Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush at the same time as almost identical brushes from four other companies. This one is by far the best! It is very densely packed with bristles, the bristles are of even length and thickness at the tip, and are incredibly soft while still being firm enough to apply and blend foundation well. I am just learning to apply foundation since I have only recently found shades that are pale enough for me to use. After decades of jut wearing powder, I need quality tools to make up for my lack of experience and technique. This brush has become the one I reach for every single time I apply makeup whether it is cream or powder foundation I am using. I have made sure to avoid soaking the ferrule and it has washed well so far. I use a hair band for ponytails to bungee it handle end up to a towel rack in my bathroom and it returns to its original shape and softness after every washing. I now wish I hadn&#x27;t rushed out and spent hundreds of dollars on brushes in the past couple of months, if I hadn&#x27;t I would invest in every single brush in this line and also buy the smaller version for application of eye makeup. Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to justify the cost of doing so in the near future so I can replace the dozens of inferior quality (but practically new) brushes I am currently using for everything. While you can find find very similar looking brushes for 1/4 the price to this one, you won&#x27;t find this quality in those. This particular brush is better made, softer, and performs better in my novice hands than any of the other brushes I purchased that vary in price from $2 to $45. Don&#x27;t even waste your time or money on the others and just buy this one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. It&#x27;s made my makeup look so smooth and flawless. Don&#x27;t know why i didn&#x27;t know about it sooner. I will never be without it. When this one wears out I will order another. Maybe two!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted an inexpensive brush since I don&#x27;t use makeup regularly. I bought this brush after reading the reviews and i must say it has exceeded my expectation. I am very pleased with BeautyJunkees. Excellent customer service. I will buy again with with them. I looked around for makeup brushes but I couldn&#x27;t find a good quality brush in this price range. I hope they continue to maintain top quality and competitive pricing.</li>
    <li> This is probablt the softest brush you could ever buy in this price range! I just love love love this brush so much. Very nice and flawless application. I&#x27;m really happy I came across this brush while I was looking for another product over amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this brush- does a great job applying my foundation.  Soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.  Would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best thing I have ever seen it puts makeup on so smooth</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST FOUNDATION APPLICATOR!-I HAVE USED THE &#x27;SPONGES&#x27; AND THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST WAY TO PUT FOUNDATION ON. HAVE WASHED SEVERAL TIMES (HAVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND WASH IT AFTER EVERY USE) AND NO BRISTLES HAVE COME OFF/LOOSE. TRIED OTHER BRUSHES AND THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST-LOVE IT :)</li>
    <li> THIS SEAMS TO BE OF GOOD QUALITY AND THE APPLICATION IS GOOD, HOWEVER I&#x27;M NOT A MAKEUP GURU SOOO TAKE OTHER PEOPLES ADVICE ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for what I&#x27;m using it for.  Not what I would use for makeup though.</li>
    <li> Just received this brush yesterday, and used it for the first time today.  I love it!  So soft, yet it buffs my foundation on so nicely!  A great foundation brush!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. I received mine today in the mail, followed the instructions - washed and dried it, and then tested it out with my favorite liquid foundation. The application is flawless and not streaky at all! I am so glad I found out about this brush and BeautyJunkee. I will most likely try out the rest of their products soon. :)</li>
    <li> Very soft brush and great delivery with prime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally bought this brush after so many raves including my daughter about how well and even it distributes the liquid foundation.  I must say I&#x27;m very impressed with this brush.  It applies the foundation evenly and flawlessly.  I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to buy it but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The one thing I will touch on is when I received my brush and the handle was a little loose.  I was able to shake it and I thought it was going to come off.  I don&#x27;t know how long this brush will last me but I will use it until I can&#x27;t.  I would recommend the company making sure that the brush is secure in all aspects.  Other than that little issue it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
    <li> its really soft and great for foundation.</li>
    <li> Love love love this foundation brush! It blends beautifully and evenly for a flawless finish. Bristles are super soft and it has the right amount of firmness that you need to blend well. I got it a week or so ago and it hasn&#x27;t shed one hair yet :-) will definitely buy again ! Thanks for the awesome brush!!</li>
    <li> High quality, dense brush.  Washes well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price!</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t personally have the infamous sigma brushes... I would have to say I&#x27;m pretty sure there are just as good. A little off in delivery date but totally worth the wait. Soft, dense, and can provide good not streaky coverage.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!! Perfect!! My makeup looks so smooth!</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft but dense.  Excellent brush for applying foundation…liquid, cream or powder.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely foundation brush. The bristles are so soft yet dense and I really get a good coverage.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable value for the price! Bristles are so soft, yet firm. I was searching for a quality kabuki/stippling brush for applying full coverage liquid foundation. After wasting money on several other &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; brushes that fell apart and disappointed me, I did some research and came across this brush. The double crimped barrel ensures that bristles don&#x27;t shed. Bristles are the perfect length, as is the handle, giving me the control I need. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The best Densely packed makeup brush I have used! I love it and I am buying more! Very affordable!</li>
    <li> recommended by youtuber.&lt;br /&gt;the bristles are so soft and dense, it makes putting on foundation so much easier and applies beautifully&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s affordable too !</li>
    <li> This brush turned me from a foundation brush hater to a foundation brush lover.  This thing is AMAZING.  Foundation glides on, it gives perfect coverage, blends perfectly - absolutely love.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush! The brissels are so soft and full! Great brush and great company!</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush! Had always used a sponge before, but this is SO much better! Nice company and follow up - thank you!!</li>
    <li> This brush works so good for me I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> It sheds a lot! don&#x27;t buy. Real technique is way much better!</li>
    <li> I think this is the 3rd or 4th time I&#x27;ve ordered the Kabuki Makeup Brush from Beauty Junkees (one as a gift) because I love it that much! It is the best makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever used for applying liquid foundation. It helps me to achieve a more flawless look and I would never go back to applying foundation with my fingertips again. The Kabuki brush is the best way to get an even application without streaks and you can use a stippling effect to get a smooth, even application. I love my brush and highly recommend it for anyone wanting to achieve a flawless look.</li>
    <li> I love this brush the bristles are very soft my liquid sunscreen foundation goes on flawless, I would recommend to any one.  In addition I appreciate very much the care instructions that came with it. The price is very vey reasonable, I&#x27;m going to buy another one just because :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! The brush is soft, great quality and they have super fast delivery. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes that works great with powder foundation doesn&#x27;t work well with liquid type of foundation.  They are spread out, too soft and too bulbous.  This brush is more dense.  It works better with BB cream and liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Love my brush! Fast delivery and more than what I expected. Bristles are so extremely soft I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Must own this brush!</li>
    <li> I got the brush in a timely manner! I haven&#x27;t used kabuki brush for foundation before however I decided to try this one! And I have to say I absolutely LOVE it! It is very easy to use, you get to use less foundation (that&#x27;s my personal experience). The brush also makes the foundation lay so well on skin! Very very impressed! And cleaning.. well, I just clean with warm water and a couple of drops of dawn dish detergent. Then let it air dry and it&#x27;s ready to use again!</li>
    <li> My face is oily and acne prone.  So I use a pressed mineral foundation from MAC. I ordered this brush as a back-up brush for my MAC Kabuki brush and I just fell in love! The coverage is excellent.  I like the fact that it is not too soft but that the bristles aren&#x27;t harsh either.  This is now my everyday make-up brush!</li>
    <li> I was in need of a new make up brush. My current foundation brush is the large flat kabuki brush from Sonia Kashuk. It&#x27;s been my favorite brush for applying my foundation but I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $25 on it if I could find something more affordable. I decided to try one of Beauty Junkees brushes (I currently have their sponges which I use for concealer). And I absolutely loved it! The first time I ever used it I got the most flawless application. My skin looked so smooth and perfect. As someone who has suffers from acne I was amazed and how great my skin looked. And it still looked like my skin. Not only is the brush great but the customer service from them is amazing! Seriously! I&#x27;m so in love with this brush and can&#x27;t wait to buy other brushes from this company.</li>
    <li> Love, love this brush and the make up one I ordered too it was the concealer brush. Best ive ever used going to get the blush one next. U will not b sorry</li>
    <li> I washed my brush before use as recommended and the bristles fell out. I used the brush and really like how soft the brush is and it made blending foundation easy. I washed it again last night cautiously and it the bristles were still falling out. I guess you get what you pay for. I would put the brush as average and comparable to real techniques brushes. I probably would not repurchase just because of all the fall out!</li>
    <li> Got here on time. I was very excited for this brush. It is super soft and works amazing to put foundation on.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use it to apply bb cream and it evenly applies it with ease.</li>
    <li> I love my Kabuki Brush. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and love how it works applying my liquid foundation. I then tap some powdered blush on it and am pleased with how it works. I have not washed it yet, so not sure if the bristles will fall out, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had in the past with other brushes. I&#x27;d recommend this brush.  UPDATE 3/24/2015 I no longer like this brush. After washing, the bristles are now on my face, in the sink, on the counter, you get it...the search goes on for the best Kabuki brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Helps to put my foundation so evenly on my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!  I am not normally a fan of using brushes for liquid or cream foundations but now I am a believer.  My makeup goes on so much easier and looks so natural with this brush.  So impressed that I bought one for my mom who is also wowed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered the smaller brush for under eye concealer and can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> It in nice brush and i use it for foundation but after using for a while it had started to kinda fray and spread out. But i will still be using it. I just got my eyebrushes too and hopefully they will be as good.</li>
    <li> I love it !!!! Its soft and blending is awesome</li>
    <li> Love at first touch? Omgsh I am just in love of this brush! I have been looking for a good liquid and powder foundation brunch that is budget friendly! Well after trying different once and searching I stumbled to this little beauty! I&#x27;m so glad I listened to myself and just ordered it . I loved how it got here so quick . It&#x27;s perfect and the quality is amazing ! I would say better than Sigma or  MAC . I definitely recommend this brush for all my fellow beauty buffs and even beginners. I might even just buy another one for back up lol .</li>
    <li> This makeup brush is incredibly soft and high quality. Brushing it on my face feels like silk! Not a single bristle fell off the first time, and none have yet to. It applies foundation flawlessly, much better than my previous makeup brushes. I can tell this will last quite a long time, and the price was not bad either, especially for such an important and well-made investment!</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 flat top brushes and they were packaged well and arrived on time. I also own the Sigma F80 and find myself reaching for the Beauty Junkees flat top more often. It&#x27;s slightly larger than the Sigma F80 so it covers more surface area which makes application super quick and easy in the morning.  I didn&#x27;t experience any shedding or unevenness with the first brush I ordered, but the last two had a very significant chemical smell (gave me a headache) and did shed during the first wash and had a lot of uneven stray hairs that I had to pluck out with tweezers. I&#x27;m hoping the second two weren&#x27;t a bad batch as they were gifts for my little cousins. Overall, I do think they are comparable to the Sigma F80 and if you&#x27;re on a budget I&#x27;d def recommend this flat top kabuki brush.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Nice brush but, bristles not quite as close together and tight as they say. not quite a foundation brush but good for using with loose powder to make a finished look over a liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> The Beauty Junkees flat top brush is very soft and is good quality. It is excellent to buff in liquid foundation quickly and washes up well.</li>
    <li> I did not expect to love this brush. I wanted to get the Sephora one for $38, but I think that is way too expensive for a brush. I bought this one based on the price, reviews, and YouTube tutorials. Let&#x27;s be honest: The instructions are never as easy as they make it look. So even though I watched the video twice, I really expected more trouble using this brush. I was so psyched with the easy, quick application and flawless coverage, I completely forgot to put on other makeup. I wanted to show off my celebrity-worthy makeup application. All you do is put a little foundation on your face, stipple it a little, and then swirl circles around your face and the brush does the rest, buffing out your foundation so you see zero lines. I was ecstatic with the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On cleaning: I saw some mixed reviews on how easy it was to clean. I use Nars&#x27;s new oil free foundation with this brush and that stuff dries like cement, so I&#x27;ve experimented cleaning my brush within 20 minutes of application and late at night--and I saw no difference in difficulty in washing the brush. I&#x27;ve used clarifying face wash and Ceptaphil anti-bacterial soap, and both have worked well for me. Beauty Junkees recommends using olive oil, but I don&#x27;t own any, and I haven&#x27;t run into any issues using my methods. I do follow the other cleaning instructions, which is to only get the bristles wet (not submerging the handle under water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this brush to everyone. Also, I was incredibly impressed with the follow up from Beauty Junkees, letting me know when my order shipped and usage and cleaning instructions. For anyone thinking this brush is too good to be true, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I got rid of all my other foundation brushes, sponges, etc. This is the only brush you will ever need for flawless coverage.</li>
    <li> Amazing makeup brush! The bristles are thick and yet oh so soft. This is my new favorite, and well worth the splurge!</li>
    <li> I have been using a high-end tapered foundation brush for years, however, I was never in &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; with it.  It felt like I always used more foundation than I needed to get the coverage I wanted and I inevitably had to touch it up after I was done to buff out the brush lines.  Not so with this kabuki brush! The bristles are incredibly soft yet very durable and my makeup goes on smoothly and effortlessly the first time.  I am thoroughly pleased with this product, as well as with the price. I will definitely be purchasing future brushes from Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> Love it! Super soft and does the job!</li>
    <li> This brush makes me look like I bought new makeup and I absolutely love it. Note: I&#x27;m new to Kabuki brushes.</li>
    <li> My second purchase from Beauty Junkees and won&#x27;t be my last.  Just received the flat top kabuki, and this is a great brush.  Rivals the other brands for applying liquid foundation.  Very soft, blends product well and cleans up easily.  Very impressed with the brand!  Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so obsessed with this brush! It has amazing quality and the brushes are so soft and dense! I definitely will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it! Spreads foundation seamlessly with good coverage.</li>
    <li> Love the brush, makes a great blend of my foundation before applying it on my skin, would definitely fallow washing instructions given with the package, otherwise you might mess up your new brush! Great product at a very cheap price!</li>
    <li> This really is a fantastic brush, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I was using the e.l.f. powder brush which got mangled, so I was looking at the Sigma f80 and MAC 183. I ended up getting this (and the MAC 183), and I really like it. I find myself reaching for this brush over the Mac 183. I have tried it with powder, liquid, and mousse foundations (drugstore to higher end), and all apply wonderfully with the brush. I definitely prefer this brush to the beauty blender as well-the brush is easier to clean, and I like the finish better, but that is personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;To answer my own question, for anyone that is curious, like every other makeup brush out there, this is made in China. However, it is high quality, very soft bristles, no shedding, and has a nice weight to it. I have small hands, but I didn&#x27;t think the handle was too long or too short, and it is very easy to use. If you are a fan of makeup brushes, this one is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush, amazing quality. I&#x27;ve had this brush for months now, and no shedding what so ever! Very thick, applies make up beautifully. Very happy that I purchased this as opposed to more expensive brands, because I highly doubt that they could be of any better quality then this, and this was cheaper.</li>
    <li> The brush blends like a dream, it&#x27;s a good price ,it&#x27;s not to soft or to hard ,it&#x27;s the right density to blend liquid foundation. ..All in all great brush I plan to buy more...</li>
    <li> Arrived very promptly and is great.</li>
    <li> It is the best buy on make up tools I&#x27;ve ever made, it helps to distribute the liquid concealer in a more effective way and it uses just the right amount of product, no more or less than the necessary.</li>
    <li> This brush Is AMAZING ! I&#x27;m a MUA and I&#x27;ve used so many different types of sponges. brushes ETC to apply foundation. This is BY FAR the BEST product I&#x27;ve EVER used to apply foundation. I am so in love with this BRUSH !!!! Leaves such a FLAWLESS application ! LITERALLY FLAWLESS !!!!!!! I think this brush I worth SO much more than the selling price which makes it that much more better !! 5 stars !!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, I use it for my liquid foundation. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Best inexpensive foundation kabuki brush! Blends great! No loose fibers, easy to wash, durable, and no shedding.</li>
    <li> Love the fast shipping.. Very good quality, I hope last a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller experience</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I think this product deserved it. I absolutely love this brush! It is so soft and applies my foundation amazingly. I recommend this to anyone looking to buy a foundation brush. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just got this brush today, and I immediately tried it out. It is definitely softer than any brush I&#x27;ve ever had before. I have a patch of sebborheic dermatitis, and it allows me to apply my foundation with much thicker, flawless coverage. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush, amazing quality! Very soft and better than high end brushes!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I have only been using it for a few weeks but i have had no complains so far. Allows a very smooth and flawless application of my liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Less product is required in order to achieve the desired result.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to my friends!</li>
    <li> Very dense and soft...</li>
    <li> The customer service is great, somehow there was a mix up in where the brush got sent and they immediately sent me out a new one. The brush is great quality and feels great on the skin and spreads foundation well. For the price you absolutely cannot beat it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really surprised how well these work! Definitely worth getting for the price. Way better than any brush in stores! Of course, not the best ever, but definitely way better than anything I&#x27;ve used from a drug store</li>
    <li> Always have been a sponge applicator - never again. This brush is flat-out awesome. No streaks, even layering - such a gentle overall coverage. Great airbrushed/no makeup look!</li>
    <li> I am converted to using a brush.  I had always used my hands.  The brush offers more control and a smoother application.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes!Soft and dense.</li>
    <li> Very soft and well-made brush (comparable to many of my natural-hair MAC brushes), holds shape well. However, it had an AWFUL chemical smell right out of the package, which only disappeared completely after 2-3 washes. Can&#x27;t really speak to the longevity since I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but in that time I&#x27;ve washed it several times and haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding. I&#x27;ve found that this brush works best for really buffing/blending foundation into the skin after it&#x27;s already been applied with a separate brush, as it tends to give much heavier, slightly cakey coverage if you use it for the initial application, but it&#x27;s still a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat top I bought and I am very happy with it. I wanted to buy the popular Sigma brush but I think it is too expensive. This brush gives me a smooth finish and good coverage. I have also washed it several times and it still works great. I am very happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> Love It!! Great product at an awesome price. Works as good if not better than some high priced brushes.</li>
    <li> I found the perfect brush. Never knew a brush could make such a difference. love it; watched the online video&#x27;s for proper use.</li>
    <li> Brush is so soft and dense! I use this with my Colorstay liquid foundation and buff right into the skin. The effect is a glowy finish with no foundation traces like it was sitting on top of your skin. What I also love about it is that there&#x27;s been no fallout from this brush; another thing I look for in a quality brush. This is much better than my MAC brush though definitely more friendly on the pocket. Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> What a great brush for applying the liquid foundation! It distributes the liquid foundation evenly through out the face. Brush itself feels comfortable on the face.  This is what I use everyday now! Great customer service. Highly recommended. Will do business again.</li>
    <li> Great service and tips on how to best use the brush. Very helpful.</li>
    <li> Wow--what an amazing brush.  It is large enough to put my liquid foundation on in a hurry and has a nice, substantial weight to it.</li>
    <li> Best brush I own.  Have had it a few weeks, washed a few times.  Very nice.  Received care instructions and advice from sellers.  Thoughtful customer service.</li>
    <li> I have a Sigma kabuki brush and I purchased this one and I must say this one is better!! Love! Love! Love!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Really fast and smooth application, with little product. Awesome value. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I looooove this brush for my liquid foundation. When I first ordered it, I didn&#x27;t realize how compacted the bristles are. I wanted a foundation brush that had the bristles a little more free-flowing at the top because my friend had a brush like that and it was great. Although these bristles are very compacted and harder to move around on my face,  I found they work better this way. The quality is great, no bristles have come out whatsoever. I was always using a standard foundation brush that usually left me with bristle marks that I wouldn&#x27;t notice until I went to a more lighted area. It was easy to fix, just patted a few times with my fingers, but still it got really annoying.  This brush does not do that at all. In fact,  it blends my foundation so nicely that my pores seem to disappear. It looks very airbrushed, which I like. It took me some time to learn proper techniques,  such as, using too much foundation at once will make it look caked on. Now, I just put a little foundation on my hand and use a little bit at a time with the brush. I can always layer it if I need more coverage. The technique I first tried was using it like a paintbrush,  because I was used to doing that from my other foundation brush.  It did not work well. I figured out that if I first pat the brush in foundation and pat it around my face, then blend it all by doing small circles,  it worked much better. I also used this brush for my bronzer powder, when I couldn&#x27;t find my bronzer brush, and it looked soooo nice.  This brush is amazing when it comes to blending. I highly recommend it for people using liquid foundation!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  The shape allows me to really hide my pores with stippling vs other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this brush! It&#x27;s everything &amp; I really recommend it to anyone who wants to achieve an airbrush finish, with their foundation application! Ty so much &amp; lacies go get this fabulous kabuki brush-it&#x27;s a must have:0)</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE!! Brush broke after two days! Made VERY cheap! Don&#x27;t recommend this to no one!</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve used a foundation brush. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what I wanted.  Soft bristles, dense, and flat top.  I tried it by applying my foundation.  I smeared some foundation on my face here and there, then took the brush and simply buffed it in.  It did a really good job of evenly spreading the foundation and it did not deposit too much in one area versus another.  I got a nice, even, thin coat which is just what I wanted.  If you chose to, you could even add another layer, but I just used one because otherwise, my foundation (which is actually Balm Shelter Tinted Moisturizer). tends to cake up.  It lasted all day and didn&#x27;t settle into any fine lines or flake at all which I&#x27;ve had problems with in the past.  I do put moisturizer on before the Balm Shelter as I find it is too dry for my skin by itself.  I&#x27;ve only used this brush 4 times, but each time I get the same good result.  None of the bristles have come out, and it washes up beautifully with dish soap.  I know you&#x27;re supposed to use special brush cleaner, but I find regular foaming dish soap does a superior job of getting foundation out of the brush.  I found this brush to be an excellent and fair price and a much better value than the brush I purchased at around the same price at Ulta (and consequently returned since it was prickly and did a poor job of working my foundation in).  Sure, I like the brushes that come in colors and look nicer, but they are just too pricey.  The head on this one is just as soft and of excellent quality as more expensive brushes I own.  No one sees it but me-lol.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This brush is about the same as the super pricey air brush make up brushes out there. So far I have only used it with liquid foundation but have been very pleased with it, it makes a huge difference using this brush versus makeup sponges or other cheap brushes. You end up with a smooth even flawless look!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite brush to apply foundation. Works beautifully with liquid and powder products. I have not had any fall out and the brush is the perfect balance between soft and dense. Very well made! Will definitely purchase a backup and try other brushes by beauty junkees! You neeeeeed this brush!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it! She said it applies her foundation very easily and evenly. Comparable to sigma flat top kabuki, but even BETTER.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite foundation brush. I&#x27;ve already purchased a backup. I used to use the Elf flat top powder brush for my liquid foundation and I really loved it and couldn&#x27;t imagine loving anything else but this is much better. I find that the brush does not absorb as much product, so the hairs don&#x27;t stick together and start to apply the foundation streaky. You can really get away with using this brush without washing it for over a week (I know that&#x27;s gross but it happens lol). I use it to apply liquid foundation and I also use it to blend in my blush. It&#x27;s just a great brush overall and a great price. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Loveeee it! It applies my foundation smoothly and it hasn&#x27;t gotten stiff or have foundation over stick to it. Very soft and my all time favorite foundation brush currently!</li>
    <li> I like it. It spreads evenly.</li>
    <li> I came upon this brush as a recommendation from a YouTuber (saaammage). It&#x27;s the good for both thick and thinner foundations.  I find that it helps to buff the foundation to a more natural finish. I&#x27;d highly recommend it and at that price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush. Love it.</li>
    <li> My foundation goes on flawlessly with this brush. I have never used a makeup brush before and I&#x27;m sooo glad I didn&#x27;t spend big bucks on one because this one is genius!</li>
    <li> The handle fell off with first use.</li>
    <li> The best foundation brush by far!</li>
    <li> Love love love this Brush! Best quality! Its gentle but solid with flexibility to really work in the foundation! No bristles have come out def recommend it over my Sigma for the money you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> A great makeup applying product.  These are really easy to use and comfortable.  They are a well made piece of equipment too, so they won&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and I guarantee you will like it.  They aren&#x27;t that cheap, but that they aren&#x27;t too expensive either, and honestly it isn&#x27;t worth buying cheap things you&#x27;ll just replace anyway.  Get something good.</li>
    <li> This brush sheds too much.  Does not even last for 6 months.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This brush is a must have! All my girls on my Christmas list are getting one this year!!!</li>
    <li> Great follow up and product!</li>
    <li> Great quality brush.  Extremely easy to clean bristles without them shedding like other brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Gives a smooth flawless look.  Definitely a great purchase</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time, and I love it! It seems easy to clean, and I now use it everyday.</li>
    <li> The bristles of this brush are soo soft and the brush itself is dense and fully functional. I use it to blend out my foundation and it works well!</li>
    <li> Love it, Great BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> Brush works great! Had a weird chemical smell out of the the package but it wrote of within the day. Gives a nice even coverage and the bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles and great coverage.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean easy to use I love it. Although I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it takes a lot of makeup. It applies a t hi n even coat no streaks. The coat is thin but you can always layer on if you&#x27;re in to that.</li>
    <li> I really liked the brush in the beginning.  I used liquid foundation with it.  I liked how the foundation goes on smoothly.  However, after a few weeks of using it, the bristles of the brush started to fall out.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> TL;DR: Pros: FANTASTIC brush with dense bristles and amazing softness. Cons: Might have off putting smell and some initial shedding.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brush because youtube beauty guru Saaammage recommended their brushes (I believe she has the flat kabuki and the angled, maybe the round?) and included a coupon code. I can’t easily find real technique brushes around where I live and I only wanted a foundation brush, plus I had some Amazon credit, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the brush was the chemical, paint-like smell of the packaging that brush came in which has a resealable opening which I found helpful in opening. The brush didn’t have such a strong smell, but it was still there and off putting. My brush also came with one hair that was longer than the rest and lose, so I pulled i out. The bristles were also SUPER SOFT. I was almost tempted to brush it on my face if it weren’t for the fact my face hadn’t been washed for 8 hours and the awful smell.&lt;br /&gt;From the start, Beauty Junkees has offered fantastic customer service. My package came right on time, they sent me an email about how to apply foundation/concealer with the brush, and the packaging offers directions on cleaning. The writing also says to clean the brush before using it the first time, so I proceeded to clean with some baby shampoo because I was out of olive oil. I believe the chemical smell went away because the baby shampoo was scented.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE how soft and dense the brush is. When I applied bb cream and used the brush to blend it, I had a much easier time of getting an even coverage then using my fingers or my ELF foundation brush, which is what I used before. The feeling where you can’t feel individual bristles but just a dense brush blending and softly stroking your face is amazing, and I think my blending has improved so much with the brush. After I used the brush, one hair did become loose, although did not completely come off. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;I can’t wait to keep using this brush and hopefully it will last a long time so I don’t mind replacing it. Fantastic quality for its price. Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> Wow this brush is amazing! It makes my foundation look flawless. This is my new foundation brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is really soft and my makeup looks amazing. This is the first time I have used a brush for my foundation and so I cannot compare it to another kabuki style brush, but the brush quality is great. There has been no shedding and the bristles are dense and soft.</li>
    <li> Great brush!!! Very soft and applies makeup effortlessly. I will definitely purchase some more!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush it is super soft and works my foundation in like a dream. I have purchased 6 so far and will order more in the future as needed.</li>
    <li> Great product given as a gift. Shipped securely, good communication. Can recommend this company.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of makeup brushes but this one has become my favorite for my foundation.  It helps the makeup go on smooth, not streaky and very even; it works better than brushes I have that cost 10x as much.  The brush has a weird plastic-y smell at first but now it doesn&#x27;t have any smell at all.  The bristles are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding from it.  I use this daily with liquid or cream foundation and my skin look smooth all day.  I&#x27;m ordering more of these for gifts.</li>
    <li> Great brush, great price!!!</li>
    <li> Smells weird at first -- and kinda still does (like chemicals and such), but works amazing :)</li>
    <li> Very nice and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, I use it for everything and it&#x27;s just perfect. I plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> I much prefer the Real Techniques line of makeup brushes. I used this brush with liquid foundation, and the application was smooth. However, I had a lot of difficulty cleaning the brush. Because the brush is so dense, it is hard to clean the liquid foundation that has worked it&#x27;s way up higher into the bristles. It was almost nearly impossible to get the brush to dry, again, because it is so dense. It is very important for me to be able to wash my brushes regularly, as I had trouble with acne and do not want to accumulate bacteria. I would recommend the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush to someone over this brush.</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles.  Comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Works well. Not an expert, but the brush is smooth, doesn&#x27;t split, stays together and washes easily.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT! My make up is so smooth with it!</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEE it.&lt;br /&gt;Best foundation brush I have EVER used and it blends everything sooo nicely and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t any streaks when I blend in my liquid foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face look dry or cakey.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable to use, and the bristles are so so soft. I&#x27;m outstanded by the quality of these brushes for just the price. I love it so much, I&#x27;m never going back to any other foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Junkees brushes are seriously a staple in my brush collection, they&#x27;re just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;And their customer service is so polite! For a delay in shipping, they sent me a pack of free brush gloves!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based on reviews and people are right about how amazing these brushes are. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, easy application, easy to clean, soft and durable. No need to invest in expensive high end brushes because this one is twice as good for half the price! Get yours today! This is the fourth one I&#x27;ve bought and I love it.</li>
    <li> Love it. It glides on smoothly &amp; evenly &amp; it&#x27;s exactly what I expected. One good tip:  do not dot on liquid foundation on your face (per instructions on the plastic case), instead, put a little bit on the back of your hand, rub it on your finger &amp; pick up on your brush from there.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas and she absolutely loves them! Very soft and fluffy while distributing make-up evenly.</li>
    <li> It works great with any foundation !</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Great for liquid foundation, creates a flawless even application.</li>
    <li> I use brushes for things other than makeup, so I know a well-made brush when I see one.  When Beauty Junkees sent me this brush to review it, I realized that I was holding the best makeup brush I have ever owned.  The thick, heavy handle, balanced and comfortable in the hand; the solid long ferrule that&#x27;s better than any other brush I own, for any purpose; the wonderful soft bristles, packed densely enough to give excellent coverage and firm control... for probably the first time since high school, I couldn&#x27;t wait to put on makeup and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there was my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated it at first.  It wasn&#x27;t floppy and sloppy like all my other makeup brushes.  It did exactly what I told it to do.  The problem wasn&#x27;t the brush, the problem was that the brush showed me that my makeup skills were pretty poor.  I usually look in the mirror and give myself a hearty \\&quot;Eh, good enough,\\&quot; as I walk out the door.  I set the brush aside until I could learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emailed instructions from Beauty Junkees helped.  Some online guides and videos helped as well.  I know most people probably keep up with makeup skills, but I haven&#x27;t taken the time to care for a long time so I had a lot to learn.  I practiced, and went back to the lousy cheap brushes to achieve that \\&quot;Eh, good enough to fade into the background\\&quot; look on low self-esteem days.  Then I forced myself to throw away the junk brushes and switched to this one for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not objective enough to know if I&#x27;m doing a good job.  But yesterday a friend I haven&#x27;t seen in a while said \\&quot;Wow, you look good!\\&quot;  She studied me, trying to figure out what was different, then asked me what I&#x27;d done.  My hair, clothes, and weight are all the same (drat), this brush is the only thing I&#x27;ve changed.  I guess it&#x27;s a noticeable improvement, but not painfully obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash this brush every day, so I hope to be able to get another one soon--on humid days it can be a little slow to dry.  Since I live in a swamp a long drying time is normal for all my brushes, but this may not be the same for everyone.  And someday I may even dare to buy more brushes and stretch out beyond foundation basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say good tools make all the difference.  I had no idea.  One well-made brush has made a very big difference here.  If I could do it over again (or if I were starting from scratch right now) I&#x27;d skip the cheap junk brushes and go straight to one or two good quality brushes.  I&#x27;d learn how to apply makeup well instead of how to manage with junk.  And I&#x27;d save myself a lot of time and frustration.time is normal for all my brushes, but this may not be the same for everyone.

    <li> Best brush I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> Freaking love this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush was good at first. But it started to started to shed quite a bit and now half of the bristles have fallen out. It&#x27;s totally wonky and unusable now.</li>
    <li> Just amazing! Blends immediately</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re looking for that airbrushed look on your face with liquid foundation, this brush is for you.&lt;br /&gt;I find it works best if you exfoliate your face with a washcloth before using.  Also, using a primer is a must to get that flawless look.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this brush. I use it for my powder mineral foundation and it does not go on heavy. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out like other brushes. High quality brush at a great price.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! I loved it helps give you coverage but with a flawless finish</li>
    <li> I really like this style of brush. It&#x27;s much more efficient than the smaller/flatter brushes I often see, and streaks less. However, it started to shed pretty significantly after about 6 months of use. It was only $12 so I wasn&#x27;t heartbroken, and I ordered a new one as a replacement, but if you&#x27;re looking for a buy-it-for-life product this isn&#x27;t your answer.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas present for my granddaughter. She ask me to order it for her.she loves it.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! I used it to apply a powder foundation and the result was a flawless airbrushed look. The quality is great and it feels good in hand.</li>
    <li> Really nice brush. Very similar to my sigma and as soft as some of my more expensive brushes. Very good at applying and amazing at blending and buffing products in. Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation on my sensitive and rosacea skin. Haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding!</li>
    <li> Works well and does the job. I actually use this for my MAC powder and not foundation. Gives good coverage and fairly soft. My only complaint is that the bristles are pretty compact and don&#x27;t spread apart very far.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve bought so far and I&#x27;m loving it!! So cheap yet such high quality. I washed it right away after the brush came and I was playing it rough on the brush to see how it holds out. I was squeezing, scrunching, pressing the brush but not a hair fall out. So soft yet durable! Gotta collect them all!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great brush for the price!</li>
    <li> I read good things about this brand being good quality for a decent price, and that seems to be true. I&#x27;m not a beauty expert with a million youtube tutorials about how to do everything under the sun - I&#x27;m just a woman who thought &amp;#34;maybe I&#x27;ll try applying this new foundation with one of those soft, dense foundation brush thingies cuz that&#x27;s how the Sephora lady did it.&amp;#34; This brush fills that need nicely.</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 of these, 1 for my liquid foundation and 1 for my mineral foundation and I am amazed by how soft and well made they are. It doesn&#x27;t shed unlike other brushes that I have purchased in the past. Also, it stays soft after washings, unlike other brushes that feel rough. I have spent as much as $30 for a foundation brush and honestly, this brush is just as good as a higher priced brush. It&#x27;s not made from animal hair, so the brushes aren&#x27;t coarse in texture and I find that sythetic brushes do better with being washed and used over time. Plus, I feel better about buying a product that is cruelty-free.</li>
    <li> Originally for the first month the brush is amazing. However after continuously applying my foundation the handle fell off. I tapped it back together and continued using it. After each wash I didn&#x27;t notice any shedding until one time (I was careful not to get water in the ferule after each wash) the bristles started shedding excessively until the brush was no longer usuable.</li>
    <li> I wish that the bristles were just a tiny bit longer, the bristles are so short that I can&#x27;t get a good buffing motion- there is too little give in the brush head, I find it requires me to hold it parallel to the floor- you can&#x27;t have any angle at all or it simply doesn&#x27;t make contact with your skin- it requires a very unnatural and uncomfortable arm/wrist posture. If you are comfortable with a bristle this short it&#x27;s a nice quality brush- no shedding, soft, appears well made;  but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, I would get something with slightly longer bristles that would glide and give a better buffing motion and more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> When i first recieved this brush back in August, i loved it. The foundation, powder and concelaer brush were my first makeup brushes and i used them everyday faithfully. I unfortunately, started noticing that as i was applying my foundation my face would be left full of strands of the brush. After just two months of owning the foundation brush, the bristles started coming out in strands then clumps, until one day the entire brush had pulled away from the handle. I had to throw the whole thing in the trash. It is best to invest in something of better quality if you are going for long term use.</li>
    <li> I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS.  It is so soft, and it really takes my foundation application to a new level.  I am so happy I finally invested in a good foundation brush.</li>
    <li> love it! the only problem it has the brush has a weird smell to it! should clean it before you use it on your face!</li>
    <li> Aside from the vendor contacting me to give me extra hints about the brush (I mean really- how difficult is it to figure out how to use a cosmetic brush ?--- and which I do not like that Amazon hands out my information -- I did like the brush, it seems well made, it&#x27;s very soft and it does do a good job of applying liquid foundation ( and probably the baked products like Laura Geller too) Compared to the higher end cosmetic vendors (like Laura Geller ) this brush is very well  priced.</li>
    <li> At first I was quite happy with it since it left an air brushed looked on my face but after just a week it started shedding and falling a part. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I purchased this exact makeup brush August 2014 and now over a year later I ordered it again. As soon as I opened the packaging, I could feel the brush quality was different. The synthetic hairs were MUCH less dense and soft compared to the dense brushes I&#x27;m used to. I think the quality has gone down hill and I&#x27;m disappointed because I LOVED this brush as my every day liquid foundation brush. Even better than Sigma&#x27;s flat top kabuki.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush! It&#x27;s very soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. My foundation looks flawless when I use this brush to apply it.</li>
    <li> I never used a foundation brush before and wow, what a difference it makes.  It&#x27;s a bit difficult to clean after use.</li>
    <li> The brush has a very strong smell when opened, I&#x27;m hoping that it goes away with an initial cleansing.  Other than the strong smell, the quality seems very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Personally I love it, its very smooth works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t shreds</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super picky about my makeup brushes. I only like to use good quality brushes and that means spending a lot of money...usually. I have a ton of brushes in my collection, and this brush ranks up there as one of my favorites. The brush is very dense, but so soft. This brush is perfect for cream based products and it applies and blends, so smooth and easily. I am so glad that I found BeautyJunkees brushes! The price and quality is unbeatable. I know I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Smells bad. Still smells bad after 4 washes. Nice, dense and soft though... Ok I&#x27;ve been through 3 of these. Bristle hairs fall out after a few weeks or months. Seller is super nice. But stil. You get what you pay for. The hairs are densely packed. Only buy if u intend on repurchasing every few months. Save your money. Buy something higher quality.</li>
    <li> Simply love it. Better than Sigma 80! Looking forward to buy more!!! I am loving it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush...I can&#x27;t wait for my new contouring products to get here so I can really put it to the test.  So far though, it is exactly what I expected. The bristles are dense and soft and feel luxurious sweeping across my face!!</li>
    <li> Such an awesome brush! I was using a RealTechniques Expert Face brush and their beauty blender sponge but this brush is so much better than those! This brush makes my liquid foundation look flawless and so much better than before. It does have a strong smell once it&#x27;s out of the packaging but I washed it and the smell went away!</li>
    <li> ive only used it once, but so far so good!! love this!!! had it for a few weeks now</li>
    <li> I feel like I got this for a steal! So soft and distribution of products is really nice. I love it!</li>
    <li> UPDATE 1/25/16: For the past few months this brush has been SHEDDING LIKE MAD!! I was a bit afraid of this because of the cheap glue smell when first receiving the product. I own many different brands of brushes from low-end (EcoTools, Elf) to high-end (MAC, Christian Dior) and in between (Real Techniques) and have never had a brush shed on me before. The shedding is most annoying when trying to apply foundation and having to take the time and remove separated bristles from under my foundation. Will not purchase from this brand again.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: This review is for the Flat Top Kabuki brush. I have used this brush a few times for applying my liquid foundation and am very impressed with the way it applies foundation to my face. Previously, I was using the Real Techniques stippling brush and was quite pleased with the results but once I used this Beauty Junkees, the difference was noticeable. The foundation seemed even more airbrushed, even, and more natural.  The bristles are extraordinarily soft and it is a pleasure to use on my face. I have never used a brush this large for applying foundation so am still getting used to going around my eyes and nose with it (I find it a bit awkward around tight areas--but certainly can not reduce my rating because of my own preferences in brush shapes.)  The only real negative I have about the brush so far is the awful and extremely potent/toxic glue smell that permeated both the inside of the package and on the brush itself when first opening it. The smell was so strong I feared the glue for the bristles was not sufficiently cured. Fortunately, the smell disappeared after washing the brush thoroughly with baby shampoo but now I am a bit wary about the bristles falling out with repeated washing , especially after having to wash it so frequently because of its use with liquid foundations that needs to be removed often. Hopefully, this is not the case but I did deduct a star for this horrible smell.  But, other than the smell, really am liking it so far.</li>
    <li> It smells something like medicine when you first open it, but after washing it goes away. This brush makes my foundation go on so evenly and smoothly giving an airbrushed effect. Usually I use a stippling brush for a smooth look but the application sometimes hurts my skin. This brush however is so soft and gives the same effect if not better. Love this brush!!</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this brush. I bought a MAC foundation brush and it smeared make up on my face leaving streaks. ukh! then I bought this one and wow! all of a sudden I felt like I had a suede finish on my face (I used the same foundation in both of the applications). What a great brush!</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels and they way it smoothly puts my foundation on</li>
</ol>
