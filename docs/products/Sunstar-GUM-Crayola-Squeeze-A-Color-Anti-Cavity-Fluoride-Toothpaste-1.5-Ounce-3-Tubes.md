      <li>Loved Loved Loved these!!!</li>
      <li>We had to find a fluoride toothpaste for her that she liked!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m supposed to be teaching my kids to brush their teeth on their own, even under my supervision.  </li>
      <li>leave it the you to reach your own conclusions about the intelligence of Americans as a population.</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t really clean that well, but the flavor is so good.</li>
      <li>Apparently the blueberry tastes awesome.  </li>
      <li>I will be purchasing some more.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just OK</li>
      <li>I bought this toothpaste for my niece and nephew to use at my house and they LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>The flavors are very true to the candy version of apple, watermelon, and berry.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this because it caught my eye and thought what a cute idea.  </li>
      <li>It is super cute.</li>
      <li>My niece likes the &amp;#34;Jazzy Apple&amp;#34; (green) flavor best, while my nephew likes the &amp;#34;Blueberry&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My kids were really into the idea of mixing their own toothpaste flavors.  </li>
      <li>This is great for younger kids</li>
      <li>I love the tubes they are designed to look like crayola crayons and they really are so cute.</li>
      <li>I suspect the dark tinted colors have a &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of their own, and it isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
      <li>My boys 7 and 4 would so excited to try it.  </li>
      <li>The small holes were the perfect solution to my four year olds problem of wasting the toothpaste &amp; painting the sink with it!</li>
      <li>, this is perfect for small children.</li>
      <li>The kids can aim better and control how much is coming out.  </li>
      <li>Frankly, I think more sophisticated market studies probably would have identified or predicted that there would be enough suggestible people out there to generate these outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The narrow opening in the tubes means the kids can load their own toothbrushes with toothpaste without making a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He loves it very much.  </li>
      <li>but this is exactly what anyone with an understanding of biostatistics and study design</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve starting giving this as part of birthday gifts, and I&#x27;ve had more than one parent ask where to purchase it again.</li>
      <li>First, the use of the &amp;#34;Crayola&amp;#34</li>
      <li>did exactly what I needed, encouraged a kid to brush.</li>
      <li>I finally used a mixture of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide and it was able to take the stain away.  </li>
      <li>He bragged that he had the cleanest teeth in the whole town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The boys didn&#x27;t really like any of the flavors.</li>
      <li>Really.  </li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t get a real lot fot the money</li>
      <li>I didnt like it so much because It doesnt make bubbles.</li>
      <li>The green apple smells amazing, and my 2 year old now loves brushing her teeth!</li>
      <li>As a healthcare professional trained in population based statistics and study design, I am very much aware of how suggestible some people can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what the other flavors are like!!:)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, the reviews for this product are an amazing example of the inevitable pockets of human behavior that are devoid of rational thought.  </li>
      <li>I love the small hole, keeps the kid from wasting (we use this as a supplement to make brushing fun).&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
      <li>I finally found a real toothpaste my daughter likes!</li>
      <li>Anyone familiar with the science of color mixing (i.e. you know the difference between additive and subtractive color processes) will know that when you mix groups of different colors, the resulting colors tend to turn brown or grey.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the design.  </li>
      <li>My 4 yr old does not like the flavor of any mint or the kids bubblemint toothpastes.</li>
      <li>Ridiculous for sure,</li>
      <li>The blue one has started staining my 4 year old daughters teeth grayish brown!</li>
      <li>comments that this toothpaste product is somehow staining kid&#x27;s teeth is utterly ridiculous, but out of a large group of people, you are always going to get a subset of intellectually baffling people - whether it is believing in UFO&#x27;s or ghosts, or believing that this toothpaste stains children&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
      <li>importantly, I wish to address some of the negative comments about this product.  </li>
      <li>Great product for kids who hate the normal toothpastes for kids.</li>
      <li>First, the little hole the toothpaste comes out of is very tiny and was a chore for even an adult to squeeze out.  </li>

<li> Great product for kids who hate the normal toothpastes for kids.</li>
<li> First, the little hole the toothpaste comes out of is very tiny and was a chore for even an adult to squeeze out.  </li>
<li> When a child uses all three colors when brushing teeth, what the kids will spit out, will look grey or greyish blue, which I will admit is an odd colored material compared to traditional toothpastes, but not at all unexpected, given the color mixing.  </li>
<li> My kid loves the flavor and brushed his teeth for a long time!  </li>

<li> only complaint</li>
<li> The tube is also less messy than other toothpastes.</li>

    <li> 1.  This is only $3.99 at target&lt;br /&gt;2.  I love the small hole, keeps the kid from wasting (we use this as a supplement to make brushing fun).&lt;br /&gt;3.  It worked!  My kid loves the flavor and brushed his teeth for a long time!  He bragged that he had the cleanest teeth in the whole town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did exactly what I needed, encouraged a kid to brush.</li>
    <li> Loved Loved Loved these!!!</li>
    <li> We bought this toothpaste for our children and after a few days of use my daughter&#x27;s teeth were stained brown.  We tried using regular toothpaste to fix it and it didn&#x27;t work.  I finally used a mixture of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide and it was able to take the stain away.  Threw this toothpaste out and will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> My daughter will only use this toothpaste and i could not find it in stores anyway. Was relieved to finally find it on here. Just wish the tubes were bigger for the price!</li>
    <li> The small holes were the perfect solution to my four year olds problem of wasting the toothpaste &amp; painting the sink with it! She likes the flavors as well.</li>
    <li> The blue one has started staining my 4 year old daughters teeth grayish brown! Never buying this again!</li>
    <li> My kids were really into the idea of mixing their own toothpaste flavors.  The flavors are very true to the candy version of apple, watermelon, and berry.  However, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again because of the packaging.  First, the little hole the toothpaste comes out of is very tiny and was a chore for even an adult to squeeze out.  I realize this is to prevent children from going crazy but I&#x27;m supposed to be teaching my kids to brush their teeth on their own, even under my supervision.  Second, after a period of use, the paint/coloring agent used on the outside of the toothpaste tube starts to shed off on your hands as you are squeezing it.  Ew!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because it caught my eye and thought what a cute idea.  My boys 7 and 4 would so excited to try it.  They brushed their teeth 4 times.  Once for each color and then the combo of all three.  I Apparently the blueberry tastes awesome.  I was pleasantly surprised by the design.  The narrow opening helps keep mess to a minimum.  The kids can aim better and control how much is coming out.  They didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting it to come out.</li>
    <li> I didnt like it so much because It doesnt make bubbles. You should put the paste twise in the thoot brush.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviews of this product, it&#x27;s hard to get out of the tube. you don&#x27;t get a real lot fot the money and it&#x27;s just OK</li>
    <li> My daughter can&#x27;t wait to brush her teeth, and mix the colors.  No more fighting with her!  I&#x27;ve starting giving this as part of birthday gifts, and I&#x27;ve had more than one parent ask where to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandson.  He loves it very much.  I will be purchasing some more. Great price also</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste for my niece and nephew to use at my house and they LOVE it.  My niece likes the &amp;#34;Jazzy Apple&amp;#34; (green) flavor best, while my nephew likes the &amp;#34;Blueberry&amp;#34; flavor best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The narrow opening in the tubes means the kids can load their own toothbrushes with toothpaste without making a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste IS fluoridated, but contains no abrasive.  That&#x27;s a good thing!  The process of brushing removes the plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about this toothpaste is that it is expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> The kids have had a blast with these but maybe a little pointless.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a stocking stuffer for my daughter. It is super cute. I hope she uses it! And I hope it doesn&#x27;t turn her teeth blue...</li>
    <li> My 4 yr old does not like the flavor of any mint or the kids bubblemint toothpastes. We&#x27;ve been using toddler toothpaste still, and low and behold, she&#x27;s developing a small cavity. We had to find a fluoride toothpaste for her that she liked! She loves these, all flavors. She says they taste like popsicles. Win win for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, found at Target, lowest shelf for $3.19!</li>
    <li> she loves them, its like a gel and they are flavored and not minty at all, this is perfect for small children. I love the tubes they are designed to look like crayola crayons and they really are so cute.</li>
    <li> I finally found a real toothpaste my daughter likes! The green apple smells amazing, and my 2 year old now loves brushing her teeth! Can&#x27;t wait to see what the other flavors are like!!:)</li>
    <li> The boys didn&#x27;t really like any of the flavors.</li>
    <li> Great product for kids who hate the normal toothpastes for kids. My daughter loves it. The tube is also less messy than other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> But can&#x27;t stand the taste. He quit using it after 2 uses, so I guess it&#x27;s not worth it. I suspect the dark tinted colors have a &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of their own, and it isn&#x27;t pleasant. Too bad since my son was so excited to get this and actually wanted to brush his teeth before bed.</li>
    <li> My son enjoys his teeth brushing with this set of toothpastes.  He&#x27;s mixed them up and also used them singly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, I wish to address some of the negative comments about this product.  As a healthcare professional trained in population based statistics and study design, I am very much aware of how suggestible some people can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comments that this toothpaste product is somehow staining kid&#x27;s teeth is utterly ridiculous, but out of a large group of people, you are always going to get a subset of intellectually baffling people - whether it is believing in UFO&#x27;s or ghosts, or believing that this toothpaste stains children&#x27;s teeth.  These are the same people that get &amp;#34;hypnotized&amp;#34; at county fairs by second-rate magicians, because of their suggestibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think two things about this toothpaste may be suggesting or influencing this faulty thinking in some of the buyers.  First, the use of the &amp;#34;Crayola&amp;#34; trademark is probably making some people think this toothpaste is made by Crayola, and that somehow the crayon chemists are getting into the toothpaste business and accidently disclosed some kids teeth.  This is ridiculous:  G.U.M. a long time manufacturer of dental products, merely acquired marketing rights to use the Crayola brand name to a group of colored toothpastes, but there is nothing atypical about these toothpastes. It merely the power of suggestion caused by the use of the Crayola trademark that is causing some people to falsely imagine that the toothpaste is coloring kids teeth.  For example, if these same exact formulations of toothpaste were taken and instead of a box that said &amp;#34;Crayola&amp;#34; it said &amp;#34;Rosarita&#x27;s Hot Sauce&amp;#34; toothpaste in green, blue and red, there would be a bunch of negative reviews saying the toothpaste is too spicy and burned the kid&#x27;s mouths.  Really.  Ridiculous for sure, but this is exactly what anyone with an understanding of biostatistics and study design wouldexpect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think that another reason why this toothpaste is falsely generating beliefs that it stains teeth is because of the color mixing.  Anyone familiar with the science of color mixing (i.e. you know the difference between additive and subtractive color processes) will know that when you mix groups of different colors, the resulting colors tend to turn brown or grey.  When a child uses all three colors when brushing teeth, what the kids will spit out, will look grey or greyish blue, which I will admit is an odd colored material compared to traditional toothpastes, but not at all unexpected, given the color mixing.  Some suggestable parents probably see that grey color, then they notice that their kids teeth are not perfectly white (for completely other reasons unrelated to this toothpaste set) and then blame the toothpaste for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the reviews for this product are an amazing example of the inevitable pockets of human behavior that are devoid of rational thought.  Frankly, I think more sophisticated market studies probably would have identified or predicted that there would be enough suggestible people out there to generate these outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave it the you to reach your own conclusions about the intelligence of Americans as a population.</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t really clean that well, but the flavor is so good.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this stuff</li>
    <li> This is great for younger kids</li>
