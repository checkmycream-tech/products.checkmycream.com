      <li>and it&#x27;s definitely one of the best Christmas gifts I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
      <li>the designer: A more rectangular case would allow easier return of the hood and chord  and have more room in the corner for accessories, say hair pins, as well as stacking better for storage.</li>
      <li>The only thing that would make it a perfect dryer would be if it had a medium setting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! I have long, natural hair. I used to blow dry and flat iron my hair until it started breaking and looking *dead*. I heard about this dryer on You Tube from &amp;#34;Sista with Real Hair&amp;#34;. I ordered and received it within 3-4 days. No more blow drying for me. Great Price too!</li>
    <li> The dryer works very well. The only issue I have is, the bonnet is a bit small and it&#x27;s too tight. There is no way to loosen the string.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this dryer! It&#x27;s not too loud, like the design, and easy to pack. The only thing that would make it a perfect dryer would be if it had a medium setting. I would highly recommend the Andis dryer.</li>
    <li> Bonnet too tight, otherwise, excellent. The bonnet has an adjustable elastic, but it is so tight that there is no way that one would adjust it even further. It hurt my forehead, because it was so tight. What I did was cut the elastic, and then just set the bonnet on my head loosely, and it works perfectly. Nice steady hot and warm options. and high and low. So, had the bonnet not been an issue, I woudl have given this 5 stars. Must have been tiny, tiny heads when they designed it!</li>
    <li> Unusable .... Bought for Mom to use to dry hair in rollers. The bonnet and closure is so tight and small there is no way to get it on or use it, even with small rollers and a small head!</li>
    <li> Oh yes. Could not wait to use. A little loud but tolerable, I have used it twice  so far. Hot oil treatment and my curly rods. Fits very well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Girls love it but the lid is a bit fragile</li>
    <li> Certainly dries your hair fast and shiny. Just wish you could adjust the bonnet.  Great for those with rollers. I just attached a large paper clip to the bonnet to make it fit better.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. A little tight going on but otherwise ok.</li>
    <li> its PERFECT and so is Amazon .com</li>
    <li> Works well.  Very portable.  The hot is too hot for me but the cool setting is perfect.  I really was surprised at how compact it is.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the money</li>
    <li> I am seriously in love with dryer. The convenience and the comfort are awesome. I can sit anywhere I want, read a book, watch tv or whatever I please while under it. I use it mostly for deep conditioning and the hear is evenly distributed. I put a towel around my neck to prevent too much heat getting on my nape. I really have no complaints. This is a good buy and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Best dyer!!!!! Ever!!!!! Really deep conditions locks well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 91 year old mother.  It dries her hair well, and she while she sits comfortably.  So far it seems to work like it should.</li>
    <li> Bought for my Mother, and it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> the bonnet is not big enought for big roller</li>
    <li> Works great so far. So convenient and great case to store. I have only used it once for deep oil tx. My hair is natural so I don&#x27;t/won&#x27;t use it often. Great condition and timely arrival.</li>
    <li> I love this. My mom got it for me for Christmas and it&#x27;s definitely one of the best Christmas gifts I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Peopel complained that it didn&#x27;t have a medium setting but I personally didn&#x27;t see a need for it. I use it for my hot oil treatments and my deep conditioning treatments it works great. It doesn&#x27;t burn my neck or ears. I would definitely reccomed</li>
    <li> Very powerful dryer, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my daughter who recently went to a nature hairstyle.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I love it, it fits my little peanut head just fine and really snug. I used it to deep condition my hair with a plastic cap and silk bonnet on top then the hair dryer bonnet. I used the silk bonnet to protect my ears and neck from getting to hot. This is the first time I have ordered this and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> The best compact hair dryer I ever owned. You can carry it anywhere. Just love it.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer.  The cap is really snug, will need to stretch it out before use.  Settings work accordingly, the hot setting is really hot, so be careful.  Only thing that makes this 4 stars instead of 5, is the cord is too short.  But otherwise a good buy. Also very easy to store and does not take up to much space.</li>
    <li> Nice dryer for the price. Easy to use while watching tv.</li>
    <li> Bonnet is so rediculously small it could not be placed on head of adult, let alone dry hair on rollers.I can&#x27;t imagine what the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; is, certainly not a hair salon with this &amp;#34;quality!&amp;#34;  Disappointing.  Time consuming. Received when I got home 5/7. Diirected by Amazon to be returned by 5/7!  Silly waste.</li>
    <li> The bonnet can separate easily from the dryer case for quick errands. It is large enough for big rollers. It had an adjustable elastic for smaller heads. It&#x27;s loud but not so bad you can&#x27;t have a conversation.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just have a hog head or what but the bonnet is tooooooo small for my head AND rollers. That is the ONLY reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5. It took me and my son (who is a football player) to put it on. It drys very very well. It has a High pressure with warm heat setting that I love. I hate going to the salon for that very reason- High pressure, high heat. I have very long hair and use a lot of rollers (the gray ones) so that may have something to do with it. If I did a simple wrap or something I would probably have less trouble. Nevertheless, either my head is just to big or it is not for big rollers but a very nice dryer.</li>
    <li> I found that the bonnet was to tight &amp; I had to cut it &amp; buy something to put in side that I could use it.Its not the best but it works. considering the price its not bad..</li>
    <li> Love it but it&#x27;s so small. Can&#x27;t wear rollers with it unless your willing to put in the time to stretch out the cap and pull your hair.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has got to be the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made in years.  First, I read where people said  the bonnet was too tight but I looked at the overall ratings and thought this was probably just the exception and bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the dryer for the first time tonight and if it wasn&#x27;t so embarrassing I&#x27;d post a picture of myself with my new &#x27;coif&#x27;.  I&#x27;m under 5&#x27; tall and have a peanut for a head and did NOT use jumbo rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see that the bonnet was going to be tight so I even warmed it up with the dryer before I tried to put it on my head but it really didn&#x27;t make any difference.  The front two roller fell out right away and I tried to re-place them again under the bonnet and the result is that I have two rollers of hair sticking straight up on top of my head.  I&#x27;m going to see if my heating iron can fix some part of this hair fiasco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this product a negative rating I would but all I&#x27;m left with is a &#x27;1&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic bonnet drier. Definitely worth paying a little extra to get a quality product. I primarily use this when I am doing a deep treatment on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great dryer, I use it to deep conditioner my hair.  I love the portability of this product.  This is a lot better than the bulky hooded dryer.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Nifty compact is a plus. Can be taken anywhere. Use to steam or dry hair.</li>
    <li> The bonnet is super tight and very hard to put on and I didn&#x27;t even have rollers on.  When I was done drying my hair, you could see the elastic markings on my forehead.  Other than that, it works great!  If I had kept the box it came in, I probably would have sent it back and gotten a table top dryer but I&#x27;m stuck with it now.</li>
    <li> Bonnet is too tight and there is no way to modify it. I put a thick sock on my forehead to prevent hurting from the tight elastic. However, functions well otherwise till now ( few months old).</li>
    <li> I know everyone has said this dryer is awesome blah blah blah. I normally love Andis products, but this has ended their winning streak with me. I purchased this for deep conditions and to style my hair roller sets, twists etc. This bonnet is so small it only fit on my 7yr olds head and that was a tight fit. I really tried to make it work but after I knocked all my pink rollers loose, everyone got a hearty laugh I gave up.  don&#x27;t know if they used small models for the design or maybe I need a plus size head bonnet either way it was a return for me.</li>
    <li> Takes 2 hours to dry, but easier to sit under than the hard hat dryers! My hair is thick shoulder length and I use the jumbo pink rollers to set.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the dryer but the bonnet was to small.  Overall please with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The image is misleading. You cannot use with rollers. Tight fit on your head. Air flow is not consistent in bonnet.</li>
    <li> Easy to use it however the bonnet is extremely tight and hard to pull bonnet on over rollers. I wish there was some way to loosen and tighten again</li>
    <li> The bonnet was too small too fit over my head, so adding curlers wasn&#x27;t an option.</li>
    <li> not as high blowing power as i would have liked, did not include any other attachments, hood fits well, lightweight and convenient</li>
    <li> The cap is very small and tight. I had to take it off after 10 mins.</li>
    <li> The unit was cracked in serveral places when I received it, but all-in-all it worked fairly well.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer because it is so gentle with only two settings. The band on the bonnet is tight at first, but after weekly or biweekly use it gets a bit more comfortable. I cover my ears with Wrapp-it bands when drying. The carrying case is convenient and everything fits perfectly inside even after several uses.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t gotten to use it yet. Can&#x27;t get the elastic in the bonnet to open wide enough to get over the rollers. It is a painful attempt even without rollers. I will have to go to JoAnns and get some elastic and rethread the bonnet opening first. So when I finally get to use it I may review with you again.  Did it. Removed the elastic and it works much better. I will still put back in a much longer piece of elastic.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. The bonnet is way too small. It was hard to put on, and after I got it on it was way TOO TIGHT. Also, while I was putting it on my head, my plastic cap kept sliding off. The hose got so hot, it was burning the crap out of my shoulder, I had to hold it up in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, when I&#x27;m doing my hair at home it&#x27;s supposed to be a relaxing experience, not with this bonnet.  I sent it back for a full refund, going back to a hooded dryer.  Hooded dryers can be used for all types of drying and deep conditioning needs.</li>
    <li> Works but it&#x27;s hard to put on the bonnet. Can&#x27;t be adjusted. Feels very tight around your head</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago on a whim, because I was breaking up with my hard bonnet dryer. I was tired of being relegated to the dining room, sitting on a hard chair for hours waiting for my hair to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great! The bonnet is sturdy, and big enough to fit my biggest rollers (the gray magnetic ones). I can plug it in and sit on the couch and watch tv. Even better, I can put the base unit on my nightstand and hang out in bed while my hair dries. It&#x27;s totally changed my hair routine. Now I no longer dread a wet set because I can actually be comfortable while I&#x27;m drying. If you&#x27;re considering this dryer, go for it!</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the bonnet. The elastic is so tight and small, that if you use large rollers it is almost impossible to fit it over your head without disturbing your set. I was so frustrated with it the first time i used it and my rollers became a mess that i took the elastic out and threaded a long sneaker lace through the hole and made a second hole to tie the two ends together. That way i can loosen the bonnet before putting it on my head. My previous dryer not this brand had a bonnet like that and it worked out fine for me. Other than that the dryer is very good.</li>
    <li> Only used product once but gives great heat.  I have fairly short thin hair so I was able to dry mine using large rollers in about 25 min. My only problem was that elastic for bonnet was super tight! Impossible to get it on with large rollers so had to cut it. I still got perfect drying all around even without tightness of bonnet.  My suggestion is don&#x27;t use really big rollers or you will have to cut elastic or die from poor circulation.</li>
    <li> Great product! Ordered and choose two day shipping and it arrived in one day. Used this product same day and got excellent results with a protein treatment I was doing.</li>
    <li> This cheap, horrible dryer literally caught FIRE (see photos of the smoke coming out the fan)!!! It is so cheap &amp; nasty -&lt;br /&gt;1. The plastic bonnet is so thin and almost melts (gets sticky) from the heat&lt;br /&gt;2. The bonnet is way too tight (dont even try wear curlers) it literally squeezes your forehead and leaves a deep wrinkle line/track&lt;br /&gt;3. THE FAN DIED after only 20 minutes ie. it slowed down gradually then completely SWITCHED OFF. After which the flames started coming out the fan!&lt;br /&gt;4. It literally smells of burning plastic. It is a horrible, poorly made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed! I live in South Africa and waited excitedly for this delivery. It literally almost cost me my life. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!! Broke after first use</li>
    <li> Bonnet was very tight around the head. I took the elastic out and replaced it with some 1/4 inch elastic material purchased from Walmart, taping it to some automotive wire and threading through the bonnet. Now my wife likes it very much.</li>
    <li> This dryer does its job well and is convenient to use.  They really should consider changing the elastic in the bonnet to a string that is more adjustable. The elastic was so tight that I cut it out and restrung it with a shoelace. There would have been no way I could have fit rollers in it without doing that.</li>
    <li> Got it for wife to replace old hair dryer she had and she loves it don&#x27;t have to sit in one spot.</li>
    <li> Dryer broke during first use between the base and the dryer itself.. It cracked it still worked and dried my hair well however it is made very cheaply with cheap plastic!!:-( :-( :-( :-(</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer. Heats up nicely. Light weight can sit anywhere comfortably. Works like a charm. I definitely recommend this particular hair dryer to any one. The bonnet is very large, durable and adjustable. Will probably never purchase the hard hair dryer again. It has a. Compartment for the bonnet and the power cord. Real easy to use.</li>
    <li> The string is too tight around the head. I wish they would bring back the gold bonnet one back. I had to settle for this one because I couldn&#x27;t find that other one. But I&#x27;m not a real fan of this BUT it still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer; bonnet elastic is too right.  I use the bonnet from an old non-functioning similar dryer and that works;  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the bonnet could be usable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually sitting with this dryer on my head now! Lol and soooo far I love it! The fact that I&#x27;m not confined to a chair on the table waiting for time to be over so I can finally move or even the fact that I&#x27;m not adjusting my head every second because I can&#x27;t breathe is just amazing! I love this dryer! My absolute first time using it and it&#x27;s already a winner in my book! I will never go back! Lol! BUT SERIOUSLY!</li>
    <li> Love the adjustable cap. Perfect for drying my hair when I&#x27;m in a rush, or if I just want to apply some heat for a deep conditioner! Overall a great product!</li>
    <li> love this  make sure to turn it so the hose is not blowing on the back of your neck to hot . Other then that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a hooded dryer, so it shouldn&#x27;t be expected&lt;br /&gt;to perform as well as one.  However, I was hoping&lt;br /&gt;for a more even distribution of heat.  Perhaps the&lt;br /&gt;opening should be at the top of the bonnet instead of&lt;br /&gt;the back?  (I don&#x27;t think women design these dryers,&lt;br /&gt;but we should.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sleek design makes it neat, and easy to put away&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy construction&lt;br /&gt;Fair value for the price... not worth more than advertised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very loud&lt;br /&gt;Bonnet too snug for rollers/a large head...it hurts&lt;br /&gt;Heat distribution uneven</li>
    <li> The bonnet was much too tight and uncomfortable.  In fact, I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it without rollers in my hair.  It would have been impossible with rollers.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Best dryer out there! use it daily</li>
    <li> Works very well. You only have to be careful with lid which is much thinner than the lower half.</li>
    <li> It definitely gets hot. Somewhat loud though.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it but it looks a bit cheap</li>
    <li> Bonnet too Small, returned.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for a home device</li>
    <li> This allows me to sit at my computer and surf around while my hair dries, which is no easy task, since it is very thick. I am able to put my hair in big rollers for extra body. It&#x27;s well-constructed and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
    <li> Works great and has adjustable settings for temp and blower.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  You have to redesign the entire bonnet to get it to fit.</li>
    <li> Nice dryer! Just as expected.</li>
    <li> The hose from the base to the bonnet is rather short.  Overall good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> The bonnet for this dryer did not have an extension. It was too small and could not be adjusted. I had to return it. It would have been and excellent purchase had it not been TOO small to cover my head.</li>
    <li> Just with the bonnet was easier to fit over rollers. but otherwise a good machine.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products for deep conditioning. Its portable and very convenient. I wish that i could&#x27;ve found this earlier.</li>
    <li> this is a great litttle hair dryer and pretty quiet too. what a time saver</li>
    <li> Used it three times and it died!</li>
    <li> Love it...only have one problem...bonnet isn&#x27;t large enough.  For most people it would work great but I use very large rollers and the fit is tight..but it dries so fast and is very compact...great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I used this dryer for the first time yesterday for my deep conditioning treatment and let me say, AWESOME! It distributes heat so evenly that when I took the cap off the conditioner penetrated really well! I love it!</li>
    <li> I am a black woman, and though relaxed, I flat iron my hair for three weeks straight, and then roller set it for three weeks, in order to maintain its health and reduce heat damage. I knew better, but made the mistake of &amp;#34;cheapening out&amp;#34; by ordering this dryer. My hair is long, and I use lots of foam rollers, or jumbo magnetic rollers, to set it. The elastic opening on this dryer is very small, tight, uncomfortable, and non-adjustable, so getting my massive mound of rollers into it was simply not possible, without switching to much smaller, less protruding curlers. The machine does get hot, and has a very small footprint, but I could not imagine it holding up to repeated, regular use. I decided to return this, and pony up $70 more for a free-standing, professional style hooded dryer.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I wish the bonnet was larger</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dryer. It has simplified my hair routine and save on so much time. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with thick relaxed hair which stops right above my shoulders.I love roller sets because of the bounce, body, and shine they produce. All I have to do is wrap my hair at night and presto! Perfect hair in the morning with NO FUSS! As an RN whose work day starts at 4:00 am, no fuss is a must! This is why  I have my hair done every week in a salon. My schedule is impossible. Finding the right time to consistently go to the Salon has been trying, to say the least. This dryer gives me the flexibility to have my hair done in my own home! It&#x27;s perfect because it dries my hair in 1 hour!</li>
    <li> I love the distribution of heat it gives. So much better than the bonnet I bought from sally&#x27;s that you attach to your hand held blow dryer than seemed to push heat to only one main spot. This was worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I had low expectations going in or what but very pleasantly surprised with the results. Not too loud, fits my head properly and will dry your hair ( obviously you&#x27;re probably going to sit under there for awhile.. Took me about 2hr30mins ). Money well spent ( especially considering the $$$ spent at the salon).</li>
    <li> This dryer is great for deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> Good quality, looks nice Would recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but so far I love it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works thoroughly through and through every time. The only thing i would change is the length of the hose.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries well.  The bonnet is small where it fits around the head. Placing a snall towel near the brow makes it more comfortable. Also restringing it so it fits an adult head.  The bonnet smells like plastic for several uses, but now smells better after I took it out and let it sit without being folded up in the case.  Good compact drying with great drying power.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I have found that these hair dryers do not last, so, &amp;#34;time will tell&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Works good, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my sister as a birthday gift. She was having a hard time finding a bonnet dryer so I took over the task for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She called to inform me that this dryer died upon the second use. 2nd use! Worthless. I could see if years had gone by but such poor quality in a product is unacceptable. I will never purchase an item from this brand again as this proved to be a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
    <li> Fast dryer. a lil nosey but is good for drying.  recommend it to anyone looking for a portable hair dryer</li>
    <li> Love this bonnet dryer, so convenient and easy storage!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, but it works fairly well.  For the price of one salon visit, this hair dryer was worth it.  I have really thick hair to it took about 1.5 hours to fully dry my hair, but it takes close to 2 hours to dry it at the salon.  It gets plenty hot and is very convenient.  I like how everything fits neatly into the carrying case.  Winner!!!</li>
    <li> Order has been cancel for a while!!! Can&#x27;t comment on what I don&#x27;t have</li>
    <li> Disgusted! The hair dryer was packed in a re-used plastic bag. I proceeded to take it out of the bag and my hands were covered in what seemed like dust and pet hair (cat or dog). I took pictures and packed it to return. I would never place something so nasty on my head.</li>
    <li> Does the job!  I use this for my deep conditioning. I appreciate the easy portability and efficient size.</li>
    <li> Hair bag is very small</li>
    <li> O.K. my wife should provide the critique... but, it runs quiet at low speed and on high speed I need up the volume a bit on the TV.&lt;br /&gt;No arguments for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of vibration dampening mount points and insulation against fan noise (which is not too bad) would make this a 5 star bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says it does NOT burn her ears as some complain. The hood does not seen overly big with medium curlers and she is satisfied (Her ear phones and tablet and PC laptop and IMac all working together with hands free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the designer: A more rectangular case would allow easier return of the hood and chord  and have more room in the corner for accessories, say hair pins, as well as stacking better for storage. However it does look like a purse when shlepping it around the house. Handle retracts awkwardly and the lasting quality is questionable. The clasp is opposite the handle. (I would put aretractable fabric handle so that you could carry it with your wrist while traveling and while holding on to other items. (Ah well, who even cares.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would appear by the pictures that the different brands are identical except for the logo. This one presented a clearer picture, but I think that we paid a dollar or two more, it got late I was tired or comparing base and shipping prices between the different suppliers.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you just bet and gamble.</li>
    <li> Good basic dryer. I only wish it had a medium setting. It only has Hi or Low and Hi is too hot for thin hair scalps. Love that it stores in its own carrying case and that the hose is easy to attach to bonnet.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair. This dryer helps to achieve a  beauty salon look. I use Velcro rollers fora smooth finish. Drys very quickly . It is also light enough to move around.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying use it very much.</li>
    <li> The bonnet is very tight on my head. There seems to be no way to adjust. Very disappointed. I will be returning.</li>
    <li> its okay but with only 2 heat control is not good</li>
    <li> just like another reviewer wrote - the bonnet&#x27;s elastic is so tight that it hurt my head and I didn&#x27;t have very large rollers on. I took her advice and took out the elastic and put in a long shoe lace which was a very time consuming and frustrating job but it worked. Plus I don&#x27;t know how anyone could sit there with the setting on high. The medium setting is almost too hot. If I hadn&#x27;t read the her review about replacing the elastic, I would of sent it back.</li>
    <li> very practical, I love it!</li>
    <li> I just received the  hair  dryer  today. I  can hardly wait to  try it. Thank you.</li>
