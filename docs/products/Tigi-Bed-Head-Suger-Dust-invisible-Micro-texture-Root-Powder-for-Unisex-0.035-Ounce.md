      <li>this is the most amazing hair product.  </li>

      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>

      <li>Dust works ok.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Instead, I did some research and found out that the ingredients are safe to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure how to describe this stuff once it is in the hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s priced at more than gold....</li>
      <li>but I love how it looks</li>
      <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;Breck</li>
      <li>Best ever for big hair!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell if more is in the air or on my hand.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This was just okay.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, when I use the curling iron, then Sugar Dust, I am able to get 3 days out of the style.</li>
      <li>BUT VERY COOL.</li>
      <li>Adds texture and lift with a touch of sparkle,  easy to use.</li>
      <li>Gave it away to a friend who has medium fine hair, she didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair, and used to try to add some volume.</li>
      <li>sort of scrunch/fluff my hair and my layered fine hair</li>
      <li>This is unheard of with baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so light</li>
      <li>works, I have the space filled in, there is some added height</li>
      <li>it feels funny when I touch it, but I don&#x27;t go around touching my hair all day and it is product..</li>
      <li>Nothing special about it, would not re-order.</li>
      <li>This is particular great for anybody (especially with fine hair) looking for a huge &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>My hair is so fine it doesn&#x27;t have much volume.</li>
      <li>this product works great for my fine hair to give added volume later in the day when my hair droops, or even the next day when I don&#x27;t want to wash it again.</li>
      <li>This is great for my mohawk, I go for the voluminous fluffy look and not the glued, crispy look.</li>
      <li>Was worth a try, but probably will not purchase this one again.</li>
      <li>Nothing is magic but this created enough fiber at the part and crown site that it filled it in and my hair looks great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine can appear flat on top even with some teasing.</li>
      <li>It took a  bit to find the right amount to use.</li>
      <li>You just have to use it right.</li>
      <li>I was worried about teasing my hair because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my long hair, but literally two or three gentle teases after sprinkling this product in was all it took to give me some sexy body!  </li>
      <li>I used this for the first time for Comic Con.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I already use big sexy powder play and bedhead powderful, and thought this was something else.</li>
      <li>I put it on all my underneath layers and then finish with Redken Rough Paste or Jonathan &amp;#34;Dirt&amp;#34; for a nice piecey look.  </li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this product to any woman who might be looking for more texture and body in her hair.</li>
      <li>Received very promptly!</li>
      <li>My hairdresser first used it on me</li>
      <li>so the dry look isn&#x27;t a huge issue, but if you have long, silky hair, or even short hair with a smooth look, this would not make you happy.</li>
      <li>My daughter loves this stuff for volumizing certain areas of her hair.</li>
      <li>I agree that it can be difficult to see, I find that I have to be in bright light to see it coming out of the shaker</li>
      <li>It really adds a lot of texture to your roots.</li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t tell how much is in the container.</li>
      <li>but the top has a wide part which shows some scalp and lacks height.  </li>
      <li>I felt this really didn&#x27;t do anything more than any other talcum powder would do.  </li>
      <li>I love all other Bed Head products, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
      <li>Well i would say that this would be like any other product you could use for more lift.</li>
      <li>I was SheRa and wanted big super hero hair.  </li>
      <li>2 hours later I got the bathroom looks ok but has fallen a tad flat.</li>
      <li>I agree, that when it arrives, it feels like they sent you an empty container, but it&#x27;s just really light weight.  </li>
      <li>This can&#x27;t be good to breathe, leaves a dusty film on everything, and never made it to my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it creates unbelievable texture for my very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair even more flat and greasy looking for so long, I could not believe it.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, it&#x27;s down to my bra strap, and it&#x27;s naturally platinum color.</li>
      <li>The product is really light and fluffy.</li>
      <li>The back and sides are abundant and so thick feeling</li>
      <li>I wash my hair every single day (thoroughly) and could not get this film out of my hair 3 straight weeks--disgusting!</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way. :)</li>
      <li>so she showed me how to just get a little out at a time, making it worth</li>
      <li>The product was okay, helped some, but not &#x27;great&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Instead, it&#x27;s a less effective version and is hard to get out of the container.</li>

    <li> I was expecting something different I guess. I already use big sexy powder play and bedhead powderful, and thought this was something else. Instead, it&#x27;s a less effective version and is hard to get out of the container. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a weird product. I opened the package, adjusted the shaker holes, turned it upside down, and starting shaking the \\&quot;dust\\&quot; into my hand. Well, I thought nothing came out. I then noticed tons of tiny dust particles floating all over my bathroom. This can&#x27;t be good to breathe, leaves a dusty film on everything, and never made it to my hair. I planned to throw the Sugar Dust out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I did some research and found out that the ingredients are safe to use. I then decided to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I realized that if I turned the package upside down in my palm, closed my fingers around it, and tapped once on the bottom of the container, the dust came out in my hand and I could actually see white crystals. I then carefully massaged the dust into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dust gives a lift to the hair with little moisture particles and fluffs it. You can play with your hair, plump it, etc and the dust is not sticky. I have thin, straight hair and this product gives me texture and lift. It&#x27;s pretty cool. You just have to use it right.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible and its super sticky I would never buy this again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great deal great price!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and when it arrived I thought there wasn&#x27;t anything in it but realized that the product is that lightweight.  My daughter loves this stuff for volumizing certain areas of her hair.</li>
    <li> Sugar Dust works! Lifts hair to give hair volume and beauty to my hair...Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great; does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I have fine hair and I sprinkle this on the roots around my crown, sort of scrunch/fluff my hair and my layered fine hair gets a huge volume boost!  My hairdresser first used it on me so she showed me how to just get a little out at a time, making it worth it&#x27;s pricey price :)  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to short hair after having long hair for years.  My stylist used this product on me and I love it!  It&#x27;s great to add texture to just washed hair.  I agree, that when it arrives, it feels like they sent you an empty container, but it&#x27;s just really light weight.  It&#x27;s like getting a little dust in a shaker bottle.  You can see it when you shake it out.  I put it on all my underneath layers and then finish with Redken Rough Paste or Jonathan &amp;#34;Dirt&amp;#34; for a nice piecey look.  The Sugar Dust adds volume and texture.</li>
    <li> Adds texture and lift with a touch of sparkle,  easy to use.</li>
    <li> must have for bob haircut</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even sure how to describe this stuff once it is in the hair. I used different amounts and it all turned out the same. The product is really light and fluffy. It is white. This bottle is TINY! A bit bigger than a roll of quarters. Not a huge deal as I feel $10 is not much for a small product if it works. This one did not.&lt;br /&gt;Sprinkled it on to dry hair. Moved things around to fluff up the hair. Ok got some volume. 2 hours later I got the bathroom looks ok but has fallen a tad flat. Use my hand to puff it back up. Gross what is that feeling? It was a little sticky but felt a bit oily and dirty. I only used it on the back of the crown. I touch the front of my hair often. Glad each time I tried this product I did not use it towards the front of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;In a average day I had fluff my hair back up about every hour. Next day that area felt so gross. Oily and tacky. I had white stuff in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not for me. The feeling alone grossed me out and then it never kept volume.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, it&#x27;s down to my bra strap, and it&#x27;s naturally platinum color. The back and sides are abundant and so thick feeling but the top has a wide part which shows some scalp and lacks height.  My hair is layered to help with height but my biggest problem is that I have two crowns and not midline so the hair circles and separates from there.  I&#x27;ve used lots of products to promote thickness, then my daughter who is a cosmetologist, suggested Sugar Dust and showed me how to use it. Nothing is magic but this created enough fiber at the part and crown site that it filled it in and my hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;yeah it feels funny when I touch it, but I don&#x27;t go around touching my hair all day and it is product.. duh...&lt;br /&gt;It works, I have the space filled in, there is some added height but I love how it looks took years off the appear of thinning hair.  [[ASIN:B005SHUDSO Tigi Bed Head Suger Dust invisible Micro-texture Root Powder for Unisex, 0.035 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Breck</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it texturizing. I have angel fine hair, this just seemed to make the hair look dirty and feel tacky. Gave it away to a friend who has medium fine hair, she didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  A must for thin hair.  It does not weight your hair down too much like other dusting products and washes out well.</li>
    <li> Was not as enthusiastic after using this&lt;br /&gt;on my clients.&lt;br /&gt;I did all the homework and it seemed&lt;br /&gt;to be some wonderous hair filler....&lt;br /&gt;it feels like chalk in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, I rather use chalk !</li>
    <li> I say it is so-so. I have baby fine hair, and used to try to add some volume. Nothing special about it, would not re-order.</li>
    <li> The product was okay, helped some, but not &#x27;great&#x27;.  I was disappointed that there was not much in the container at all.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews for amazon products but I honestly had to, due to the fact that this product was quite possibly the WORST thing to ever touch my hair.  It did absolutely nothing to give my fine hair volume but rather left a dirty, sticky film on my head for WEEKS. I wash my hair every single day (thoroughly) and could not get this film out of my hair 3 straight weeks--disgusting! It made my hair even more flat and greasy looking for so long, I could not believe it. What a complete waste of money...does not even deserve the 1 star!</li>
    <li> makes my hair all poofy - gives limp hair life</li>
    <li> But makes my hair have volume and refreshes tired hair.  Can&#x27;t use it every day, since it&#x27;s not the same as dry shampoo.  But when I&#x27;m going out, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Well i would say that this would be like any other product you could use for more lift. but its hard to see to sprinkle it and its a tiny bottle which i didnt mind. its hard to shake out and when its in your hair it kinda feels like hair spray.</li>
    <li> Dust works ok. it&#x27;s so light you can&#x27;t tell how much is in the container. Definitely has particles floating around in the air when you use it. Can&#x27;t tell if more is in the air or on my hand.</li>
    <li> Just skip this product.  Baby powder does the same thing for better.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to a little girl to play Tinker Bell</li>
    <li> This is a miracle for thin, fine, oily hair. I can use this in place of all volumizing products. I am thrilled with the quality because other brands are not a fine and can make your hair heavy and dull.</li>
    <li> This just made my hair sticky and gross. I love all other Bed Head products, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> My stylist had used this on me the last time she cut/styled my short hair and I was instantly sold!  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it creates unbelievable texture for my very fine hair.  I was very happy to find Amazon carries it, and at a much better price than the salon sold it for.  Still, it is a little pricey and the packaging makes it difficult to tell how much might be left in the shaker container.  I definitely recommend this product to any woman who might be looking for more texture and body in her hair.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve spoken to people who swear by this, and their hair looks really good, but it does nothing for mine. all i see is dust in the air...</li>
    <li> It did not add the Valium I was looking for however it worked well on day old hair as a dry shampoo</li>
    <li> I have just received this product and realise that pound for pound (or rather, ounce for ounce) it&#x27;s priced at more than gold.... not worth the price AT ALL..</li>
    <li> Yes, this does fluff up your hair so it looks a little fuller. But it also leaves it with a dry look. I use very, very little yet still it has that dry effect. I have very short hair so the dry look isn&#x27;t a huge issue, but if you have long, silky hair, or even short hair with a smooth look, this would not make you happy.</li>
    <li> worst thing you could ever buy. SAVE YOUR MONEY. THIS THING IS NOT WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and cannot use a lot of product because any added weight just flattens my hair to my head. Sugar Dust is light and gives my hair a nice lift.  I agree that it can be difficult to see, I find that I have to be in bright light to see it coming out of the shaker but take it on faith that it is and I can tell immediately when I start working with my hair.  Another nice thing for me is when my hair starts to flatten late in the day I can run my fingers in to my scalp, rub a little to stir things up and I have the lift and bounce back.</li>
    <li> Any Bed Head product is good. This is particular great for anybody (especially with fine hair) looking for a huge &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34;. Simply sprinkle on to the roots, tousle, and POOF! This is great for my mohawk, I go for the voluminous fluffy look and not the glued, crispy look. All it takes is a tiny bit of product to go a long way. However, it is so lightweight that it&#x27;s hard to tell how much is left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way. this is the most amazing hair product.  A little sprinkle gives a lot lift as long as you keep playing with your hair.  AWESOME</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. At first it was hard to get used to the odd feel of it in my hair but now i love it.  I just sprinkle a little bit in a couple different areas and i tell you, at the end of the day all i have to do is run a brush/fingers thru my hair and  it looks like it did in the morning when i did it.  Im just hoping the bottle lasts a while because it is not cheap!</li>
    <li> HARD TO LEARN TO USE. BUT VERY COOL. I WOULD NEED LIKE 10 MORE OF THESE TO GET ENOUGH PRACTICE WITH IT THOUGH AND THAT JUST ISN&#x27;T FEASIBLE.</li>
    <li> it doesnt work. at all. you can pay a couple extra dollars and get products similar to these that work.</li>
    <li> It took a  bit to find the right amount to use. but once I got used to it, I&#x27;m hooked! lots of volume and texture</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really sweet and good. It really adds a lot of texture to your roots. This stuff is like &amp;#34;hairspray powder&amp;#34;. I just can&#x27;t stand using it because I like to run my fingers through my hair and this product makes it too sticky to do so. It&#x27;s not meant to be touched or messed with after application</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have fine hair, when I use the curling iron, then Sugar Dust, I am able to get 3 days out of the style. This is unheard of with baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on my hair after a cut with Catwalk Your Highness and I absolutely loved it. I had nice texture and lift, but I haven&#x27;t been able to recreate what she did with this on my own. If used correctly it&#x27;s great, but I prefer more idiot-proof products for home use. ;)</li>
    <li> I have long hair and have long ago given up on claims by beauty products to make my hair something it&#x27;s not.  So when my hairstylist recommended this to me, I scoffed at it, and she said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll prove it to you.&amp;#34;  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  This is the most awesome product I&#x27;ve ever seen and it even works on my fine hair and the style stays!  I was worried about teasing my hair because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my long hair, but literally two or three gentle teases after sprinkling this product in was all it took to give me some sexy body!  Love, love, love this product and will never stop using it!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is fine can appear flat on top even with some teasing. This product is very light and invisible. I applied a few sprinkles and it helps keep my hair fluffy! My hair stylist recommended it to me and I&#x27;m very happy with the product. A little goes a long way. :)</li>
    <li> I like this product and would purchase it again but it is a very small container. I wish they sold a bigger one.</li>
    <li> ehhh--didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I only discovered this product 2yrs ago and haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.  I love it.  It does everything I want it to do.  My hair is so fine it doesn&#x27;t have much volume.</li>
    <li> I expected a little more from this product, as all the other Bed Head products I like. This was just okay. Was worth a try, but probably will not purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> Received very promptly! Great price through this site, Bed Head is a great product!! I am very happy and love this product-- TRULY does give great body</li>
    <li> this product works great for my fine hair to give added volume later in the day when my hair droops, or even the next day when I don&#x27;t want to wash it again. My hair is blond, so I don&#x27;t know how the flakes work in dark hair. I love this product</li>
    <li> Not worth the price unfortunately</li>
    <li> I tried this twice but couldn&#x27;t see where it did a thing for my type of hair. Didn&#x27;t give it a fair try!! I plan to give it to a friend who buys it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is a must have in my hair styling arsenal.  This stuff provides great hold for fine hair without weight or stiffness.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time for Comic Con.  I was SheRa and wanted big super hero hair.  Sprinkle a little in your palm and work it onto the crown of your head and you only need two or three little teases to get real volume.  I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before and I&#x27;m going to be addicted to it going forward.  Best ever for big hair!</li>
    <li> It did nothing for my hair. Very expensive for the tiny bottle you get. I should of returned it.</li>
    <li> I felt this really didn&#x27;t do anything more than any other talcum powder would do.  It does work but for a small container I feel like you have to use quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Smells odd and doesnt work.</li>
    <li> This is a &#x27;sticky&#x27; powder that you sprinkle onto your scalp, and massage in with your fingers to get a little lift.  I prefer a root booster mousse instead.</li>
