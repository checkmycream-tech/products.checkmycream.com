      <li>The razor (Braun 9000) itself is very good.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my Braun.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They do still provide a great shave.</li>
      <li>This has always been a great product.</li>
      <li>it is not as good as a good blade, but does a great job.</li>

      <li>Good well made product.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit</li>
      <li>It is about as good as it gets.</li>
      <li>The original setup was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>I ll be sticking with these cost effective replacements until i find a superior replacement or the 9585</li>
      <li>Braun is the best, my husband&#x27;s first choice for years..</li>
      <li>This fit perfectly and works fine.</li>
      <li>Nice replacement foil.  </li>
      <li>works as good as the original with no problems.</li>
      <li>Not as good as original.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to pay more attention.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Style Electric Razors for years and have been generally satisfied with its performance.  </li>
      <li>I am amazed how much better my original blades were.</li>
      <li>Easy purchase and switch out.</li>
      <li>and I strongly suspect is not from Braun.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it is by no mean as good as its predecessor.  </li>
      <li>Works just fine and does the job as advertised.</li>
      <li>They said, oh, and there is this newer one available, too.....</li>
      <li>I ordered the Braun 9000 9000CP series replacement cartridge from Buy-it-now-store through Amazon and what I received is a cheap substitute which I could have bought cheaper.</li>
      <li>I have a Pulsonic Braun Electric razor which I enjoy for an evening touch up.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to find the origiinal, and ordered it.  </li>
      <li>the ORIGINAL Braun 9000 9000CP Series Pulsonic Cartridge.  </li>
      <li>For whatever reason, these replacements are not at all equivalent to the original.  </li>
      <li>Finally, a clean shave.</li>
      <li>I also ordered 2 for good measure (assuming it would be the unit I wanted) only to recieve 1 in the mail.  </li>
      <li>I actually purchased my husband the latest and greatest Braun and noticed you could buy new heads for the old razor.  </li>
      <li>The first ones he bought were supposed to fit his razor but didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>The item pictured is an exact replacement for the original that came with the razor.</li>
      <li>This is a great razor and I will continue to purchase new heads in the future.</li>
      <li>Great as it keeps my old electric razor current</li>
      <li>I began to wonder why I was having to re-order these replacement foils more frequently than before.  </li>
      <li>Checked area stores that carried a Pulsonic Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Cartridge, the closed in cost was $10.00 more, and even found one that was $21.00 more.</li>
      <li>It is far superior over many other models I have used.  </li>
      <li>If I would not save made a substantial investment in my original shaver I would not even bother with a new set of blades.</li>
      <li>I wanted the exact replacement.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and expediently, but was not the product pictured above, does pull hair a tad more</li>
      <li>but this was the real thing made in Germany.</li>
      <li>You could probably wait 24 months, just depends on how much abuse it takes.</li>
      <li>The latter by Braun does not cut as close or as smooth.  </li>
      <li>This razor pulls hairs and takes longer to shave with as you must go much slower.</li>
      <li>Has long usage life and easy to maintain for him.</li>
      <li>so you have to shave slower than the original pulsonic, but not sure if it needs to go through a few cleaning cycles to be as effective as the original</li>
      <li>This fixed everything, and I remembered why I purchased this shaver in the first place.  </li>
      <li>so this is probably more of an issue for me than the average consumer.</li>
      <li>The whole shaver works like new again.</li>
      <li>I went online to look for the older style and came across it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>my 9585 is still working like new after over 10 years,  </li>
      <li>Product arrived promptly and this replacement saves a lot versus buying a new razor.</li>
      <li>My foil broke and I needed a new one.  </li>
      <li>Made my BrAun like new.  </li>
      <li>and now it&#x27;s like he has two brand new electric razors.  </li>
      <li>So I also purchased a new head</li>
      <li>When I received the product it was not the Pulsonic replacement, it fits, but it is not exactly like the original.</li>
      <li>I also never got cut from the old blades.</li>
      <li>Relaced my old worn out head.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;(Picture of cutter/foil is at nearly 3 months of use)</li>
      <li>it fails to do a good job - invest in another razor (non Braun ?)</li>
      <li>Changing the head of the razor and cleaning it regularly with the solution makes this razor like brand new!</li>
      <li>The new blades dull so quickly...</li>
      <li>Apparently Braun has changed the cartridge.</li>
      <li>I noticed this was different than my old one, but I figured it was just a cosmetic change.</li>
      <li>It barely cuts the whiskers leave alone getting a close shave.</li>
      <li>He actually used the old Braun without replacing the head for about 5 years without any issues..  </li>
      <li>The Series 7 70S which was sent fits my Braun and apparently works.</li>
      <li>I buy these quite frequently for my Series 7 9585 (Old School), as they don&#x27;t last quite as long as the originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After having an earlier model Braun shaver that I loved, the Series 7 (790cc) shaver was a big disappointment from a features &amp; ergonomic perspective.</li>
      <li>These simply do not last or stay sharp anywhere near as long as the older Braun foils.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and this replacement saves a lot versus buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> No much to say.  The blades/foil are replaced about every 18 months (n.b., I have a heavy beard) and the cleaning \\&quot;tubs\\&quot; about once a month.  I have read of people refilling the cleaning containers themselves using various mixtures but what&#x27;s the point.  They run a few dollars a month when purchased in bulk.  The razor (Braun 9000) itself is very good.  No problems except some cosmetic wear after 2 1/2 years of use.  Excellent electric razon</li>
    <li> I really do not know how Braun can improve on this product. It is about as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how bad my shaver&#x27;s performance had deterioriated.  This fixed everything, and I remembered why I purchased this shaver in the first place.  I&#x27;m going to pay more attention.</li>
    <li> Changing the head of the razor and cleaning it regularly with the solution makes this razor like brand new!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll need a replacement after about a 18month. Easy purchase and switch out. You could probably wait 24 months, just depends on how much abuse it takes. Good well made product.</li>
    <li> After having an earlier model Braun shaver that I loved, the Series 7 (790cc) shaver was a big disappointment from a features &amp; ergonomic perspective. The biggest let down was the Pulsonic 9000 Series Foils (with the blades made by Gillette). These simply do not last or stay sharp anywhere near as long as the older Braun foils. Mine typically get noticeably dull within a matter of weeks (and not the months that are claimed) ... and I do not have a heavy or tough beard. I will not buy another Braun shaver (or the foils that go in them) again in the future.</li>
    <li> Works great! I heard about cheaper knock offs but this was the real thing made in Germany. The whole shaver works like new again.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Perfect fit</li>
    <li> My foil broke and I needed a new one.  This fit perfectly and works fine.</li>
    <li> My Braun electric Razor is the best I have ever owned.  I replace the cutting foils and cover every year.</li>
    <li> Works great on my Braun.  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I am dissappointed in purchasing this item from amzon. For the second time this item feels that it is a used or refurbished item. It barely cuts the whiskers leave alone getting a close shave. I am thinking of returning it and I hope I will get my money back. I recently purchased another one from Target, and it feels alright. I wonder if the discrepency is from the factory, because the package was sealed.</li>
    <li> This is not the product that i received. I was looking for the pulse 9000 series and received the series 7 replacement head instead. They are compatible but I was specifically looking for the advertised head</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Style Electric Razors for years and have been generally satisfied with its performance.  It is far superior over many other models I have used.  The razor head replacement that used to come with the Series 7 Razor is the Braun 9000 Pulsonic Replacment Foil.  The Pulsonic brand of replacement heads will have \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; stamped on the head.  Recently, the 9000 Pulsonic Foil was superseded by the Braun equivalent which is the Series 7 Replacement head.  These are stamped \\&quot;Series 7\\&quot; on the razor head.  The latter by Braun does not cut as close or as smooth.  It does not glide as well and when used and feels like it pulls at the hair rather than cutting it.  In my opinion, it is by no mean as good as its predecessor.  I went online to look for the older style and came across it on Amazon.  The picture and label says its the Pulsonic Foil but when I recieved it in the mail, it was the Series 7.  I also ordered 2 for good measure (assuming it would be the unit I wanted) only to recieve 1 in the mail.  To date, I have not received the second unit ordered.  I was billed for 2.  These razor heads are not cheap either ($56/replacement). Some may argue that it is the same product but those who use it will tell you its not.  They are different.  See reviews on the different models online.</li>
    <li> Apparently Braun has changed the cartridge. The item pictured is an exact replacement for the original that came with the razor. I wanted the exact replacement. When I received the product it was not the Pulsonic replacement, it fits, but it is not exactly like the original. The foil does not have the same design, the middle blade is not blue, and it reads \\&quot;series 7\\&quot; not \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture on this site.</li>
    <li> I bought a Braun shaver - it worked well. in fact it gave a really good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I bought a replacement foil and cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;The question I wonder about is .. is this replacement from Braun ?&lt;br /&gt;Because if it is, that&#x27;s the last product I&#x27;ll buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Braun 9000 9000CP Series Pulsonic Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Cartridge\\&quot; seems to be an inferior product and I strongly suspect is not from Braun. It fails to cut close.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to go over my stubble again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So dont buy this - it fails to do a good job - invest in another razor (non Braun ?)</li>
    <li> Relaced my old worn out head.  works as expected.</li>
    <li> Braun is the best, my husband&#x27;s first choice for years.. Has long usage life and easy to maintain for him.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;ad&amp;#34; on Amazon said they had 15 of these left....the ORIGINAL Braun 9000 9000CP Series Pulsonic Cartridge.  They said, oh, and there is this newer one available, too.....the Series 7, 70s (9000 Series) Pulsonic Cartridge.  I was excited to find the origiinal, and ordered it.  They sent me the Series 7, which is crap.  I resent the misrepresentation, the &amp;#34;bait and switch&amp;#34; tactic.  I would avoid this vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> Great as it keeps my old electric razor current</li>
    <li> I noticed this was different than my old one, but I figured it was just a cosmetic change. I am amazed how much better my original blades were. Not the seller&#x27;s fault, but a bad joke Braun played on us. He should change the photo though, the newer shots are out there. The original setup was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The new blades dull so quickly... there&#x27;s no comparison. I also never got cut from the old blades. I have a tough beard so this is probably more of an issue for me than the average consumer. If I would not save made a substantial investment in my original shaver I would not even bother with a new set of blades. I am sadly probably going to order another set that will limp me along for a while.</li>
    <li> Not as good as original. This razor pulls hairs and takes longer to shave with as you must go much slower.</li>
    <li> Finally, a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Nice replacement foil.  I opted for this but found out after i could have purchased the less expensive package with the same foil in it.  it was just labeled differently.&lt;br /&gt;Good product though.</li>
    <li> My husband had a hard time finding replacement cartridges.  I got them easier and cheaper on Amazon.  The first ones he bought were supposed to fit his razor but didn&#x27;t.  These were perfect.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Braun 9000 9000CP series replacement cartridge from Buy-it-now-store through Amazon and what I received is a cheap substitute which I could have bought cheaper. Although I got authorization to return it, I would have had to pay for the postage and thus was not worth it to me. Rather, I&#x27;d like to warn others who would buy this item. The Series 7 70S which was sent fits my Braun and apparently works. But it lacks the quality of the 9000 in both build and closeness of shave. I don&#x27;t know why Amazon puts up with these shady sellers, but I would never again purchase anything through the Buy-it-now store located in Lenexa KS 66215.</li>
    <li> Works just fine and does the job as advertised. This has always been a great product.</li>
    <li> I have a Pulsonic Braun Electric razor which I enjoy for an evening touch up.  it is not as good as a good blade, but does a great job.</li>
    <li> I buy these quite frequently for my Series 7 9585 (Old School), as they don&#x27;t last quite as long as the originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do still provide a great shave. I replace the cutter and foil approx every 6 to 9 months, sometimes longer but i probably replace a bit preemptively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my 9585 is still working like new after over 10 years,  I ll be sticking with these cost effective replacements until i find a superior replacement or the 9585 decides it&#x27;s tired of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Picture of cutter/foil is at nearly 3 months of use)</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and expediently, but was not the product pictured above, does pull hair a tad more so you have to shave slower than the original pulsonic, but not sure if it needs to go through a few cleaning cycles to be as effective as the original</li>
    <li> works as good as the original with no problems. Will recommend to others as one of the best shaers on the market.</li>
    <li> I began to wonder why I was having to re-order these replacement foils more frequently than before.  However, after reading all these negative reviews, I no longer feel like the Lone Ranger in my appraisals of this product.  For whatever reason, these replacements are not at all equivalent to the original.  Will look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Made my BrAun like new.  Checked area stores that carried a Pulsonic Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Cartridge, the closed in cost was $10.00 more, and even found one that was $21.00 more.</li>
    <li> I didin&#x27;t know that this part was replaceable and I was delighted to receive it</li>
    <li> I actually purchased my husband the latest and greatest Braun and noticed you could buy new heads for the old razor.  So I also purchased a new head and now it&#x27;s like he has two brand new electric razors.  He actually used the old Braun without replacing the head for about 5 years without any issues..  This is a great razor and I will continue to purchase new heads in the future.</li>
