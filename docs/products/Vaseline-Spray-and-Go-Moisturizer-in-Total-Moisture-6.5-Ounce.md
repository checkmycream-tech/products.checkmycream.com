<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> easy to use non greasy</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;The can sprays nicely and fairly evenly but the mess that arises from the process is less than appealing. My suggestion to this persistent problem is spray outside or even in the shower. One of the biggest upsides to the spay action is the light application it produces, thus making it dry significantly faster. It also smells pleasant to me but my cat was appalled.</li>
    <li> I got this lotion for free as part of the Influenster VoxBox program. I&#x27;m entering this review as a Brand Challenge for the chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good mid-level moisturizer and is SUPER easy to use. I wouldn&#x27;t call it the MOST moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, but it certainly gets the job done. And what could be easier than a spray on application?</li>
    <li> Leaves pools of oil on the skin that need to be rubbed in - not as dry as I expected, but it does keep my skin soft and is a great time saver vs an all-over body lotion.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt so smooth.  I suffer from extremely dry skin.  My skin is incredibly itchy and I have often scratched spots on my skin open.  This leads to my legs looking like I ran through a thorn bush and the bush won the race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Vaseline Spray and Go, I find myself constantly spraying my arms and legs because it is so fast and easy.  I spray myself after my shower, before I put clothes on, before I go to bed, when I wake up, even when I&#x27;m bored.  Because of my constant spraying I go through a lot of moisturizer but my skin has never felt better!</li>
    <li> Good stuff will purchase more when I run out which will very very soon.Never greasy, as stated on telly love it.</li>
    <li> Sprays on and you rub it in NO greasy feeling at all and smells so good.  I will buy again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really been a fan of vaseline moisturizers because I feel like they are too watery.  I was willing to try this new product, however.  I was impressed with the concept and how fast and easy it was to use.  I&#x27;m still not sold on the moisturizing properties, but found it decent enough to use on my legs every day right out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Love the ease of this moisturizer! Fast and easy with a great outcome! Makes it a very convenient process for women!</li>
    <li> This spray is my favorite! Lovely light scent, no greasiness and quickly absorbed into your skin. I don&#x27;t believe I will ever buy lotion again. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I spray all over and then rub in, dry in seconds.  My skin has never felt smoother, I am usually always itchy this has definitely cured that, also smells amazing.  The price is also great, Walgreen&#x27;s had it for $2 more, with Amazon prime you just can&#x27;t lose.  I bought more for my sisters, mom and daughter.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. It make using lotion less messy and more controllable. It sprays as just like sunscreen spray does.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the others. Wonderful for daily use. Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t streak and has a nice, light, feminine scent.  Excellent. Will definitely buy again.....maybe with a coupon though. :)</li>
    <li> The commercials show a girl spraying herself all over and then immediately putting on clothes. It does not dry like that. I tried it and my shirt stuck to my back. It seems to be a good moisturizer, but you are not going to go anywhere immediately after you spray. I stand in front of the fan or use a blow dryer first.</li>
    <li> wife loves it..... lasts a long time</li>
    <li> bought this for my 2 1/2 year old. Very light moisturizer and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it certainly isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;spray and go.&amp;#34;  You do have to rub it in.</li>
    <li> The product was easy to spray on but it sprayed everywhere. My daughter liked it but it would not moisture very well and was oily. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use that&#x27;s for sure.  Spray it on, but you still have to take the time to rub it in.  The more you put on to moisturize the more you will have to rub in.  I am please with the product.</li>
    <li> Ok, well I like this product, but I don&#x27;t love it. What I like about it is that it&#x27;s convenient! I can spray it in hard to reach areas, and it absorbs well. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as say Vaseline repairing moisture..which is my favorite hand and body moisturizing lotion, but it will help with dryness. I have extremely dry skin and need to moisturize daily, and this product is nice when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to do a thorough moisturizing routine. I haven&#x27;t decided if I will purchase it again. It is strictly a convenience product for me, and doesn&#x27;t address deep moisturizing needs. But I do like the convenience of being able to spray it on, lightly rub it in and go.</li>
    <li> Do not understand all the positive reviews, this product is ver misleading. You spray and rub in JUST as you would lotion, this product does not dry any quicker than a lotion would, it seems to take longer to dry and leaves a sticky feeling to your skin. As far as moisturizing goes, this product does not work. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all - leaves a lingering scent but will not leave your skin softer. Also, this product contains parabens. I think this product is more about marketing and hype, you are better off using any brand of body moisturizer than using this spray.</li>
    <li> What on earth is everyone so happy about with this product? It simply does not work the way it says it does on TV. You can NOT just \\&quot;Spray and GO\\&quot;. When you use it there is a white goop everywhere that must be rubbed in. How is this any different from regular lotion? That is squeeze and rub and go. This is spray and rub and go. I have 2 bottles (One of them emits a high-pitch whistle, oddly enough). And they both leave this noticeable white lotion residue splatter unless you rub it in. At least it isn&#x27;t greasy. I&#x27;ll give it that. And sure you can reach your back with it. But you had better have a friend to rub it in because otherwise you are going to look like you were sprayed with mayonnaise from behind. Spray-on sunscreen is much more effective at the job this product claims to do.</li>
    <li> You spray then rub which is a big difference from what we normally do with lotion. The smell isn&#x27;t all that. People in the reviews are sooo exaggerating the smell. Overall great product!</li>
    <li> Spray can has a great sprayer. Spray onto arms, legs, etc, then rub in! Super fast and the lotion smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
    <li> Best pricing I could find.</li>
    <li> What a great product! It&#x27;s the perfect way to moisturize your back and hard to reach areas. And, thanks to Amazon for making a product available that I&#x27;ve never seen in the store. An added plus is that it&#x27;s available on the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; program, so I never have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> Such a great product. Smells good, goes on easy and quickly. Isn&#x27;t greasing and makes my skin super soft. Recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> My son noticed that my legs had &#x27;spots&#x27; on them. A girl friend suggested I get this stuff and WHAMMO!!! No more spots...</li>
    <li> I love this. It is very easy to spray on. You do have to rub it in a bit after you spray it on, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent but this is a preference thing. The only one I like...and I love that one...is the aloe in the green bottle. So convenient and easy to use! My back has never been more moisturized.</li>
    <li> easy to use, and it is one of the best moisturizer around to me.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I need to purchase more. It is a little high-priced from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have started to use this a month ago and I&#x27;m addicted to it now! It is part of my morning and evening routine because this is so much easier to use than ordinary lotion is. It takes me about 30 seconds to spray it all over and another minute to rub it in. It doesn&#x27;t get any easier than that! The smell is great, feminine, not overpowering at all. You can still use perfume on top of it without feeling like you have overdone it. It feels very nice and non-greasy on the skin. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I never use body lotion because of the sticky icky feeling, so this is great to use right after a shower.  I would suggest to spray it in the shower right after towel drying.  That way you avoid slippery floors &amp; sprayed walls.  I use it in my hair to tame the frizzies too, and it&#x27;s not heavy like hair serum and it gives it a healthy shine.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, moisturizes well during the warmer months through fall, but I use a thicker body lotion during the winter. The spray is great for getting an even coating and then a quick rub will have it soaked in right away so I can get dressed without it getting on my clothes. I also really like how the top turns to a locked/unlocked position so I can toss it into my bag without worrying about it getting on my stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted something I can quickly spray on after my showers and go.  You know, like in the commercial for the product.  Well that&#x27;s not what I got.  Yes it sprays but maybe I got a defective spraying device because mine sprays a very small thin stream.  I have to spray my arm 3-4 times to get enough product to lotion just my arm.  On top of being awful to spray, it takes a while to dry.  I am just going to stick to my pump lotion.  It is not worth the price or the frustration.  It does smell nice though.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! It smells wonderful! Soaks into skin quickly! I love it! Will definitely have to keep it in my daily routine</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this absorbs well, goes on fast, and keeps my skin moisturized longer than any other product I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> I still have to rub it in a little after spraying, but it does dry quickly after that. And if you spray over tile, it becomes very slippery, so be careful! Just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra money though.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin, but I&#x27;m also impatient. I can&#x27;t stand waiting for cream or lotion to soak in before getting dressed. That then leads to me getting lotion on my clothes that is either hard to get out, or never does and ruins the article of clothing.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this spray based on the commercials and was really pleasantly surprised. I really does absorb quickly and cleanly. It moisturizes nicely and has a soft summery fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s a quick spray, wipe, and get dressed without waiting. I have no idea why it took so long to come up with this, but I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
    <li> I saw the ads on TV and initially thought it too good to be true.  I was pleasantly surprised upon trying it.  It&#x27;s easy to apply (doesn&#x27;t get everywhere), smells nice, and absorbs into skin quickly.  Everyone who uses it loves it.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer in Total Moisture, 6.5 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just like the commercial in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;Shower, put my hair in a towel, spray &amp; wipe... throw my clothes on.. its that easy!</li>
    <li> This is excellent if you need some quick moisture, but not nearly thick enough to keep my very dry skin happy for very long. I usually use it if I need to be out the door quickly after I shower.</li>
    <li> My skin gets very dry, especially in the winter when the furnace is running.  I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on lotions over the years, without much success.  I bought this at Target on a whim &#x27;cause I liked the idea of a spray.  After reading the other reviews I seem to be the only one in love with this lotion.  I spray it on right after showering, barely have to rub it in, have had no problem with the can getting too slippery to hold, or my marble floor getting slippery, though I do stand on a bath rug when spraying.  My skin has never been so soft in my life, even my feet, &amp; it smells wonderful.  I have an additional benefit to share.  I started using this during the summer, when I swim &amp; tan a lot.  I think this lotion has helped maintain my tan, &#x27;cause it has not started fading at all, even though it&#x27;s been over a month since I was in the sun.  Other huge benefits are that it absorbs right in without leaving any slimey feel to my skin, &amp; does not irritate my legs to use it after shaving.  I love, love, love this product &amp; wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> This is fun and fast, but it does come out super cold.  So its hard to put on after a shower.</li>
    <li> Good, but probably better in an environment with a little more humidity. Here in dry Colorado? It&#x27;s good, but not great. Requires multiple applications compared to regular lotion.</li>
    <li> I am so unbelievably lazy. I hate putting on lotion, I find it to be such a chore and it is the LAST thing i want to do after a hot/relaxing shower. This product is a game changer... I barely even rub it in. It is so easy and convenient and worth every penny. Get it!</li>
    <li> I kept seeing this advertised and was really anxious to try it.  It was a disappointment.  I know it has to be thinner than regular lotion to be able to be sprayed, but it was very runny and did not work very well.</li>
    <li> I had been hoping and praying for a product that I could use that would be quick, wouldn&#x27;t make me breakout, or have an allergic reaction to. I was very pleased that this product checked all of those boxes! I can quickly apply the moisturizer before getting dressed and not have any problems with it being too wet or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it five stars, but as with any spray, I have a slippery build-up of the product on my bathroom floor. I&#x27;m afraid that it&#x27;s going to cause an accident if I do not immediately wipe it up which kind of defeats my desire for a quick product if I&#x27;m wiping up the floor. Perhaps it will get better as I get more used to spraying it and get better aim!</li>
    <li> Not as easy to apply as creams especially for the back. Nevertheless, its smell is amazing. I love that its quick to apply.</li>
    <li> Very poor value.  Saw 3-pkg. at Costco after I received for lease than I paid!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I thought this was going to spray out like Vaseline (since its by Vaseline) but it sprays more like a mousse. A bit of a let down but I guess that was my misunderstanding. It smells nice and a little goes a long way. Controlled spray so  it doesnt get all over everything around you. I wish it moisturized better though.</li>
    <li> I actually keep one of these in my car. It&#x27;s a great spray and go.... when you&#x27;re on the go! Plus, it smells great, goes on smooth (not greasy), and absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> I tried the cocoa butter Spray and Go Moisturizer, and loved how easily it went on, how quickly it dried and how moisturized my skin felt.  One downside, the bottle is small, at 6.5 oz it runs out quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion by far! I have super dry skin and this goes on fast and soaks in fast to give me smooth soft skin without the oily sticky mess of most other lotions. Love it</li>
    <li> I bought one for me and my brother-neither of us like it. It&#x27;s watered down lotion with something in it that causes dryness! My hands get so dry after using this!&lt;br /&gt;My brother found nothing good about it either!</li>
    <li> It sprays all over and makes the floor very slippery.. When you spray it on your body you still need to rub it in... I also do not like the fragrance... Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This spray on moisturizer isn&#x27;t exactly as described, but fine for me.  I tried two of the scents, this one and the aloe vera, and the smell is fresh and light on both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The convenience is great to spray on arms and legs, BUT you still have to rub it in.  So I don&#x27;t see the difference between this and regular moisturizer other than that you don&#x27;t have to use a pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one big perk: the moisturizer feels very cold, so great for after sun and swim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One possible perk:  if someone is disabled somehow, this may be helpful to spray on and apply without too much effort on the hands. I can see a caregiver using this on their charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A negative is that in terms of quantity, there seems to be less than a traditional bottle of lotion. And if you don&#x27;t rub it in immediately, it makes a gummy mess on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, I still love it.</li>
    <li> The scent is VERY strong.  And it has a strong alcohol component to it that burns in the nose a bit.  I tend to be a little bit more sensitive than most with these things, but this one seems excessive. It also doesn&#x27;t dry anywhere near as quickly as I thought it would.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have never used spray on lotion before, I might just be hooked!!! Sprays on so light and it&#x27;s so easy to use!!!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like oats or anything like that, it actually smells really feminine. my suggestion is smell this thing in store before purchasing online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I have psoriasis and was hoping it would be an easy way to apply moisture and it isn&#x27;t as oily as I had hopped) It depends what you&#x27;re looking for just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This spray smells great and is easy to use. It dries very quickly when you are in a hurry. Cool concept.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this stuff is great!  I find it to be convenient and the feel and scent are both great.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this and how it goes on. My skin is far too dry however and this only last for a few hours. I may be dehydrated.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say how well this works over time, but my skin feels more moisturized immediately after using it. It does absorb very quickly, but feels more substantial than other spray moisturizers (in a good way). I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t smell very pleasant due to the fact that the description doesn&#x27;t mention any scent, but it smells unobtrusively refreshing and any scent it leaves fades quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the easy that apply and moisture my skin in a few minutes  I recommend this product 100 %</li>
    <li> Terrible product. You can&#x27;t help spraying a large plume of product into the air. It contains parabens which are toxic to lungs. I could smell it on my breath for hours. Advise not to use around children.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this, but it tends to be a little thin in regards to moisturizing. I live in Fla and we need a little more in regards to dry skin. The smell was super nice.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - moisturizer that goes on easy and absorbs quickly. No sticky or filmy feeling. Moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I love this so so much!! It dries in seconds and it makes your legs or arms or where ever you spray it soft like you just put lotion on. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love that I don&#x27;t have to rub it in very much and doesn&#x27;t affect clothes when dress right after.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It moisturizes my skin without feeling oily. I&#x27;ve noticed that I get dressed faster because I&#x27;m spraying large areas of my body as oppose to drops of lotion that I put in my hands multiple times to cover my body. Great product that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Product is super easy to apply and dries very fast. The smell is very mild so both myself and my boyfriend can use it without him thinking he smells like a girl. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great for travelling or when you want to hurry and put on lotion.  Dries quickly and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Spray on is convenient but it needs to be done over a towel (so it doesn&#x27;t get all over the carpet or make the hard floor slippery). Easy to use. Pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I really like the convenience of the spray and it does absorb fast as stated in the ad. Not sticky but feels silky.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is the second order I have placed for more than one can. Usually 2 -6 in one order. I ALWAYS receive 1 can that does not work/spray at all. And yes, I turned the cap to expose the spray hole. The product is not returnable because &amp;#34;regulations&amp;#34; so I am just out the cost for an unusable can AGAIN! Very frustrating and just wrong that I cannot get a replacement. I will attempt to find a store locally to find this product in the future, so 1 can doesn&#x27;t in the end,  costing me the price for two.</li>
    <li> super product would buy again. goes on greaseless and rubs in super quick. I would definitly buy again....and again and again</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint is that the spray ends up spraying out a little too much, so there&#x27;s always a fair amount that winds up making the floor slippery.  Other than that, it is exactly as described and delivered in a timely manner. I have a sensitive nose and allergies, and nothing triggered any problems with that (so no noticeable perfumes).</li>
    <li> I live on the water and lots of sun. My skin is very dry because I am not good about using lotions. This meets my needs. I love the convenience, the ease of rubbing it in, etc. I bought 3 more. One for the deck, one for the car and one for guest bath. This product probably not the TLC my outdoor skin need, but if you are like me and hate rubbing all that lotion in, this may be for you.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a scent and it works great! You have to rub it in when you spray it so it is not a spray and go. When you do spray it it drys quickly and leaves a fresh washed scent. Fabulous!</li>
    <li> I liked the smell and it is easy to apply this moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anybody that doesn&#x27;t like to apply moisturizer by hand.</li>
    <li> There are several features I love about this. When you are rushing in the morning, you can just spray and go. It soaks right into your legs and arms and does not get in your clothes. Smells great. Then my skin feels so soft afterwards. This is a proactive approach to dry winter skin. I have stocked up for winter. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Please note that I do not have bad skin... However, I do have what you would call &amp;#34;oily skin&amp;#34; rather than dry skin.  When I used this product, it made me break out all over my legs and knees especially. Thinking this was a type of soap I was using or detergent, I didn&#x27;t think anything of it until I stopped using the lotion for one week.  Instantly the breaking out stopped.  After picking it back up and using it, I broke out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving it to my mother who has dry skin.  Still a lot of money for something that makes you break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 22 years old... Not even in &amp;#34;acne years&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Strong scent....moisture is not good for really dry areas but it is do convenient for those busy and on the go!  My college and high school students love it but would not recommend for anyone with dry skin and may want all day moisture.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I bought this product from Walmart, and did not read the instructions before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really understand the appeal. You have to rub it in. So why do you need the spray? Is this for people who hate lotion pumps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would work similarly to spray sunscreen. I use that all the time-- I spray it on and do not need to rub it in, or if so, not very much at all. This is no where near the same. You MUST rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought there would be two high points for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expectation: It&#x27;s faster than regular lotion because you just... spray and go.&lt;br /&gt;Reality: It&#x27;s not any faster, because you are still rubbing it in. It&#x27;s arguably even slower, depending on how much you accidentally get on the floor and bathroom wall, and how much time it takes to clean that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expectation: This will prevent me from getting my hands all lotiony when I do my legs, then my hair all weird when I style my hair with lotiony hands, then my face all weird when I put cream on my face, etc. (Am I the only person who struggles with this??)&lt;br /&gt;Reality: You still have to rub it in, so this solves none of those problems. (Again, I didn&#x27;t read the directions before I purchased at Walmart.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am baffled by the conversation I assume happened at Vaseline:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Let&#x27;s make a spray lotion!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;That&#x27;s awesome! That way you can do it with one hand!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Let&#x27;s not go crazy... they&#x27;ll still need to rub it in.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;What? I can&#x27;t hear you. You know, I think I&#x27;ll call it Spray and Go.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: It still gets three stars for being a working lotion, so is technically still useful in that regard. But the added value of it being a spray is nonexistent.</li>
    <li> quick and easy application.</li>
    <li> I should have believed the over reviews about the smell. Not my favorite. The ease is great - apparently I am too lazy to squeeze a bottle, it is much easier to spray, but it does coat the floor so I stand on a towel.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t really care for this product. it just felt heavy on my skin even though the product wasn&#x27;t heavy at all. I felt like i was spraying this product all over the place. you have to spray close to the skin but i didn&#x27;t like how it felt. It&#x27;s okay. I just wasnt a fan.</li>
    <li> Spray rubs in well, but tends to spray in a wider area, thus getting on things other than my legs and arms.</li>
    <li> Not messy at all if you&#x27;re careful. Quickly absorbs and lasts 24hrs. It&#x27;ll spoil you! It made my re-order list.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer smells like a high school girls locker room. For those not familiar with that particular smell, it is an odor combination of sunscreen and about ten different sickly sweet creams from The Body Shop. Gross. Secondly, it gave me a rash.Not a horrible one, but a rash nonetheless. And most importantly of all, it did not appear to do anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so easy and fast to use i use it everyday and there is still a lot of product inside. I use it on my daughter and even my husband who never wears lotion loves it.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary by influenster and I love it! its so easy and great for people on the go like me!</li>
    <li> This is the best !!! I put it on my legs wow what a difference !!!  For you see I am a Diabetic with Peripheral Neuropathy and Cellulitis of the legs when I put That Vaseline Spray on my legs felt good even helped with the pain.  Thank you Vaseline Company !!!  auntbea09 (From Maryland)</li>
    <li> Vaseline spray and go moisturizer is so much easier and quicker than regular lotion! Great for when your a busy person!</li>
    <li> I am always too busy to moisturize. I am a mother of 4 minor children and have a full time job.  I would rather sleep than spend extra time getting ready in the morning for work while getting my 5 year old ready too. But, this spray and go is a God sent!!! I was sacrificing moisturizing when i don&#x27;t have to, and i love this stuff. I keep it in the bathroom. After showering and drying off i spray it on, do a quick rub and I am ready to put clothes on.  I always wanted to apply a moisturizer i just never had the time and now i take 5-10 seconds a day and it works. My legs don&#x27;t look like the Mohave Desert anymore.</li>
    <li> Not only do I love this Vaseline Spray and Go for myself, but mostly... I bought this for my dad to use on his legs and feet. He is elderly and his feet and legs are dry and scaly and he&#x27;s just not able to go through the whole moisturizing routine for himself. And while this product really does need a little bit of effort, he&#x27;s been spraying it on his feet and legs after his showers and letting it soak in and dry without hardly any extra effort at all.. And I can totally tell a difference in his skin since he&#x27;s been using it. We love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Vaseline is another product I love and has used for years! I like this spray because you can spray rub and then go. Very easy and quick to use.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing my son after his bath or before bed was always chore.  He has dry skin, but he hated putting on lotion, and I hated applying it as much as he did.  Then, we found the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer.  No more sloppy thick lotion to apply.  I love this concept.  So does my son.  He is four, and he loves spritzing himself and a quick wipe and he is done!  It has become a fun activity thanks to this product.  Its easy for him to use, he has fun doing it, it takes the chore out of applying lotion, and the impact on his skin is great.  The lotion applies evenly, provides good moisture, and really works well.  I am glad they make this, and we will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this!  With it being so cold, I woke up this morning with my legs feeling dry and a little itchy.  I just spray a little on my legs, rubbed it in and moved on.  It has such a nice, pleasant smell that is not overpowering, which I really appreciate.  And anything with oatmeal does well for my skin. I like that it is non-greasy, so your hands do get moisturized as you spread it about, but it does not stick to your hands the way the creamy body lotions do. How convenient this invention is!  Wish it was around years ago.  Reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> Great product recommending it for patients to use right after shower. Easy to spray and hold in moisture great; good for the person who has a decreased range of motion especially and can&#x27;t reach low legs.</li>
    <li> As far as convenience, it&#x27;s exceptional. Unfortunately, it falls short when it comes to actually moisturizing - which is its whole purpose in the first place. That 3rd star? I was being generous.</li>
    <li> Easy fast , not oily on skin after applied. Nice smell would recommend to anyone. Try it and be suprised</li>
    <li> I have recommended this product to family members and friends. I also have auto shipment set up every other month so&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about The product cause if you can spread it on your skin the lotion must be very thin. However it does the job just like  the regular lotion, simply fast and easy. At first just want to use it for gym cause I am on the go but eventually use it when I am home cause it does moisturize my skin but without pumping spout and  spreading on my body.</li>
    <li> I am sure glad I came across this product!  If it&#x27;s just new to the world, it would be a great &amp;#34;Product of the Year&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s the only solution&lt;br /&gt;I have found to eliminate dry skin on my legs.  Just spray it on, rub it in, and away you go!  Truly, it is wonderful!  You can spray it into&lt;br /&gt;the palm of your hand if you would like, and apply it that way.  Sometimes it is impossible to hold a spray bottle in the upright position&lt;br /&gt;and spray, expecting it to go downwards onto your legs.  (My personal tip of the day.)</li>
    <li> The yellow spray can works better than any of the other choices. The others seem to dry the skin and leave it pasty.</li>
    <li> I saw this advertised on tv and was curious. It&#x27;s great! I use it right out of the shower. It gives you a light coat of moisturizer very quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife because of her diabetes has trouble with skin and she loves this stuff because it is easy to put on.  It is not messy and still keeps her skin  moisturized.</li>
    <li> Pretty much as advertised. Goes on almost instantly. I had expected it to be more of a spray. Instead it goes on in a stream, but it stays where it is aimed long enough to massage it into your skin, and you can get dressed immediately with no mess. This is a success.</li>
    <li> Contents are under pressure. Hard to use. Heavy Scent.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  I got it because I live alone and can&#x27;t reach my back.  I can just spray this on.  It smells good and works well as a moisturizer.  Glad I discovered it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that they come out with this wonderful product of Vaseline in a spray. I do recommend this. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Being a man I hate to put lotion on my body but during the winter months when the air is extremely dry it is quite necessary. This product is truly amazing and I am glad that I found it.</li>
    <li> No more messy lotion bottle with icky moisturizer plug in pump. Love it just for that alone. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a heavy moisturizer. This is a light moisturizer. It soaks in quickly and smells nice and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Not exactly spray and go..spray, rub in...and go perhaps.  I was curious how that would work..but thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyway.  The nice thing is it&#x27;s quick.  Pretty light so it doesn&#x27;t really make your hands all greasy or anything.  I like it...</li>
    <li> I saw the advertisement by vaseline on amazon and couldn&#x27;t stop laughing. I watched it over 10 times, and showed it to my family. Its definitely a spray and go lotion with a pleasant fragrance that lingers for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Was unsure how I&#x27;d feel about this product but I love it.  I use it for after the gym so I can get back to work.  Regular lotion sweats right back off but this was light enough that it soaked right in without leaving a greasy feeling or being too sticky to put clothing back on.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and was disappointed that the perfume smell lingers and lingers. This will definitely compete with the  perfume  I wear in the daytime.  I shouldn&#x27;t be smelling this lotion 2 hours after applying.  My husband was hoping to try this but couldn&#x27;t stand the way I smelled after applying it.  I would consider buying this again if they came out with one that is unscented.</li>
    <li> While I was hesitant at first, once I sprayed it on, all doubt was gone.  It is accurate in spray but goes on nicely.  It works great when I have to get ready in a pinch and I don&#x27;t have time to lather on regular body lotion from a tube.  You spray and go.  It is not greasy and goes on nicely.  I will be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like lotions.  I never have.  I don&#x27;t like the sticky feeling that stays on the skin.  I&#x27;ve just stayed away, until now.  These Spray &amp; Go moisturizers are lightweight, non sticky and dry so fast you have to check and make sure you even put it on in the first place!  They&#x27;re perfect!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I got it for free from influenster and have since made it my main moisturizer. It leaves my akin feeling fresh and smooth. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a huge difference from regular lotion but I prefer the spray. The smell is awesome and I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is a must-have.  I received it in my Influenster Vox Box for free, but will buy it in the future for sure! It is now my go-to lotion for daily use!  Even my husband is addicted.  I&#x27;ll go to look for it, and HE has it!  Sprays on easily.......dries quickly!</li>
    <li> I love anything that gives me more time in the morning to drink my coffee or watch youtube.  This is so easy to use! Just literally Spray &amp; Go! So great! I&#x27;m glad they came up with this!</li>
    <li> I received this Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.  My opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great I love how light it is and how easy it is to apply.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy which I like in a lotion.</li>
    <li> Love the Vaseline spray and go moisturiser. Got mine from Influenster and have been in love with it ever since. reduces the time needed to apply the moisturiser and the rub in afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love how quick and easy the application of this product is. I received this item free in the Sugar n Spice voxbox from Influenster. Just a quick spray and run then I&#x27;m out the door. It&#x27;s great on the go at the gym or on vacation as well! I would have given 5 starts if it were more moisturizing for sever dry skin. I have to apply extra to knees and elbows.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. Its easy to use and dries pretty quickly.  i am the type of person that doesnt like lotion on my body nor do i like it on my hands. but with this stuff i can actually use it. It absorbs really quick and doesnt leave that oily feeling behinde. also smells great!</li>
    <li> I loved thed Vaseline spray and go moisturizer.it was easy to spray on instead of having to keep squirting it out like other lotions.I could spray my whole leg then rub it around when im in a hurry and always on the go its so much easier and helpful.i also loved the smell.The moisturizer wasnt greasy and left my legs feeling smooth.I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Sprayand &amp; Go, very convenient for traveling because it contains a safe for spilling the product, the product is very well I have very dry legs and an all day kept moist personally I think that the adsorption is not as fast on my skin but is not greasy, when set skin feels great.&lt;br /&gt;is a arternativa for me in my daily use.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product at first but it&#x27;s actually pretty good!  It absorbs really quickly, even if it&#x27;s 80+ degrees out (where I live).  I like the smell and the packaging and it was really easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, the only junk thing is that it tends to stream a straight line of product onto my skin (instead of a spray).  This usually only happens during the first couple of seconds and evens out into a spray later so it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> I got one of these free from Influenster and I have to say I am a huge fan. I don&#x27;t know how it wasn&#x27;t thought of earlier. It sprays out into a fine mist that allows for you to cover your entire body quickly after a shower without having to stop and repump or have a huge glob of lotion in your hand. After getting the Vaseline Spray and Go Total Moisture free, I decide I wanted to try another variety as well so I bought the Vaseline Spray and Go Aloe Fresh and I do have to say I prefer that one over the original only because of the cooling sensation associated with the actual lotion. This one is great though, definitely worth picking up.</li>
    <li> I love how the Vaseline spray and go mosisturizer is easy to use and makes my skin feel refreshing. This is something i will switch to because of the easy to go and spray.</li>
    <li> I like the way Vaseline lotion smells, not to strong, not to weak.  The spray is light and the lotion sinks right into my skin.  I still have to rub it in so not sure I would choose the spray over the regular kind.</li>
    <li> Ever since the suntan lotions came out in a spray bottle, I&#x27;ve wanted an inexpensive lotion in the same format!  Answered!!!  I LOVE this product.  It sprays evenly and rubs in quickly without a greasy mess!  I will buy tons more of this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**received this product complimentary from Influenster, however all opinions are my own**</li>
    <li> This product applies lightly and evenly and is very easy to use. It smells great and offers superior packaging for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing. It is perfect for on the go and at work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received your Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I got this product complimentary from Influenster and at first I was excited about it.  I mean who wouldn&#x27;t want something to make the process easier to apply moisturizer.  I like the fact that you can spray the product, but that was it.  The coverage is average.  You spray and still have to wipe as I found the spray was more narrow focused rather than a wider spray.  Also it absorbed quickly, but my skin still felt dry a few hours later.  Compared to a lotion based moisturizer this one is just average.  It would be convienent to travel with or if you were in a hurry to get some moisture.  I gave it 3 stars because its not a horrible product just didn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
    <li> I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and it was requested that I write a review.  Honestly, I like the product. The commercial is a bit misleading, it does not absorb that fast, but it is faster than regular creams and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Love how lightweight this lotion is. Also love how it cools me down. Will def be my summertime go to lotion</li>
    <li> I received my Vaseline Spray &amp; Go complimentary from Influenster.com as part of my Sugar &#x27;N Spice VoxBox. I really liked this, I wish it was in the $4-$5 instead of $6, but I will probably only use this in the fall and winter as I live in a really humid state. Lotion in the spring and summer is just not needed. When I get out of the shower in the fall and winter, my legs and arms especially are really dry. The first night I git this after my shower, I applied this. Now I&#x27;m the type of person that applies lotion one limb at a time... You can&#x27;t do that with this. If you do your hands will be slippery and you&#x27;ll have a heck of a time pressing the nozzle down. But thats about. It smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t go on greasy. I just wish is was a dollar or so cheaper and bottle was easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;That is one thing I could say to Vaseline, if you&#x27;re listening, please put a grip on the bottle for us one limbers! lol&lt;br /&gt;I am also entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> Product goes on well, moisturizes, and smells lovely! You can spray it on, rub in, and put on your clothes in seconds!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product! It smells amazing, keeps my skin moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t feel me leaving sticky! I hate thick lotions and this is so light and fresh.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the fact that this is a spray and go product and the first of it&#x27;s kind. I like to spray it on right after I get out of the shower and let it soak in while I dry my hair. After this is done, I am ready to put my clothes right on! It locks in moisture too which is awesome! The spray feature may seem a little weird at first, but you will start to wonder how you lived without it!</li>
    <li> I got this lotion from the influenster voxbox for promotional purposes. I really like the scent and feel of this lotion. The fact that it comes in a spray is amazing - now I can get my back with no trouble at all PLUS I can use it upside down. awesome! I will definitely be purchasing this in the future - I would like to try the other scent too :)</li>
    <li> I really love how moisturizing this product is. It leaves my legs super soft &amp; shiny - which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative that I have found is that it&#x27;s not really \\&quot;Spray &amp; Go\\&quot;... yes, you spray it but you still have to blend it.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer in Total Moisture in my Influenster Voxbox.  Not only was this the favorite item in my box but it has quickly become my favorite moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this is so fun.  You just swipe the top to the side and press the top.  A fine mist emits onto your skin and lands light as a feather.  Rub the Spray and Go Moisturizer onto your skin with a few wipes and you&#x27;re good to go.  And I mean anywhere!  Slip into bed without getting your sheets all greasy, get ready for the morning, re hydrate your skin after a shower or after a swim in the pool.  There are so many great places this can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I&#x27;m towards the end of my bottle and I wish I had more.  I&#x27;d love to win the brand challenge with this review and get a few more bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++ for this!</li>
    <li> After using a boutique brand spray lotion for a couple years I found out about vaseline&#x27;s spray and go lotion by receiving a free sample through influenster&#x27;s voxbox program and I&#x27;m sold. I was paying $20 a can for a much smaller amount of a greasy lotion and this is fab!! Goes on easy, is non-greasy and smells great! A must have for all mom&#x27;s on the go!!</li>
    <li> I love this spray n go idea. It is easy, fast, fun, and convenient. Leaves my skin smooth and smelling good. Great buy people.</li>
    <li> Applying lotion after I shower is a part of my daily routine, &amp; so is waiting for it to dry. Not anymore, thanks to this wonderful product! I have seriously been telling everyone about it since i got in in my Sugar N Spice VoxBox! Added bonus: hold it upside down and beind you to add moisture to your back in those hard to reach areas!!!! GENIUS!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It absorbs very fast. It is very very moisturizing.  You can put clothes on right after and there is no transfer to worry about. I did receive the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> This product is good on the go. When stepping out of the shower, it is good to have something that you can just spray on and move around. It does not get on your hands so much. Which leaves your hands less greasy. However, I do not care for it to long time moisture. I have severe dry skin, I have to reapply for my skin to feel moisturized. Most people do not have this issue with their skin and I still recommend the product when you are on the go. I use it when I am on the run. Later I back it up with another product.</li>
    <li> I spray it on, rub in a little and I&#x27;m done. I like how it feels and its not greasy. The creams I just do not care for, I just don&#x27;t like taking the time to apply them and have never found one I really liked. The Oat type suits me, I love the scent. If you&#x27;re like me you sprayed on a light body spray after shower, with this you do not need to because of the light scent.</li>
    <li> I initially saw this product on a television commercial and immediately wanted to try it. So I was super excited when it was one of the items featured in my Sugar N Spice Voxbox through Influenster. I love the product it is so easy and convenient. It sprays on nice and even so you don&#x27;t have to worry about applying too much, and it does absorb pretty quickly. Wonderful scents and reasonable price:) I would def recommend trying.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff SO much!  It is SO easy and quick to use.  One thing that is a must and has to pass with me is the \\&quot;rub in test\\&quot;.  If a lotion takes forever to rub in, I don&#x27;t care how moisturizing or how good it smells, I just can&#x27;t deal.  This is light, yet very moisturizing and it totally past my \\&quot;rub in test\\&quot;.  I will happily recommend this to everyone.  I just hope to see more scents added to this line.  That would make me a very happy girl!</li>
    <li> I really loved this product.  It did not feel greasy on my skin and really made me feel moisturized.  The only recommendation I would make is to lower the price a little.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray on the go Moisturizer is a very awesome product, it moisturizes your skin as well as it drys fast enough for you to spray it on your whole body and then put your clothes on and not feel as sticky afterwards, it is a very neat product for busy parents.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! I have bought lotion and only use when dry skin but this makes it easy to use each and everyday.</li>
    <li> This lotion has replaced my previous moisturizing regimen. It is so easy- spray, rub and go! It dries immediately. I can put my clothes right on. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or sticky. Only downside, it&#x27;s cold once you spray it on. If Vaseline could make it with a warming ingredient, that would be awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this product to get up and go in the mornings... when you&#x27;re running late to work or school.. i was able to try out this product via Influenster and Vaseline Spray and go!! thank youu!!</li>
    <li> It was alright.I loved the smell and it did dry fast. But the moisture was just not enough for me. Id rather stick with regular lotion. Idk whether or not I would purchase this product. I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle from influenster.com( and entered into the brand challenge) I loved the smell of it as well as how fast it absorbed into your skin. I did notice that I had to reapply it more often that regular lotion. But it is a great product for when your on the go, or for a teen to throw into their locker at school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Vaseline Spray &amp; Go is an excellent lotion when your in a hurry or don&#x27;t want to gunk up your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if they could make it in a purse size, that would be amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works so good for my spring and summer skin. Its not sticky or anything like that. Spray and Go!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. ALSO, leaves my legs really soft after shaving. I definitely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> The convenience of this product is AMAZING.  The moisturizing level, not so much. I have EXTREMELY dry skin, and this just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.  My teenage son however, loves it!  (**I rec&#x27;d this product complementary via Influenster)</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is amazing just spray on, Absorbs quickly, does not feel greasy, dries quick so mornings are so much faster. I&#x27;m in love with this spray and go moisturizer my life is complete now!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster, I received a sample of this and love it! This is the perfect time saver in the mornings or even to stash in your gym bag!!</li>
    <li> This Spray and Go is great. You spray it on, rub your hand over it so it&#x27;s even and you can get dressed. You don&#x27;t feel wet, sticky or greasy. But you do feel soft and silky. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this I realized I would have to carefully apply since the mist would likely make my floor slippery. I applied while standing on a large rug but the mist really spread and a small amount ended up on my tile floor which turned my floor into a skating rink.  It was very hard to clean off the tile, too.  I felt like I was careful in my application and still couldn&#x27;t control the mist from making the floor slippery.  Use this with caution, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Original Review: Spray and Go was so easy to use. It sprays out in a fine mist that is easy to rub in and allows for all over coverage. Also had a very pleasant smell. The downside is, don&#x27;t use it while standing on tile or polished floors as the mist will make your floor slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited Review(after two weeks of use): I still don&#x27;t think it rates more than 3 stars. I saw no difference between this product &amp; any other lotion I&#x27;ve used (as far as softness and being a moisturizer) other than this one was \\&quot;easier\\&quot; to apply... and more expensive.</li>
    <li> I thought the spray would be more misty.  It&#x27;s not very \\&quot;spray &#x27;n&#x27; go\\&quot; at all, since you still have to rub it in, it takes the same amount of time it would if you were using lotion from a tube or jar.  My fault for believing the commercial and falling for a gimmick.  Also, it smells very much like hairspray and there is a slight sticky consistency to it.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great all over after a shower.  It dries fast and its not too greasy. My skin is super dry and I hate having to apply lotion everyday but I do and this makes it tons easier. It spells really nice too.&lt;br /&gt;I got mine complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> This is a amazing product to use for all skin types and easy. I love to use this product right after I take a shower.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely amazed at this product.  It&#x27;s easy and works great.  This gives the perfect amount of moisture for everyday use!  I especially like to use it on my legs after shaving.  Completely satisfied.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! It keeps my skin moisturized all day and does not leave it greasy! I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry skin,but is tired of the oily moisturizers! I received my Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Complimentary from Influenster..I am entering a brand challenge for a chance to win a prize!</li>
    <li> I love the continuous spray. It leaves me moisturized and smooth. It dries very fast and don&#x27;t have to worry about a sticky feeling.  I use it daily!</li>
    <li> It has a great fragrance and is super easy to use Im very busy with kids school and work so it was great to have a product that made it easy to moisturize on the go</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re in a hurry after your shower and don&#x27;t have time to wait for your moisturizer to be absorbed then this is a really great product. It sprays upside down, and doesn&#x27;t drip so you can even spray it on in the bathroom and rub it in as you&#x27;re running around getting dressed. There&#x27;s no sticky feeling, and it has a pleasant smell. There are just a few downsides. The first is that you have especially dry skin or problem areas like dry elbows or knees then you might need to spray it on a few times to get adequate softness. The other downside is the ingredients. There are some chemicals that I&#x27;d rather not be putting on my skin, so if you have allergies to certain chemicals or prefer a \\&quot;greener\\&quot; lifestyle then this probably isn&#x27;t for you. Overall, a good product and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I am not a fan of putting on lotion... at all. I hate it. I hate that I have to wait to put on clothes, I hate that it makes my hands and body all greasy, and I hate that it is really strongly scented and I have to wear the same perfume or forgo perfume altogether when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have to do any of that when I used this. I did not hate using it, it literally took under a minute to apply it, and then I was ready. The scent is not strong and does not clash with my perfume and I could get dressed right away. Maybe it isn&#x27;t the best for people whose skin is really dry and needs extra moisture, but this is great for every day use. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works great, smeels great, absorbs fast and moisturizes skin. I recieved  Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I tried this product through Influenster and am really impressed. I think the spray can has revolutionized beauty products - I for one am a HUGE fan of spray on sunscreens also. I like Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer because it is very quick, easy, and feels great on my skin. With it being around $6-7 and the availability of coupons out there, it is an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I recently received this product complimentary from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 1-star because that&#x27;s how many sprays I was able to get before it stopped working. Totally upset that the spray stopped. Now I have a full container of moisturizer, and not able to use it. Can&#x27;t get the top off. I bought it at Target, but didn&#x27;t think it would be fair to take it back there. The portion I was able to use, I loved it. The moisturizer is great. I&#x27;m really surprised that this company released a product like this.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the easiness of applying lotion this way before going out. Your skin doesnt feel sticky, but light and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I wish all lotion came in a spray like this! This makes my morning routine that much easier. Sprays well (I was expecting it to be like spray sunblock) and the lotion comes out thicker than I thought and is easy to rub in real quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside? It&#x27;s cold when it comes out, so be prepared!</li>
    <li> I was really very wary of this product when I received it from Influenster.com but I can truly say that my day would not be complete without it! My spray and go sits on my desk at work! It is great! This product sprays on nicely and absorbs quickly. I absolutely love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so convenient for the office and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands wet or oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Influenster.com for allowing my to try this product free! I hope I can win the brand challenge you have set up for me! Wonder if I can snag one of the great prizes!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go moisturizer, because I hate waiting for my skin to dry before putting clothes on when I&#x27;m on the run.  I&#x27;m a mama of a toddler, so time is always of the essence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, Vaseline does provide a very quality product.  Though, I think this lotion would be more ideal for summer months than winter, because I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s thick enough to really moisturize some of the rougher, dryer skin patches that one obtains during the winter months.  But the smell is nice and light, and it does stand true its word - it dries quickly, leaving skin smooth and non-greasy.  The spray isn&#x27;t too bad either, though I did feel a little bit didn&#x27;t make it onto my legs, thus making my bathroom floor a little slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this is a pretty good product, and would use it again.  But for the winters, I think I&#x27;ll stock up on a different, thicker product, and save this for the warmer weather.</li>
    <li> As a person who hates to touch her feet, I love this because I can spray it on them, let it dry and be finished.  However, for all other areas, the spray can be very cold and uncomfortable and I&#x27;m pretty certain that the floor gets just as moisturized as my body.  It&#x27;s nice for some things but I don&#x27; like it any more than any regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I rate Vaseline spray and go moisturizers  a 10 because it&#x27;s really fast you spraying it on and out the door. I love the smell and texture it feel silky I really really enjoy using it everyday</li>
    <li> I totally love this product. I doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy and there is really no excuse not to moisturize anymore. The only aspect of their marketing that I don&#x27;t agree with is getting dressed right after. I would still wait a couple minutes before putting your clothes on so you don&#x27;t have that stuck to your clothes feeling.</li>
    <li> I have received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. I am currently using this product on a daily basis. I love it. It is easy to use and smells great too. My skin feels softer since I have been using it on a daily basis. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love how quick and effective this product was.  I enjoyed the fast application while getting ready in the morning. It was an accommodation for sure. I highly recommend this product especially in the summer where this spray will feel great when it&#x27;s hot!</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer to try out, for free, in my Sugar &#x27;n Spice VoxBox from Influenster! I&#x27;m writing my review, in hopes of winning a brand challenge! I was beyond thrilled to try this product out! I kept passing it in the store, and telling myself I&#x27;d wait for a coupon, lol. So, here&#x27;s the good... this is a nice, light moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and left my skin feeling soft, not greasy. I love that it comes in spray form because it is easy to cover a lot of surface area quickly! The price isn&#x27;t bad either. The bad... not the greatest smelling product. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, I just like a little more fragrance in my lotion. And finally, the ugly... DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT use this product without a towel under you or use it outside. (which, I mean, I don&#x27;t often apply lotion while I&#x27;m outside. It&#x27;s usually when I get out of the shower! So, go with a towel!) You will inevitably get lotion on the floor wherever you are standing-- I wasn&#x27;t thinking the first time I used this &amp; about broke my neck, slipping on it! Be careful &amp; lotion on!</li>
    <li> I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. With all that stuff out of the way... I truly like this product and will purchase it in the future. It is so easy to spray on my way out of the house. I don&#x27;t have to worry about squeezing product to the end of the bottle or making a mess by dripping. I literally just spray and go. Great for moms on the go!</li>
    <li> I received this in my Influenster VoxBox and was pretty excited to try it out, plus I could win something from them for my reviews. I absolutely love how easy it is to apply, and rub in, plus there is like no dry time. I would apply it on one leg and by the time I was done with the other one, like 30 secs or so, the first was dry. It&#x27;s not sticky either, like some lotions can be. The biggest downfall for me is that it is relatively expensive for the size bottle you get. Plus, for someone like me who has really dry skin it is not as moisturizing as I need. I do like the idea and the product is good, but the price and the fact that I need a more heavy duty lotion, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase it on my own.</li>
    <li> I actually received a complimentary, full sized sample of this product to sample and review--I hadn&#x27;t really heard of it before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect....and since I didn&#x27;t request it, I wasn&#x27;t sure that I needed it.  Now--I&#x27;m a little addicted to the convenience of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My middle daughter has battled eczema bouts and dry skin since she was a baby.  Her condition has improved--and we rarely need prescription creams these days--but, there are times that she needs lotion on an almost daily basis for a bit.  Honestly, the whole family needs moisturizing lotions from time to time--not as often as our middle one--but, often enough.  (Especially in our dry, Ohio winters!) I HATE putting on \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; lotion. I rarely do it for myself (and I should)--and, it&#x27;s just inconvenient for little ones past the baby stage! It&#x27;s greasy, it&#x27;s hard to rub in and it takes time to absorb so that clothes can be thrown over it.  Most of the time, in our busy days, when I realize we need lotion--it&#x27;s right before bed or I&#x27;m noticing on the way out the door.  I&#x27;m now a valid fan of Vaseline Spray and Go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You literally can spray it on, lightly rub it in--and GO.  I don&#x27;t have to scrub my hands after applying it...there is little residue on my hands and the kids (and I) can immediately dress without \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; our clothes to the lotion.  I don&#x27;t have to rub and squeeze and try to find \\&quot;other places\\&quot; for the lotion to absorb.  The spray nozzle delivers a great amount for the area.  It has a light fragrance (that I actually like) that doesn&#x27;t send my migraines or my youngest daughter&#x27;s asthma into overdrive.  And--it moisturizes as we would expect.  We love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree that the \\&quot;over-spray\\&quot; will make hard floors/tile floors slippery--so avoid applying it without putting down a towel first to catch the overspray.  From an environmental standpoint--I&#x27;m not generally a fan of aerosol type, convenience sprays--but, because we use this only as needed--I think I can rationalize it for its overall value to my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a free sample as a member of Influenster, as I mentioned--but, I wasn&#x27;t required to review it here--I just really wanted to share my opinions.  It works for my family and I wanted to share our experiences.</li>
    <li> This product is from the great Vaseline brand so it is a great product - easy to use, fast drying and very useful for reaching those hard to reach places.  Also provides long lasting moisture for healthy looking skin.</li>
    <li> As mi title says quick &amp; easy to use and dry&#x27;s as fast as you can put it on i love how easy is to apply i mainly use it when i shave my legs love the feel of the spray in my skin Vaseline always does it better :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not better than the other moisturizers from Vaseline but i like the idea of spraying the product on the go..very practical for busy people like me.. will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of the product literally spray and go and while wearing a skirt or a pair of shorts its awesome to just spray my legs and run out the door .... do I still run my hands over my legs to ensure its equally distributed yes I do but as a touch up during the day its awesome!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I was a bit leary at first, but after I tried it... my skin felt soft and supple. Usually I would have to reapply lotion after a couple hours cause my skin started to feel dry. Not with this. Not only does this SMELL amazing, but it&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s SO easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST TRY IT!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, is quick and easy it dries immediately. I can get dress without having my clothes feel sticky and no pump or mess usually with other lotions you have to keep pumping the bottle and sometimes it gets everywhere, I love this I just spray where I need it and how much, I can&#x27;t wait to try more from this collection, perfect I used it after shaving my legs no irritation it makes my skin so soft and moisturized it smells great too.</li>
    <li> I liked the convenience.  It seemed the application was a little faster than traditional squeeze lotions.  But you still need to rub it in.  Although impressed that it is generated by compressed air, you can get a lot more squeeze lotion for the same price.</li>
    <li> I hate the feeling of lotion as it absorbs. I hate it so much that I rarely use it! This stuff changed my life. It dries so fast; now I have no excuse! Not to mention it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I have a found my new favorite lotion! Easily spray this on, rub it in and you are good to go. It dries super fast and smells great! I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I got a full sample of this in my voxbox from influenster, and I have to say I love it.  It is so easy to use and drys quickly.</li>
    <li> I was sent a sample of this to review from Influenster.  I used it and I thought that it was nice at first.  After about an hour my skin had soaked it up and was beginning to show signs of dryness again.  My skin is extremely dry so it could just be that and not the product.  I did like the scent and the feel of it however.</li>
    <li> I like the convenience of the packaging and the idea behind the product, but I don&#x27;t feel like it moisturized as well as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
    <li> I loved this spray and go moisturizer!!! It&#x27;s so convenient smells great and saves time!!! Everyone must try this!!! This product is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the free sample of the spray and go lotion I received from Influenster. I love the scent and the way it almost instantly dried on my skin! I get out of the shower, lotion up and can get dressed right way. No waiting for any lotions to dry! Love it!</li>
    <li> I am seriously in love with this stuff! I love the scent, the formula and the convenience of it being a spray! It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling or residue. I will continue to purchase this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer was given to me complimentary from Influenster I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, and it is travel size.  I will try the others soon.</li>
    <li> This couldn&#x27;t have come at better time in my life, when I am ready to do a lot of traveling.  Its so easy to use not greasy and a great time saver.  I recommend to everyone, if they can afford it, price is a little steep.</li>
    <li> I am IN LOVE with this lotion! I&#x27;m 33 and NEVER use lotion because I HATE the greasy or sticky feel it leaves on my hands.  With the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer I never had to worry about that again!! This is THE first product that I have found in 30 years that doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty feel on my skin.  It comes in a spray bottle, so all you have to do is aim and spray quickly over your skin up and down your arms and legs, spread it over the entire skin, and it dries completely in about 10 seconds.  I use mine after the shower, spray and get dressed without wasting any extra time. I love the smell. It doesn&#x27;t have a distinct smell to me, just that it smells good and is not overpowering at all. I have allergies, so that is also important to me.  Plus I work in healthcare, which prohibits strong fragrances.  The best part is that it leaves your skin so soft! I was amazed how soft it left my skin! As you can see, it costs about $5 bottle and I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months already, so I&#x27;m willing to pay more for these VERY important things. There is definitely magic in that bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster to review.</li>
    <li> I use lotion everyday. My skin always feels so dry and it is like I can never get enough lotion on myself to keep my skin moisturized. So many of the lotions I have tried feel greasy and dry up in no time, leaving me feeling like I need even more! I was a little hesitant about this stuff because a spray seemed weird. I like to think of it like spray sun block, which is about what consistency it has. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful smell. I love the smell and sometimes just pick up the lotion to smell it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by how smooth the lotion felt when I began to rub it onto my legs. It does not feel greasy AT ALL! Instead, it feels so full of moisture, it is almost like rubbing water on your skin. It leaves them feeling very nourished. And the cool thing is that it dries so fast! You can get dressed in literally seconds. Its not sticky at all either! This stuff is a miracle product! I love to use it on my hands as well, it just  makes them feel so moist and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite lotion! I don&#x27;t think I will even bother with the old greasy stuff anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  *  *&lt;br /&gt;I received this Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m hoping to win the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> The concept is great but for me I felt it was a little dry. Discloser: I received this Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and  I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> The convenience of the Spray and Go Moisturizer is great! It dries quickly and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I also enjoyed the scent which was soft &amp; clean making it easy to layer with other fragrances. The only thing I somewhat disliked was the moisturizing power. I felt like I had to spray a couple of times to get the amount desired that I needed for my skin, perhaps the cocoa butter might be a better option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! Made moisturizing after my shower a breeze. The smell is amazing and it left my skin feeling amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer, courtesy of Influenster, and was really impressed with the ease of application. The smell was also great - very clean (and who doesn&#x27;t like vanilla?) However, I noticed that after shaving, my legs started getting bumps, from a lack of moisture. Its common, but I found that my baby lotion is the only true cure for those bumps (other than exfoliating). Although I will not make this product my everyday go-to, I will purchase for travel or the beach b/c of the easy of application. The product goes on fast with an even spray and dries surprisingly fast - no stick/tacky feeling at all.</li>
    <li> this stuff is supper easy to use. I love it but it gets all over my carpet when I spray it on my legs.</li>
    <li> I recieved this from Influenster for testing and I love it. It is non greasy and quickly absorbs into my skin. It&#x27;s light for summer and smells great. I have already bought two cans and have gotten my husband to use it.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product complementary through the Influenster Vox Box program. I really enjoyed this product on the days where time was an issue. I don&#x27;t feel like it moisturized as well as traditional lotions/moisturizers but it got the job done when I needed it to. I had a few issues with the spray nozzle not wanting to stay unlocked during application and I also found that I had some trouble holding onto the bottle after application to another area. All in all, I would like to keep this product around my house &#x27;just in case&#x27; because it is REALLY handy.</li>
    <li> I was excited when this item debuted right in time for summer.  I hate putting on a heavy sticky lotion and making sure there&#x27;s enough time for it to absorb completely before getting dressed.  I live in the hot and humid South so waiting for full absorption can take a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is definitely spray and go.  It absorbs pretty much immediately.  My two issues with it are that 1) I don&#x27;t particularly like the spray aspect as I feel like I&#x27;m always getting lotion everywhere except where I want it and 2) it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  I could deal with the relatively short effects if I had a different application method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most likely won&#x27;t buy again unless they offer this in a non-spray form.  That&#x27;s just my personal preference though.</li>
    <li> I must say I really love this stuff! Spray and go, its that simple!! I always seem to be in a hurry and this product is right up my alley. It leaves your skin smooth and has a great fragrance. Forget the thick greasy lotion and try out this light, pleasant moisturizer! *I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering a Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the go, so this is perfect for me.  doesnt take a long time to rub in which is a good thing</li>
    <li> I was worried about scent and sticky feeling. but scent is what I like.&lt;br /&gt;when you rub few seconds, skin absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This is an easy moisturizer to use.  The spray is so easy to apply.  You have to rub it in after you spray it on.  It is not just a spray on and leave there moisturizer.  In years past there was a Neutrogena Dry Oil that I loved but they stopped making it. I was hoping that the Vaseline Spray would be similar but it is not. I still like it better than regular lotion. It is quicker than regular lotion.</li>
    <li> The Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer is a spray based system that aims at giving consumers a fast and easy way to moisturize.  I wasn&#x27;t aware that the old fashioned products were so inconvenient, but my wife assures me that they in fact are!  This product goes on easily, much like a spray on sun screen does, and then has to be gently rubbed into the skin.  It leaves skin feeling softer and only leaves behind the faintest traces of a greasy or oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to consider is that this moisturizer has a scent which seems to linger for a long time and as such women who wear any perfume on top of it might not like the way the combination smells.  The scent itself is pleasant, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that doesn&#x27;t have a lingering scent you&#x27;ll want to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this one a try rating, especially if you&#x27;re in a cold and dry climate like we are now here in Chicago.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and seems to do the job of moisturizing quite well.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found for busy people, Spray and go.  Saw it advertised on tv, does all it claims to.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Item is just as described!</li>
    <li> I got this for my fianc&amp;eacute; as a stocking stuffer -- she&#x27;s been looking to get it for a while.  After a couple months here&#x27;s the feedback...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The stream is not adjustable.  She was expecting a bit more of a mist like the spray-on sunblock, but it actually sprays more of a stream which you then have to rub on.  It&#x27;s not unusable or anything, but it wasn&#x27;t what she was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) She HATES cold lotion.  We live in the northeast, and in the wintertime everything gets cold.  The worst is rubbing on cold lotion.  Because its spray-on, there&#x27;s no way to pre-warm it in your hand so it sprays on cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, thats not to say there are inherent flaws in the product -- I think it just wasn&#x27;t what she was expecting and she&#x27;s pretty much stopped using it.</li>
    <li> First of the price is way to high for this product, and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin like it says. And after a few sprays the can is empty cause you have to use almost the whole can to moisturize your body! It&#x27;s just not worth price I&#x27;d set the value at $3.29 cents.</li>
    <li> I received this in one of my Influenster Boxes and I fell in love with it. It sprays on so easily and quickly, smells great, and absorbs so quick into my skin. It leaves my skin feeling fresh,smooth, soft and moisturized. I love the consistency of the product. I have tried all three fragrances and my favorite is the Aloe. It smells really fresh and clean. I am hoping they make it in a travel size! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love for my legs to shine in my short shorts in the summer. Thank God for this product. It&#x27;s non greasy and it leaves my legs feeling smooth. I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> Influenster sent me this product, and I think it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m really lazy about putting lotion on my legs(don&#x27;t judge me) and this spray makes it really quick and easy. It dries quicker than a regular lotion, which is what I like about it. It took about a week to notice a difference in my skin, but now it&#x27;s really soft. I recommend it to all the lazy people out there! It&#x27;s now a staple in my after shower routine.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product! It&#x27;s very easy to use and smells great. The only warning I have is that it is not too fine of a mist that you can get away without rubbing it in. Like any other lotion, you have to make sure it absorbs into your skin (vs. a true mist).</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s amazingly soft and moisturizing and goes on so fast! Great for any busy mom on the go!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Vaseline spray and go! It makes your skin feel so silky soft and leave an amazing glow.&lt;br /&gt;Got if for free from  inflenster.com</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff for every day moisturizing. It goes on faster than typical lotion because of the spray bottle and is light enough that I never feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The only challenge that I have had is holding on to the bottle while spraying after I&#x27;ve rubbed in some of the lotion, but you get used to it/figure it out.</li>
    <li> My husband and I share this and it is super easy to use.  Just spray and rub in.  It leaves your skin moisturized which was amazing to me at first.  It also quickly absorbs into your skin leaving it soft!  Definitely will purchase once we run out and can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.  Thanks you influenster for giving me this complimentary sample to try out!</li>
    <li> I received a courtesy sample of Vaseline Spray and Go from Influenster and at first I was a little unsure about the moisturizing effects since I am used to my good old fashioned lotion/oils. Boy, was I wrong! It is very easy to apply- just spray and rub in. There is no greasy after effect and you stay moisturized all day long. The only problem I have now is figuring out a way of keeping my husband from continuously stealing my Vaseline Spray and Go.</li>
    <li> super fast easy.smell great.....love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received your Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> This lotion is such an awesome idea! It works great and is so easy to use without all the mess. I got a can free from Infulenster in my VoxBox and when I tried it was sooo happy with the results and couldn&#x27;t believe how simple and easy to use that it was. Best Lotion Ever...oh and it smells fantastic too!</li>
    <li> I am usually rushed after showers and this product cuts my moisturizing time in more than half!!! Isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t come off on clothes, and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from Influenster to review. I have a lot of allergies, so I didn&#x27;t really like the scent. It actually made me cough because it was so strong! It was easier to apply and faster to apply than other lotions, but it is also more expensive. I don&#x27;t feel like it really saves that much time. I might be more inclined to use it more if it came in unscented or a lighter scent.</li>
    <li> I received your Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. I was very pleased how the Spray and Go was true to it&#x27;s name..just spray and go! Less drying time and non greasy to the touch. It saves time getting ready in the mornings and it&#x27;s so much easier to apply to my back with just a few sprays. I&#x27;ve been using it after my baths and after returning from the beach and Vaseline Spray and Go is really helping me maintain my healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it, but it has become an essential in my morning routine. It is quick, easy, and the product doesn&#x27;t make your hands feel oily. It is very user friendly, just spray... and go.

    <li> I recieved this from Influenster.com for free to try. I love the way it makes my skin so soft and non greasy. I have and I will recomend this to my friendsd and family. I am entering for the brand challenge for a prize. Thank you Influenster!</li>
    <li> I was given a bottle of Vaseline Spray and Go Moinsturizer from Influenster.com and have enjoyed using the lotion. It has made it easy to get dressed without leaving a sticky residue behind or sticking to your clothes. I wasn&#x27;t paid or compensated for my review and I&#x27;m doing this on my own will letting you know that this is worth buying. The price is good and the quality is great!</li>
    <li> I tried the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer and I love it. I am constantly moisturizing because I have very dry skin. I&#x27;ve been on a few trips in the past month that kept me outside and on the go. Luckily I carry a pretty big bag so I just tossed it in. After we left the beach and washed off we still had stuff to do before heading back to the hotel so I didn&#x27;t want my skin to dry up from the ocean water and sun. I would dry my legs off, spray it on, rub it in a bit, and keep going. It really is good for on the go days especially vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize***</li>
    <li> received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster i&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. Loved trying out this product it was so easy to use just spray and gently rub in very quick. Lately i have been having very dry , itchy, red skin and tried all sorts of lotions and none of them helped my skin until i tried this it really helped the itch go away and made my skin feel smooth and soft and on top of that it smelled wonderful :)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Vaseline Spray and Go from Influenter.com. And I really love it. I use it on my legs and arms. It is great right after a shower. And I also like it after I shave. It is so fast and easy to use. And doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling. I have been using it so much I think I am almost out of it. So I will definitely be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 13 year old daughter has been using mine also, and wants me to buy her a new bottle of it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disclosure: I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;Besides getting it free I actually love this moisturizer. I use it on myself as well as my 3 year old son. He gets really dry skin patches and hates putting on lotion. This actually made it fun for him since i could spray it on and make smiley faces and shapes. He even said it tickled and his dry skin doesnt bother him after applying it. The fact it makes traveling with lotion easier is also a big plus, no more messes in my bags. The smell of it is also very good. I cant wait to try the other scents.</li>
    <li> I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;Really enjoy this product! Fast and easy, absords crazy fast! Has a pleasant smell and leaves you moisturized! I bought several bottles...one for home, one for travel and I gave one to my husband believe it or not! He is a plumber with very dry skin and needs something fast and easy to apply while on the job. (Hoping they come out with a more manly scent for him LOL)</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Vaseline brand lotion and have been for a while. So when I received a complimentary Spray and Go from Influenster, I was super excited. I have little time to get ready during the day, but moisturize regularly. The product was easy to apply. There is a good size area that the stream covers. However, I am dissappointed with the formula. It didn&#x27;t give me the same moisture effect as the rest of Vaseline products I have tried. I am not sure if it had to be changed to put into aerosol format, but it wasn&#x27;t a few hours later before my skin begged for more lotion. So overall, the product is okay but I won&#x27;t be buying it.</li>
    <li> This product is easy for on the go and when you are in a hurry. i love sticking this product in my purse and heading out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about the lotions I use because a lot of them are either greasy, slimy or just don&#x27;t moisturize well.  I used the Vaseline Spray-n-go when I went out in Atlantic City with some girlfriends on Saturday night and was pleasantly surprised that my legs didn&#x27;t feel coated in grease and the ugly, scaly texture didn&#x27;t return while we were out!</li>
    <li> Prevent meltdowns with this moisturizer. Light moisturizer not greasy at all, and smells great. Spray evenly, rub in, and flaunt. This is Perfect for spraying when wearing shorts &amp; skirts. I received this free in my voxbox from Influenster.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I received this Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry, sensitive skin and gave up on moisturizer after trying everything.  Lotions either burned and made my dry skin red and irritated, or left me feeling greasy and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this spray moisturizer, I have seen the light!  This product is amazing.  It dried and absorbed in 30 to 60 seconds.  I was impressed, but it doesn&#x27;t stop there!  The formula is so lightweight, I didn&#x27;t even feel like I was wearing lotion.  Not greasy AT ALL!  It made my skin so soft.  I am happy to say I will be using Vasaline Spray and Go again and again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I modeled in a fashion show recently and all the models used this product.  Everyone was raving about it and I was able to give my review.  A must-have.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is perfect for when you need to get ready fast. I kept mine in the shower. Application is super fast and it dries so quickly you can put your clothes on straight away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this spray lotion. I rather lather and splatter than spray n go lol. I didn&#x27;t get the moisture I was looking for with this product.I felt like it dried my skin out.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of the use of this product. It dries so fast, but yet my skin stays incredible soft. I love that my hands aren&#x27;t all greasy after application, too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it works so well and I love the scent I definetly recommend it dries quick moisturize great! Vaseline is just a really good brand in general</li>
    <li> I received Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer free through Influenster and I couldn&#x27;t possibly love it more!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely something that I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered buying had I not tried it, but now that I have it&#x27;s the only lotion I want to use.&lt;br /&gt;The top turns to allow you to spray it or close it which I love because it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pop open\\&quot; like my other lotions and spill all over the inside of my purse.&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely non-greasy! I just sprayed it on my arms and legs, rubbed it in and now I&#x27;m typing on my laptop which I would never be able to do with any other moisturizer, I&#x27;d HAVE to wash my hands first!&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff! Try it!</li>
    <li> I got this product from Influenster VoxBox and love it. It comes out in a fine mist and just rubs right into your skin. It has a nice neutral smell. I would defiantly recommend this. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about how quickly they stated it would soak in, as well as how well it would actually moisturize. But, I was pleasantly surprised. It works well. Super easy to apply! Just spray, a quick rub in, and dress. It did quite well with my dry as dust skin, too. We&#x27;ve already started getting 80 degree temps and it&#x27;s holding up well in the heat. Don&#x27;t know how they did it, but it works! Would definitely recommend! Especially, for those of us who usually end up going without moisturization (and regretting it) because of lack of time.</li>
    <li> I love Vaseline Spray &amp; Go - it&#x27;s a hit with my 7 year old as well. This product is so easy to use and I love that it&#x27;s fast drying and not sticky. Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a sample of Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> The lotion comes out as a semi-liquid, and is white so you know where you sprayed it. The lotion smells really good, a nice flowery powdery smell. It left my skin feeling silky smooth and it really did just take a couple of seconds to disappear. Now it did take a little longer to really absorb and I was left with a sort of \\&quot;wet\\&quot; feeling for a bit. Other than that it works perfectly especially for when you need it quickly. So why use this instead of traditional lotion in a bottle? Well thats a harder question to answer - but one major upside is the continuous spray. It eliminates that time when you have to stop and get more lotion to apply. Especially those times when your lotion bottle is almost empty and you have to shake it up and down to try and get the lotion moving down.  Overall its a great alternative to the traditional lotion and really handy to have around. I received this from Influenster to try out and review.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle of Vaseline Spray and Go from SugarnSpice Vox Box and usually I&#x27;m pretty lazy when it comes to lotions/moisturizers.. Like, I don&#x27;t really use them too much. But, this spray and go makes it simple, and easy. It sprays a fine mist and you rub it really quickly and you&#x27;re done. Kind of awesome. Be careful if you&#x27;re wearing flip flops and spraying downward.. I got some on my actual flip flop -- slippery suckers! Love this lotion.. Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. So easy and convenient to use. It does a great job moisturizing And it smells AMAZING!!! Reminds me of tanning. :)</li>
    <li> Its a great idea. If you spray every where first! I sprayed one leg then rubbed in, went to go spray the other leg and I couldn&#x27;t hold onto the bottle! It was a pain. It soaked in fine to my leg, not my hands. It was frustrating. So I sprayed every where first, but that was not a great feeling, and of course some of it dried before I could rub in evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Idea, but not for me. I also found that it isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for my skin. I do like that it is air powered and not aerosol but does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> Probably one of my favorite lotions. Its super easy to use, &amp; it dries super quick. Its really good for on the go.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the spray on lotion concept. Vaseline has really outdone themselves with this new product. My daughters and I really like to use this after showering to get the full effect. I recommend this if you&#x27;re not the type to moisturize, after using it once you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have very sensitive legs/skin and I couldn&#x27;t find a lotion that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin then I tried this stuff and it did not irritate my skin or anything. I finally found something I can actually put on my legs. This is the only stuff I will buy. It smells good and I like the way it sprays on. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am 100% in love with this spray! I received it as part of a free product trial and I honestly have nothing bad to say.</li>
    <li> Love this product from Vaseline. It goes on easy and smooth drys really quick so you can get dressed sooner. The best way to apply lotion hands down .</li>
    <li> its so easy to use, just spray and go!! i will repurchase, love this so much! you can take it with you everywhere and its so easy to use</li>
    <li> Products smells great and is not greasy!! And I love that I can spray it on, rub it in and walk away!!</li>
    <li> perfect for on the go and after the sun. smells good, feel soft but not oily or greasy. i will definitely buy again and again. Best lotion I&#x27;ve used in a while for the best price</li>
    <li> I love the concept of this product. After all, we&#x27;ve been spraying sunscreen on this way for years, why didn&#x27;t someone come up with spray lotion sooner? It goes on quick and easy and dries so quickly. I found it to leave my skin moisturized and I loved the smell. However...if you have sensitive skin like me, you may have to stay away. It was fine on the bottom of my feet and my hands but if I put it on anywhere else, it made me itch, especially after I had shaved my legs. Keeping my fingers crossed they come out with a variety that even those with the most sensitive skin can use.</li>
    <li> i received this product from influenster and I must say it is great I didn&#x27;t get no oily residue I literally just sprayed and went well I rubbed for a quick second but this stuff is amazing and it really helped my dry skin</li>
    <li> I am always on the go and cause I am so busy, my skin is always dehydrated and dry! I received this from Influenster and it has been a doozy applying lotion. I still have to rub it into my skin after I spray, but the application is more evenly spread out and the scent is pleasant. I can&#x27;t wait for other scents to come out in the spray bottle! The lotion seems kinda watery, but it definitely hydrates my skin and for a while too! Vaseline is awesome. Thanks for another great product!!!</li>
    <li> I received a can of  Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Total Moisture formula free to review from Influenter. I am very happy with it, and I will definitely be purchasing the other formulas soon. I keep my can sitting on my bathroom vanity, and it&#x27;s the first thing I grab after I dry off from the shower. It absorbs almost instantly, without feeling greasy or sticky. Definitely work the price in my opinion, I hope to see Vaseline release more formulas to the line in the future.</li>
    <li> There are 4 girls in my house so let me tell you that we never find something that we all love. Well, this was the one things we all fell in love with. We have had to buy more so that everyone has their own.</li>
    <li> My kids love this because they dont feel sticky they hate lotion because they say it feels sticky and they get itchy but this vaseline spray is perfect they love it since they dont feel that they have lotion on :)</li>
    <li> Wish this was made sooner.  Perfect for everyone.  Quickly spray, rub in and go.  Not oily or sticky feeling when putting on your clothes.  This is a must for all women!</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT! A MUST PURCHASE IT SMELLS GREAT AND IT DOESNT LEAVE AN OIL RESIDUE AND ITS SO EASY TO USE</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this product! It is so easy to use, just point and spray. I am able to reach my back and the back of my legs easily. It absorbs quickly and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or watery. It works very well too. I am also in love with the smell of it!&lt;br /&gt;I have been telling everybody about this, it&#x27;s brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I recently got the chance to try from Influenster.com and Vaseline complimentary the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer in Total Moisture. I have been using this for a while and it is my go to for getting ready in the morning for fast and easy moisturization!! I like the fact that it dries pretty fast!! Great for getting ready in a pinch!! You do however have to use alot of it to feel moisturized.. I do not really like the smell of it, although it is not horribly smelling it is tolerable, I just would like it to smell a little better. But overall I do like this product!!</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline Spray and Go in my Sugar &#x27;n Spice VoxBox from Influenster and... OH WOW do I LOVE this product! I was a little wary of it because it was a spray moisturizer and wasn&#x27;t convinced it could do much for my skin. But I was wrong! My skin is SO soft after using this product! And it&#x27;s so fast &amp; easy to use! I doubt I will go back to other moisturizers in the future! Way to go, Vaseline!</li>
    <li> I was not sure whether or not I would like this product......I loved it!!  Sprays on easy with no greasy mess.  Smells divine....a winner in my book!!</li>
    <li> This is great. I love the ease of putting it on. And it never feels greasy and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. So great to be able to try it thank to influenster!  I&#x27;ve had my friends try it also while traveling.</li>
    <li> I loved reviewing this product from Influenster!  I like the fact that it sprays on, but sometimes I underestimate how much I&#x27;m applying and end up putting on more than I need.  It&#x27;s also hard at times to get it evenly dispersed around my thigh area.  It&#x27;s definitely a great moisturizer though and super easy to use and I would buy it again, but I may look into seeing if they have a self-tanning one because I prefere those during the summer.</li>
    <li> I really like the convenience of this product, but I hate that it ends up all over the floor when you spray it on your legs. It leaves the floor slippery and I find I have to clean it almost every day. That is not so convenient!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, fast, easy to use, and quick absorbing! The smell is very feminine and sweet. Very affordable too! I have nothing bad to say about this product!</li>
    <li> I have plenty of regular lotion, but I never seemed to be able to motivate myself to use it. However, this spray lotion has proven that it can be easy! I use this product most nights before I go to bed, and my skin is so much softer because of it.</li>
    <li> My skin is always a scaly alligator because there is nothing i hate more than greasy, sticky lotion. Enter this magical potion! I spray it on, quickly rub it in, and it&#x27;s immediately absorbed. It is moisturizing and smells great (I have the yellow bottle that&#x27;s like wheat oat or somethingearthy) because I recieved complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was a silly product when I saw it to be honest. Why do you need to spray your lotion on - does it really make that HUGE of a difference. Well, then I used it. What I like is this: It makes it so much easier to put lotion on EVENLY and without excess which I know I myself am guilty of sometimes. It does take a lot less time, and leaves my hands a lot less gooey after applying it all over. Its a great product.</li>
    <li> The smell of the lotion is refreshing and it lasts a long time. It is easy to use and when you need to take it on the go you are able to close the nozzle so that it does not spray out on its own. The only problem that I had with this is that when I fist put it on its a little chilling to the skin.I actually received this product complimentary from Influenster</li>
    <li> I love this new spray lotion from Vaseline!  Super easy to use.  I love this for the hard to reach places, like my back!  I spray it on, let it soak in for about a minute and boom, ready to go!  Doesn&#x27;t feel oily on me which is a huge plus.  The only thing is that when you are spraying your back, be careful where you are standing.  I make sure I am on a rug because the floor can get a little slippery when you are spraying... especially when first getting the hang of all the angles of the back.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary bottle of Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough nice things. It has cut my routine by a good 10 minutes! Extra sleep time! Thank you Vaseline! I got it complimentary from influenster for testing and I am entering the brand challenge for a chance to win!</li>
    <li> I received this Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster. I love this product it easy to put on and use on the go. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that. When you put it on it doesn&#x27;t last long enough so you have to reapply twice or more through the day for it lasting. And I have entered the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize from Insfluenster.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It sprays on and absorbs almost immediately. It smells so fresh and clean. I love that you can just spray it on, and barely have to rub it in.</li>
    <li> This is great!  It goes on quickly and easily, moisturizes on contact, and dries within seconds!  It&#x27;s especially great for skinny and legging jeans-no more waiting for the product to dry before you can get dressed!</li>
    <li> I do not usually use lotion.  My skin is not dry and it takes forever for lotion to absorbed.  I received this lotion from Influenster to sample.  First of all, I liked the spray can.  It had a nice, concentrated stream of lotion.  I don&#x27;t think it is likely to clog.  I also found the lotion to absorb quickly - just as it promises!  I don&#x27;t think it was more hydrating than any other lotion, but I did appreciate that it didn&#x27;t take long to absorb.  Overall, I was pretty happy with it!</li>
    <li> I recently got to try out Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer for free, through Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer smells really wonderful, and the scent lingers for a while. It sprays on very thinly, which is why it absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s not as good as a body butter for really dry skin needs, but I think this will be fantastic in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the ingredient list was better for you, and also it&#x27;d be nice to see how much you have left.</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am writing this review so I can have an opportunity to win some more stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the spray and go moisturizer. It&#x27;s easy to use. Its not greasy; which is a huge plus! It has a quick application to it. so I would definitely recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I got Vaseline Spray and Go from Influenster and I love how quick and easy it is to go in the morning. There&#x27;s no greasy feeling, however the highpitched spray noise, will wake you up, or maybe I just have sensitive ears :) Either way, definitely worth it as I wear a bunch of dresses and this helps me get my legs work ready super fast without the greasy feeling.  If you have extremely dry skin, this may need to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
    <li> got this in my influenster vox box and loved it. Its super easy to use. it has a great scent and my kids can even use it.</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to use this product and I love the smell, BUT it takes a long time to dry. So I have to spray it on as soon as I get out of the shower and then wait until it dries.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on, just a spray to the skin, wherever you want it to be, and then rub it in! It smells really wonderful too. Feels a little sticky when first rubbing on, but once rubbed in, there is no sticky residue or grease left behind. It&#x27;s pretty cool, like a modern way to put on lotion! I still, however, prefer the usual way rubbing in lotion, but this is a great product for people on the run, with not much time in getting ready!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{I received Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.}</li>
    <li> I received this product in my sugar n spice box and I must say I love it. It has a very nice smell to it and its very easy to use. I think my skin has improved since starting to use this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is best applied on dry skin rather than damp skin for quick absorption. It leaves my skin feeling soft and delicately scented! Love it!</li>
    <li> I received a can of this for free in my Influenster VoxBox. I&#x27;m not a lotion person because I can&#x27;t stand how slimy it feels on my skin. When I opened my box and saw this, I was excited to give it a try. The Spray &amp; Go moisturizer goes on just like spray sunscreen and absorbs quickly. The application is fast and the moisture is apparent, even after such quick absorption. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this regularly after my free sample runs out.</li>
    <li> thanks to influenster, i was able to try the new vaseline spray and go free. IT IS INCREDIBLE. makes moisturizing so much easier. i love how quick it is to moisturize my 5 year old now. it&#x27;s no longer a battle to keep him still. i just spray it on, rub it in, and he&#x27;s ready to start running around again! great job, guys!</li>
    <li> i hate waiting for my moisturizer to dry so i can get dressed but not anymore with this spray, get it</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I liked that is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. It is also great on the go as the bottle is not too big or heavy and since it doesn&#x27;t have a pump you don&#x27;t have to worry about messes in your purse or backpack. I usually keep a small travel/trial size lotion in my purse but I compared the weight and this one weights just as much as the small travel size regular lotions, plus it dries so fast and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Often my morning are rushed so when I don&#x27;t have the time for my regular lotion the Vaseline Spray and Go is a quick and easy alternative.  I normally don&#x27;t even have to rub it in, just spray it on and it&#x27;s absorbed into my skin before I&#x27;m ready to get dressed.</li>
    <li> I love how quickly spray and go absorbs into the skin, it also has a very nice cooling sensation when it comes in contact with the skin great for a quick cool down when its hot that nourishes the skin after a rinse (think lake tanning or after swimming rinse off)</li>
    <li> This lotion is great if you are in a hurry. I find it is a little bit light, good for summer. Not sure it would be enough moisture if you live in a dry climate in the winter. If you do not hold it close enough, it will get on the floor or whatever is around and be slick so be careful where you spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this regularly as it is a bit pricey for how much you get, but good to try if you are busy!</li>
    <li> Love the ease of applying Vaseline Spray and Go! So thankful that I got it in my Influenster Vox Box for free!</li>
    <li> I loved this product and how quickly it dried after spraying it on after my shower, this was my first time ever trying this product and I just loved its convenience.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have used it everyday and my skin has never been better. It&#x27;s so easy to use I no longer skip moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and can&#x27;t see myself using anything else. It&#x27;s so convenient to use and makes my skin so soft! Great for a busy mom who doesn&#x27;t get a lot of time to shower and get ready.</li>
    <li> I lvoethis product it is so easy to use and it goes on easy and last a long time and makes my skin smooth!</li>
    <li> I received Vaseline Spray and Go complementary from Influenster to try and review.  I really like this product a lot.  I use a lot of lotion, especially in the summer since my skin gets so dry.  Vaseline Spray and Go lasts all day and is super easy to apply.  Just spray from about 3 to 6 inches away from your skin, do a brief rub in, and it&#x27;s already dry enough to put on clothes.  I haven&#x27;t has to worry about getting too much lotion and trying to find a way to put it back in the bottle or anything.  It&#x27;s simply amazing.  Thanks Vaseline and Influenster for giving me the opportunity to try this product.</li>
    <li> i love this moisturizer. the ease of application, the quick absorption and the way it makes my skin feel!! it&#x27;s so worth the amount you pay.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer, complimentary of Influenster. I was really impressed with the ease of application. I will be taking this product with me on vacation and to the beach. It smells great and very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who smells the product before I&#x27;ll even give it a try, so I was ecstatic over the Vaseline Spray and Go Total Moisture. The spray feature is perfect for getting those hard to reach areas like your back. The down side to the spray feature is it gets on the floor and counters, no matter how close I spray it. Which makes for slippery tiles! This product does make moisturizing quick, it&#x27;s easy to spray your whole body and then quickly rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that I are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and how easy it is to use. It goes on smooth and dries quick. Has a nice refreshing scent!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  You can actually do as it says , &amp;#34;spray and go!&amp;#34;  sometimes I skip putting lotion on my super dry legs due to time constraints when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning. This product can be applied. So quickly with the spray technique that I don&#x27;t need to skip it.</li>
    <li> I received this moisturizer from Influenster. I did like this moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any different or better then other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. I still give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s an interesting concept with it being in spray form, and I like how it smells.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Makes my skin super soft and it not greasy or anything. Was shocked at the quality of this. LOVE IT! NOthing I dont love. The smell, the ease of use, the way it makes my skin feel. I can go on!!!</li>
    <li> Great for the winter when your back is dry and you have no way to reach it! I wish it would come down in price a little... and that it was scented in other scents. But hopefully that will happen with time! Overall, really like this product!</li>
    <li> After you spray it on one arm/leg and rub it in, you hand is too slick to hold onto the bottle to spray further.  Not quite as easy to use as the commercial on TV suggests.  I&#x27;ll stick with the regular bottle of Vaseline moisturizer next time.</li>
    <li> Just what we need to spray a bottle of chemical ingredients on our skin daily because none of us are carrying a sufficient toxic load from the environment/ daily regimens already. uhuh :0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter, argan oil...there are so many other non irritating/less toxic moisturizers you can choose from. This is essentially the \\&quot;fast food\\&quot; option for body moisturizing, flocking to convenience over healing/ restorative ingredients when it comes to what we put on the largest organ of the body. Shame on us.</li>
    <li> The smell is nothing special and it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as it advertises so personally I was disappointed. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love that after I put this on it dries quickly making it easier to put on pants (skinny jeans). Plan to purchase this in the future. I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is so fast and easy doesn&#x27;t take that much time and drys fast! I even have my husband loving it he says he like how it doesn&#x27;t pile on his skin I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love how the product makes my skin feel and it did dry super fast. I&#x27;m not a fan of the arosal can, though. I run into the same problem with the sunscreen that comes this way. When I spray it onto my legs, etc. the product gets everywhere- specifically the ground and it makes a slippery mess. So I usually just spray it into my hand. I don&#x27;t know if this defeats the purpose, but I don&#x27;t have a terrible mess to clean up after. A tip I heard is to spray it while you&#x27;re on the bathmat or in the bath tub to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that I&#x27;m are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!  I love it. It makes it easier to get my husband to rub my back. I would rather have this lotion over any other brands.</li>
    <li> This lotion is lightweight yet moisturizing.  It dries extremely quick so you can build the moisture just like a foundation.  The scent is perfect also!</li>
    <li> This is a great item for when you&#x27;re in a rush, or at the gym, and like other reviewers said, for those hard to reach areas like your back. The only complaint I have is the one I got must have a faulty sprayer because it didn&#x27;t come out in a fine mist. More of a solid stream. But other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> its perfect when you&#x27;re running out of time so spray and leave then its good to go .  its perfect</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster I was able to try this awesome NEW product. I highly recommend! Easy to use no mess. Spray while dressed no greasy mess and no harsh scent. Nice and easy to use. My family loved it asked about it while using it on vacation. They loved it! My children are able to spray with no problem they liked the spray vs lotion. Fun new product! I would buy it!</li>
    <li> When I first got this item I was very skeptical. I did not like it at first but once I used it more it grew on me. The lotion does dry fast than other lotions. However it is not as morsturizing as I would hope. It is all pricey with not too much product. But it is convienient.</li>
    <li> Great product skin feel great I enjoy that you can spray the product on your skin in go. Great preasant smell</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this lotion!!  Will be buying this lotion instead of others from now on!  Highly recommend buying this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this product... It didn&#x27;t spray evenly and the nozzle clogged easily. Once I sprayed it on my body and rubbed it in I felt sticky not smooth I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Courtesy of Influenster, I tried this product for the first time. Specially for those on-the-go, the ease of use and quick drying time did for me. The smell is good, and I feel moisturizer the whole day. I recommend this product because it works really well on the skin, leaving it soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Not only does this not take forever to soak in, but I also used it as an antichafing measure when wearing dresses and/or nightgowns.  My mom loved it, my roommate loved it, and I loved it.  I&#x27;m going to get a few of the other types because this product is going to be on my forever list!</li>
    <li> I have to lotion my skin after every shower, my skin is so dry. Now there is no more sitting on the bed with a bottle and taking for ever waiting for the lotion to dry. You take the spray can spray every place, even the ones you could not reach before like your back. Then just go over it with a quick and I mean quick rub and its dry and your done! Get dressed and you are out the door so fast, I will never buy any other lotion again. It is a defiant must try for anyone!</li>
    <li> Spray &amp; Go helps make moisturinzing easy and quick. No more waiting for lotion to absorb or getting clothes greasy. The lotion comes out in a fine mist that is lightly moisturizes and absorbs quickly. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, allowing for getting dressed quickly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it can have some overspray and seem a little messy. After a little practice, though, it is quite easy and simple. Make sure the area is clear of clothing and don&#x27;t hold the can too far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin light and silky. On days that I go to work I wear compression stockings that put on after bathing.With Spray and Go I don&#x27;t have to wait to get dressed. Normally I have to wait about 20 minutes before I can put get dressed because I have to wait for my other lotion to absorb and get less oily. It does smell really good, and it is simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give skin moisture and hydration, but if your skin is very dry and needs more moisturizing it could leave you wanting. It does lack thicker emollients. As I gear up for warmer weather, it will be useful because I normally lighten my moisturizing routine in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer - I did receive a complimentary Vaseline Spray &amp; Go from Influenster.com and am entring a brand challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Vaseline Spray &amp; Go complimentary as part of the Sugar and Spice VoxBox from Influenster. I was excited to try this as I had seen it advertised and thought it sounded like a great idea. My kids and I get very dry in the winter and we need to moisturize often. I got out of the shower and started spraying it on. It was so easy! It coated evenly and continuously sprayed even when I held it upside-down to get my back. My kids started fighting at that point since I was out of the room for 5 seconds so I hurried up and put my clothes on. The lotion was already absorbed! It was almost instant! The scent was extremely pleasant and lasted all day. Another thing, the bottle lasts a really long time. This is a neat little product I will definitely be buying more of. *I am writing this in hopes of winning a prize*</li>
    <li> The spray lotion was very easy to use, I liked using a spray to apply.  The scent was not too strong, but I usually like a lotion to be a little heavier. This is nice for a light lotion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved Vaseline&#x27;s Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer! I live in FL, and sometimes lotion can be a hassle, especially in summer months with all the humidity. Spray &amp; Go is very moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film or residue on skin. I simply spray it on after I shower and it gives me all the moisture I need for the day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s not great. It might be fun for kids since they might think getting sprayed is cool. It has a watery type of consistency that I wasn&#x27;t a fan of, but it does moisturizer. I got this product as a free sample from influenster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely a traditional \\&quot;wipe and go\\&quot; lotion girl.  So, when I got the opportunity to try this out, I was excited.  I received the product and my 3 year old and i tried it out (he hates to put lotion on).  He loved the application, squealing with delight, \\&quot;It tickles!\\&quot;.  Application was a breeze.  However, i did not feel that it moisturizes as well as traditional lotions.  I think this product is better used as an \\&quot;in between\\&quot; lotion or an \\&quot;on the go\\&quot; lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Easy to use, absorbs quickly and smells great! I&#x27;ve already finished the bottle I got complimentary of Influenster in the Sugar &amp; Spice Vox Box, I need to get some more! Way better than trying to rub in some lotion when you&#x27;re in a hurry!</li>
    <li> I like how quick it is to apply and rub in the spray lotion. I think the level of application is perfect, versus some traditional lotions that leave me feeling slimy or gunky. The product saves me time in the morning as well which is helpful too. The scent is a little too strong. I think if they could make a fragrance free version they could attract more users...also the value for what you get is questionable. I am sure you get more product in a traditional product bottle than this can.</li>
    <li> Influenster sent me this product and I absolutely love it. Not only is it convenient the lotion is amazing. I got a really bad sunburn and everywhere was closed and this was the only lotion I had and this stuff was incredible. It not only moisturized my skin (no peeling) it went on cool and fast and I did not have to rub it in. I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I received my Vaseline Spray and Go complimentary of Influenster and I love it! I use it everyday. The smell and application are amazing and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin all oily like most lotions/moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> Just gettin&#x27; this out of the way - I got the Spray N Go free from Influenster, and this review helps my chances of winning a prize. FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously love this stuff, but not for me!  Have you ever tried to put lotion on a squirmy toddler?  This stuff makes it so much easier!  I can hold my toddler&#x27;s leg with one hand, and use the spray lotion with the other!  It has totally streamlined my kids&#x27; bedtime routine!  Five stars for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I got it from @influenster in my Sugar N Spice vox box. I literally use this everyday before I go to work. It leaves me moisturized, not greasy, and it&#x27;s easy and quick to apply. It&#x27;s great for travel because you don&#x27;t have to worry about a mess.</li>
    <li> I got this product from Influenster to try and it definitely serves it&#x27;s purpose... it goes on easily, dries fast and is scented nicely.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it was cold going on, just like spray sun screen is.  Otherwise, thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Spray and Go was okay...I was able to try the product from Influenster, and sadly I was not impressed. I felt the Spray and Go was a waste. It works like canned sunscreen, you push down the top and it sprays out. You have to rub in the lotion. The lotion was not the best quality at all. I felt it was comparable to something I could get at the dollar store. It was not moisturizing at all! The smell was very mild. I also feel this product goes very quickly...it will not last long. Retail runs 5.99-7.99. I would not buy this again. I was very happy to try it, but I was not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> I  received the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I want to say I love it!! Its so easy to apply and dries instantly. Most important it WORKS My skin looks and feels wonderful. I keep it in my bag so when I finish at the gym after a swim I can literally spray and go :)</li>
    <li> Just brilliant, it sprays on quickly and effectively. Though I recommend getting a helping hand for spraying your back haha. I just love it, it dries instantly no mess no fuss.</li>
    <li> I was sent my can complimentary of Influenster &amp; I LOVE this product so much. I&#x27;ve been using Vaseline moisturizers for a couple of years now &amp; they are by far my favourite. The scents are great without being completely overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is said to be kind of a citrus/floral scent, but I don&#x27;t really pick that up at all .. It smells more neutral to me, kind of like oats. I&#x27;m not a fan of anything citrus or floral &amp; if this were scented with either of the two I probably wouldn&#x27;t be using it at all because both those fragrances have a tendency to make me feel rather ill &amp; I don&#x27;t find that happening with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The continuous 360 spray makes it incredibly easy to get a quick, even application. It&#x27;s a super light formula &amp; the best bit, which is it&#x27;s marketing sell .. is that it claims to be non-greasy, which it&#x27;s not at all. It&#x27;s super moisturizing &amp; immediately absorbs into your skin within seconds of rubbing the product in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than what I&#x27;ve been paying for my other Vaseline lotion, but .. what can ya do!?</li>
    <li> Loving Vaseline&#x27;s new Spray and Go moisturizer.  It does well to hit those hard to reach places.  The fragrance is good and it is not very greasy.  My husband liked using it on his rough hands and elbows.  Well done!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this out cause i love this lotion brand... I was very satisfied with it that i use it on my girls for their dry skin. Once sprayed on and dried my skin feels soft and skin doesnt feel greasy</li>
    <li> seriously like the spray &amp; go feature... am usually in a hurry and with dry skin i simply spray dries quick and leaves my skin super soft</li>
    <li> I love using Spray and Go moisture lotion. This stuff dries in less than a minute and you can use this in a hurry. Put on those clothes without the drying time of regular lotions.</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago I recieved the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go moisturizer for testing purposes from influenster and Vaseline, I have not stopped using it! I love this product it absorbs fast in my skin so there is not much of a fuss anymore no more rubbing of excessive lotion mess, no more clothing sticking to me intill it dries. Amazing product I even love how the smell is really settle.</li>
    <li> I received this item for free to try from influenster.com.  I was pretty excited about trying it out, I have dry skin and use moisturizer regularly and finding something that absorbs quickly enough to be able to spray it on and get dressed immediately is definitely a bonus.  There is a learning curve when it comes to getting the spray action right, I ended up with a couple of slippery spots on the bathroom floor after the first use but otherwise I liked it.  The product really does absorb quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft.  But here is the problem, the smell.  I understand that lotions and creams often have a scent but usually that scent goes away.  Not this one.  It is strong and it lingers on your skin all day.  For that reason I will not be buying this moisturizer again.</li>
    <li> It is so easy to use and I loved how quickly it was absorbed into my skin. Not sticky at all and I really enjoyed the light fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I received this complementary from Influenster from the Sugar n spice voxbox. I tested and I came to the conclusion that this is better than lotion. It dries quick and doesn&#x27;t leave the body feeling greasy and oily. It moisturizer well and overall an easy to product to use. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am entering a branch challenge and I hope I win so I can win a prize for testing it :)</li>
    <li> Also works as a face moisturize, can put my clothes on easily, don&#x27;t waste time&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for the cream to dry or to put my clothes on no spotting on them either. I am amazed of the smell and how being a spray even softens elbows.good for eyebrow plucking too!</li>
    <li> This is great and the kids loved using it especially.  It last all day and is easy to use.  I like the scent.  Be careful, though, using on tile...it definitely will become slippery.</li>
    <li> Very convenient for on the go... Dries fast, moisturizes, you can spray and then rub on it&#x27;s great... Overall it&#x27;s a great product, I definitely recommend it to everyone... For all skin types..</li>
    <li> This spray lotion is definitely helpful when you are someone that is always on the go...it helped me so much as a makeup artist, when I need to moisturize my models&#x27; skin in a hurry. The moisture is not as the other Vaseline products...but it is still pretty effective.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use product. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t sticky like they say - I think it still left a rather sticky residue.</li>
    <li> This product is quick and easy to use.  My four year loves this product over the regular lotion.  We practice writing letters, numbers, and shapes with this spray lotion.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. I received it through a review program from Influenster, and I&#x27;m currently entering a brand challenge with this product. It&#x27;s quick and easy to apply, absorbs fast so that you can get dressed right after an application. It&#x27;s moisturizing and has a pleasant scent. I also think it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I love that you can spray this on and not have to deal with slow moving lotion or a hardened piece of gunk in the pump. It absorbs rather quickly too! It is non greasy and has a very pleasant smell. I will definitely buy this again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This seems to moisturizer well and has a nice smell.  I wish it had no odor at all, though.  If you wear perfume, a scented deodorant, scented shampoo, or soap, etc.  All the smells compete with one another.  Yuck.  If your only fragrance comes from this, it should be fine.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product and am happy I did!  It makes it much easier to just spray it on, but you still have to rub it in.  I loved the smell and my skin feels really soft!  Also, it will make your floors slick if you aren&#x27;t careful where you are spraying it.</li>
    <li> greasy, messy, not as advertised.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a warehouse club which had a rolling advertisement for it playing on a little screen near the product display, featuring a girl spraying herself and dressing in about a quarter of a minute.  I thought it would be a great product to reach those hard areas of, and moisturize my back, especially coming from a trusted line such as Vaseline Intensive Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a horrible product!  I can&#x27;t believe so many people like it.  Whatever chemical is in it that causes it to dry quickly, is very drying to my skin.  I followed the directions and sprayed it on and rubbed it in with my hands.  The palms of my hands shriveled up and felt tacky and as dry as if I&#x27;d been washing dishes all day.  About an hour after applying it, I held my husband&#x27;s hand for a bit and product transferred to his palm, too, and he asked me what that tacky stuff on my hands was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could literally feel the dehydrated, tacky feeling in my palms and fingertips 24 hours later, after having washed and moisturized my hands numerous times (not with this stuff).  I brought it back to the warehouse club and thankfully they refunded my money.</li>
    <li> Delivers what is promised - sprays on lightly and absorbs nearly instantly!  I usually kept this in my shower so I could use it right after a shower and not spray it everywhere. I took off a star because it felt like a fair bit of lotion was wasted and the bottle ran out quickly.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Goes on easily and is not sticky, tacky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to spray on yourself to legs and back.&lt;br /&gt;It is a light mist and not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Subscribe and Save is great option for purchase</li>
    <li> The ultimate moisturizer and sprays on easily.</li>
    <li> I like the concept but it is still a bit too greasy for my taste.  While it applies easily, I am not sure it is as effective as cream or lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this product it smell amazing and its really easy to use it make me skin feel nice and smooth!!I I got it all thanks to Influenster for give me a chance to try this amazing moisturizer. This is for a badge challenge.</li>
    <li> Goes on just like they advertise it on TV.&lt;br /&gt;Good smell.....I like it!</li>
    <li> While I liked the product when it came out, it was extremely hard for me to use the spray with my arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> Was given a can from my sister and read the ingredient list before i used it. Yuck!! Stopped using products with parabens in them several years ago after my dermatologist told me that parabens convert into cancer causing hormones. There are also two really long (scary) chemical names in the ingredient list that I have never heard of before. Didn&#x27;t even want to use it at all. I&#x27;ll stick to lotions that I know what the ingredients are.</li>
    <li> I love the Vaseline spray and go. In the morning when I&#x27;m ready to go, I don&#x27;t like to spend time putting lotion on and then having to wash it off my hands. I just spray it on and rub my arms together. And i&#x27;m good to go. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love that you can just spray after showering and never have to sit down and make sure your lotion is completely absorbed.  Quick to use, absorbs fast and no oily residue.  Living in the mountains, we have VERY dry air and this has been a dream come true for better skin!! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I received a bottle in my Influenster VoxBox to try out and test for free, in exhange for my review on my blog, and I am so pleasantly surprised with it that I&#x27;m sharing it with you here.&lt;br /&gt;First, I love that it&#x27;s spray, which makes it so much easier.  I don&#x27;t always want lotion on my hands, and this allows me to put it where I want it, without having to get messy.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has VERY dry skin on his back, and this has  been a miracle for him.  I love this stuff and recommend it to anyone, especially those with dry skin, or skin issues such as psoriasis (I have psoriasis, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about!)</li>
    <li> Super easy and convenient.  Sprays on evenly and absorbs quickly. My alligator legs thank you. Great way to moisturize after winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received  Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> This product is a great moisturizer and its extremely fast to use. This product is great for people that have a busy lifestyle and dry skin</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is so easy to just spray it on and go.  I love being able to use it for my kids since its not oily and you can put your clothes on right after!</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray and Go is so easy to use!  I&#x27;m so excited for this product, it makes putting lotion on my back so much easier! It also smells soooo goood!</li>
    <li> The idea of spraying and going is a myth But for those of us who only have time to rub and go, spray and go it the charm. It is perfect in my daughter&#x27;s gym bag, in my office drawer, and on your counter for a quick touch up. I wouldn&#x27;t advise this to be your base form of lotion[[ASIN:B009RNUH4A Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer in Total Moisture, 6.5 Ounce]] if you are needing more moister to keep the skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! It kept my legs moisturized but drys so quick so my legs are perfectly smooth to slide into pants...perfect!&lt;br /&gt;-Veronica</li>
    <li> I love that I can spray on my lotion. With as busy as my schedule is, it is sad to say that lotion often gets skipped. Not anymore. This lotion is thin but works great.</li>
    <li> I received this from influtester and have been using it for a few weeks. I found spraying it further away and not rubbing it in works best for me. Downside, it makes the floor slippery if its tile. Its definitely easy and handy!</li>
    <li> I Dread Winter skin, Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer has made my skin very soft and smooth,Only after 1 week of use.&lt;br /&gt;  Very Convenient to use, you will Not get your hands all gooey like a regular lotions,fast drying once you rub Vaseline spray and Go into skin. Skin is instantly smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have been using Vaseline Spray &amp; Go on my face for 2 weeks .I am prone to break-outs in my  T-zone and have not had any break-outs. I highly recommend Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer Thank You for allowing me to test through @influenster.</li>
    <li> No more ashy, dry skin... Your skin will feel soft and NOT GREASY AT ALL, this is my 3rd bottle ♥</li>
    <li> I love the ease of use of the new Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer!  It&#x27;s easy and fast! It makes my skin soft!  I&#x27;ve replaced all of my lotion with these cans!</li>
    <li> Love this product.So easy to use.No grease to it ..dries fast love it.Sared tis product wit my mom now she&#x27;s  a fan.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell, it is very intoxicating.  I must admit that it is different and something you have to get used to when it comes to spraying on your lotion.  I found out that I tend to spray pretty close to the skin otherwise you will spray your skin and whatever is close by.  I did find that once you spray the lotion on, it absorbs fairly quickly and there is no greasy residue.  However, even though this lotion would be good for everyday use, it did not help moisturize my severely dry skin spots.  I do use this lotion on my leg though.</li>
    <li> This really does make my life a little easier. I often just skipped moisturizing my entire body to save time, but now I don&#x27;t have to do that anymore! Just like it says, spray &amp; go! It dries fast, and smells so nice. I got it complimentary from Influenster, and I&#x27;m entering a Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize, but my opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> I never thought of a moisturizer in a spray, and I have to say, I love it! It is really easy to apply, and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t let that sticky greasy texture on your skin. You can apply it as soon as you get out of the shower, and your skin absorbs in seconds. The scent is really nice, and the amount of products that delivers each spray is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it specially if you have dry skin like mine, and want to save some time while applying on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of the new Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m writing this review as a participation on the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. ** The opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Received the Vaseline spray and go for review from Influenster.  I liked that it was easy to apply, I found that by spaying very close to skin the spray did not get all over the floor.  The spray lotion smells very good and absorbs very quickly and leaves skin nice and lightly moisturized. Overall a good product for quick lotion application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not fond of \\&quot;spray\\&quot; items, so this product wasn&#x27;t one of my favorites in the box. I do like the scent, as it is very similar to the scent of the lotion. When sprayed, it goes on quickly and is easy to move around to moisturize whatever skin surface it was sprayed on. It is very convenient to bring wherever you&#x27;re traveling to instead of having to lug around a bottle(s) of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the 2 things it comes down to are 1) personal preference and 2) price. For me, I&#x27;m just more of a lotion kind of girl, and I&#x27;d rather spend my money on the bottle of lotion than a spray bottle. But don&#x27;t knock it til you try it. :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster &amp; entering brand challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I have a huge in progress leg tattoo that is very colorful.. my legs get so dry, and it&#x27;s such a pain to be constantly lotioning them, especially in the cooler weather. This product is really awesome. It goes on quick, dries within a few moments, and I&#x27;m ready to put my pants on (haha). My only issue is that the spray cap they used likes to slip back into the \\&quot;lock\\&quot; position quite often, thus keeping me from spraying. Kind of annoying, but the product is really nice. I got this as a test product courtesy of Influenster, and I will most certainly be purchasing it in the future.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Spay &amp;Go Moisturizer complimentary of Influenster and I am enter the Brand Challenge to win a prize. With that being said, I love this product! I have dry, sensitive skin and not a whole lot of time with 5 boys so it is perfect for me. It moisturizes my skin without making it feel oily. It goes on quickly. I don&#x27;t always rub it in when I am in a real hurry and it does fine with just doing that. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it aggravating my skin and it has a nice smell. I love that I also don&#x27;t have to worry about squirting out too much and having to rinse it off. I hate being wasteful and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it now with this product. I also found how great the lock is the other day when I caught my son (4) in the bathroom trying to play with it. Luckily, he couldn&#x27;t because I remembered to lock it so it saved me from having to clean an extra mess. I highly recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Only lotion of it&#x27;s kind. I love that it dries instantly and does not stick to clothes.  I will defiantly be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> You can spray this stuff from across the room.....LOL. I sprayed it the first time and wasn&#x27;t ready, it got everywhere. Including on my husband who was on the other side of our bedroom. It rubs in great but it isn&#x27;t something I would purchase because of the mess it makes. I got mine for free from influenster and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample in my Influenster VoxBox. I was excited to try it, and it lived up to my expectations and then some. It is easy to use, absorbs quickly, and also has a wonderful light scent.  I will definitely continue to have this around... it definitely helped with my dry hands that are still recovering from a very rough winter (we live in Ohio).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good moisturizer. It&#x27;s easy to spray and smells really good, while it moisturizes. I loved that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the bottle opening in my luggage while traveling, and the way it dries so fast on your skin makes being on-the-go even easier. My only con is that you need to spray all your body first before rubbing it onto the skin, as your hands will be to slippery to re-spray. Also, mae sure to spray on a carpet because it can also get the floor slippery.</li>
    <li> I received this in my Sugar n Spice voxbox from influenster and it&#x27;s overall a great product. But it doesn&#x27;t really keep my skin moisturize for long.</li>
    <li> I got one bottle from Influenster to review .. I have not bought this yet but yes I would buy it as soon as my bottle is over.. The opinions expressed are entirely my own and not been influenced by anyone. I hated the product when I first received it.. because I was not using it correctly.. Once I read the directions it was totally different experience.. I frist spray all parts of the body that I need to moisturize holding it a little away from the body and then rub the lotion in.. it is not very thick in consistency which is good for summer use.. I would not use this in winter or maybe use two coats since I have dry to normal skin..the smell is very pleasant.. like typical vaseline smell..</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use and smells great. Just spray and go. I keep mine in my car just i case I forget to put on lotion.</li>
    <li> I felt that this was one of the better spray on moisturizers. The only thing I felt it missed: Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;.a natural oil that is close to human sebum and as such, does more for the skin overall.  My children and I love the smell and the non-greasy feel after application. I bought more!</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer. Frankly, I&#x27;m amazed it wasn&#x27;t made before. It&#x27;s a long-lasting moisturizer in a fine mist format. You do still have to rub it in, but it absorbs super quickly, and it lasts as well as the regular Vaseline lotion, my husband&#x27;s favorite. It&#x27;s great for women and men...the scent isn&#x27;t gender specific or overpowering, though very pleasant. It also worked great for my teen...she&#x27;s always running late, and this let her leave with soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster, and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy this was to use.  You just spray it on and, in seconds it is dry.  I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the fragrance, but it worked great at moisturizing my skin. Since it&#x27;s a spray, hard-to-reach places (like your back) are now easy to get.  I got a free sample of this from Influenster and liked it for the most part.</li>
    <li> Spray and go is really great and easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and dries quickly, but in the long run, it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing. I&#x27;d only use it for a quick fix, not long term moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best coverage lotion that I have owned in a long time. Not only is the spray factor amazing but the no greasy lotion is great. I have the best time applying this lotion and the smell is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I got this complimentary of Influenster&#x27;s Sugar &#x27;n Spice Voxbox and i&#x27;m honestly loving it. its easy to use and it dries quickly after you blend it in. I love how theres actually a part where you can close it, so if your traveling you dont have to worry abt it spraying anywhere or making a mess, for that matter. You&#x27;re supposed to spray it 4-6 inches away from where you&#x27;re going to spray it and then blend away so that it doesn&#x27;t stay lotion-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that I love about this is that you can spray it on and not have to worry that ur moisturizer will go all over your clothing. I&#x27;ve once tried to spray my legs and then wearing m skirt with no difficulties what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other scents. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize from Influenster*</li>
    <li> Vaseline brand has great products anyway and the Spray and Go Moisturizer just tops the list. It has a nice scent.  It is easy to use with a nice light spray and It keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I got the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and i am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. This moisturizer works wonders on my skin. Its been really hot and dry here in CA all i have to do is spray really quick and my skin is left feeling nice and soft. Also the smell is nice too.</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Spray and Go Moisturizer for nearly a month now and I love it! My skin is softer and I love the scent of the spray (oat). Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I loved this spray on lotion. It was easy to dispense and rub on and made my legs feel so smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclose: I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> This lotion is easy to apply, simply point and spray, then rub in. Its perfect for after you dry off from getting out of the shower. (Just be sure that you&#x27;re standing on a towel or a rug - so you don&#x27;t accidentally slip) It sprays in all directions, upside down, sideways.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, absorbs quickly and is not greasy (that&#x27;s always a plus)&lt;br /&gt;I put some on earlier today and my skin is still soft and has a light, pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received your Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I got to try this spray through the influenster vox box and i am not too impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is very easy to use and is very handy i find that there is too much lotion going to waste.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion comes out in a fine mist but sprays in two completely different directions and half of the lotion just ends up flying through the air landing anywhere but on ur body. I prefer the old fashioned tubes.</li>
    <li> I love the new Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer.  I received it complimentary from Influencer in my Vox Box. I will be buying this product when my sample runs out.  I love that you spray it on and it dries super fast.  There is no excuse to not use this lotion.  It only takes seconds to apply and works great.</li>
    <li> I tried this it was ok. I think after it dries so does your skin. I love the convince of spray and go.</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Total Moisture compliments of an Influenster VoxBox.  The instructions recommend that you use this with minimal clothing and I would have to agree - make sure you aim well!  The first time I sprayed it I accidentally got it all over my socks (typical me!) but I was very pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t stain or leave a greasy mark.  The moisturizer goes on in a smooth, even coat that rubs in quickly without leaving your skin or hands feeling greasy!  It works great on those spots that need a little extra help like elbows and knees and even a few hours after using it my skin still felt silky smooth.  The smell of the lotion is a little strong but its pleasant.  My only suggestions are make sure you don&#x27;t get it on your clothes and watch where you are spraying it - I think it could be easily wasted if you have bad aim!</li>
    <li> im totally in love with this stuff! it moisturizes my skin and it dries almost instantly! NO REGRETS AT ALL! Im most likely repurchasing the cocoa butter version! I did get this item free from influenster and im entering a contest to win more(:</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray and Go moisturizer is so quick and easy! It sprays on and is super light. I love the fragrance and the time I save. It&#x27;s perfect for stepping out of the shower or after a day in the pool or on the beach. Spray and Go is also great for targeting problem dry areas without lotioning all over. I will advise you to spray it very close to your skin. It&#x27;s very slippery if you get any on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I really loved Vaseline spray and go.  It only takes a sec to spray on, rub in and go!  One thing you have to watch out for is over spraying.  It doesn&#x27;t take but a few seconds to do the entire length of your legs and you&#x27;ve got enough.  Moisturizes really well!  You won&#x27;t regret trying it!  I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It&#x27;s really quick to use and it leaves my legs feeling soft.  I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> i really love this stuff goes on great leaves u feelingsmooth all day fast and easy ready to go! u all need to try! and it smells great1</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get this free from Influenster for testing purposes! Now I get to enter the Vaseline Brand Challenge and possibly win more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a Vaseline fan, but this spray and go takes it to a whole new level! I love that you can just spray it on, rub it in and go. It really is that quick! As all Vaseline products, this absolutely serves it&#x27;s purpose! It only comes in 3 variaties, but going just by the names of the other two, they sound pretty great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side not...I hate, hate, hate most commercials, but the once for the spray and go are AWESOME!! Haha! I actually enjoy watching them! Now that is saying something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I would definitely recommend these to anybody, especially those who lead a busy lifestyle!!</li>
    <li> Spray and Go is a very convenient and easy to use product. Its great to use on those hard to reach areas. wish they would have came out with this product 10 years ago!!  Got a free bottle thanks to @influenster.  I definitely recommend this product to everyone out there. This will be a staple item in my vanity for years to come!  thanks again influenster for turning me on to this product!! \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer from Influenster to try and can honestly say I&#x27;m impressed!  This goes on easy, absorbs quickly, is not greasy or oily so it did not leave stains on my clothing, and keeps skin moisturized and feeling soft for hours!  I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with this product and recommend the use of this product!</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint with most lotions is that they are very greasy.  I did not have that problem with the Vaseline Spray and Go.  I just lightly sprayed on my legs and ran out the door.  Since it is a spray and not a traditional lotion, you also don&#x27;t have lotion all over your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.)</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I received it via Influenster through their complimentary VoxBox program. It smells clean and warm, dries quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I literally just spray it on my arms and legs, rub them down, and I am good to get dressed. Works like a charm! I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it if you have very dry skin, but maybe one of the other options is more emollient.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It does not replace my body lotion for everyday use but its great to spray on right before I walk out the door.  It is my new summer staple and I wont be leaving home without it!  I can&#x27;t wait to try all the varieties.</li>
    <li> I got this product from influenster and ever since I got it I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. It&#x27;s easy to use and makes your skin visibly soft! I&#x27;m in love</li>
    <li> I am a huge lotion fan. Living in Hawaii and constantly being in the sun, moisturizing is a daily habit for me. I love Vaseline products and have used them before. The Spray and Go is no different. I really like how fast it dries, and it really seems to moisturize pretty well. I gave this product three stars for 1) the ingredients and 2) the mess it makes. I&#x27;m not a fan of it containing alcohol in the ingredients, I think that is really bad for your skin in the long run. I also don&#x27;t like how it gets all over the floor when spraying it onto your skin. If you do it in the bathroom, prepare for a slippery mess. I&#x27;d suggest putting a towel down. I probably won&#x27;t buy this specific product again, but I will continue to use Vaseline. Thanks Influenster for sending me this product in my Sugar &#x27;N Spice box to try out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarole&lt;br /&gt;onehaolegirl.com</li>
    <li> Love this product which has good moisture!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*received your Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I loved my complimentary Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer from influenster. It sprays on easily, dries quickly, and without any sticky feeling. I will definitely buy more once my free one is all gone.</li>
    <li> Love the spray. One of the bottles would not work but I called the Vaseline number and they provided a coupon for a free bottle to replace the broken one. Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Did not need it, the price was just better than what I have paid for in the past.</li>
    <li> I love it! It really dries fast. A little goes a long way. If you spray too much you will have to rub it like lotion but when it dries there is no greasy feeling at all. This may replace all lotion in our home!</li>
    <li> The spray is good but it ran out too quick, I only used it for a week for my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected.  After receiving the product and reading the ingredients I was hesitant to use it and the fragrance is overpowering. I can&#x27;t imagine spraying this all over my body.  I tossed it.  Can&#x27;t win &#x27;em all!</li>
    <li> I LOVE spray on lotion! It&#x27;s much easier to rub in and it smells good. Not greasy at all either which is a hive plays for me.</li>
    <li> Spray and Go was so easy to use.  My back gets very dry in the winter.  I find it impossible to reach everywhere with a normal moisturizer.  When I used Spray and Go I was able to cream my entire back.  I don&#x27;t rub it in and it absorbs before I finish dressing. I have used it for about a week now and my itching has stopped. I like to do things fast and I find Spray and Go perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This product applies lightly and evenly and is very easy to apply.  It smells out of this world wonderful.  Superior packaging for a superior product.</li>
    <li> I am the type of person who can&#x27;t stand the feeling of clothing on top of lotion. I feel like the lotion will get all over the clothes and make them sticky, but with this moisturizer, I don&#x27;t have to worry! I didn&#x27;t even buy this product through Amazon (I bought it at Rite Aid) but I felt the need to write a review. This product is great, it dries in seconds and keeps skin feeling soft all day. This spray is awesome, and the bottle sprays in every direction, making it easy to get the hard to reach places. I highly recommend this product, it is such a time saver!!</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle.  I really like it.  I pat myself dry just a little in the shower and then apply while I am still in the shower area.  Works great.  My skin feels great.  I do apply more often then regular moisturizers because it is so convenient already in my shower.  I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star because it is a little pricey.  That is all.</li>
    <li> Watching the commercial for this Vaseline spray on product, I ran out to get it.&lt;br /&gt;Well, after spraying tracks all over my body, I still needed to spread it over my skin by hand and wait for it to dry.  Only difference was applying the lotion by spray vs from your hand.  You still need to rub it in and the sprayed track isn&#x27;t always on the spot you need it. As for it&#x27;s moisturizing .... not so good. Given the price, it&#x27;s more sales hype than substance.</li>
    <li> I really love this Spray and Go moisturizer. Its easy to use and smells fresh. I love how I can just spray and it go on evenly. I will be purchasing the other ones too.</li>
    <li> It has a great scent that&#x27;s not to overbearing and it absorbs very quickly. I can&#x27;t stop touching my arms they&#x27;re so soft!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I received it in my Influenster Voxbox and loved it right away!  I wear skirts a lot but rarely take the time to lotion my legs.  But with Spray and Go I can just spray my legs and by the time I put my skirt on the lotion has been absorbed!  I don&#x27;t even have to rub it in!  Amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is a complete winner - I&#x27;d toss it in my car, gym bag or even beach bag!  Great for moisturizing on the go, and it dries quickly enough that it never gets on your clothing; can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I received this in my Influenster Sugar-n-Spice Vox Box and fell in love with it. It&#x27;s super convenient when you&#x27;re in a hurry to get ready. I like that it is very moisturizing and it smells pleasant too. I would buy this product again. #Spray&amp;Go #Influenster</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray Go Moisturizer is an amazing product. It is quick and easy to use. I love how easy it is to spray on. It is very moisturizing. It covers my skin and I do not have to reapply. Great new product that&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Ok let me say that first off I love the smell of this product and then I also love the way it feels on my skin, it makes my skin soft and not greasy. But the whole spray thing isnt what I expected, I mean you spray it and if its too far you get it everywhere (I mean, it&#x27;s a spray what do I expect) and then you still have to rub it in your skin with your hand so it&#x27;s not like it saves any time. over all I like it but not for the \\&quot;spray\\&quot; feature.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray Go Moisturizer is an amazing product. It is quick and easy to use. I love how easy it is to spray on. The smell is great. It is very moisturizing. It covers my skin and I do not have to reapply. Great new product thats worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> This is a really awesome light moisturizer.  Not recommended for rough spots like elbows and knees, but for everything else it&#x27;s perfect!  I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy, so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about what not to touch after using it.  I even use it on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering a Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> This absorbed really quickly and was really fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to skip moisturizers because I&#x27;m lazy but this made it really convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the greatest skin lotion but for someone like me&lt;br /&gt;who rarely uses body lotion,&lt;br /&gt;this is ALOT better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying, just wished it was cheaper :P</li>
    <li> My Grandmother used Vaseline lotion and I always come back to it, so when I got the Spray and Go in my Sugar and Spice Vox to try, I knew I would love it and I do!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about Vaseline is that it is a light weight moisturizer, there is no sticky or tackiness from putting the lotion on and waiting for it to dry. I towel off after my shower and spray away, I&#x27;m, lotion&#x27;d-up and dry by the time I brush my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance takes me back to my younger days and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I don&#x27;t like  lot of the moisturizers on the market now because they feel greasy but this one does not. The smell is great, not too strong. I received this in an Influenster Voxbox but after trying it, I would definitely purchase it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I have to watch even with lotions what to use and put on my skin. This went om very smoothly and no sticky mess. My skin didn&#x27;t get irritated by it which is a plus for people like me. It lasted a good portion of the day on me and my skin felt refreshed with it. The smell was not over powering and faded as the day went on which is a plus as well for me. It&#x27;s def worth trying!</li>
    <li> I love how the product goes on so easily and reaches areas on my back that I would otherwise ignore. My daughters use it and in fact fight over it, so I know that I will be buying this product in bulk. I am amazed at how evenly it covers your skin and how it leaves your skin soft and not greasy. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I had never tried it until I received it a free promotional product and it has now become my favorite mosturizer.  It&#x27;s definitly a staple in my household!</li>
    <li> I love the newest item from Vaseline. It&#x27;s very convenient, And it saves so much time. You can you live on wet or dry skin. And it really does a wonderful job at moisterizing. You don&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>
    <li> I received Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. I enjoy trying new lotions and this one is great! The spray is so easy and covers my legs and arms very quickly. The moisturizer is not greasy at all and my skin stays moisturized all day long. The smell is great - reminds me of summer! I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other moisturizers in this line! I definitely recommend Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer Total Moisture!!</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer is great - not greasy, not sticky, applies and absorbs in seconds, and I can get dressed right after my shower without having to wait!!  It smells fantastic, and I LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> I really like the ease of use, and it absolutely was oil free and quick drying. I feel like for the price though, it should be in a larger bottle- the spray function makes it use up pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to try this product for a while, so I was very excited when I received it in my vox box for influenster.com. This is a really awesome product. You basically just spray the lotion all over your body rub it in and it dries instantly with no waiting time. I dont use this to replace my regular moisturizer as I felt it didn&#x27;t moisturize as well, but when I am in a hurry or feeling too lazy to put lotion on this I choose this. Overall this is an awesome product. My only minor complaints are that in the winter when the bottle got cold the lotion went on freezing cold.</li>
    <li> My mornings can be pretty hectic and I don&#x27;t always take the time to moisturize like I should.  Now that is not a problem!  Vaseline Spray &amp; GO is so quick and easy to use, I have no excuse not to moisturize.  On top of that, it moisturizes just as well as anything else I&#x27;ve used.  I received your Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really grown to love this lotion. It&#x27;s easy to use and has a great smell. It abosorbs quickly and won&#x27;t leave you sticky or greasy. My skin feels soft and looks beautiful. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this courtesy of influenster. It smells nice, goes on easily, and is not sticky. I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can spray and go from head to toe from front to back and with just a couple of rubs this spay and go Vaseline instantly absorbs into my skin nicely and not oily or sticky.....I highly recommend this product for the on the go moms, dads, kids and college kids...great product</li>
    <li> Spray and go is one of the bests new lotions out there! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy, and leave a nice soft feeling. I love spray and go!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is super easy to use, comes out quickly and is light yet moisturizing. I usually prefer a lotion that has a creamier texture but the lightness of this one leaves my skin feeling really nice.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! spray n go, not greasy, easy to apply when you need something easy and quick to put on. covers dry ashy skin.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray and go is an amazing easy to use product. Total moisture in just seconds without oily slippery hands.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use spray and go on my toddler it has turned after bath time into a fun game. My toddler likes to be sprayed and she loves the smell too which is a bonus cause scents completely turn her off on things.&lt;br /&gt;check out other reviews at influenster.com [...]&lt;br /&gt;I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;username: weaverwife2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009RNUH4A Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer in Total Moisture, 6.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I really love this product!! It&#x27;s quick, just spray on, rub in, and you&#x27;re done! It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in well, and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my bottle of Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that I&#x27;m entering a Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase this before I got it in my Influenster vob box, but I didnt! I can say after trying it for free this is the ONLY lotion i will use from now on! AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I loved it.  It dry super fast without out feeling sticky . You jump out the shower spray it on and be out the door in no time.</li>
    <li> After seeing a commercial for this product, I doubted that it could be as easy as they made it seem... especially when your skins gets as ashy as mine does on the best of days. While I like the product, it does not seem to moisturize as deeply as my Vaseline Total Moisture Coca Radiant. And believe me, my skin requires as much moisture as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product is not a total fail for me. I was at the beach recently and made a last minute decision to take this Spray &amp; Go with me. Keeping in mind that this product is in a can, I toss it in with some almost completely frozen bottles of water and headed out to the beach. Okay, this moisturizer has become a must-have beach/pool item for me. Coming out of the water even ashier than usual due to the salt water and chlorine, this is really great to just spray on and look half-way presentable until you can get back to your hotel. Amazing! Living so close to the beach, I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase this Spray &amp; Go moisturizer to keep in my beach bag for any last minute beach/pool trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*While I received these products complimentary from Influenster, the thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am writing this review to enter the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. I think the product is great for when I am in a rush and need to just \\&quot;spray and go\\&quot;. It sprays out a fine mist and I can quickly rub it in. I don&#x27;t think I am an overall fan of the scent or the lasting ability of the moisture. But when I am in a rush and have to run out this does the job.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product. The concept, packaging and commercials for it were appealing and made me hopeful. The overall performance of the product was as described. The issue I have with it is the moisturizing aspect. The lotion sprays on and absorbs quickly but my skin does NOT feel moisturized at all. I am not sure what they can change to make it better but I was disappointed</li>
    <li> I usually put lotion or oil on after I shower Vaseline Spray and Go saved me time and worked just was well as my other lotions. I received a free sample to try from Influenster and I&#x27;m happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product. It will not replace my night time lotion, but it has become my new daytime moisturizer. Although, the price is a little steep. I would love an unscented kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I recently got to try this product free from influenster.com and I absolutely love it. The spray is super easy to apply and it dries quickly, so there is very little mess on my hands and I can go back to the tasks I was doing before. I also love how well it moisturizes and that it leave my skin feeling soft and silky. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! makes my skin super soft and smells amazing! i would highly recommend this product to any one</li>
    <li> I love lotions and use them all the time.  But sometimes I just don&#x27;t have time to sit and wait for my skin to dry so i can get dressed and for that reason, i occasionally forego using moisturizer when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  Then i was introduced to Vaseline Spray and Go moisturizer.  I love this stuff.  It is so easy to use, just spray up and down your arms, legs, and body, wipe in quickly and you are ready to go!  Within just a matter of SECONDS, you can go from dry skin to moisturized!  No waiting for it to dry to get dressed.  I was very skeptical that this product would work as well as i had seen in commercials.  I figured it would either not dry nearly as quickly as was claimed, or it would do a terrible job moisturizing my skin or something else would be just horrible about it, maybe the scent would be awful or maybe it would be very greasy.  I had absolutely none of the problems that i was concerned about.  It has a nice clean scent, is super easy to apply, sprays on easily and dries in seconds, does a great job of moisturizing my skin and leaves it soft and silky feeling with no greasy residue at all.  I love this product.  I will not be replacing my regular non spray lotion with it, but only because i love using lots of different lotions.  However, this is my new go to product when i am either in a hurry or when i just don&#x27;t feel like taking the time to rub in regular lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. However, this does not effect my opinion at all.  I am under no obligation to write a positive review of this product.  All expressed is my personal opinion.  I received a bottle for free but have since went out and bought two other bottles so that I could try all three varieties as i like it that much!!!</li>
    <li> I like the product because it applies evenly and dries quickly.  I would like to try other scents since I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell of this particular one.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, smells great, dries within seconds! I&#x27;ve always been pretty bad about moisturizing until I got this product in my VoxBox last month. I live in a humid area, and this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t make you feel sticky after application!</li>
    <li> So easy to use. It&#x27;s great to throw into a bag and use on the go, because it dries super fast!</li>
    <li> I like the easiness of this product but it really is not anything special. I wish it would have SPF in it and its greasy after applied.&lt;br /&gt;Again, nothing to fancy with this product besides the quickness it offers when applying lotion. SPF should really be included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve received this Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster. This review is used to enter into a Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> So I received a bottle of Vaseline spray and go from Influenster to try and I love it! fast easy and smells fresh! I love that you can spray it on.</li>
    <li> I loved this product!  It was very easy to use and soaked right in with minimal hand/lotion contact.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and perfect for after shower.</li>
    <li> I love this. It goes on easy, absorbs quickly, and saves so much time. It smells great, and I&#x27;m super picky when it comes to scents. Totally worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not picky at all when it comes to lotion. Its that soft creamy stuff you use to make your skin soft when its not. I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time, or money on my moisturizer. In fact the last time I had to buy new lotion was over a year ago, and I still have some left. So when Influenster.com sent me this product free to try I wasn&#x27;t exactly knocked off my socks, its lotion right? Well I have been converted. I will never buy another pump lotion again. First off, this stuff smells so good its stupid. It doesn&#x27;t smell like fancy flowers or some overpowering scent that will clash with my perfume. Its just a light, pleasant scent that I can&#x27;t get enough of. And I hate how things stick to me after I apply lotion, whereas this stuff dries fast enough that I don&#x27;t have that annoyance any longer. This is a super cool idea and well executed, I can&#x27;t help but feel that, though I&#x27;ve began using lotion more often, I&#x27;m actually using less product to moisturize my skin. I love this stuff and so does my boyfriend. Its small enough to carry with me for photo shoots to keep my legs shiny and soft, and it takes little to no time to apply. (I don&#x27;t even have to sit down to use it!) Definitely my favorite lotion now by far, I highly recommend you check it out, especially if lotion is one of those things that like me, you find to be an annoying and unnecessary part of your routine. I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference in the softness of my skin, mostly due to my willingness to apply lotion more regularly. My legs are thanking me for it!</li>
    <li> So easy to use not only on me but my 3 year old it so nice and handy i love this and will only buy this....</li>
    <li> I received my Vaseline Spray and Go complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I am really enjoying this product.  It is easy to use, has a nice scent, is fast and the spraying mechanism, though loud (my kids say it sounds like a robot lol)is nifty!  it sprays a fine, even mist and is easily rubbed in and absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion can be sprayed onto any area that needs moisturizing one spot at a time, you can set the bottle down and rub the mist into your skin.  You won&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky and you won&#x27;t have to wait to get dressed. This eliminates so many steps it isn&#x27;t even funny! No more pumping or scraping lotion into your hands, rubbing your hands together and slathering it onto your skin till you&#x27;re dry, now just spray, rub, dress and go! Nice and fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Though I was given this product for testing and reviewing purposes, this review includes my experience with this product, your experience may differ. I was not paid by Vaseline or Influenster for this review in any way.*</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer compliments of my Influenster Vox Box. (I hope I win the Brand Challenge!) I am not going to lie- sometimes I skip moisturizing after my shower because I am in a hurry.  I am usually trying to get my shower and get dressed while my baby girl is napping.  This new spray lotion from Vaseline makes it easy and quick for me to moisturize after a shower.  I just do a quick spray, rub it in a little, and get dressed!</li>
    <li> This is a really convenient product to use. It is like any other lotion but it is fast to use. It moisturizes ok. It has no sticky residue and drys fast!</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary in a VoxBox from Influenster. I absolutely LOVE this lotion, and may not ever buy a different one again. You literally spray it on, rub it in and go! It dries almost instantly, leaving you moisturized and smelling good with no \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling you normally get from lotion. I actually look forward to applying my lotion now :)</li>
    <li> Who would have thought someone would come out with a lotion that comes out of a can?  I actually love it, and it works!</li>
    <li> I love this new spray and go lotion it is ingenious! Spray it on it on quick rub in and done non greasy quick drying so you can get dressed quicker and be on the go! One thing I would love if they made a purse size one that would be amazing! great also because the top locks so if your traveling no worries about a lotion mess when you open your suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my complimentary Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer from Influenster I am entering a contest the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin but rarely use lotion. I find even baby lotion is too greasy and just sits on top of my skin. With that bring said, I love this stuff. I use it two or three times per day and each time I just spray it on, rub it in and then wait about thirty seconds. By then it&#x27;s dry and my skin and silky smooth. I have no issues with greasiness or leftover residue. I can even go to the gym and sweat and I cannot tell I just applied lotion. Every bit absorbs in to the skin. I will def be purchasing this.</li>
    <li> As a busy young mom, I don&#x27;t have much time to get ready when I get a rare night out. Vaseline Spray &amp; Go makes it easier to moisturize my skin when heading out because I can spray it right on, put my clothes right on, and head right out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am enetering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I got this product from my Sugar and Spice VoxBox from Influenster... i seriously don&#x27;t use this product every time i need some moisture my legs, or arms, etc... i think its more of a go to the beach get wet, spray some of this and your done.. i don&#x27;t consider this product an everyday to go lotion, but its really good, i do recommend it, it has an amazing smell, i do own other Vaseline normal lotions and i&#x27;m happy with them as well as this spray and go one.</li>
    <li> I honestly thought this product would be more lasting. And plus i still look really ashy!! So its \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but i wouldnt purchase it</li>
    <li> I was interested in this product because I use lots of moisturizer especially during the dry winter months. This product comes in a can that looks like a hair mousse can.  I opened up the nozzle and sprayed it on to my arm.  After that I rubbed it in to my skin and it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.  The smell of it was good. Very mild and not overpowering. I liked the idea of spray-on moisturizer in a can though.  If you&#x27;re in a hurry and just want to give yourself a quick spritz it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> Can I just start by saying that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I love it???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I suffer from eczema and staying moisturized is a major concern for me. Anything that helps with that is a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is designed to spray from any angle!!! Yes, ANY Angle!! Even upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.There isn&#x27;t an over bearing scent so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray is continuous and steady. It covers well and leaves no greasy residue! I will definitely by using this product from now on!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed trying out the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go, which I received complimentary from Influenster.  If you hate wasting time when getting ready, this product will definitely help you out a bit.  What I love about it is that it dispenses just the right amount in a light mist, so there&#x27;s no goopey mess to deal with.  Another great feature of this product is that unlike the big lotions that usually have pumps that don&#x27;t travel well, the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go has a twist/lock feature so that it won&#x27;t accidentally spray when you pack it.  It&#x27;s smart, easy, and fun to use.  I recommend to anyone who wants to streamline their regimen of getting ready.  By the way, I&#x27;m writing this review as part of a Brand Challenge for Influenster with the chance to win a prize :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product and the idea that it sprays.  It goes on nicely and absorbs really great after rubbing it in.  Not greasy at all.  It has a nice fragrance.  I tend to use this at night before bedtime. I like that it doesn&#x27;t get my sheets greasy.  I like the scent, it&#x27;s very nice!  Going to try the other fragrances too!</li>
    <li> If you have mildly dry skin, this is the way to go! Quick and easy, goes on evenly, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and by writing this review, I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I am so happy the Vaseline brand created a spray and go Moisturizer. This is a great product for hard to reach areas that require Moisturizer. Great for after bath, on the heals of your foot and all over. I&#x27;m such a fan now and a loyal Customer. We purchased a can for every family member.</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of testing this product out, courtesy of Influenster SugarNSpice VoxBox, and I really like it.  No joke, I&#x27;m telling you this stuff is great.  Normally I only seem to have time to moisturize my face and arms, but with this ingenious product I&#x27;m able to moisturize my legs and thighs in seconds and it dries by the time I have to put my clothes on for work. I like this product so much I&#x27;m hoping to win my Brand Challenge so I can win more fun products (I&#x27;m almost out of my Spray and Go so I need another!!!).</li>
    <li> I love the Vaseline Spray and Go. It smells WONDERFUL and it is so easy to moisturize.  Spray and the lotion is on your skin and just rub it in.  I love this so very much and I feel so pampered when I use my bottle of Spray and Go! I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> The pure oat extract is my favorite. I was given this by influenster and I think it was one of my favorite things I received. I love that it can be sprayed at any angle. It soaks in fast and there is no greasy residue. A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad this was finally invented lol. I received a free bottle of this stuff from Influenster to try out. So far I love it. It&#x27;s so easy to spray, wipe down, and the get dressed right away. The smell is subtle and it leaves no residue. My only issue is that I&#x27;m sometimes spraying the walls with lotion when trying to spray places like the back of my arms. I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize from Vaseline!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff! My skin is always horribly dry because I hate the greasy feel of lotions, especially when I&#x27;m getting dressed. But then I got this stuff from Influenster and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s way easier to apply. The mist applies evenly, and the product is not thick and greasy--it&#x27;s thin and absorbs super fast (as compared to a lotion). This is the only moisturizer than I can stand to use on my legs.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer was very easy and quick to use.  However, I have very dry skin so this was insufficient to provide me the moisture I needed.  It also smells very nice and light.</li>
    <li> I received this Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer from Influenster as a complimentary gift to review. I am beyond happy with this product! I love love love the fact that you spray it. It drys super fast no waiting and most important NO STICKY feeling :D There is NO MESS!!! I also used it at night on my son after his shower and for the first time I had no complain. That is his favorite lotion he does not want me to use anything else on him.  The spray does not get stuck which I found amazing! I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize because I truly love this product! Oh it also smells good!</li>
    <li> Really light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky or greasy. Perfect for hot days when you want to use moisturizer, but can&#x27;t bear the heavy stuff.</li>
    <li> Sprays easily and absorbs in seconds. Feels refreshing especially in the warmer weather without having to rub in heavy cream. Its just spray and go. Love the scent!</li>
    <li> I recently had a chance to review this new Vaseline spray cream through Influenster.com and have to say that I absolutely love it! It dries fast and makes your skin feel amazing! A must for anyone who likes soft but doesn&#x27;t have time to wait for it to dry!</li>
    <li> This product makes moisturizing a breeze! No greasy application, no getting excess product on your hands, and no waiting for it to dry. Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer has become a staple in my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> I love the new Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer!  It&#x27;s easy to use with a twist close top, so you can throw it in your bag for that quick overnight getaway. It sprays evenly and soaks in quickly leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth with out the greasy film other moisturizers leave behind.  I am out in the sun alot durning the summer months and I am so glad to have found a lotion that is quick and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Although I would have preferred a fruity or floral scent, I do find that Vaseline&#x27;s new Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer is a wonderful product. It&#x27;s easy to apply, plus super-fast! Unlike traditional moisturizers, you don&#x27;t have to scoop and self-apply. You can quickly spray this moisturizer on yourself and lightly rub it in. It rubs in relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a lot of moisturizer, because I have sensitive skin. This moisturizer sprays a fine mist, leaving just enough moisturizer on the skin. The smell is light and pleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin. I like a moisturizer that really leaves a strong scent on my skin, so my husband can complement on how great I smell later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this moisturizer leaves your skin so soft. It&#x27;s a new essential for travel. It&#x27;s also perfect for dry skin on kids. It&#x27;s just a really fast working moisturizer, because you don&#x27;t have to scoop or pump to apply. I was able to very quickly apply this to my daughter&#x27;s skin and send her on her way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product. At around $6.00, it&#x27;s adequately priced. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see it on sale this summer or find some coupons and at that point we&#x27;ll stock up. I just don&#x27;t think there is a better moisturizer for travel, especially when camping or traveling where kids will be in shorts and soaking up the sun. This is perfect for after sun care, something to apply after a bath, when kids are ready for bed, and after they&#x27;ve washed off their sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this lotion in the Sugar and Spice Voxbox from @influenster.com. I tried it and thought it was just ok. The lotion it&#x27;s self is great...I just don&#x27;t like the application of it. Just seems like you&#x27;re spraying more than just your legs or arms or whatever.</li>
    <li> I hate it when I put on a lotion and my hands feel sticky and greasy forEVER afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vaseline Spray and Go was perfect!  It didn&#x27;t make my hands sticky and greasy, it went on quickly, and it soothed my itchy dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer is the best thing!  I will not use regular lotion again.  I just spray this lotion on and it dries quickly leaving my skin so smooth and moisturized.  Who would have thought vaseline could be in a spray?  Well, it is.  You must try this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of spray lotion, it felt sticky and slimy and the smell was equally off putting.  Not a product I would recommend or buy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s so easy and quick to use.  It makes my skin feel silky smooth, and I love the smell.  I did get this product to try from Influenster.  It seems a little on the pricey side, but I do like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I really liked this, went on super easy and hydrated just like the normal Vaseline lotion does!! The only thing, a little over spray onto the floor...but its cool!! I don&#x27;t mind!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s about time someone put lotion in an easy to use spray bottle. This is perfect for on-the-go lifestyle. I need to moisturize and go, I don&#x27;t need to deal with lotiony-slippery hands and this is the solution. It just plain works. And the husband discovered it and I catch him using it all the time too! Perfect for the kiddos too. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I received this product complementary from Influenster in their Sugar N&#x27; Spice Voxbox and was asked to try it for a month before reviewing. I used this regularly after my shower and before getting dressed. I found that the product had a very strong smell, not unpleasant, just strong. The container was light weight and was easy to hold and use, sort of like the spray on sunscreen some companies make. I found that the product did absorb quickly, but that it left my skin feeling thirsty and dry after about 10 minutes. Personally, I do not care for the product as I have dry skin and I found the sent to be a bit overwhelming. I do concede that for someone with oily skin or for people that hate that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling some lotions leave behind, this might be a good fit for you. At this point, it&#x27;s all preference. I will say, as most Vaseline products, this one if FULL of parabens and other not so great for you ingredients. My advice is to do your research and decide for yourself. Good luck and happy shopping!</li>
    <li> If you have normal skin and want to quickly put on some lotion and go then this is the product for you. You can spray the lotion directly onto your body but I found that it was easier and less wasteful to spray it into my hand first. You need to rub it in a little either way, and you probably don&#x27;t want to spray your face. My kids think it feels a little cold and weird if I spray directly onto their body so I rub it in with my hand instead. I really like this lotion but it isn&#x27;t super moisturizing so it wouldn&#x27;t be good for dry skin. I use the tub Vaseline for that purpose. With those two products you have pretty much all your needs covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is fast and easy and a really nice amount of lotion comes out. It&#x27;s not white or glopy; nice and smooth fine mist that comes out. Surprisingly not oily.</li>
    <li> I honestly saw the commercial for Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer the first time and was like wow that is the best product ever I have to try it out because I am soooo lazy when it comes to moisturizing and I&#x27;m always in a rush in the morning. I also hate trying to get lotion on my back, let alone getting it all rubbed in a dry before I try to get dressed. The first time I used it I figured so this is going to be like those aerosol sunscreen products I guess, which I love but can tend to make a mess and are better used outside if you want to keep you&#x27;re carpet clean and also can leave you a sticky mess for a bit. I&#x27;ve been seeing some bloggers talking about how they want to try it but are weary because of that reason. SO NOT TRUE! The spray actually is more controlled and hits the spots you are spraying and doesn&#x27;t make a huge mess. It&#x27;s also more of a fine mist so it really does absorb quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky just like they claim. I highly recommend you give the product a try because I am 100% sure you are going to like this product. I now am moisturizing each morning and it&#x27;s totally improving my skin. I am and will now forever be a regular purchaser of Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer Total Moisture. I got this free from Influenster!</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed and nice</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Works a treat.</li>
    <li> A nice solid moisturizer that goes on light. I use it daily on my legs and arms. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use. I have really dry skin and only supplement with a heavy duty moisturizer on my hands (they get extra dry from dish washing).</li>
    <li> I thought this was the answer to my prayers. It says it is non greasy and I thought I could easily lotion my back with it. Unfortunately I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is loud when spraying and you have to rub it in still. I had to go back over everything with my normal lotion after using this product because I didn&#x27;t feel moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like the way it applied, but the more I used it and figured out the technique I love it.</li>
    <li> I love how easy to use this product is, and guess what...NO GREASE! I just got mine a bit ago and it&#x27;s already gone :)</li>
    <li> My fault that I didn&#x27;t read all the details and instructions prior to purchase. I thought this was just a light spray on lotion and it is...however, it&#x27;s still expected that after spraying it on, you will rub it into the skin. Well, what the point in a spray, if you still have to rub it in? The whole point for me was to be able to spray this on my back and go. So, this is really no different than a cream moisturizer that has to be rubbed in. I don&#x27;t get it and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was asked how to put lotion on your back during dry months.  This was my answer and he really liked it.</li>
    <li> I was personally disappointed in the Vaseline Spray and Go because I found it hard to spray unless I&#x27;m very weak. It does spread nicely though.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Goes on easy and dries very quickly! Perfect for those days that you&#x27;re in a hurry! I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> This has been such an awesome product!! You just spray it on and go about your day, it&#x27;s amazing!!!!! I received this in my Influenster VoxBox to review and I&#x27;ve used it everyday since!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is so easy to use and i love the ease i get from finally being able to reach my back on my own. I got to try this product for free from influenster.</li>
    <li> I received this in my Influenster Sugar n Spice Voxbox. I was amazed at the concept of spraying on my body lotion after showering. I was super impressed at how light and non greasy it was. It dried super fast! It is the BEST idea EVER!! I &lt;3 it!!!</li>
    <li> I received one of these free from Influenster and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It smells GREAT, feels good going on, makes my skin feel so soft AND it dries so quick! :)</li>
    <li> My skin is really sensitive and breaks out when I use lotion. This spray makes my skin so soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. I honestly did not expect this product to live up to any of its claims. Well I was put in my place, wasn&#x27;t I? It really DOES absorb quickly, and it really ISN&#x27;T greasy at all. Plus it moisturizes as well as you&#x27;d expect a Vaseline product to, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> This is my new goto lotion.  my daughter loves the smell. She comes in from school and puts some on.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray N&#x27; Go is so amazing!  I love these ease of use the continual spray offers, it even sprays upside down!  It applies so quickly and then absorbs super quick!  I didn&#x27;t think it would work to help keep my skin moisturized so well but it blew me away!  Afterwards my skin is smooth and soft without any greasiness!  Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this awesome product through Influenster free to review and I&#x27;m entering the brand challenge for Vaseline!.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of this product I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it helps when I don&#x27;t want to get my hands full of lotion. It&#x27;s moisturizing and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and is quick and easy to use! it does not leave your hand feeling oily! if youre on the go and need a quick moisturizing in the morning (or at night), this is the product for you</li>
    <li> I can honestly say, I don&#x27;t care for it much. It didn&#x27;t save quite as much time as I was hoping it would because you still have to rub it into your skin after spraying it on. But putting on lotion is a relatively quick process anyways. It does absorb quickly but dries out just as fast. I prefer the regular Vaseline lotions to the Spray and Go because the moisture lasts all day. Plus, it&#x27;s hard to spray your skin without spraying the floor and any nearby furniture. The one thing I liked about using the Spray and Go is that it made putting lotion on my (overly active) toddler a bit easier. He likes to wiggle and dance through the process so it was easier to just spray him down instead. I just wish it would last longer.**I received the Vaseline Spray and Go free from Influenster for testing purposes and am entering into a Brand Challenge by posting.**</li>
    <li> I  have a love/hate relationship with body moisturizers. I love them because they keep my skin soft, and I don&#x27;t get dry, itchy skin. I hate them because I they sit on the surface of my skin and take forever to absorb, if they do at all! So, I am happy to report that Vaseline has made a product to mend my relationship with moisturizers. Spray &amp; Go has a a continuous spray action that allows you to cover your body in seconds. Once your done applying all you need to do is briskly rub the lotion in and you&#x27;re good to go! The moisturizer absorbs instantly.The only downside would be over-applying moisturizer. If you tend to go over a spot that you already covered, or decide to do a second coat, you may not get the instant absorption that you got the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Originally posted at [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> i got this in an influenster voxbox.  i love the way it smells and it&#x27;s easy to use.  my only issue is that there is a lot of over spray, meaning when i spray my legs a fair amount sprays over onto the floor making it slippery.  it&#x27;s a very light moisturizer as well, good for warmer weather.</li>
    <li> If you actually have dry skin this is not he product for you...however for a quick spray on regular skin , you might be ok. Ill take it to the beach or pool.</li>
    <li> I like that it does absorb quickly and is extremely convenient, quick to put on and easy to throw in a bag for on the go.  I also like to use it on my two year old, I can hold her there with one hand and spray her down with the other :)  Makes it a lot easier to get lotion on her at this stage. I received a bottle of Vaseline Spray &amp; Go in an Influenster Voxbox to try for free.</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer in my Sugar &#x27;N Spice VoxBox from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t heard about this product before actually testing it out and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect fully. I was beyond impressed with the product and that it leaves the skin soft without the greasy feeling that comes with applying most lotions. It sprays on super easy and a quick swipe and I&#x27;m on the go. The smell is very pleasant and I find myself using this often because it&#x27;s easy to apply. I would always pass off the lotion because I didn&#x27;t want my hands all greasy or was in a hurry and just didn&#x27;t have time to sit and apply lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since bought more using coupons that I found in the newspaper. My own complaint is the pricing on it seems a little steep, but when using a coupon it helps to reduce the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!!!!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This product is great! It applies super easy (just spray), smooths mover skin without making your hands greasy, absobs into skin within seconds and smells great. This product works as well as other vaseline products but the major difference is that you don&#x27;t have to go digging at the bottom of the container or squeezing a tube to death to catch the last ounce of lotion. In the end, this product may cost slightly more than other comparable ones but the simplicity of it all is well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Total Moisture free from Influenster for testing purposes and love it. It sprays in a nice continuous mist and has never gotten clogged.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  It does not irritate my skin or sting when I put it on after shaving.  I like the light scent and it leaves me moisturized all day.  I want to try the Cocoa Radiant one next and am entering to win one for free through the Influenster Brand Challenge![[ASIN:B009RNUH4A Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer in Total Moisture, 6.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I have been using Vaseline&#x27;s Spray and Go for a month now and actually really like it. I use it in the mornings after a shower and my body feels moisturized throughout the day. I do really like that it still works well upside down. My only con is that I often get the lotion on my floor when I&#x27;m trying to spray my feet and/or legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a complimentary Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I love that this lotion sprays on- it saves a lot of time versus rubbing it in!  Simplifies my morning (and evening) routine! The scent is nice and the product seems to work well and cover evenly!&lt;br /&gt;(I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.)</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray &amp; Go is great for quick on the go moisture. I think that it is effective on dry skin and would definitely use it in the future, but I tend to go for thicker lotions that are more effective on super-dry skin, especially in winter. Spray &amp; Go is great for on-the-go or light moisture. I could definitely see myself taking this on vacation (if I was checking a bag)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> Best lotion on the market! Goes on clean easy and dries fast! Love it! My kids love getting lotion on now! Pick it up today!</li>
    <li> I got this to try complimentary from Influenster. At first I was apprehensive about a product like this but at my first spray, I was hooked. Now, it isn&#x27;t just SPRAY and GO! No, you spray, rub in, and it dries to a non-tacky finish. I&#x27;d love to try some of the other scents and formulas they have. I&#x27;d definitely buy this for myself in the future.</li>
    <li> Tried this product after receiving it via an Influenster VoxBox. I was curious to try it because i am a big fan of spray on sunscreen. I thought this was just ok for a few reasons. It&#x27;s not pleasant to spray on after a hot shower because it comes out very cold. It makes your hands very greasy so be sure to spray it all over first and then rub, don&#x27;t try to do one body part at a time because the greasiness of your hands makes it hard to spray. It also ends up all over the floor when you spray so make sure you stand over a bath rug when you use it.</li>
    <li> I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary in my sugar &#x27;n spice voxbox from influenster.com.  I was really impressed with the ease of use that comes with using a spray on lotion.  It wasn&#x27;t at all greasy but left my skin feeling nice and soft. It also dried really quickly, which is definitely a plus!  The only thing bad about the Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer was the scent.  I received the pure oat extract and it had sort of a stale scent to it.  If the other scents have the same moisturizing abilities I would love to try them!</li>
    <li> I love most of Vaseline brand products but this is by far my favorite! It&#x27;s really easy to use and has great consistency when it goes on. My favorite feature is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or rub off on my clothes!</li>
    <li> It applies evenly and dries very quickly.  You can get dressed nearly right afterwards.  I prefer this much better to their regular lotion.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Vaseline Spray and Go lotion for free in my Sugar &#x27;n Spice Vox Box from Influenster. It smelled great (although my boyfriend disagreed) and was really easy to apply, especially in harder to reach areas. It&#x27;s just like spray suntan lotion. It claimed to absorb really quickly, which it does if you just mist it on(which Is plenty of lotion), but if you&#x27;re a little heavy with the spray, it&#x27;ll take as long as any other lotion to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, I&#x27;d love to advocate this lotion, but the price is just a little too high to justify it. If they lowered it to between $3-4 a bottle, I&#x27;d be all in.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer from Influenster and I immediately thought it was a neat item. I am a big fan of Vaseline products as a brand, and their products are usually of high quality. I found that to still be the case with this particular moisturizer as well. I liked the fact that it was a light weight moisturizer because during the summer time, when the weather is horridly humid and nasty where I live, I don&#x27;t like to use heavy products but still like for my skin to be moisturized. I&#x27;m not sold on the retail value, I think I probably need to use it more to come to a final conclusion on that. My only other complaint is that the moisturizer didn&#x27;t stay long when applying a single coat... I needed several coats to ensure that i wouldn&#x27;t have to lotion myself again for some time. Other than that, this may be a product I will purchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> thanks to Influenster i was able to try the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer and while i have never been a huge fan of their lotions in the past, i am happy to say this has given me a better opinion of them.  it is so easy to use which makes it nice for the whole family.  unlike other spray lotions, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy or give you that \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; feeling.  you feel refreshed and revitalized.  you can take it anywhere.  thank you for making such a great product Vaseline.  i will be looking to get more of these in the future!</li>
    <li> Warning if you have daughters buy a couple! We live in a dry climate and all my daughter (who have dozens of lotions) steal this because they love the smell, how fast it goes on and how long it lasts! I&#x27;ll be buying in bulk next time.</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster for free to try out. While this isn&#x27;t the best lotion around, it&#x27;s also not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As far as moisture goes, it definitely was not enough for me. I don&#x27;t have horribly bad dry skin, but I found that I had to apply this a few times in about an hr to equal up to the amount of moisture I need. It sprays on cold. It&#x27;s quite the shock when you get out of the hot shower and you zap yourself with this lotion. I tried it on my 3 yr old son and he literally started crying because it was so cold he thought it was hurting him. It doesn&#x27;t last that long. That could be because I had to use it so often to make it work for me, but it was gone pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It does smell really good. I actually found myself randomly smelling my arm throughout the day. Which could be a good thing or a bad thing, bad because you look like a lunatic smelling yourself all day long. It does shorten the amount of time needed to moisturize. Not for me since I had to apply it so many times, but for a normal person it probably would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you don&#x27;t need a lot of moisture this product would be perfect for you. If you are dry, stay away.</li>
    <li> This product is really good. It drys quick and lasts a really long time. They sell this at walmart for a good price. Im really loving it. I got mine from influenster and im entering the brand challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s so easy to use and quick! It smells really good, and doesn&#x27;t give a greasy or slimy feeling. It keeps my body moisturized for hours, which is really important for me, since I have dermatitis. My legs really really dry and itchy and this really helps a lot. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion was absolutely horrible.  First, I do not get the whole spray on concept.  What is so inconvinent about the traditional pump for lotion?  Secondly, this lotion is way too thin and watery to moisturize my dry skin.  Overall, I had a bad experience with this lotion and would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received the following products from Influenster for testing purposes. I received the Sugar &#x60;N Spice Vox Box 2013.&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer Total Moisture, priced at $7.99 for 6.5 oz. can. This product is great for quick moisturization. It sprays on nicely and smells really great. It absorbs really quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy. It is light so, probably not very effective for seriously dry skin. Be careful to spray it over a rug or towel as it can make the floor slippery.</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me as a part of the Influenster program! This is one of the first body moisturizers that I felt didn&#x27;t leave me sticky or come back out onto my body when I sweat. I love the fresh scent and the way my skin looks after using it! Amazing product and would definitely repurchase!!!</li>
    <li> After seeing commericals for this product, I was very interested in trying it. Loved it! Definitely dried quickly, was easy to use, and left my skin feeling moisturized. I received your Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I love vaseline spray and go. It&#x27;s super easy to apply, and goes on without any oily residue so you can spray and slip into your jeans without the gunky wet feeling.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It works just like it says it will! It smells good, and it rubs in fast and easy. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  Its so easy to use and leaves my skin feeling amazing.  my legs were super smooth and silky.  when i checked it out at the store the price is totally reasonable for what you get...it was only a couple of dollars.  The only complaint I have is that when it sprays on its a little messy.  Thank you influenster for giving me the opportunity to try this lotion.</li>
    <li> The Vaseline Spray and Go is a fantastic moisturizing product to use when you&#x27;re in a rush and you need your legs and arms feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> I got this product through Influenster. I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it as I have hardwood floors and I envisioned myself slipping accross the floor as I tried to spray it. It wasn&#x27;t that way though, and after a couple sprays I got the hang of it. Great for on the go, but it won&#x27;t replace my regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Goes on easy and dries very quickly. Great for humid summer months! Leaves skin soft and smooth :)</li>
    <li> love it! smells great and is not greasy :) definitely will be re purchasing this product! i highly recommend, easy on the go spray</li>
    <li> This product is extremely convenient for on the go use. No mess and very moisturizing. It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I received this through Influenster to try for free. I was not disappointed. I love how soft it makes my legs after shaving. It smells great, absorbs quickly, is easy to apply, and isn&#x27;t greasy. The only small thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that it does get on surrounding areas, so laying down a towel is recommended. I hope to win more from the brand challenge at inflenster.com!</li>
    <li> this product goes on easy and quickly. it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized. i love it. i can easily take it with me to school, work, and the gym. being a full time college student and worker makes for a busy life and this product fits right in. i reccommend it to anyone who uses a moisturizer on a daily basis</li>
    <li> This product works nicely, refreshing scent, easy to use, cooling effect, absorbs quickly into skin, and it applies smoothly via the spray. There was no clumping, clogging or anything of the sort to clean up, it didn&#x27;t leave any leftover residue either. Quick and effective. As the mother of a wiggle monster, this was fast enough that even my little one couldn&#x27;t run away, now she tries to apply it herself :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I amentering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize...However, all opinions expressed are my own and truthful.</li>
    <li> I love how this stuff works! It makes your skin silky smooth and it&#x27;s so easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t leave you all sticky like some lotions do and it&#x27;s just all around the perfect product.</li>
    <li> As a lotion goes it functions just fine and is as easy to use as you make it. Be sure to hold it pretty close to your skin to avoid any overspray, as it can get kind of messy. Non-greasy, smells good, and moisturizes well, but not something I would buy at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on and off for a few months now. I think if you want something you can spray on and run out the door then this is for you. I don&#x27;t find that it moisturizes any better than regular lotion. I do like it for my arms because I can spray it on the way out. I still like regular lotion for night time before bed. The biggest thing is this - do you pay more for the convenience of it? How much is that worth to you?</li>
    <li> I was expecting to LOVE this product but it always left my fresh shaven legs with stubble bc the mist is SO cold!</li>
    <li> I love the new Vaseline Spray &amp; Go. It really is super convenient and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy and gross. This is my new favorite way to moisturize!</li>
    <li> Such a nice product. Goes on so easily and smells amazing. Just bought 3 more.</li>
    <li> I keep it by my chair and put it on my arms everyday.  My old skin is getting crinkley.  It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it does look better.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday take with  bag for after swimming</li>
    <li> Gets the job done when you&#x27;re in a rush. In the wintertime you will need something heavier, as this is very light. You still have to rub it in as well. It&#x27;s not just spray and go.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  Not only does it dry fast but it does moisturize your skin.  It smells really good too!</li>
    <li> This product saves you so much time because you dont have to wait for it to dry.  It get those hard to reach places and absorbs instantly.  It moisturizeswell but I would like it to be a little more moisturizing.  This will be great in the summer months because it is light and cool on the skin when you spray</li>
    <li> This is a great way to moisturize hard to reach places fast (like your back).  What&#x27;s not so great is the fact that it uses potentially dangerous ingredients like parabens that shouldn&#x27;t really be slathered on your body.  If it wasn&#x27;t such an all over body product, I might want to use it.  I&#x27;m just too nervous. I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try for free from Influenster.  I like it! It is easy to use, and the smell is pleasant.  After a shower, it sprays on quick and just a few rubs and it is absorbed and you are ready to dress.  Like someone else said, be careful when using on a smooth surface, the over spray is slippery!</li>
    <li> I love Love Love this lotion, it does what it says and more! I love the way you literally spray and go.  I tried it out when I was rushing out the door and it dried super fast, it also left my skin feeling and looking soft!</li>
    <li> Not only do these smell great but they really do absorb quickly, just like they say! I&#x27;ve tried all 3 kinds and love them all equally. I didn&#x27;t know how I would like a spray-lotion at first, but it is definitely easy to use and convenient!</li>
    <li> This product was very easy to use. Spray&#x27;s on and dries quickly for busy mornings. I did find the quality different from regular bottled lotions though. The spray did not hydrate my skin the same. For days when your are in a rush this is the best hands down otherwise i&#x27;m sticking with my regular lotions.</li>
    <li> The idea of a spray lotion sounded kind of weird since you have to rub lotion in to get the best moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I really think this is very moisturizing and goes on with ease! You still have to rub it but barely. It&#x27;s so smooth and rubs in very easily and quickly! I also really like the smell</li>
    <li> So i received this vaseline spray in my influenster vox box and I LOVE IT. It goes on with ease and it really does moisturize without the greasy feeling. It is very convenient when you forget to put on lotion. I hope one day they make smaller bottles so i can put it in my purse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color, so I&#x27;ve got a bit of a different perspective. Given that darker skin tones tends to show dryness in the form of \\&quot;ash\\&quot; (my father-in-law always says \\&quot;your heritage is showing\\&quot; when someone&#x27;s ashy. ha!) I like to use thick lotions that I KNOW will keep my skin moist all day. Needless to say, I was a little skeptical of this \\&quot;spray and go\\&quot; moisture. Anything that comes out in the form of a spray would be thin and useless right? Well it really did work! No dryness all day! Now I didn&#x27;t dig deeply into the ingredients, (I&#x27;m scared to look) but for what the brand boasts, it actually does what it says.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturize!!! I like all the scent. So easy and out the door! I received mine in my Influenster box.</li>
    <li> When I first go this I was skeptical about it, but after I gave it a try I actually  really like it! It&#x27;s really nice because alot of times I don&#x27;t have that much time to put on moisturizer but this only takes a couple of seconds to dry.I really recommend this if you are short on time!</li>
    <li> I received Vaseline Spray and go compliments of influencer and let me say this is a product that i will be using this whole summer season. Its very moisturizing to my skin and very fast to apply to the skin. I enjoy using it on a hot day and a cant wait to use it when i go to the beach this summer. I have used just about the whole bottle and it has not malfunctioned and it works just as perfectly as the first day I used it. I cant wait to tell my friends and family about this so they can start using this too!!!</li>
    <li> I love my Vaseline Spray and Go! I received it to sample through Influenster. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was going to absorb in fast or dry non greasy. When I think of Vaseline I think of grease. But I was impressed it dries completely with no greasy residue. It also smells really nice and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I received Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary of Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. The following reveiw is my honest opinion about the product. I have very dry skin and was eager to try it out. What a great innovative product. It sprays on evenly and absorbs quickly leaving my skin super soft (not greasy) and moisturized all day. The only con I would say about this product is to be careful when applying on tiled floors or any other flooring besides carpet because it can cause walking surfaces to become slippery. Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Vaseline&#x27;s Spray and Go Moisturizer works for me. I&#x27;m always on the go and in a hurry. This product allows me to spray on my skin moisturizer. I love that it sprays because I can moisturize those dry areas on my back that I almost have to be a contortionist to reach otherwise. The fragrance is nice and light and perfect for all weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I was given a complimentary can from influenster, I love the product and have already purchased a can to keep on my desk at work. My hands get dry from shelving books and using commercial hand soap. Love it!</li>
    <li> so Fast and so easy to use. Just Spray a mist on and rub it in. simple as that. Just like using sun tan lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it in the morning and it leaves my skin so soft. I am mosturized for most the day but I like to apply 2-3 times a day!!! Loving it!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a product test on my VoxBox from Influenster...  I love it.  It is as simple to use as the product claims to be.  Just spray, rub, and go.  How much easier could it get?</li>
    <li> I get a ton of giggles from the kids as i spray them with this. My daughter, especially, loves this and I think, has single handedly emptied the canister. I love the smell and the feel of this moisturizer but am not personally a fan of anything that I spray from a can - I prefer the moisturizers I can squirt onto my palm or take a little off from a bottle with my fingers.  So while my little ones are sure to clamor for more, I think this one will not make an appearance at home.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I really like the spray and go. It is super easy to use, I like that I can get it on my back without help. I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I really like this, It gives a little bit of sheen. The only con is that it&#x27;s really expensive if you buy it at the drug stores.</li>
    <li> I received your Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster. Since receiving this product, it sits on the edge of my bath tub so that I will remember to use it each day. I love it, it&#x27;s light and refreshing. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other types of Spray &amp; Go. It is perfect for summer. I only gave it 4 stars, however, because I simply prefer and thicker, more moisturizing lotion or cream in the winter time or when my skin is very dry. The Spray &amp; Go is perfect for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> Bye Bye rub on lotions! I have found a better way to moisturize!  This stuff goes on like silk!  Even the kids love to have it sprayed on them! I can spray my back when no one else is around. It absorbs before I even get dressed.  Plus it smells out of this world amazing! Love the Cocoa Radiant! The best thing is not having to wash my hands after I apply the lotion!  My skin feels rejuvenated after this hard cold winter.  This stuff rocks! You should really try it! I received this as a free sample for being an @Influenster member. I am also entering to win a brand challenge! Woo-Hoo! So what are you waiting for? [[ASIN:B009RNUH8G Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer in Cocoa Radiant, 6.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I love the idea of a spray lotion! It is so convenient especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry. However, it still leaves my skin feeling dry... I wish it provided more moisture...I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> While i received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and i am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. I wanted to say that this worked amazingly! I sprayed on before putting on my wedding dress and it worked fantastic! I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is a must have product year round! It provide fast easy moisture throughout the day. It&#x27;s long lasting and has a very nice fragrance which you have three to choose from. The each are very nice. I recommend this product for anyone who wants moisture throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer is awesome! I really do love it and it really is as easy as the name implies. I will admit, I still love my Bath &amp; Body Works Lotion because it smells amazing, but it is too time consuming and messy to apply daily after my shower. In fact, before this product I NEVER used a moisturizer after my shower in the morning. It was just too daunting a task to undertake. With the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer I dry off, spray on my moisturizer and within seconds my skin is dry and moisturized. I don&#x27;t even take any extra pause getting dressed because it absorbs that quickly! My skin feels softer, so I know it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s just pure magic in a bottle for a price that can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Love that it cuts down on moisturizing time after showering! The spray and go idea was genius! It really does moisturize instantly within seconds as it claims, no greasy feeling after!</li>
    <li> i love this lotion i received a bottle free from influenster sugar &amp; spice voxbox its perfect for a person on the go it soaks in  less than 10 seconds and left my skin feeling soft and supple &gt; I didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy and greasy like a lot of the lotions have in the past . I love the idea of a spray lotion  im always on the go and i can toss it in my bag and not have to worry about the bottle squirting everywhere its light weight and easy to use. Im entering a brand challenge for a chance to win a prize</li>
    <li> I have recieved this complementary from a website called Influenster. This is a lightweight moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my skin and it feels like someone sprayed a cup on water on my skin. It is so wonderful! I love the fact that it is not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch when I use this daily. This is also very useful for travel.</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer from complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes. I was really excited to try this product. I can NEVER remember to put lotion on after a shower. Im a mom and usually am rushing . Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer is so easy to use. I just leave it by the shower and once im done I spray and go! I love that I can put my clothes on almost right away.</li>
    <li> I thought the Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer (Total Moisture)performed ok. It has a nice smell and sprays on evenly.  It really does dry quickly just like the commercials show. I only give it 3 stars because I prefer a much thicker lotion on my skin, don&#x27;t mind waiting for it to dry and I like my lotion a little warm. This sprays out a little bit too chilly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product in my opinion would work great on the go in places outside of my home like at the beach or pool and would feel great on a hot sunny day, but I&#x27;m not ready to trade in my \\&quot;other brand\\&quot; Cocoa Butter Lotion for this yet.</li>
    <li> I got to try this free thanks to Influenster! I love the idea of a lotion that is easy to use, and this lotion lives up to that promise! It&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like, but I will continue to use in addition to my regular brand, on days when I&#x27;m in a crunch for time.</li>
    <li> We got to test this in my Influenster Box and I liked it. It was easy and quick to use and wasn&#x27;t messy or greasy. You still have to rub it in but it makes a nice even coat so it is easy to do. The price point is a little high for our every day use, but on sale I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to use and keeps my skin moist all day. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy at all I can get dressed right after applying.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stop recommending the product. It&#x27;s perfect for summer, very light. Doesn&#x27;t make your skin sticky to not put your clothes on right after. I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the spray part, but it sprays the lotion nicely. My husband even likes the feel of this lotion and the smell is very nice too.</li>
    <li> I really love this, the smell is fantastic. Its so easy to use and quick its a really great product and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works so good and awesome when you are in a hurry. I received a bottle of Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and im entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I got this lotion from the influenster voxbox for promotional purposes. I used it for a few weeks, and then the spray bottle started malfunctioning and spraying lotion in all different directions. The lotion itself is good, moisturizing, not too strong of a scent, and it keeps my skin soft all day. I know the spray part is supposed to make it faster, but i still need to rub it in, and wait a bit before i get dressed. It&#x27;s faster than a non-spray lotion, but not by much.</li>
    <li> I received Vaseline spray and go complementary from influenster and I am sooooo impressed with it.  It sprays on like a spray sunscreen, rub it in, and it dries soooo fast.  I will most definitely buy this product as my future lotions.  PLUS, the price is great.  This will be replacing my bath and body works lotion.  Non greasy and quick!  Win!</li>
    <li> When I saw an ad for this product, I instantly thought \\&quot;Why has no one thought of this before!?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I received a bottle complimentary in my Influenster VoxBox and was thrilled to see it lives up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have freakishly dry skin. Actually, I&#x27;ve had psoriasis since I was five and I am so sick of slathering thick greasy lotions on my body that I have gotten pretty lazy with the whole lotion thing. I use the Vaseline lotion daily! I get out of the shower, spritz spritz spritz, rub it in a little, and I&#x27;m ready to get dressed and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the application is what I love most about it, but it also works quite well as a lotion. It&#x27;s not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t goop up in areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product doesn&#x27;t go away any time soon because I plan on using it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I received this free to try from Influenster but even if I hadn&#x27;t I would&#x27;ve bought it to try just to see if it lived up to the commercial&#x27;s claims that you could get dressed immediately after you used it.  It&#x27;s true!  The lotion sprays in a very light but hydrating mist that sinks in super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any stickiness or grease.  It smells very fresh and I&#x27;m so glad to have tried it.  I am planning on purchasing the cocoa butter formula but I also hope to win one as part of a brand challenge on Influenster.  It definitely lives up to its claims and is a great add to my morning.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  The reason I&#x27;m usually reluctant to use lotion is the drying time, plus it&#x27;s just a gloopy mess.  This moisturizer, though, sinks into skin almost immediately, is easy to apply, and does a good job of hydrating my skin.  I will definitely be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> Great product. Super easy to use. Love the smell. However, if you are looking for a super moisturizing lotion this might not be the product for you; felt like my skin was still dry after use for several days.</li>
    <li> I received your Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this! It&#x27;s so easy to apply and dries super quick. It has a pleasant smell too. I hate perfume smelling lotions so this was perfect for me. It&#x27;s a great time saver and would be perfect for the gym or beach.</li>
    <li> So we all know that Moms have the hardest time finding time for themselves let alone getting 1 hand free. This was a blessing for me as instead of 5-8 minutes of moisturizer (if I am in a rush) this took less than 2. Plus big plus for pregnant mommas because this reaches places and is easier than traditional lotions. Great scent too!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for travel! It&#x27;s so easy to use, you just spray and rub in - and the lotion soaks in fast! The top also locks so you can take it with you when you travel and it won&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Spray &amp; Go moisturizer is a great product. When I received a complimentary sample from Influenster, I was a little skeptical. I&#x27;ve used other spray-type self-tanners and such, but they were all greasy and took forever to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;Not so with this product! I love how fast it absorbs, the smell, and the light moisturizing you get. It&#x27;s just what I want-I don&#x27;t want to feel a layer of lotion!&lt;br /&gt;This product has made it so much easier for me to take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is the price for the amount you get-you run out pretty fast, and it is a lot more expensive than your regular lotion. Wish it came in larger cans, and the price was a wee bit less.</li>
    <li> This is novel product packaging for lotion. It is a continuous spray container, similar to spray-on sunscreen aerosol containers, that is easy to use. The lotion sprays out evenly and is non-greasy. Also, the lotion dries quickly (under 15 seconds), so it is great for those instances when you need to shower and rush to get dressed and get out of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I received The Vaseline Spray &amp; Go for free to test and I have to admit that when I received it I thought it was strange to incorporate moisturizer in a spray can. I thought maybe it would be like spraying shaving cream or something like that, but when I sprayed it on it felt like lotion! What I find though is you do not need to spray a lot on because if you spray a long strip across your arms or legs it will be too much when you rub it in. It dries fast and does not leave you greasy. I really do like this product and I like the smell of it too. I also felt it left my skin extra soft which is something I rarely find in a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster.com and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
    <li> I received my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge. It is amazing. I just had my son and have spent everyday at the hospital at the NICU.  This has helped tremendously with the dryness my hands were undergoing from the constant hand washing.  My hands are soft and smooth.  The ease of use is amazing.  I love not having to squirt it out of a bottle, just spray and go.  It also smells great, it leaves you smelling clean.  This is definitely my new favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> I love that this is simple spray and go though I feel like I do not get as much moisture as I would if I were to use a cream lotion. It is however great to use for children especially when they wont sit still long enough to pump or squeeze repeatly for different areas. With the spray and go you can spray all areas and rub in faster. Making less hassle. So glad I was given a chance to review this from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I got this from influenster for free to try, but I brought another one. This is great for the summer, it is light and great for on the go. It does feel a little greasy at first but that goes away after it completely dry.</li>
</ol>
