<li> There are other websites where you can purchases these for cheaper.  </li>
<li> My only complaint would be that it took two and a half weeks to ship to me.  </li>
<li> I can use less product yet since there&#x27;s less waste through dripping.</li>
<li> These little bottles make it convenient to carry around.</li>
<li> so I just use plain oil on my lips.  </li>
<li> I also purchased the duo with one plain and one swirl.  </li>
<li> But with the price of the jars and shipping it is hard to complain to hard.</li>
<li> I was a little afraid to put expensive perfume in here at first, just in case something bad happened</li>
<li> All in all I got what I needed and it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
<li> Had bad experience with the roller ball not working</li>

    <li> Love these. They do not leak at all.</li>
    <li> Ended up tossing in the trash.  I filled it with an expensive perfume oil only to find out that the roller ball would not budge.  I could not get any of the perfume out and ended up buying a different roller that works perfectly.  I would not recommend this roller.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I envisioned but fits the purpose for what I got it for. I&#x27;ve since been told of a website that sells them for 30 cents each so i&#x27;ll be checking that out next time I need one.</li>

    <li> These are good quality for the price I paid. However, the ball does not roll easily. It is only good to use for perfume or a liquid with water like consistency. The bottle size is about 2 inches in length.</li>

    <li> when I ordered this bottle, I was unaware that essential oils need to be in dark glass bottles--so, minus one star.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the bottles, the top goes on HARD the first time you use it. Of the two bottles I bought, one bottle&#x27;s roller ball keeps falling out--minus one star.&lt;br /&gt;So, my advise, find a better, darker bottle for your essential oils.</li>

    <li> great bottles I use essential oil in them for daily use</li>
