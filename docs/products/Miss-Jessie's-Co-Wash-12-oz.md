      <li>This product is great.</li>
      <li>Not drying so great for curly hair.</li>

      <li>so I&#x27;m extremely pleased and will buy again!  </li>
      <li>Has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>Kind of thinking that my hair does not like this product.</li>
      <li>I love the way it leaves my hair and scalp</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay product</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but I need something thats more sudsy.</li>
      <li>I love the Miss Jessies line of products.</li>
      <li>but this is so much better than what I used before.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff - helps soften my hair and make it curlier.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t need suds, it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Pretty good cleanser.</li>
      <li>Now that I don&#x27;t have dreads anymore I&#x27;ve been using this product on my hair which is fine</li>
      <li>I pretty much should be getting a check for Miss Jessie&#x27;s products because I tell everyone who wants to know how awesome their product is!</li>
      <li>My hair feels great with just enough moisture and easy to detangle in the shower.</li>
      <li>I was taken by surprise to see that this product does not suds because it is sulfate free</li>
      <li>This product just does not seem to clean my hair well.  </li>
      <li>Great for dry hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>She really likes the product and she has tried so many.</li>
      <li>This was the first shampoo I used when going sulphate free</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a new user of some of the Miss Jessie&#x27;s product line, I&#x27;ve used the cleansing creme and although there&#x27;s no sudsing, my hair feels clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>Outside packaging, I love the product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s completely sulfate free.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend with the conditioner!</li>
      <li>Not at all what it claims to do waist of too much money</li>
      <li>but in fact my scalp is clean and not dry since using this product.</li>
      <li>This shampoo left my hair so incredibly soft that most of the time I didn&#x27;t even need conditioner.</li>
      <li>The only downsides are the price and that it doesn&#x27;t lather, so you end up needing a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean.</li>
      <li>Not only does it clean it conditions your hair also.</li>
      <li>and I have the same soft shiny easy to manage results.</li>
      <li>If you have non-cooperative, frizzy wavy or curly hair I highly recommend this line of products.</li>
      <li>The only product that leaves my hair feeling clean without stripping my hair of its natural oils.</li>
      <li>which is all the new rage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair for nearly 2 years.</li>
      <li>It makes the hair soft, shiny, and easier to manage.</li>
      <li>feeling like it&#x27;s not stripped of natural oils.</li>
      <li>but my girls hair is so silky soft after two weeks of using it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Leave-In Condish and Jelly Soft Curls gel for almost a year, and I&#x27;ve been so dissatisfied with regular shampoos for years, but the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; thing just doesn&#x27;t work on my fine, low-porosity 3b/c curls (weighs it down, dampening the curls),</li>
      <li>I was not comfortable with my hair getting as clean as I wanted it.</li>
      <li>I use this particular product and the conditioner daily.</li>
      <li>As soon as I started using this a major portion of my hair problems cleared up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>It defined my curl pattern and left my hair feeling soft.</li>
      <li>I got my order and do not understand why the shampoo was packaged and covered so it wouldn&#x27;t spill, but both the conditioners were not and completely spilled all over everything in the second Box and got everywhere.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through so many shampoo&#x27;s; trying to find something for my delicate, dry hair.</li>
      <li>Shampooing everyday is a big no-no for people of African descent, but this isn&#x27;t shampoo in the true sense; this is a co-wash.</li>
      <li>It does not dry it out.</li>
      <li>She has natural hair and it tends to get a bit dry.</li>

    <li> I got my order and do not understand why the shampoo was packaged and covered so it wouldn&#x27;t spill, but both the conditioners were not and completely spilled all over everything in the second Box and got everywhere. It was leaking through the box. Outside packaging, I love the product.</li>
    <li> Reviewing for my wife a bit ... but she loves the stuff. She has natural hair and it tends to get a bit dry. She really likes the product and she has tried so many.</li>
    <li> I was taken by surprise to see that this product does not suds because it is sulfate free which is all the new rage. Once I didn&#x27;t see any bubbles I mixed it with another shampoo that create suds. I loved this product in combination with a sudsy shampoo. It defined my curl pattern and left my hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> The search is FINALLY over! This is the cleanser I&#x27;ve been looking for all my life! I&#x27;ve been using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Leave-In Condish and Jelly Soft Curls gel for almost a year, and I&#x27;ve been so dissatisfied with regular shampoos for years, but the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; thing just doesn&#x27;t work on my fine, low-porosity 3b/c curls (weighs it down, dampening the curls), so I decided to give this cleanser a shot. This creme cleanser moisturizes my curls, eliminating frizz without weighing them down. My husband even commented on how bouncy my hair looks!</li>
    <li> Great for dry hair and scalp. Must rinse thoroughly.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner left my hair with a weird sticky feeling after it was dry. I don&#x27;t know, maybe is had something to do with the other styling product that I used, but I have never had that reaction before. Kind of thinking that my hair does not like this product. Even after I used it without the styling product if felt like my hair needed something else that the shampoo and conditioner lacked or took away.</li>
    <li> This was the first shampoo I used when going sulphate free and I LOVE it. The only downsides are the price and that it doesn&#x27;t lather, so you end up needing a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean. This shampoo left my hair so incredibly soft that most of the time I didn&#x27;t even need conditioner. I would definitely recommend this to others with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love the Miss Jessies line of products. I dont have overly curly hair but its unruly. In addition to that my hair often lacks shine and is not soft. This product is great. I use this along with the conditioner and Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding. I now get comments on my hair. The only thing that I have a hard time getting used to is the lack of lather. This shampoo does not lather at all. It makes me feel like I am not cleaning my hair but in fact my scalp is clean and not dry since using this product. If you have non-cooperative, frizzy wavy or curly hair I highly recommend this line of products.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for curly ahir. It does not dry it out. Helps prevent fizz.</li>
    <li> I have used this over the last year and I love it. Not only does it clean it conditions your hair also. It rinses out and leaves hair feeling great, looking shiny, and makes your curls bouncy. I just wish Creme De La Curl Cleansing Creme came in larger bottles.</li>
    <li> I love the way it leaves my hair and scalp feeling like it&#x27;s not stripped of natural oils. I will use this forever.</li>
    <li> I pretty much should be getting a check for Miss Jessie&#x27;s products because I tell everyone who wants to know how awesome their product is! I use this particular product and the conditioner daily. Shampooing everyday is a big no-no for people of African descent, but this isn&#x27;t shampoo in the true sense; this is a co-wash. My hair feels great with just enough moisture and easy to detangle in the shower. Here&#x27;s what you need to know: this product will not lather- it&#x27;s completely sulfate free. This co-wash has the consistancy of conditioner. If you&#x27;re curious about my hair type, I am multiracial with a combination of 3c and 4a curl pattern. My hair is also dyed with henna. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new user of some of the Miss Jessie&#x27;s product line, I&#x27;ve used the cleansing creme and although there&#x27;s no sudsing, my hair feels clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. allows me to wear my hair curly for once</li>
    <li> Pretty good cleanser. Has a nice smell. Not drying so great for curly hair. I am just so used to suds that that is the only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product but cleansing creams are not supposed to have suds.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - helps soften my hair and make it curlier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll always miss the suds but this is so much better than what I used before. I&#x27;ve gone through so many shampoo&#x27;s; trying to find something for my delicate, dry hair. As soon as I started using this a major portion of my hair problems cleared up. My hair doesn&#x27;t shed like it did, doesn&#x27;t break like it did. In fact, it brought out some really beautiful textures I didn&#x27;t even know I had, once the damage had ceased. Miss Jessie&#x27;s is a wonderful brand for kinky/curly/coily hair.</li>
    <li> This product is over priced and its detangling power is weak. I could have bought an over the counter product and got the same effect. This product is not worth the price.</li>
    <li> The only product that leaves my hair feeling clean without stripping my hair of its natural oils. I like the fragrance too!</li>
    <li> This product just does not seem to clean my hair well.  There is little lather at all, and I do not think I will order it again.</li>
    <li> It does take some getting used to with it not sudsing and you do use quite a bit but my girls hair is so silky soft after two weeks of using it their hair has gone from dry and brittle so I&#x27;m extremely pleased and will buy again!  Highly recommend with the conditioner!</li>
    <li> Not at all what it claims to do waist of too much money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair for nearly 2 years. I love it. It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it. It makes the hair soft, shiny, and easier to manage. I went through so many shampoos that left my daughters thick hair hard and knotted up. Now that I don&#x27;t have dreads anymore I&#x27;ve been using this product on my hair which is fine and I have the same soft shiny easy to manage results. I do follow up with a leave-in. The product doesn&#x27;t sud so if you aren&#x27;t used co-washing or no sud shampoo you shouldn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Great  shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip all the moisture from your hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product but I need something thats more sudsy. I was not comfortable with my hair getting as clean as I wanted it.If you don&#x27;t need suds, it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
