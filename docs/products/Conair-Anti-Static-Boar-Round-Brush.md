<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ends of this comb are kind of sharp and scratch my scalp, I&#x27;m not a big fan.</li>
    <li> Love it - very sturdy</li>
    <li> Sorry, but I have to add my voice to the critics. I gave it one star because the price is low enough that i don&#x27;t feel guilty just tossing it. First, it is HUGE. Mine measures almost ten inches long, nearly three inches wide, and the space between the teeth is 3/4&amp;#34;. I never saw such a big comb and I wasn&#x27;t pleased at the size but thought, if it works I will live with it. But it didn&#x27;t do anything for me, I have had much better, and smaller, detangler combs, and there is no evidence that it is anti-static. I have a lot of static but the comb had no effect. Worse, as other reviewers said even if it works it isn&#x27;t worth the misery. The comb is a very hard, rigid and inflexible plastic. It has no give at all and is like an assault on the scalp. Those long, large teeth are like shark teeth, pointy and sharp. I accidentally clipped my ear lobe, hard not to do with a comb this size, and took a chunk out of it. One of the reviewers said it is big enough for a horse. I am convinced it would even scratch a horse. I am throwing it out. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Works just like a comb should. Very sturdy and useful</li>
    <li> Best wide-toothed comb for wet hair</li>
    <li> this comb is huge, if you have thick hair, kuddos to you this will work great. As far as thin hair its ok but i wold not buy again if had too</li>
    <li> The wide teeth are just what I need to detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb..A very good comb for a reasonable price as an add-on item.</li>
    <li> I got mine in green, would prefer pink but no big deal. The brush gets the job done. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product cause I was having a lot of problems with flyaway hair, it was really bad and since I got my Anti-static comb , the flyaways are gone .its so much nicer combing my hair now. Thanks again Amazon,  you&#x27;ve done it again. Love my Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how large this comb was when i received it and how wide the space was between the teeth. It made it a little unwieldy. I have long thick hair, so I thought this would be perfect for the shower. Unfortunately due to its size, I could only use about 2/3 of the brush at a time during each stroke through my hair. The tips of the teeth were also surprisingly sharp and hurt my scalp.</li>
    <li> For a three dollar plastic comb, this product is worth far more. It&#x27;s wide teeth help to avoid viscious tangling of breakable hair or to avoid snagging of wet hair. I use it to comb hair after my shower (it&#x27;s best not to use a brush on wet hair) and it gets the job done perfectly. Love it. As it says in the description, you don&#x27;t get to choose your color; mine is turquiose. That did not matter to me in the slightest but it might matter to you.</li>
    <li> Great comb did what it said. Combed thru my daughters and my hair without snagging or pulling. Would buy again an recommend.</li>
    <li> Very Good Product. It has given me no issues.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s enormous! It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but jeez.</li>
    <li> love the wide tooth comb but as far as static goes not so great!And it does work great on tangles....</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Detangles without Static.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok , esp for long hair. Just that I probably did not read the description well enough, this comb is huge. It&#x27;s the length of my forearm. But it does it&#x27;s job well for detangling.</li>
    <li> The teeth were very sharp and i got my comb in pink. But over all this comb is big, and it works great. I just scratches. So be careful. But totally worth the money i paid for it.</li>
    <li> A must for long hair!!!  Very well made and sturdy.  Easily gets out any tangles with very little pull on hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this comb! I am a man with an undercut and fairly long hair on the top. I never found a brush that I loved, and most traditional combs pull on my thin hair. This gives me the flow I want, in the shower with conditioner, on dry hair, even on hair with product in it. Great</li>
    <li> Not really much to say about this except that it&#x27;s exactly what I expected. Works just fine! I am happy.</li>
    <li> My daughter has impossibly tangled hair.  She uses this right after conditioning now and her hair is absolutely manageable now.</li>
    <li> Massive. And blue. And it works.</li>
    <li> Great product. The ends are a little sharps and I got a blue comb, instead of a pink one (like displayed in the picture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it works great for when I&#x27;m brushing my hair through in the shower.</li>
    <li> I really love this comb, it&#x27;s perfect for my thick curly hair. I highly recommend it! Only downside is that you don&#x27;t get to pick which color you get, but luckily I got a blue one.</li>
    <li> this comb is huge. hard to handle. and its not smooth..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use it yet but it came pretty fast. Just your basic comb. Feels very sturdy though.</li>
    <li> It arrived fast and in the color I wanted, pink,  I like use it when I blow dry my hair and sometimes I carry it in my purse</li>
    <li> Bigger than I was expecting, but love it so far. I use it often, and it&#x27;s a great detangling comb. The size is kind of crazy, but it works like it should.</li>
    <li> i have super curly hair that get&#x27;s very tangled every day. i had been using a brush and realized a better comb would be better for my hair. i bought this based on reviews and it&#x27;s great. takes my tangles out easily without hurting me and works great. can&#x27;t beat that for the price!</li>
    <li> Great comb for long hair, got as an add on.</li>
    <li> Not a bad comb but not great. Is firm and is not gonna break on you. Just kind of large and clunky.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;anti-static&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; for that matter, but as a regular comb it&#x27;s good. It works well to brush through curls without messing them up too much,</li>
    <li> This comb has wide teeth,  but the ends of these teeth are pointy and they scratch my scalp.  I have used better combs in the past.</li>
    <li> Love this comb, it really combs out the tangles without tearing your hair out. Nice and sturdy comb!!!!! Like it</li>
    <li> I like this comb, and use it alot. However, I did not find it to be anti-static at all.</li>
    <li> this was terrible I threw it out the rounded ends of the teeth caught my hair and pulled it out. not worth it</li>
    <li> It does what you&#x27;d expect it to do. Great quality and not flimsy at all.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Color is really pretty and comb does good detangling my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great for using it to detangle wet hair after shower. Great on wavy/curly hair. However, the top part of the teeth is a bit sharp; wish it was rounded more thus making it a bit easier on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair with tons of knots. only comb to not snap in half and get all my knots out</li>
    <li> Great for my curly headed toddler</li>
    <li> My granddaughter doesn&#x27;t cry now when we comb her hair!  It&#x27;s amazing what a difference this comb makes.</li>
    <li> This comb is really big . I&#x27;m so happy that it is because I have curly hair and it helps a lot with combing out tangles . I had another one of these 3 years and still going strong. I only wish I could pick out the color now I have 2 blue ones .&lt;br /&gt;Note: I ordered prime so it came packed with all my other items in one box which was awesome and convenient 👏</li>
    <li> The tooth spacing is perfect, but the ends of the teeth are a bit rough/sharp.</li>
    <li> Better than described!</li>
    <li> Great comb for wet hair. A lot bigger than expected.</li>
    <li> Its huge!!  I Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for me as I have VERY long hair.  It&#x27;s amazing how much easier it is to comb out my hair after shampooing.  Would highly recommend!! :)</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have extremely thick, coarse, curly hair and she is particularly sensitive to the sensation of combs and brushes tugging on her tangles. This comb has wide, thick teeth that painlessly unsnarl her hair without combing out the curl. I use it in conjunction with detangling spray, and I&#x27;ve been able to cut down on washings to once a week this way (she also hates hair-washing day, but I&#x27;d been doing it more often just because the conditioner helped control tangles). It&#x27;s quite large, sturdy, and durable. You can also add an elastic band or cord to the hole on top so it can hang from doorknobs, etc.</li>
    <li> The tips of the teeth are too sharp and scrape the scalp. I&#x27;ll keep using my Goody comb that is 10+ years old over this one.</li>
    <li> Very good detangling comb.  It works great on wet hair and does not cause breakage.  Also great for sectioning hair.</li>
    <li> It is great at combing through wet hair. It is very useful and also easy to grip so says my wife (gift).</li>
    <li> Bristles are a tad bit too sharp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb and it functions like a comb should.</li>
    <li> Good product, I use it daily</li>
    <li> Great Detangling comb. Works well on curly hair, no ouches or complaints. The comb is Great for younger kids too.</li>
    <li> ack I should have read the reviews first! It is just too big of a comb for my hair. I thought it would be a good fit since I have dense, thick and tons of hair but it is just too wide to be effective for me. Plus the materials are not pliable at all so it is a bit rough on my scalp. I think this is a good comb if you have very long hair and/or puffy hair.</li>
    <li> So gentile on my hair! It effortlessly glides through my hair right after towel drying. I have almost zero split ends since I&#x27;ve switched from my old brush to this comb!</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t really look too well, I thought it was to hang in the shower, but it has a hole in the top, but it is not a hook. nice comb though!</li>
    <li> Good comb for detangling long wet hair, teeth are somewhat sharp and dig into scalp though.</li>
    <li> Biggest comb I&#x27;ve seen, strong plastic, not easily breakable, good for combing hair without ripping it, also easy on the scalp, I want another.</li>
    <li> The best comb for curly, natural hair. I have one in my shower and one in my purse. Finally, a comb my knots won&#x27;t snap in half. lol</li>
    <li> Great comb! I have thick curly hair and it works like magic</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get a wide tooth comb for quite a while. I have very very thick curly hair and combing is such a pain. I have this and it works wonders!!</li>
    <li> Great use it all the time</li>
    <li> My grand daughter has very curly hair and it tangles so easily. This comb is very sturdy and goes though the hair with ease. Great for Kinks and snarls.</li>
    <li> Comb is large and works well to detangle hair in the shower. No complaints. I received a blue comb.</li>
    <li> This comb is OK.  Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than what you could buy at a Dollar store or a local Beauty supply store.  It was just convenient to add on to my order.</li>
    <li> This comb is great for using on wet hair when you need to comb through your conditioner. I have curly hair and like to use a leave in conditioner and this definitely helps to detangle my curls.</li>
    <li> this is a great comb. doesn&#x27;t hurt me and does the job. i am extemely happy with this purchase. can&#x27;t find this in stores where i live and i really like this detangling comb.</li>
    <li> Nice and big and sturdy.</li>
    <li> This arrived just as described. It is perfect for the pool or after a shower. I like the handle - my other wide tooth combs do not have a handle. For some reason, these things are hard to find at the local box stores!</li>
    <li> This comb arrived quickly and with no problems. However, the ends of the teeth are somewhat sharp. Honestly, when I am coming through my wet hair, it hurts my scalp. They&#x27;re that sharp.  What were they thinking?</li>
    <li> My natural hair is a breeze to detangle now because of this comb.  Love it, love it, love it.  The colors are nice as well. I have the greenish-blue one.</li>
    <li> My hair is very easy to tangle. I have curly hair that gives me a run for my money once my hair get wet. It combs thru very easy and I have little to no breakage. I just wished it had a hook on the end so I can hang it up in the shower. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good comb for those who have hard to manage hair.</li>
    <li> This is reliable comb. No issues whatsoever. I got it in pink which is nice! And it wont break on falling (yet!). Perfect for going through curly hair.</li>
    <li> not very expensive so you probably get what you pay for.  i found it to be a bit rough on my hair and my scalp</li>
    <li> The ends of this comb are rounded and soft so they don&#x27;t irritate my scalp or rip my hair out.  There are a ton of products that are much more expensive and have the same quality.</li>
    <li> I could easily and painlessly comb through my hair with ease. Have really help to reduce hair loss! Very easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> i have bought other combs but this one doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to static and great for after the shower instead of using a brush and it ripping my hair out!! i would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair, and have broken quite a few detangling combs! This comb is well made and can handle my thick hair!! It&#x27;s a GREAT product! Very happy about the price too!</li>
    <li> VERY wide-toothed ... perhaps I should have read the description more closely. You could almost comb dreads with this thing. Also weird: Had a sinister, slippery-slimy film on it when it arrived in the mail, which hardly came off when I washed it with soap. Perhaps some fancy hair-detangling substance? I was just hoping to get a basic comb, and I guess this one will do fine for a middle-aged long-haired dude.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, fine, curly hair that is one length to the middle of my back.  After a wash, NIGHTMARE to comb through without knots and other issues resulting in split ends.  I like this comb because of the thick wide teeth, there is enough space to let some hair through without feeling as though it is \\&quot;ripping\\&quot; through my hair.  Much easier to comb wet long hair and I&#x27;m sure it will last me years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps...I don&#x27;t know about the Anti-static qualities??</li>
    <li> This is the best brush to use out of the shower</li>
    <li> Nice wide tooth comb. Solid plastic, great for combing condition through my hair in the shower, and perfect for detangling after the shower. It&#x27;s better for your hair to use a wide tooth comb when wet still.</li>
    <li> Outer coating of plastic? material on this comb is peeling away, catching and pulling my hair. I guess the price reflects quality in this case.</li>
    <li> Works great for long hair.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT for detangling hair. We mainly use one we keep in the shower for quickly combing conditioner through hair (you can use a lot less conditioner therefore not weigh your hair down) but we also have one we use to detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair when it is dried. The anti-static is a bonus. The tips of the comb are a little sharp, so it&#x27;s better for using through hair ONLY and from from scalp to ends of hair  (if that makes any sense).</li>
    <li> The teeth on this comb are spaced perfectly for detangling, but they are too pointy and sharp.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb. I have fine, thin, curly hair and use this to keep the curl but minimize breakage. I don&#x27;t comb my hair once it&#x27;s dry so I can&#x27;t speak for its anti-static properties. It&#x27;s a nice weight in your hand and does the job without snagging.</li>
    <li> this comb prevents frequent hair fall since it provides a very relaxing massage whenever you comb your hair! A must have in all bathrooms!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this comb. I don&#x27;t have a sensitive head but the ends of the prongs feel rough and it&#x27;s not very effective at getting tangles out of my medium length fine hair. It&#x27;s too wide and big too.</li>
    <li> Just got this comb. I&#x27;m letting a relaxer grow out and going natural... So far I&#x27;m loving my new comb</li>
    <li> The seam for the cast on this comb is at the point of the teeth which happened to already be sharp. I used it once and will never use it again. It felt like I was coming my hair with pin needles. Very painful. Also more like rips your hair out rather than detangles. Horrible product. Save your poor scalp the misery</li>
    <li> I needed a wide tooth comb to use on my long hair after showering.  It&#x27;s a great comb and I would highly recommend.  It is VERY large.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a regular comb. It might be sharp for some ppl. Many ppl complained that the comb was too sharp. It was alright for me. It was not exactly &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; but it is very much bearable, although it might be because my hair is naturally not tangled easily and so I didn&#x27;t have to tug. I do recommend it since it is cheap</li>
    <li> The comb is kind of big. My hair is still static, becasue of the winter. Maybe it&#x27;s an anti-static comb for warm weather only.</li>
    <li> This detangling comb ended up being much larger than I expected. It is wide toothed. I used it on my wig, along with some wig conditioner, and it does the job. Too bad I couldn&#x27;t pick the color, it arrived pink, which is not my favorite, but again, it&#x27;s useful and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I have long hair. It has grown past my hips, and it&#x60;s very hard to comb wet. This comb works great I am vey pleased with it. The only flaw was the tips were a little rough. Good Comb !!</li>
    <li> The comb is giant! It is way bigger that Imwas expecting, but it works at untangling my hair. Not sure if the anti-static does anything? But for curly hair, the size between the tines is nice since you need a wide toothed comb.</li>
    <li> Nice quality comb. Heavy duty!</li>
    <li> Glides through hair so well. Dosent cause static. The teeth are spaced apart and comb is good for detangling without causing frizz. I had bought one like it in a local store previously. The only problem with this one that didn&#x27;t exist with store bought one is that the tips of the teeth are sharp and hurt the scalp a bit. Otherwise it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Conair Anti-static Detangling Comb, Colors may vary- I love my comb.  If you have long hair or tangles this is a great comb.  I use to cut hair and you de tangle hair from the bottom UP..so start by sectioning the hair from side to side or ear to ear...take one side and start at the bottom of long hair and slowly work up the hair to rid tangles.  What I do is use a detangle solution or just olive oil to help my long hair. It&#x27;s easier to section the hair.  If you are in a hurry this really is a good solution and if you ride a Harley Davidson Motorcycle.</li>
    <li> This comb is so large, it&#x27;s for a giant.  Maybe my fault for not reading the details, but I have never seen a comb so large in my life.  It&#x27;s almost comical.  I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
    <li> I like the size and shape of the comb, but there are a lot of problems with it. It works very well for detangling, but, despite claims, it is not in any way &amp;#34;anti-static.&amp;#34; On top of that, the plastic seams are rough and sharp. The comb scratches my scalp and yanks my hair. Overall, it is just not a good comb and I will have to replace it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it, but it hangs in the shower just in case I want to.</li>
    <li> The comb I received was a dark aqua color (which is pretty).  It&#x27;s a pretty large comb.  It does well with detangling my hair with little static.  I wish the the points of the teeth were a small bit duller.</li>
    <li> Works great on wet hair!  I would recommend this to any one with longer hair.  It works great.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I love this comb!  My hair has been growing and multiplying (I think vit B12 &amp; arosci hair cream among others have something too do with it) so I needed a larger and hearty comb.  I have found Conair products to be quite good.</li>
    <li> VERY large comb.  Wasn&#x27;t the size I was expecting.  Does a good job of detangling.  Just be aware of the size before you buy.</li>
    <li> The comb teeth heads have unfinished plastic that is sharp and rips out my hair. Perhaps it was the first model. The tips are unfinished plastic that allows for hair to get caught. I suspect this was a first design and since then have perfected the wide tooth comb. I have long (to my waist) curly hair and use other Conair wide tooth combs. This one isn&#x27;t for me but maybe for you. Good luck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really anti-static, at least not for me.  I have very fine curly hair and usually use a pick, so I thought this product would help. The material is a lot harder than a pick and I keep scrapping my scalp with it.  Maybe I&#x27;m just too clumsy but a pick is easier to use, I think.</li>
    <li> Okay almost all detangling comb works , don&#x27;t they? Well...idk but this one does for sure. I promise. I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to used my fingers to detangle my wet hair anymore, and brushes were just breaking the hair apart, and this was a wide-tooth comb. Also seeing that I have prime it got here in two days. So yeah..good buy. I don&#x27;t know what else to say. Except that if I were you I&#x27;d take a look at my local supply store they could easily have it cheaper- but then again this isn&#x27;t that costly so do as you wish.</li>
    <li> While it might be anti-microbial, it certainly did not retain its advertised anti-static capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;An old fashioned vinyl record &#x27;static zapper&#x27; might do the trick (if there are still any to be found).&lt;br /&gt;Needs washing anyway, so what is the point of the anti-microbial I wonder?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus side: It&#x27;s a nice big comb, which makes taking out the occasional knots in my long curly hair far easier than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;For that alone, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is just a regular large tooth, detangling comb. It&#x27;s great for combing out wet hair, but it&#x27;s just a plastic comb that isn&#x27;t going to change your life.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the teeth hurting the scalp, but I certainly haven&#x27;t noticed any anti-static benefits.</li>
    <li> love this for detangling and styling</li>
    <li> Helps to prevent breaking wet/damp hair.  Does not pull hair that is already weak because it is wet. Love it.</li>
    <li> Works great, large durable comb!</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair that tangles like a giant mess after the shower.  This works well to get the tangles out and not pull out all of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for naturally curly or wavy hair! I have wavy hair, this separates the &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; instead of making them frizzy! Who knew a comb could make a difference!</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this comb!  I ordered it for all of my girls.  They love how easily it goes through their hair and easily detangles their worst hair knots.  It is well made and the handle is incredibly easy to keep hold of.</li>
    <li> I find it amusing how big this comb is!! It&#x27;s so massive! But yes, it&#x27;s a wonderful comb. I bought it so that I could more easily detangle my hair after a shower but I find myself using it instead of my hairbrush now!</li>
    <li> I really love this detangling anti-static comb.  It combs through wet hair without pulling and damaging my hair, and my hair has less static electricity.  Since I live in a very, very dry climate, that is important.  This comb is so good, my husband has all but stolen it from me (he has long hair, too)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb with wide teeth which helps when combing through wet tangled hair.  It makes combing through wet hair a whole lot easier.</li>
    <li> My sisters all laughed when I showed them because it was so big! But it does it&#x27;s job so I gave it 4 stars</li>
    <li> Light and strong comb: I use this on long curly hair wet from the shower. Makes it easy to detangle without removing curl too much. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Wide teeth mean less pulling on the tangles, works great on my really long, wavy, and of course tangly hair.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair this is for you.</li>
    <li> The comb is a bit sharp on the ends of the combing piece. So whenever I try combing my hair with it, my skin gets scratched.</li>
    <li> There are other combs, that cost more, and have different brands, but I promise that they were created from teh same mold as this one.. and maybe even at the same factory.  Buy this one, it&#x27;s the best price and works great.</li>
    <li> The advertisement that it is a detangler must be a joke. It absolutely does not work for me - my old pick from 20 years ago does a better job of detangling. Not sure of the Anti-static feature, since I lost interest in using it after it did nothing to detangle my hair (I have long/straight/fine blond hair).</li>
    <li> i get this for when i shower i get a product called hair one { like wen but cheaper at sallys } it recommends running a comb throw after you put it in and befor you leave it in for a little bit to get it throw all your hair . this works good . the only thing i dont like is i would have thought with it being big teeth it would tack hair but it does this is how come it get a 4 i would have gave a 4 and a half but couldnt.</li>
    <li> This comb is massive in size. It&#x27;s totally unpractical. As soon as I held it, it felt like I should be combing a horse instead of a normal sized persons head. Maybe I should&#x27;ve paid more attention to the dimensions, but I have never seen a comb so huge that it didn&#x27;t even occur to me to verify that.</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly waist-length hair so this is a really great detangling comb for me. Has a good grip and sturdy built, only thing is, it feels way too big. But all in all, great product.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and I keep one of these in the tub and one by where I do my hair because it is the best comb I&#x27;ve found so far for combing out my hair gently and getting the tangles out without tearing my hair.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this before I shower. I never brush or comb my hair when it&#x27;s wet. EVER!!! This does a good job of gently detangling my hair when it&#x27;s dry. It doesn&#x27;t have any sharp teeth and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught on it. Good Quality.</li>
    <li> Great comb for tangles. I love it !</li>
    <li> This comb works great - I have curly hair and it always goes right thru it smoothly and no tangles are left behind.  Doesn&#x27;t pull at all.  I wish it was the 80&#x27;s so I could keep it in the back pocket of my Jordache to carry around all the time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very stiff and hurts my scalp. Pulls out hair easily instead of being gentle with detangling hair.</li>
    <li> great for super curly hair.  very sturdy</li>
    <li> This comb is coated with an anti-bacterial film called Microban, more commonly known as Triclosan. Triclosan contributes to antibiotic resistance and disrupts hormones, among other issues. This is why many companies are phasing Triclosan out of their products.  I think the warning sticker on the outside of the comb package is telling of the dangers of Triclosan: &amp;#34;Keep away from children. The thin film may cling to nose and mouth and prevent breathing.&amp;#34; This is a big plastic comb, with no sharp edges! There is absolutely no reason it should be required to be kept away from children. And since when does hair need to be treated with anti-bacterials? How ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb to use on my LO&#x27;s hair as it is curly. When I received this comb I laughed, the comb is bigger than my LO&#x27;s head. Now my LO is only a yr old but still... If you are looking for a huge wide tooth comb this one will work great for  ya :)</li>
    <li> A good sturdy comb.  works great with my daughters long, easy to tangle hair. We use it straight out of shower.  Very glad we purchased.</li>
    <li> This comb is great for getting through my thick hair without causing it to stand on end.  It leaves the body and shape without flattening it.</li>
    <li> Bought this to groom my long-haired shi-poo.  does the trick and helps keep her tangles to a minimum.</li>
    <li> Lifesaver with getting the tangles  out of my daughter&#x27;s hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> Hard to go wrong with a basic large comb but I like this comb and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Sadly didn&#x27;t work on my daughters tangles</li>
    <li> HUGE comb. LOL Does what a comb is supposed to do. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a comb that is so painful to use! It does a terrible job at detangling my hair, I have medium length curly hair that I comb in the shower after conditioning it, and have never had problems in the past with other plastic combs.</li>
    <li> love this comb.  have long hair (straight now, but very curly before straightened),  gets out all tangles.  combs nicely.</li>
    <li> I like this comb, because it seems to be made better than the dollar stores.i would recommend this product to all..</li>
    <li> I have long hair and have been told to never use a brush on it, just wide-toothed combs and this one hit the nail on the head.  Not purse sized, but I can definitely find it on my bathroom counter to comb out my hair after I wash it!  Great comb.</li>
    <li> But it WAS cheap so I got what I paid for. Does the job of getting the major tangles out while the hair is still wet. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have 4a/4b/4c hair &amp; this is the only comb I trust to detangle my kinky curls.&lt;br /&gt;Works amazing on wet hair, I do not recommend using it dry though. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I only bought this comb because of the antistatic claim. I already have wide toothed combs for detangling.&lt;br /&gt; This comb does not help with static! Complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> Unfinished plastic trim between the teeth. stilled liked the comb for my heavy main</li>
    <li> I keep this comb in the shower for when I condition my hair. I love it. The plastic doesn&#x27;t absorb water and it slides right through any knots or tangles. Will probably buy another for outside the shower!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I use this comb to detangle my hair after I wash it. Thinking about ordering another one just in case I lose the one I have now. This comb is a must if you have kinky or curly hair.</li>
    <li> nice wide, sturdy comb that does not pull on wet hair</li>
    <li> I brought this for my girlfriend. Her hair is really prone to tangle. It works really well. But shes a wuss and wont use it like its intended. So now im using it as a back scratcher. good for the hard to reach spots</li>
    <li> I really like the way this comb works when I&#x27;m combing the conditioner through my hair in the shower.  I also use it after I get out of the shower and towel dry my hair.  No snags and less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have thick ringlets...and still have better luck just using my fingers.</li>
    <li> Not too happy, it&#x27;s HUGE and it has sharp points that hurt when you use it. Handing it off to a sister who has a long haired dog! lol</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about anti-static,  but this is great for combing wet hair,  and for a quick fluff up of dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that is prone to tangles.  In fact, I could go for weeks without combing it.  I love this comb since the teeth are wide enough to accommodate the kinks, and the comb itself is strong enough to handle them.</li>
    <li> A comb is a comb, but I have others I like better.</li>
    <li> Nice big comb with wide set tines (bristles?  not sure what to call them). The plastic has a pleasing matte finish.  However, the ends of the tines/bristles are sharp and will scratch your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teeth, the spiky things are called teeth.</li>
    <li> I use this to comb through my hair in the shower when I&#x27;m applying or rinsing conditioner. It detangles nicely. Mine came in a pretty turquoise color.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower comb that I have ever used. I want to buy another one for back up.</li>
    <li> works amazing at detangling sturdy and well made and best comb I&#x27;ve had in my 50 years of life LOL</li>
    <li> Love this comb - it works great for detangling and sectioning off hair to curl it.</li>
    <li> Perfect comb to get through knotty long hair without damaging it. I&#x27;ll even use it in the shower along with conditioner to work out tangles.</li>
    <li> Nice big teeth and not flimsy.. I have thick curly hair and i have no issues with it. I bought a second one after my dog slobbered and tried to chew up my first one- now its his toy.. But was more than happy to buy another--Solid buy and can&#x27;t beat the price  As a random side - as stated colors may vary-- the first comb i got was the pink like in the picture and the second one that came was a lovely blue. Enjoy !</li>
    <li> Works fine for tangles.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully despite my very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two of these. I&#x27;ve started using a comb on my wet hair instead of a brush to decrease breakage. So far so good. Seems well made and it&#x27;s a good deal. The best part was that it came straight to my door!</li>
    <li> It seems like such a simple comb... how can it be rated low?  The bristles are way too sharp.  if you put much pressure on your head while using it, it hurts. They need to be more rounded. I use it, but I can see myself replacing it soon.</li>
    <li> The comb works very well for detangling both my straight hair and my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. The size took me awhile to get used to, but now I feel comfortable using it.</li>
    <li> This comb does exactly the opposite that it&#x27;s supposed to do. It creates tangles and pulls the hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller I recommend both!</li>
    <li> Boo. I don&#x27;t use this at all. It hurts my head and I don&#x27;t really think it detangles all that well either. I got a pink comb and wasn&#x27;t all that expensive so not worrying about returning it.</li>
    <li> there was a big improvement in the way doing her hair has been since my grand baby has received this comb.  No  more crying and whinnying.&lt;br /&gt;The comb actually takes out the tangles , leaving her soft and comb-able.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Feels sharp on the scalp at first but you get used to it after a few days.</li>
    <li> I love this comb! I&#x27;ve been searching for a comb with wide enough teeth that won&#x27;t yank my curls during detangling that also has a handle so I&#x27;m not struggling to grip it while wet. This fit the bill and came with the microbial coating. Perfect wash day companion.</li>
    <li> mine came in a bright pink, so yes colors DO vary.  I really like it though.  It combs through my thick hair nicely and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair like my previous comb.</li>
    <li> perfect, I have a pink one, and just perfect</li>
    <li> For natural hair tangles beware!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this comb a 3-star rating because it does it&#x27;s job, but the comb is huge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is about 10 inches in length. It seems more fitting for a horse than a human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can deal with the size, then I think you will like the comb.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll put my review of the actual product first and the rest is my personal experience with de-tangling, and hair type etc, just in case someone in a tangly-haired dilemma might find it useful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb is actually really good, I was expecting a lot less for the price. It is large and wide-toothed, which was exactly what I needed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for short or very fine hair though, it&#x27;s really made for long or thick hair I&#x27;d say. It&#x27;s not as colossal in size as I&#x27;d expected from some reviews, but still it isn&#x27;t small. It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to grip; I use it in the shower to gently comb through my conditioner, and again after bathing/showering to de-tangle it, with a moisturizer and oil through it, and I have no issues which is a miracle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say using it has gone hand in hand with my renewed routine for taking better care of my hair, and I&#x27;m not sure how well it would have done with de-tangling tresses before I&#x27;d treated my hair with a deep conditioning routine as it was a real mess before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb does have seams although they are so small and smooth it&#x27;s not a problem; the comb is very well made so it doesn&#x27;t snag or rip my hair in the slightest. The only way I could damage my hair is if I&#x27;m rough with the comb myself. I haven&#x27;t noticed static which I get lots once my hair is dry, which is a plus, but I haven&#x27;t tested it very much once my hair is dry. Overall the comb is really good, there are better combs out there for more money I&#x27;m sure but I&#x27;m happy with this. Also, mine came in purple which is quite cute :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto more info about my hair and why I actually bought this comb, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided to stop using my Tangle Teezer as I found that the way I used it, it was causing breakage and as a result I now have lots of small broken hairs. I was upset as it was so easy to use and I&#x27;d invested in several TT over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the TT&#x27;s convenience, it is still a BRUSH and I had forgotten that. Seeing the breakage made me realise that I should go back to combing to detangle my hair, because the way I used my TT just encouraged me to be rough on my hair. I was using it for speed and convenience, not to care for my hair. Don&#x27;t let me put you off if you use one, it&#x27;s just my own experience of the product, but I think combing with a good comb is better for me and my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, back to good old combing which I dreaded because my hair is a nightmare to de-tangle. I am Caucasian with very long and thick wavy hair that just does not like to behave. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and as a result my hair was in pretty bad shape thanks to a lack of nutrients and neglect (and also the way I was harsh with it using my TT), it was very dry and impossible to de-tangle or run my fingers through and it generally caused a lot of frustration and pain to de-tangle after bathing. Even with the TT, it was horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started up a routine in order to take care of my hair again, deep conditioning weekly and using proper products to moisturize, heat protect, and oil to seal in the moisture etc. Combing has really helped me to remember that I have to be gentle with my hair because at the end of the day, it&#x27;s very fragile and precious. Thanks to my new routine and perhaps this comb, lol, I can actually de-tangle my hair without my arms hurting or needing to go for a long lie down afterwards. It&#x27;s not an ordeal for me anymore.</li>
    <li> I use it in the shower when Im shampooing my hair.  Without this comb my hair would  look like a hot mess!!</li>
    <li> I just wanted a comb to replace the one I misplaced SOMEWHERE, but geez...some are selling for over $30! for a comb??? anyway read some reviews on this and got it. The pointy end problem? Simple fix. Just get a piece of sandpaper and sand the ends smooth. Now it works exactly as I need it to. Pleased.</li>
    <li> This detangling comp is great. It is solid enough so that it will not break at hard spots. Even my hair is quite long, I still can work it all out with this great detangling comp. I love it for I feeling I got when using it with conditioning creams or hair masks.</li>
    <li> Updated review: I love this comb. my hair is really long and tangles easily so the separated and smooth bristles make it WAY easier to work with my hair especially when it&#x27;s wet, I leave it in my shower and it hangs on the hook perfectly because of the hook hole at the end of the comb.  I bought this comb from amazon about a year ago and it&#x27;s still my favorite comb lol :)   The only thing that sucks is you can&#x27;t choose the color you get, I got it in a teal color which is my least favorite color. I wish I got a pink or purple one, but regardless it&#x27;s amazing for people that have long tangly hair like me.  I would recommend this comb to people</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why others have said that the comb teeth are pointy/sharp at the ends. I just received this comb today and immediately opened it and tried it out. Perfect! And, no, the teeth are not pointy or sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago, my hairdresser gave me a comb just like this one. I looked in our local beauty supply store for one like it. I couldn&#x27;t find one. But here on Amazon - this is the comb I&#x27;ve been looking for. I want to have one in each bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this comb for several reasons. It&#x27;s easier on the hair than a hairbrush, which means less hair breakage. Yes, I use brushes while blowdrying my hair, but I&#x27;ll use a comb like this to run through my hair before going to bed. It can also be used in the shower to comb conditioner through your hair. And lastly, if I wear my hair naturally wavy/curly, I can comb my hair without blending the curls into one big frizz bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend!</li>
    <li> This comb it excellent. Because my hair is natural, it&#x27;s important to detangle without all the pulling. This comb does an excellent job without putting too much stress on my hair. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> the tines are way too far apart to do anything worthwhile to my hair (even too wide for &amp;#34;finger combed&amp;#34; look).  Also, the comb is covered with some sort of grippy material that tugs on my locks.  Maybe this just isn&#x27;t made for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This comb does a good job of separating my hair when I am trying to curl or straightening my hair. I am not sure if it does a good job of preventing the static but just as a comb, I do like using it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This Conair comb is well-made and durable. My hair is very thin which is easy to scratch my scalp. However, it has never scratched my scalp once. I love Conair&#x27;s products. This comb is awesome. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have long hair.  I needed a new comb because the one I had finally broke after years and years of use.  I purchased this.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> detangles very well and very sturdy.</li>
    <li> i really like these combs theres no seam so no snags, i would buy again</li>
    <li> Probably my fault for not looking at the dimensions closely, but this comb was much larger than I expected.  It has really wide and big teeth that is uncomfortable for my scalp.  Kinda hurts.</li>
    <li> I have crazy think, coarse, wavy hair. And its long. This is the perfect comb to untangle my hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> Using this comb has diminished my loss of hair. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was packaged nicely &#x3D;)  Love to use this comb after my shower with a little bit of leave in conditioner.  My mom loves it too &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have long and very thick hair and this comb really gets the job done.  I love the wide spaces btwn the teeth and the thickness of it.</li>
    <li> I would rate it higher, but the ends are so pointy and hurt my scalp.  It does however, untangle my hair great.</li>
    <li> Great spacing and this comb is good for detangling without pulling, but the teeth are way too sharp. Will be looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I received this comb and thought it would be great.  The size is perfect and great for my soft curly hair.  It is easy to hold.  I thought the tines of the comb were too sharp.  They scratch my scalp.  Maybe with use they will dull up a bit because I like the comb.</li>
    <li> I needed a big tooth comb and didn&#x27;t realize there are significant differences in comb quality.  This comb is hard plastic and I just don&#x27;t like it.  My hair is fine and when wet needs the big teeth to help with tangles and be gentle too.  This comb has no glide to it and just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I ordered two, put the second one still in the package in the donation box.  I usually like Conair products, but this one isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Comb looks like a gag gift....its gigantic...and as everyone else said, the tips of the comb hurt your head when you use it</li>
    <li> I gave this comb 5 stars because it works on my unruly hair!! I have very tangled unmanageable hair that a regular comb just can&#x27;t do the job right. My hair is very coarse and thick so I was surprised at how well this comb handled itself when I got it in my hair. This is wide so it won&#x27;t hurt so much when trying to comb tangled hair. I love how it doesn&#x27;t break its durable. This is the best comb I&#x27;ve used in a very long time and will continue to keep buying this brand.</li>
    <li> Need a new wide tooth comb that wouldn&#x27;t give me too much static while combing my hair out. The ends are kind of pointy, but I just filed them own a tad and bingo bango....works like a charm</li>
    <li> i needed a new one since i thought i lost my other ones big and perfect for combing my hair when it is wet and easily comes through the knots with minimal pain</li>
    <li> Actually made combing out my thin fine hair more painful. This did nothing to help detangle it, the only thing it helped with compared to using my hair pick was keeping my hand from cramping up. Do yourself a favor and buy a wet brush instead, I bought one of those next and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb that detangles, not much to say. Works just as good as any other detangling comb. Not better not worse. Decent price.I use it on my daughters very curly (corkscrew) hair. She doesn&#x27;t cry.</li>
    <li> Detangles well, but teeth are sharp and rough on your scalp.</li>
    <li> Its a wide tooth comb alright.. just a lot bigger than expected. Its great for a quick run through of the hair but the space inbetween each tooth is almost too much. Not a good tool for adding volume or teasing but it is durable.</li>
    <li> Great to get rat&#x27;s nests out of long hair</li>
    <li> I was, at first, disappointed when I saw the width between the combs teeth. I have fine hair and thought it would be useless to me. Wrong. Its great, detangles perfectly and I am glad I gave it a chance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap plastic comb, not much can be said about it other than it works. If by some miracle the one I purchased breaks I&#x27;ll be back to buy another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so big and wide between the teeth. Just a little bigger than necessary, but it works!&lt;br /&gt;How much can you say about a comb, just to make the review long enough to be accepted?</li>
    <li> I received this comb really fast and it was exactly as described. it is sturdy and great for detangling. perfect</li>
    <li> I love this comb! A natural girl&#x27;s best friend.</li>
    <li> So I was looking for a comb because I was told its better on your hair than a brush. This isn&#x27;t exactly what I had hoped but it is decent. The gaps between each bristle is quite big which maybe that&#x27;s the way it supposed to be. Either way I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much of a gap. Biggest con with this product is that the ends of each bristle are sharp! So I have to be careful when combing my hair cause it pokes my scalp and it does not feel very good at all. This comb is very large too which I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be THAT big lol. I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase this but it may work well for others.</li>
    <li> Easier to use than a brush and way less static.  I have long fine blonde hair.</li>
    <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL</li>
    <li> Comb served it&#x27;s purpose. Teeth of comb wasn&#x27;t very sharp.</li>
    <li> I should have noticed how big this detangling comb was. It&#x27;s VERY big, not something that you&#x27;d be able to put comfortably in a travel kit, which was what I had wanted this for. It&#x27;s 9.5&amp;#34; long by 2.5&amp;#34; wide.  It fits in my vanity drawer, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in my travel kit.</li>
    <li> Easy hold handle and the tips of the tines are rounded. Just right for use while shampooing and conditioning . . . the one I received is marine blue. Great choice for the price!</li>
    <li> Very well made product. I follow through with this comb after I detangle with my Denman. It has no parts that snag or tug at your hair. Additionally, it&#x27;s super easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Good comb, but a little sharp on scalp.</li>
    <li> I use this on my damp hair out of the shower or when it&#x27;s dry. It doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to break which is important since my hair is so long. Best comb I have ever used! :)</li>
    <li> Gentle on hair, and no tangles!  I love it.  I have very fine hair, and this is the best ever</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 4-year old daughter who has fine hair and hates having her hair brushed due to the many knots and tangles.  The gaps in this comb are much too wide making it not useful to comb through her hair.  We hardly use this comb now.</li>
    <li> Great comb, especially after swimming</li>
    <li> I noticed my wife&#x27;s hairdresser used something like this comb.  I ordered this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this comb - it detangles and distributes conditioner through wet hair easily and does an excellent job of what it is supposed to do.  I smoothed the sharp edges with an old pumice stone, and that resolved the problem.  The next time I have an order that allows for an add-on item, I&#x27;m getting another.  Definitely not a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Helps prevent my hair from breaking. I saw a YouTube video that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for. My hair doesn&#x27;t get many split ends anymore.</li>
    <li> Not great. I have wavy/curly hair....ringlets at the bottom, but straight on top. Prone to tangle. I bought to brush in the shower but it was just painful, and not helpful. I went back to my old brush and tossed this in the trash! ( its huge BTW) dont buy for a kid!</li>
    <li> Comb is not quite right.  I Can&#x27;t put my finger on why.  Maybe because it&#x27;s too large.</li>
    <li> Do not like this.  I am sending it back.  It is big enough to comb a horse.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. The teeth hurt my head when I use it. Sad I purchased two. Should have just bought one.</li>
    <li> Not sharp as others describes. A very good comb for wet hair that tangles quickly</li>
    <li> Very LARGE comb, which is okay, however the ends of the tines are very sharp and can scratch your scalp.</li>
    <li> Its a comb, it does what a comb does</li>
    <li> I use this comb every-time i take a shower, my hair is extremely curly and thick. have had no cracks, teeth break off or any wear at all! If i ever need another one, ill buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Love this big tooth comb...really gentle on my hair as the tangles are plenty after a wash..and I use it to comb my hair after a wash.  Nothin fancy, but does the job.  I have 2 of these now and both were pink upon delivery..must be excess stock color!</li>
    <li> This is great comb. So good I bought a second one.  Runs through tangles easily will no pulling and no whining from the 7 year old.  I like it on my hair as well.</li>
    <li> Durable, bristles are not flimsy, cheap. This is what I wanted and this is what I got. Great for combing out wet hair! Got this for an add on price - in the store I know I would have had to pay double the price. Happy.</li>
    <li> It really works!! My 3 year old has the world&#x27;s most staticy hair and this comb stops it dead in its tracks!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this type of comb.  She had on for years that she bought in Japan when she was a kid.  A couple of years ago we had to cut that one to pieces to get it out of our 3 year old daughters hair because our 5 year old son tangled it in her long curly hair.  My wife was very sad because she loved that comb and thought she would never find another one.  Until now.  This one is almost an exact match.  Wide and strong teeth.  Very durable.  Great for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love this comb! A few other reviews mentioned that it was a bit scratchy, which I have to agree with... But just take a nail file to the sharper edges, and its the perfect wide tooth comb. I took off one star because of the need to file it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, its huge!! Ive never seen a comb quite this large, but I personally find it very convenient since my hair is very long. It makes it easier to reach my length.</li>
    <li> This comb has the teeth set too wide apart. It won&#x27;t work for average hair. It would be good for very thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> It goes through my 4c hair like its silk when wet, I love it. I don&#x27;t think it will break, it seems very durable unlike other combs I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s just good, I love it. Sometimes I need a smaller comb for my ends because I have really straight heat damaged hair, but overall it&#x27;s a dream.</li>
    <li> My hair is doing so great with this product. Good for texturized/relaxed hair!!! I love it! Glad I bought it!!</li>
    <li> The comb is much larger than expected, but it will do.</li>
    <li> When I slide it through my uncombed hair........said hair then becomes combed.</li>
    <li> I like this comb. :) I keep it in the shower.</li>
    <li> hurts scalp, will not use</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s sharp. I used sandpaper to dull it out so that it&#x27;s more gentle on my scalp.</li>
    <li> its a comb, it gets the job done lol got a blue one, no issues</li>
    <li> Exactly the wide toothed, soft/smooth comb of the right length and grip.&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t beat the price, and the colors are okay</li>
    <li> Takes a while to brush my hair but my hair is not stripping..</li>
    <li> No more fly-away hair. Easy to comb long hair and my granddaughter loves to use it. It is big and light at the same time, so it is easy to hold it and comb your hair either wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I use it to detangle while combing conditioner through my hair in the shower. Saves me a lot of time compared to using my fingers and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or cause knots.</li>
    <li> SO CONVIENT TO HAVE THIS ITEM DELIVERED RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what I can say about this, except it&#x27;s a pretty standard detangling comb, and it does its job. I received it in the blue color, which looks nice. Nothing seems to be breaking/ chipping/ flaking/ poking, which is always a good sign.</li>
    <li> I think this comb is fantastic. My hair is down the middle of my back and is natural curly so it gets pretty snarky after washing it. This comb goes through my hair without ripping out at the roots. It also works well to assist in putting it up in a ponytail.</li>
    <li> This comb really worked on my long thick hair. There is no static from it at all the large spaces really help my hair not to get ripped out. I do have to hold the top of my hair when combing it so I don&#x27;t feel my hair getting pulled but Im very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Very strong, quite large comb. Really like the look it gives me. Definitely so relative to my mainstream, predictable, 2015 white male haircut...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as I expected!</li>
    <li> Nice comb, I&#x27;m using it all the time for my curly hair. It came in nice blue color and the teeth are nice and wide,, exactly as I wanted and needed.</li>
    <li> Great at combing through thick natural hair</li>
    <li> Awesome comb for post swim.  I use this after my shower to disperse my almond oil evenly through my hair.  I received a pink one which was an added bonus!</li>
    <li> I dare you to try this comb on ANY hair and not like it, you won&#x27;t pick up a brush again. Wet or dry, long or short, this is magic. I have five now, so there&#x27;s always one near, whether home or traveling. No joke.</li>
    <li> Great for detangling. No rough edges to snag hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb for detangling.  I have fine hair and before I got this comb, I was pulling my hair out with my brush after I got out of the shower.  My boyfriend&#x27;s daughter borrows mine all the time, so I got her one as well - it was pinkish-purple, pefect color for her.  I had to find it on Amazon because I could never find it in the stores.  I have tried others, but the teeth on the other combs I looked at were closer together and not as pain-free for detangling.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer that said the tines are too sharp. They do hurt a bit more than they should.&lt;br /&gt;However, my biggest complaint about this comb is that it&#x27;s much too big and the tines are also too far apart. That is probably why it&#x27;s so hard from the picture to tell its size.</li>
    <li> This wide tooth comb is perfect for my super long hair.  Using this comb makes combing out my hair after washing very quick and easy, no breakage or yanking.</li>
    <li> Love this it does a great job on daughters hair. Great size to be able to use for intended reasoning.</li>
    <li> When I received this comb I was a little surprised at how large it really is. However, that wasn&#x27;t a bad thing, it actually made combing through my mess of wavy hair much easier and quicker because it didn&#x27;t get stuck as much as smaller combs do. I have also noticed that I&#x27;m not pulling out as many hairs during each comb. It still combs my hair thorough, just much faster! :)</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a curly or wavy that needs detangling hair in shower, this is the simplest and easiest tool. I prefer this over my fingers because I feel like it detangles more and helps with clumping curls together.</li>
    <li> I love its anti-static quality. It keeps it clean-looking and you don&#x27;t have to deal with the annoying static feel. Kudos</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel ergonomically correct in my hand, it&#x27;s too big and unbalanced. Maybe it&#x27;s for people with a lot more hair though mine is to the middle of my back.</li>
