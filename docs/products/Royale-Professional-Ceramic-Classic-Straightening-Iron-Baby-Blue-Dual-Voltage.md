### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Really happy!</li>
      <li>I had gotten one years ago in the mall and was very happy with the product .</li>
      <li>/&gt;She says it is the best straightener she has ever used in it</li>
      <li>Totally loved this straightner!</li>
      <li>I ordered two very nice Royale straighteners.</li>
      <li>Have used this product line before and as always the item is as good as it is advertised to be.</li>
      <li>great service with genuine products....</li>
      <li>She was having to borrow one from from her roommate every day and needed to get one of her own.  </li>
      <li>Amazing :)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better than nothing but not the deal I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased at all with this .</li>
      <li>Works better than Chi in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Now everything about the product looks authentic but it does not function like it was described by the sales rep.  Bottom line I would not recommend this product, but for 40ish dollars what should i expect.</li>
      <li>Assume product!, so glad I didn&#x27;t pay $300.00 at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
      <li>I found it here for $60 :).</li>
      <li>Now it will sure need to be replaced before I sell my home.</li>
      <li>I know my CHI never burned my counter top.  </li>
      <li>Plugged them in and heated up very quickly.</li>
      <li>Was very pleased with the fast shipment of the products.</li>
      <li>Her best friend&#x27;s mom purchased the exact same iron in the mall for $80!  </li>
      <li>Feels nice in the hand and certainly doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, feels cheap, the chord is</li>
      <li>feels cheap and slippery to hold onto.  </li>
      <li>Also, the cheap plastic on it around the edges isn&#x27;t smooth.</li>
      <li>Great flat irons</li>
      <li>This flat iron is great.</li>
      <li>This is not the original brand and pulls at my hair.</li>
      <li>Its amazing, gets hot quick n stays hot.</li>
      <li>I was told it would be the best item I would ever get, well, I am not pleased with it!  </li>
      <li>This one has adjustable heat temperature and gets very hot.</li>
      <li>I purchased this Royale straightening iron on Amazon, and it arrived quickly, was exactly what I wanted, and super savings.  </li>
      <li>But if you let it heat up to long it will burn your counter top!</li>
      <li>Like everyone else I became aware of this product in a mall kiosk.</li>
      <li>Agree with everyone else not the same as in the mall straitens just like the cheap ones hair frizzed up not even 30 mins after.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair was straight but by the time I finished it had puffed out again.</li>
      <li>black(the real one is supposed to match the straightener.</li>
      <li>This iron only goes to 230 degrees, which really protects your hair, especially if you are not quite adept at using the thing.</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair and my daughter has thick course curly hair and neither of us had any problems getting our hair to straighten easily with it.</li>
      <li>So the $40 I spent on the straighter plus money for a new counter top</li>
      <li>Royale products always are, but when I ordered this product i got an older version.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I ordered it again to find out that it hardly even gets warm .</li>
      <li>It works just as well as any other low-price flat iron, but its not the amazing Royale I bought for my mom.</li>
      <li>The product works fine, but we didn&#x27;t get a baby blue one, instead we got a purple one, which was fine but a little unexpected.</li>
      <li>, I still have to blow dry my hai and the plated get very hot.</li>
      <li>Leaves you hair feeling soft and moist.</li>
      <li>Would highly reccomend especially for the price.</li>
      <li>The only complain i have is that in the picture it looks aqua blue and it came like a cross between light purple n baby blue.</li>
      <li>The flat iron would work on wet hair the sales rep disclosed and it would never get hot to the touch</li>
      <li>but it would flat iron the hair like no other product.  </li>

    <li> Took at least one hour to get hot. Just horrible flat iron. Worst ever, I will never purchase this brand ever again.</li>
    <li> The product works fine, but we didn&#x27;t get a baby blue one, instead we got a purple one, which was fine but a little unexpected.</li>
    <li> great service with genuine products....</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great. Royale products always are, but when I ordered this product i got an older version. It isn&#x27;t what the picture looks like. False information. Nevertheless, the flat iron works wonders besides the fact that it smells a litte like it&#x27;s burning when its on. It did save me tons of money ordering off of Amazon. All in all I give this product a 3 only because of false advertismen.</li>
    <li> ***Review From Dad***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is in college and asked for this specific flat iron so I ordered this one from Amazon.  She was having to borrow one from from her roommate every day and needed to get one of her own.  Her best friend&#x27;s mom purchased the exact same iron in the mall for $80!  Can&#x27;t believe the savings here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says it is the best straightener she has ever used in it truly is \\&quot;professional\\&quot; quality.</li>
    <li> Assume product!, so glad I didn&#x27;t pay $300.00 at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it!.&lt;br /&gt;Fast arrival!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Great flat irons but the cord popped out 2 day&#x27;s after using it:/</li>
    <li> I received this Product over a month ago. At first I hated it but realized I needed to let it heat up longer than my Chi.  But if you let it heat up to long it will burn your counter top! I was really disappointed and would not buy this product again. .  However  it does straighten my hair so who am I to complain. I know my CHI never burned my counter top.  Now it will sure need to be replaced before I sell my home. So the $40 I spent on the straighter plus money for a new counter top it was not worth the price. Disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. This is not the original brand and pulls at my hair. Couldn&#x27;t stand to use it!</li>
    <li> I bought a chi n i didnt like it, then my friend told me about this iron n that is was $150 at the mall. I found it here for $60 :). Its amazing, gets hot quick n stays hot. The only complain i have is that in the picture it looks aqua blue and it came like a cross between light purple n baby blue. Other then that. Amazing :)</li>
    <li> nothing like I expected. plates were blackish colored didn&#x27;t heat up or straighten like the one I got at the mall Kiosk several years ago. box and product were very different. feels cheap and slippery to hold onto.  all and all it&#x27;s better than nothing but not the deal I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I ordered a green one of these and they sent me a blue one and it got bad pretty soon I don&#x27;t know if it was because my sister used it that it got really bad and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore so not very good to last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Agree with everyone else not the same as in the mall straitens just like the cheap ones hair frizzed up not even 30 mins after.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased at all with this . I had gotten one years ago in the mall and was very happy with the product . That&#x27;s why I ordered it again to find out that it hardly even gets warm .</li>
    <li> I spend 100+ dollars at the mall kiosk to get my mom the green, classic Royale Straightener. Soon after, I used it a few times and decided I wanted one too. Works better than Chi in my opinion. Feels nice in the hand and certainly doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. However, a hundred bucks was a bit to spend soon after Christmas. I purchased this from Amazon and it is most definitely fake. It&#x27;s lightweight, feels cheap, the chord is black(the real one is supposed to match the straightener. So BLUE). Also, the cheap plastic on it around the edges isn&#x27;t smooth. It&#x27;s rigid. It works just as well as any other low-price flat iron, but its not the amazing Royale I bought for my mom.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair was straight but by the time I finished it had puffed out again. Did not live up to the hype!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this product line before and as always the item is as good as it is advertised to be.</li>
    <li> Plates cracked after a few uses!</li>
    <li> Like everyone else I became aware of this product in a mall kiosk. The flat iron would work on wet hair the sales rep disclosed and it would never get hot to the touch but it would flat iron the hair like no other product.  I was told it would be the best item I would ever get, well, I am not pleased with it!  I bought this item on amazon.com because of the price of course, but when I used it it did not work on wet hair like it was described, I still have to blow dry my hai and the plated get very hot. Now everything about the product looks authentic but it does not function like it was described by the sales rep.  Bottom line I would not recommend this product, but for 40ish dollars what should i expect.</li>
    <li> I ordered two very nice Royale straighteners. Was very pleased with the fast shipment of the products. Plugged them in and heated up very quickly. Will not be using because these are a gift.</li>
    <li> It is everything it says it is! Leaves you hair feeling soft and moist.</li>
    <li> When traveling abroad I needed a flat iron that had dual voltage. This one has adjustable heat temperature and gets very hot. I was surprised that works as well if not better than my $120 salon name brand iron. I have fine curly hair and my daughter has thick course curly hair and neither of us had any problems getting our hair to straighten easily with it. We have years of experience using flat irons so if you are unfamiliar with them I would suggest practicing on the lower temperatures. Would highly reccomend especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Totally loved this straightner! Bought one for my daughter and she loves it! Unfortunately, don&#x27;t drop it because it breaks. Mine shattered but plan on getting another one!</li>
    <li> I have never used any hair \\&quot;tools\\&quot; before.  But my daughter told me this was the iron to get, so I did. $150 in the mall, $50 on-line. I purchased this Royale straightening iron on Amazon, and it arrived quickly, was exactly what I wanted, and super savings.  This iron only goes to 230 degrees, which really protects your hair, especially if you are not quite adept at using the thing. Really happy!</li>
    <li> Worked well and straightened my hair without frying it.</li>
    <li> This will straighten my extremely curly hair and stay for a few days but when I tried to curl my friends hair it only stayed about 10 minutes. I don&#x27;t need to curl my hair so I am very happy with it.</li>
