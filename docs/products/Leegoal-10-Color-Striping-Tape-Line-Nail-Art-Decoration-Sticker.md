### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product with plenty of tape to use!</li>
      <li>Great to use to make lined designs in their nails or to add colored lines into the design.</li>
      <li>the tape sticks good and looks great</li>
      <li>This is a good assortment with no duplicate colors.</li>
      <li>However, they would be good to use for masking off a stripe pattern, and then pulling them off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with&lt;br</li>
      <li>easy to apply on the nails beautiful colors..</li>
      <li>Well it&#x27;s good, but I think it could have been more sticky if you wanted the sticky strips to stay on as a design.</li>
      <li>pain in the butt honestly.</li>
      <li>The product colors are nice.  </li>
      <li>These are perfect for making lines in your nails and for using them as guides to make straight painted lines.</li>
      <li>They came in handy for Halloween.</li>
      <li>I think the idea is nice</li>
      <li>Otherwise they add a nice striping effect to your nail art.</li>
      <li>They were super cheap and are really great colors!</li>
      <li>love this wheel</li>
      <li>Just like most rolls of tape</li>
      <li>Love them, I use them with a lot of my nail designs.</li>
      <li>when pulling out pieces of tape :)</li>
      <li>so I would just recommend using more than one coat</li>
      <li>I purchased these for my grand daughter.</li>
      <li>I use these for nail art but not much, because they just don&#x27;t stick very good and pull up at the ends very easily.</li>
      <li>Very happy with my order and received before the expected date.</li>
      <li>Cool nail art decoration ribbons!</li>
      <li>I love the product, I just wasn&#x27;t looking for something that was going to have such a great learning curve.</li>
      <li>Item is as described and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>the strips stay on and come off easy.</li>
      <li>Easy to use too.</li>
      <li>I would recommend buying if you are willing to take the time to learn how to effectively use the tape, or if it is something that you are going to use to get a design in the polish (like taping off a portion of your nail).</li>
      <li>and it should be fine.</li>
      <li>Awesome products, just wish it was a little quicker ship time</li>
      <li>These are fantastic if you have someone else to do it for you, or if you&#x27;re going to do them on someone else.  </li>
      <li>but thanks anyway!!!</li>
      <li>This little pack is great-- many holographic colors from all ends of the spectrum for nail art.</li>
      <li>I really liked all the different colors!</li>
      <li>the strips are so thin and dainty!  </li>
      <li>I was all excited to get my striping tape in the mail (came within a reasonable amount of time)</li>
      <li>really like this product these tapes work well and make very pretty art on the nail</li>
      <li>The colors are pretty.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using striping tape</li>
      <li>Send me items ect..for the idea ;)</li>
      <li>I only wish I would&#x27;ve recieved more colors, but I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s really too much of a hassle and would probably cost more to send them back</li>
      <li>The stick is just right: it comes off easily when making designs without hurting the dried under layer of paint, yet it stays on when applied over a relatively fresh coat.</li>
      <li>I really like the shiny foil finish.</li>
      <li>I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
      <li>and I live in Puerto Rico and believe me they are widely separated places, but I love the product because it adheres quite well</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I only used one coat, however, and the tape was fine on nails where I layered the topcoat on a bit thick</li>
      <li>so I am not sure if it is normal for the laminate layer to peel without enough top coats, but that is my only concern.</li>
      <li>Difficult to use on your own.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to find the start of it when it&#x27;s been used, but not impossible.</li>

    <li> really like this product these tapes work well and make very pretty art on the nail</li>
    <li> I think the idea is nice but I wish the tape was a little bit thicker. It was hard to work with and to put on.</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t received my product and it&#x27;s been over a month. I&#x27;m going to assume I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Too hard find the start of the tape. Will spend several minutes trying to work with this and then we&#x27;ll cut several rounds to create an end.  Then an using about 4-5 at a time.  pain in the butt honestly. you can use medical tape, painting tape, or similar items instead if you are trying to create a line for a 2 shade look.</li>
    <li> Love them, I use them with a lot of my nail designs. They came in handy for Halloween. Works well with mixing colors!</li>
    <li> Cool nail art decoration ribbons! They were super cheap and are really great colors! Easy to use too. I&#x27;m very pleased with&lt;br /&gt;this purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my grand daughter. She loves them.. the strips stay on and come off easy.</li>
    <li> I only received 9 colors and it took a while to arrive.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for making lines in your nails and for using them as guides to make straight painted lines. I only wish I would&#x27;ve recieved more colors, but I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> cute but difficult to apply.  Maybe they can come up with a wheel like you would use with tape. Put them all on a wheel and pull out the color you need &amp; cut on tape blade.  Send me items ect..for the idea ;)</li>
    <li> took a long time to reach me, but there is no problem, because I understand that is from Hong Kong and I live in Puerto Rico and believe me they are widely separated places, but I love the product because it adheres quite well</li>
    <li> I really liked all the different colors! the tape sticks good and looks great, only bad thing is the roll comes off of holder at the first pull... BE CAREFUL! when pulling out pieces of tape :)</li>
    <li> Awesome products, just wish it was a little quicker ship time but thanks anyway!!! I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
    <li> The tape works really well and doesn&#x27;t pull off your base polish.  Great product with plenty of tape to use!</li>

    <li> I use these for nail art but not much, because they just don&#x27;t stick very good and pull up at the ends very easily. They take alot of manipulation to apply as well, because they don&#x27;t stick. Sorry folks, but not worth the savings if they are that hard to work with, and I have a very steady hand and work pretty quickly. Time is $ and these particular striping tapes are an epic FAIL.</li>
    <li> The product colors are nice.  The only problem, they continually come off after a couple of days, even with topcoat.  However, they would be good to use for masking off a stripe pattern, and then pulling them off.  Or, if you just want something to last a couple of days.  Just don&#x27;t expect them to stay on for two weeks!  The colors are pretty.</li>
    <li> This takes a lot of dedication to use. I would recommend buying if you are willing to take the time to learn how to effectively use the tape, or if it is something that you are going to use to get a design in the polish (like taping off a portion of your nail). There aren&#x27;t instructions...just trial and error. I love the product, I just wasn&#x27;t looking for something that was going to have such a great learning curve.</li>
    <li> They will do the Job, When I received them I was suprised of how small is the roll. They look bigger in the picture !!!</li>
    <li> This is a good assortment with no duplicate colors. I really like the shiny foil finish.</li>
    <li> I was all excited to get my striping tape in the mail (came within a reasonable amount of time) but when I opened up the package there were only 9 tapes instead of 10. To some that&#x27;s not a big deal but I paid for 10 and wanted 10, it&#x27;s really too much of a hassle and would probably cost more to send them back so I&#x27;m stuck with what I have. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just like most rolls of tape it&#x27;s hard to find the start of it when it&#x27;s been used, but not impossible. The stick is just right: it comes off easily when making designs without hurting the dried under layer of paint, yet it stays on when applied over a relatively fresh coat.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my daughter and her nails are going to be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I love this wheel the strips are so thin and dainty!  She is going to enjoy&lt;br /&gt;her artsy manicures!!!</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s good, but I think it could have been more sticky if you wanted the sticky strips to stay on as a design.</li>
