### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Customer service at the manufacturer is wonderful as well.</li>
      <li>Great purchase!</li>
      <li>Customer service was EXCELLENT helped me exchange it for another unit that worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have replaced it with another brand--not a happy customer.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace a worn-out Emjoy Gold Caress (which worked great, by the way).  </li>
      <li>To be honest , it hurt!</li>
      <li>and the price is good.</li>
      <li>two Brauns I own both use a 12 volt transformer. . . .</li>
      <li>It just isn&#x27;t effective.</li>
      <li>and I got to try it before I bought my own.</li>
      <li>Its easy!</li>
      <li>it works better and faster.</li>
      <li>Plus, It only gets the longer hairs, so in order for it to do any good, I need to go without shaving for a 2-3 days to build up a good bit of stubble.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a cheap epillator model, and you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t pull out hairs (just broke most of them) on the first pass</li>
      <li>Totally worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It took me a good ten minutes just to do one armpit (and I still had to shave afterward.)    </li>
      <li>I love it - pulls out all my hair quickly and effectively with little pain.</li>
      <li>The item is good and worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say enough nice things about the unit.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know about any other epilator products to advise you of a good one.</li>
      <li>Let your hair grow out a bit for the first time you use it.</li>
      <li>With regular use I don&#x27;t even notice it - if I don&#x27;t use it for a week or more</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time today.</li>
      <li>had my first unit for 6-7 years</li>
      <li>my skin does become a bit more sensitive to the epilating action</li>
      <li>Apparently, it has a stripped (plastic, cheap) gear</li>
      <li>This thing certainly was &#x27;Sin Dolor&#x27; (Painless).  </li>
      <li>works well while being connected to electrical outlet, but battery drains out fast if not being charged.</li>
      <li>You can really use it anywhere.</li>
      <li>My arms stayed smooth for about two weeks until the stubble came back, but it doesn&#x27;t look like all the folicles are growing new hair.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this item</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that everyone else who wrote a review has a high pain tolerance</li>
      <li>The motor is great, holds a charge well even with daily use, and it is delicate enough for my sensitive areas but effective enough to take care of larger areas like my legs without a problem and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some people said it doesn&#x27;t work, possibly because they are not using it right.</li>
      <li>I am still looking for a new epilator, but I do not recommend this one.</li>
      <li>have been epilating for 5 years now (Braun) and wanted a new epilator.</li>
      <li>I gave this product two stars, because, it was relatively pain free, but, that is the only reason.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, it only hurts bad the first time you use it, it gets better after that.</li>
      <li>For one thing, it&#x27;s extremely loud.</li>
      <li>I had to get my old Braun out and redo both thighs.</li>
      <li>Then I went away for two weeks and noticed that the leg I did didn&#x27;t  grow back the hairs the whole two weeks.</li>
      <li>About a month or two ago (early March 2013)</li>
      <li>My wife cannot shave her underarms due to reactions from the razor and always tweezes, so were so excited to finally get an epilator to maybe save her some time.</li>
      <li>It hurts at first for beginners but once you get used to it, it becomes very soft and sometimes removes the dark spots underneath also.</li>
      <li>Either it pulls them, but not hard enough, or it breaks them off.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very loud, hard to clean, and is NOT painless.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never used an epilator before, so I&#x27;m not sure how other epilators work, but so far I&#x27;m not too pleased with my purchase.     </li>
      <li>My armpit is still completely bare (just the one, it hurt too much for me to attempt the other).</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my new unit for 6 months now without 1 single ingrown hair.</li>
      <li>(I expected that, but the level of pain was almost too high for me as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do have thicker hair but not too thick and the emojoi epilator pulled them RIGHT out!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for my mom to replace a different Emjoi model. She loves this one- it works better and faster. There is a lot of mixed reviews with epilators- highly recommend this item and the price is good.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, it just broke the hairs instead of pulling them. My wife cannot shave her underarms due to reactions from the razor and always tweezes, so were so excited to finally get an epilator to maybe save her some time. Unfortunately this is not it. It did not pull one single hair from her under arms, but after a few passes it broke about half of them. We are returning it and trying one of the other manufacturers. My advice, don&#x27;t waste your time on this one, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I just bought this one. I&#x27;d never used an epilator before, so I&#x27;m not sure how other epilators work, but so far I&#x27;m not too pleased with my purchase.     For one thing, it&#x27;s extremely loud. It sounds like a buzz saw, which is especially annoying when I use it near my face. (I don&#x27;t even like using it when other people are in the house, for that reason.) Plus, It only gets the longer hairs, so in order for it to do any good, I need to go without shaving for a 2-3 days to build up a good bit of stubble. This is very inconvenient, if I have a date the next morning. Also, it takes a really long time and never seems to get all the hair. It took me a good ten minutes just to do one armpit (and I still had to shave afterward.)    I wish I could take this back to Walmart where I bought it, but they probably don&#x27;t want since it&#x27;s been opened. Oh, well--it&#x27;s something, and I&#x27;ll make it work.</li>
    <li> My mom has one of these and I got to try it before I bought my own. To be honest , it hurt! I only got one leg done and didn&#x27;t want it anymore. Then I went away for two weeks and noticed that the leg I did didn&#x27;t  grow back the hairs the whole two weeks. That&#x27;s when I knew I was going to buy this product for myself. To be honest, it only hurts bad the first time you use it, it gets better after that.My mom is hooked on hers and now I&#x27;m hooked on mine!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at Target or Walmart for $40.  I&#x27;ve used it only a few times and don&#x27;t like it.  It says it&#x27;s painless and efficient, but it hurts like hell and only pulls a couple hairs out at a time.  I&#x27;m returning mine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a local drug store in lieu of razor heads. I have very thick, coarse hair on my arms and I have a tendency to get a girlstache and beard if I don&#x27;t keep up. The thick hair tends to clog up the standard razors so I thought I&#x27;d try this \\&quot;virtually pain free\\&quot; method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that everyone else who wrote a review has a high pain tolerance or I&#x27;m just a wuss, but using this product was nothing short of slow torture. It hurt so bad that I couldn&#x27;t do it on my own. Thankfully, I have a particularly sadistic roommate who volunteered to put me through what I can describe as a dozen angry pixies using dull tweezers to rapidly pluck out the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did one arm, and rested. Belly and chest, rested, then the other arm. It hurt so bad that I had to stifle my grunts and screams with a pillow. When it got to the pits, I started sobbing. It was a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it did pull the hair out! My arms stayed smooth for about two weeks until the stubble came back, but it doesn&#x27;t look like all the folicles are growing new hair. My armpit is still completely bare (just the one, it hurt too much for me to attempt the other). Still haven&#x27;t tried my legs, but I fear the results pain-wise. So, the product gets a three star because it did do as promised; pulled out the hair. It just hurt like a mother.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at Wal-Mart today for $25. &lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow it goes back to the store. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been epilating for 5 years now (Braun) and wanted a new epilator. &lt;br /&gt;(My wife told me they wear out and need to be replaced) At only $25, I thought, \\&quot;What the hey! I&#x27;ll give it a shot!\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After 70 minutes on just my upper thighs, I realized this product is ineffective junk. I had to get my old Braun out and redo both thighs. &lt;br /&gt;Even so, the nearly-worn-out Braun only took me 20 minutes to do my legs from waist to toe, including the thighs that I had to redo. I am still looking for a new epilator, but I do not recommend this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars instead of one because it IS painless. It just isn&#x27;t effective. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I was repackaging the unit, I noticed the power rating on the transformer; 3 volts.   &lt;br /&gt;The two Brauns I own both use a 12 volt transformer. . . . Something to think about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(Yes, I am a guy. I have rather severe OCD and I epilate to avoid unconscious hair plucking, which gets badly infected)</li>
    <li> I have been exfoliating for 15 years.  I bought this at Walmart 2 years ago and now I am looking for another one for another location. The previous one that  had was expensive and more painful to use. The experiences in the reviews are not at all like my experience.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product. I love it - pulls out all my hair quickly and effectively with little pain. With regular use I don&#x27;t even notice it - if I don&#x27;t use it for a week or more my skin does become a bit more sensitive to the epilating action but I think that is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my first unit for 6-7 years - I used it constantly. After a while it stopped holding a charge and I felt the motor was getting weaker. So I instantly and without hesitation ordered another unit. However this unit did not work as well - more painful and gave me lots of ingrown hairs. Customer service was EXCELLENT helped me exchange it for another unit that worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my new unit for 6 months now without 1 single ingrown hair. The motor is great, holds a charge well even with daily use, and it is delicate enough for my sensitive areas but effective enough to take care of larger areas like my legs without a problem and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about the unit. Customer service at the manufacturer is wonderful as well. They have definitely earned my lifetime loyalty!</li>
    <li> I wax, and I thought I&#x27;d use an epilator for in between waxes, just to get the few hairs that grow in longer.  This epilator didn&#x27;t get them.  I can run it over the same spot 20 times, and there are still hairs left.  I can feel it grabbing the hairs but it doesn&#x27;t actually pull them out.  Either it pulls them, but not hard enough, or it breaks them off.  Completely worthless.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a worn-out Emjoy Gold Caress (which worked great, by the way).  This thing certainly was &#x27;Sin Dolor&#x27; (Painless).  It also did not do the job.  I went over and over a couple of long hairs but it just wouldn&#x27;t get them.  Ended up tweezing.  I am going to go for another Gold Caress, or may try the Braun epilator.</li>
    <li> My sister got this model a long time ago. She didn&#x27;t use it because she said it was too painful, and that it even drew blood, and didn&#x27;t work well. I scoffed at her exaggeration, and decided to use it just to try epillating for myself. I will try again, just not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t pull out hairs (just broke most of them) on the first pass, it&#x27;s very loud, hard to clean, and is NOT painless. (I expected that, but the level of pain was almost too high for me as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cheap epillator model, and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Ignore all of the bad reviews! If you are thinking about buying this... BUY IT! I used it for the first time today. I do have thicker hair but not too thick and the emojoi epilator pulled them RIGHT out! It was not too painful, just as painful as waxing. Its obviously going to hurt a little because your pulling hairs from the root. Nothing too bad at all! You can really use it anywhere. Its easy! Fallow the instructions. Totally worth every penny! It is rechargeable, doesn&#x27;t need batteries. Truly what I have been waiting for. Some people said it doesn&#x27;t work, possibly because they are not using it right. Let your hair grow out a bit for the first time you use it. Great purchase! BUY BUY BUY!</li>
    <li> terrible! does not work. Dont bother buying this epilator it is completely worthless!!</li>
    <li> What a waste of time and money.  This does not work.  After 45 minutes I didn&#x27;t even have one thigh done and still had to shave it.  It is being returned!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money, use a razor.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible...I bought this product at Wal-Mart for $25.00.  It was for my daughter, but, I thought I would use it also.  After about an hour, my daughter brought this epilator to me and said \\&quot;It sucks...and I give up!\\&quot;  She still had to shave after using this product.  The product did not remove almost any of the hair. Those that were \\&quot;removed\\&quot; were only partially removed and still left a stubble or a hair about 1/8\\&quot; in length.  Terrible product.  I gave this product two stars, because, it was relatively pain free, but, that is the only reason.  This epilator is being returned to the store today.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  Unfortunately this is my first time using an epilator, so, I don&#x27;t know about any other epilator products to advise you of a good one.</li>
    <li> It hurts at first for beginners but once you get used to it, it becomes very soft and sometimes removes the dark spots underneath also.</li>
    <li> The item is good and worth the money spent. works well while being connected to electrical outlet, but battery drains out fast if not being charged.</li>
    <li> I bought my Emjoi epilator (it does not say AY-5 Sin Dolor but the item in the picture looks like mine) on December 12, 2012.  About a month or two ago (early March 2013), it started \\&quot;not\\&quot; working.  The motor was running but the tweezers weren&#x27;t.  Apparently, it has a stripped (plastic, cheap) gear inside.&lt;br /&gt;I have replaced it with another brand--not a happy customer.</li>
