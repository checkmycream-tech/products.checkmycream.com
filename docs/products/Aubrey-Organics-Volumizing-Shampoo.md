### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was so happy I discovered Aubrey Shampoos!</li>
      <li>and my hair is in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>It depends upon the weather what is ideal for my hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo.</li>
      <li>Both smelled great, regardless of the difference.</li>
      <li>Great price on Amazon (although the prices do change daily/hourly sometimes).  </li>
      <li>That worked great until I went on vacation.  </li>
      <li>It smells great and cleans well.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great.  </li>
      <li>The original formula which was divine!!!</li>
      <li>shampoo is good, but I have to use a lot to get it in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Tips add a drop of peppermint in to it and you will have a very refreshing shampoo</li>
      <li>I love the GPB conditioner!</li>
      <li>Old formula was brilliant - cleaned well added volume and shine, and smelled beautifully herbal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Rose Hip Seed Oil &amp; Apple Stem Cell</li>
      <li>I have very fine, 3c curls...</li>
      <li>Old formula worked wonderfully but not any more.</li>
      <li>etc - meaning at the most</li>
      <li>Since the product is plant-based, it is quite gentle, however, works great on cleaning his hair from the scalp.</li>
      <li>Since it seemed to get more oil off my scalp than the others, I was using it once a week to get out styling buildup.  </li>
      <li>Really love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Been using it for many years and got rid of all my dandruff shampoos.  </li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I also love using it on my kids after swimming in a chlorine pool.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a healthy shampoo, you should try it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the scent, but I love the way it works on my hair and the way my scalp feels after using.</li>
      <li>My hear looks much better and stay cleaner longer.</li>
      <li>Great to find natural products that work better than all those chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Even though that the scent is very appealing, there has been a change in scent since the first bottle that I had.</li>
      <li>All great, natural ingredients, and</li>
      <li>It works great with my thin hair, gives it body feels healthy and has a pleasant smell, will buy this product again, although I didn&#x27;t get this one online</li>
      <li>If I had actually received what was captured in the image, that would be great.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is great, although I use it only a couple times a week.</li>
      <li>(translation: water); laurel glucoside (from coconut/beet sugar); oryza sativa (rice) extract; on and on with equally bizarre ingredients...</li>
      <li>So, be aware!!</li>
      <li>I have very greasy hair and using this kind never makes it realy feel clean.</li>
      <li>It comes out squeaky clean, without drying his hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo isn&#x27;t full of luscious suds, but we can leave that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s great for other hair types</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a product that is truly free of toxins and really works</li>
      <li>I have better luck with Desert Essence Red Raspberry Shampoo.</li>
      <li>Although Aubrey is supposed to have one of the cleanest personal care lines, I get allergic reactions to many of their products including this one.  </li>
      <li>At first I liked them but after using them a few days I am finding my hair gets greasy</li>
      <li>What the front label actually says (in the fine, fine print) of the actual bottle when it arrives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very retro</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really blame the shampoo for me not reading the label</li>
      <li>It smells very rosy...</li>
      <li>It cleans the hair very well.</li>
      <li>really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is not overpowering but still strong and lingers for a long time which I think is rude as it is better that others not be able to smell your scent unless they are close enough to hug or kiss you.</li>
      <li>Just be aware that you should check the ingredients for items you are sensitive to.</li>
      <li>New formula!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I would say it is a bit more harsh than the others I have tried.  </li>
      <li>New formula has \\&quot;harvest apple\\&quot; on the label.</li>
      <li>They sent me the new formula</li>
      <li>Do not buy the new formula.</li>
      <li>So I decided to buy the exact same one.</li>
      <li>It was fine for a few days.  </li>
      <li>but found when this arrived the name was a little deceptive - as it contains primarily what they call:&lt;br /&gt;aqua</li>
      <li>and I was shopping for the old formula as featured in the photo.  </li>
      <li>I have an extremely sensitive scalp</li>
      <li>but i can see how some people think its an old person smell...</li>
      <li>Being a natural product, the suds to the shampoo is very nice...not too little as some natural shampoos are.</li>
      <li>Very thin and watery, smells sickly sweet like apples and cheap drugstore chemically fragranced shampoos, and leaves hair flat and greasy.</li>
      <li>IMHO the more I used it, the worse my hair got.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great shampoo. I have tried other \\&quot;free\\&quot; shampoos that dry out your hair or leave a nasty build-up. If you are looking for a product that is truly free of toxins and really works well then you should try this.</li>
    <li> If I were to create a shampoo, this has all of the ingredients I would use.  However, it left my hair feeling like straw and I had to use a lot of conditioner afterward.  If you are looking for a healthy shampoo, you should try it.  There are not many shampoos made with such high quality ingredients as this one is.</li>
    <li> What is being advertised is not what I got.  I got the harvest apple one.  So, be aware!!</li>
    <li> I always wonder why &#x27;WEN Shampoo&#x27; (the infomercial) acts like a new discovery for deleting the ingredients that are bad for the hair, when Aubrey has been around doing it for YEARS!  All great, natural ingredients, and because I color my hair, I use the Rosa Mosqueta version.  Great price on Amazon (although the prices do change daily/hourly sometimes).  The shampoo isn&#x27;t full of luscious suds, but we can leave that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (and it&#x27;s brother &amp; sister derivatives) for degreasing engines - not our hair!</li>
    <li> It smells very rosy... i love it but i can see how some people think its an old person smell... Tips add a drop of peppermint in to it and you will have a very refreshing shampoo</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great.  It cleans well, too.  It didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have an extremely sensitive scalp and I was hoping this shampoo wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my scalp, but it did.  If you don&#x27;t have a scalp issue, this shampoo will likely work for you.  However, if you do have tender scalp and are looking for an organic product that cleans without inflaming, keep looking.  And if you find something, leave a message, I&#x27;d like to try your recommendation.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a long time ago and have finally run out of the bottle. So I decided to buy the exact same one. I use it on my son, who has very thick hair and can get pretty oily with the summer heat. Since the product is plant-based, it is quite gentle, however, works great on cleaning his hair from the scalp. It comes out squeaky clean, without drying his hair. I also love using it on my kids after swimming in a chlorine pool. It cleans the hair very well. Being a natural product, the suds to the shampoo is very nice...not too little as some natural shampoos are. Even though that the scent is very appealing, there has been a change in scent since the first bottle that I had. Both smelled great, regardless of the difference. It might probably be different ratios of specific flowers that are used in the shampoo that may have contributed to the change in smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent, but I love the way it works on my hair and the way my scalp feels after using. I do have oily hair which might affect my experience.</li>
    <li> IMHO the more I used it, the worse my hair got. My sculp itched, my hair was hay-dry on the first day and lumpy and dull on the second. I didn&#x27;t like the smell either. It&#x27;s very retro - that&#x27;s the only way I can describe it. Not at all sentual. Now it&#x27;s my dog&#x27;s shampoo. He doesn&#x27;t mind. In fact, I think he likes it.</li>
    <li> If I had actually received what was captured in the image, that would be great.  They sent me the new formula and I was shopping for the old formula as featured in the photo.  The one they sent me had different ingredients and a different bottle.</li>
    <li> Beware...and actually read the INGREDIENTS. I bought this to replace ALL Rosa Mosqueta shampoo...but found when this arrived the name was a little deceptive - as it contains primarily what they call:&lt;br /&gt;aqua (translation: water); laurel glucoside (from coconut/beet sugar); oryza sativa (rice) extract; on and on with equally bizarre ingredients...then mid-way through a VERY LONG list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- rosa...etc - meaning at the most this is a minimal volume of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately had not opened and tried to use the product when discovered this. What the front label actually says (in the fine, fine print) of the actual bottle when it arrives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Rose Hip Seed Oil &amp; Apple Stem Cell&lt;br /&gt;Harvest Apple&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say what???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aubrey - I&#x27;m disappointed in you - AND you really need to decide if you want to be a quality advertiser.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great, although I use it only a couple times a week. It seems to give me volume but with any shampoo I don&#x27;t like to use it every day.  It depends upon the weather what is ideal for my hair.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried Aubrey Organics Rosa Mosqueta Shampoo but it did not work for me.  Although Aubrey is supposed to have one of the cleanest personal care lines, I get allergic reactions to many of their products including this one.  The scent is not overpowering but still strong and lingers for a long time which I think is rude as it is better that others not be able to smell your scent unless they are close enough to hug or kiss you. I turned red on my scalp, face, and neck all around my head of hair.  I have better luck with Desert Essence Red Raspberry Shampoo.</li>
    <li> After using  my hair felt like straw, stripped, and dry. It felt so rough, I was afraid to comb through it with for fear of it breaking off.  I had to immediately do a deep conditioning.  I have very fine, 3c curls...and my hair is in excellent condition.  Organic or not...it felt like I washed my hair with dish-washing liquid.</li>
    <li> It works great with my thin hair, gives it body feels healthy and has a pleasant smell, will buy this product again, although I didn&#x27;t get this one online I still recommend it for thin or weak hair.</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff.  Been using it for many years and got rid of all my dandruff shampoos.  Great to find natural products that work better than all those chemicals.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so happy I discovered Aubrey Shampoos! My hear looks much better and stay cleaner longer. Before I had to wash my hear every day or every other day, now I can wash it once in 3 days!</li>
    <li> Do not buy the new formula. Old formula was brilliant - cleaned well added volume and shine, and smelled beautifully herbal. New formula is horrible. Very thin and watery, smells sickly sweet like apples and cheap drugstore chemically fragranced shampoos, and leaves hair flat and greasy.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No perfumes or fragrances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you only have to use a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have very greasy hair and using this kind never makes it realy feel clean. Maybe it&#x27;s great for other hair types but it&#x27;s not my thing</li>
    <li> The original formula which was divine!!! New formula has \\&quot;harvest apple\\&quot; on the label.</li>
    <li> New formula! Do not buy! Dries hair! Old formula worked wonderfully but not any more.</li>
    <li> I have used several of the Aubrey Organics Shampoos and Conditioners.  I love the GPB conditioner! This shampoo was no different.  It smells great and cleans well.  I would say it is a bit more harsh than the others I have tried.  I noticed that I do need a conditioner every time I use this.  Since it seemed to get more oil off my scalp than the others, I was using it once a week to get out styling buildup.  That worked great until I went on vacation.  I only had room for one shampoo and I chose this one.  It was fine for a few days.  Unfortunately I hadn&#x27;t noticed that it contains Organic Corn Syrup.  I am unfortunately one of those unlucky people allergic to corn in all its various tricky forms.  After a week of using it as my daily shampoo my scalp was red scaly and itchy.  This stopped a few days after I switched to something else mid-vacation.  I can&#x27;t really blame the shampoo for me not reading the label so I have to go 4 star!  Just be aware that you should check the ingredients for items you are sensitive to.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a lot of the Aubrey products lately.  At first I liked them but after using them a few days I am finding my hair gets greasy really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is good, but I have to use a lot to get it in my hair.  Makes it expensive.</li>
