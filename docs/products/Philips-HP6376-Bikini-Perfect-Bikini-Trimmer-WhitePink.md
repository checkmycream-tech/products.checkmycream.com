### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good trimmer.  </li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>The style of the trimmer is attractive if you care about that sort of thing.</li>
      <li>But I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>I must say I loved it considering it  </li>
      <li>Would tell friends, good deal for the price.</li>
      <li>Best feature, you can clean it well in water.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Looks great and easy to charge and set up.  </li>
      <li>Good price, somewhat better than the conair that I had.</li>
      <li>I purchased this trimmer with high expectations as it stated that it was a girl&#x27;s best trimming friend.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but I&#x27;m satisfied with how it gets rid of my pubes.</li>
      <li>glad they did ..</li>
      <li>I have seen many reviews saying the micro shaver didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I love this Bikini trimmer</li>
      <li>(I dropped it one too many times in the shower)</li>
      <li>So I would say if you want just a trimmer then this item works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Cleaning is also easy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how good this one is compared to many others, but I know it was way better than the first one I had, and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions to a T and everything worked out fine</li>
      <li>thats who originally made it for bliss same great product  </li>
      <li>I had read reviews on different ones but decided to go with this one because of the precision comb it has 1-5 levels and you chose which level you want it does trim your hair very nicely.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s waterproof and thus easy to quickly rinse off.</li>
      <li>The packaging and product itself is nicely made and I love that it comes with a cute little pouch to put everything in.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this item and the first time I used it the trimmer worked fine.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be a lot better than shaving with a normal razor...</li>
      <li>many people complain that it might not shave everything off completely think that&#x27;s when you go in with a straight razor.</li>
      <li>So I opted to try the microshaver instead which did absolutely nothing!</li>
      <li>and I still like it better than others from my past :-)</li>
      <li>this was my first time ever using one and purchasing one.</li>
      <li>was my first time.</li>
      <li>I thought that at first too.</li>
      <li>first got this from bliss for 65 dollars it lasted for 5 years....  </li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say is it has a 45 day money back guarantee.</li>
      <li>It was overall easy to use and the instructions helped.</li>
      <li>I have only used it once, however it did a fine job.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really cut well.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t care much for the micro shaver but still have to use it to get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>The remington trimmer cut the hair much closer to the skin.</li>
      <li>Very durable.  </li>
      <li>but if you are wanting it to maintain and keep you really closely shaved do not buy this.  </li>
      <li>I really recommend not purchasing.  </li>
      <li>At this price I expected something more durable..</li>
      <li>Kind of, i thought I can actually use it for remove the hair, not only cut it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty loud.</li>
      <li>My main concern is with the micro shaver as I have yet to get it to shave anything.  </li>
      <li>I love how it came with a little zipper bag for you to store it.</li>
      <li>so I got a new one.</li>
      <li>The precision trimmer/comb barely works.  </li>
      <li>I had an electric trimmer before that was less than stellar.</li>

<li> I am very careful when I shave</li>
<li> almost half the price</li>
<li> It does cut a little hair</li>

<li> With that being said, the trimmer and attached comb works quite well and it helped me from getting the usual shaving bumps.  </li>
<li> and I get cut by this razor at least five times while shaving.  </li>
<li> or I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  </li>
<li> wrong.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this product! I have had several and each time I break one I have to get another! Beauty essential for summer and all year round!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but I&#x27;m satisfied with how it gets rid of my pubes.</li>
    <li> I love this Bikini trimmer this was my first time ever using one and purchasing one. I must say I loved it considering it  was my first time. I had read reviews on different ones but decided to go with this one because of the precision comb it has 1-5 levels and you chose which level you want it does trim your hair very nicely. Also the trimmer can be used without the comb and I like it because you can get in there and get all the extra unwanted hair. Didn&#x27;t care much for the micro shaver but still have to use it to get the hang of it. It was overall easy to use and the instructions helped. I love how it came with a little zipper bag for you to store it. I recommend this for anyone wanting to trim the bikini line and notice it&#x27;s a trimmer not a shaver many people complain that it might not shave everything off completely think that&#x27;s when you go in with a straight razor. But I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> My remington trimmer crapped out on me so I decided to try another brand. From the time I purchased the Remington it had charging issues. I purchased this trimmer with high expectations as it stated that it was a girl&#x27;s best trimming friend. It was not. The trimmer itself, even when the guard was off left hair too long. The remington trimmer cut the hair much closer to the skin. So I opted to try the microshaver instead which did absolutely nothing! The style of the trimmer is attractive if you care about that sort of thing. Otherwise a total bust. The only good thing I can say is it has a 45 day money back guarantee. Don&#x27;t wast your $20.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased. I bought this same product a few years ago. The clipper head broke on it (I dropped it one too many times in the shower) so I got a new one. For this price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Good price, somewhat better than the conair that I had. Best feature, you can clean it well in water. Would tell friends, good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and the first time I used it the trimmer worked fine.  But the foil shaver does not help at all.  After trimming I tried the foil shaver and it did not really do anything.  So I would say if you want just a trimmer then this item works pretty good.  But you are still going to have to shave the stubble that is left over.</li>
    <li> I have  what I ask for.</li>
    <li> Sorry, this didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I didn&#x27;t even see stubble on the razor,  So, no go for me.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer.  Very durable.  Long lasting battery for items of this ilk.</li>
    <li> This one was to replace old model of Philips bikini trimmer and they keep the same quality over the years which it&#x27;s not the usual lately ..  glad they did ..</li>
    <li> I had an electric trimmer before that was less than stellar. I don&#x27;t know how good this one is compared to many others, but I know it was way better than the first one I had, and I really like it. I only use it once a week or so, and the charge seems to last for a couple of months. I also like that it has 5 different lengths. The interchangable razor head didn&#x27;t really work for me, but I didn&#x27;t exactly need it to, either, so that wasn&#x27;t a big disappointment for me.</li>
    <li> Kind of, i thought I can actually use it for remove the hair, not only cut it. I&#x27;ll use for my legs.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really cut well. Maybe the problem is in the shape of the raiser. So i would recommend to look for other options.</li>
    <li> first got this from bliss for 65 dollars it lasted for 5 years....  bliss switched to another company and i found this one from phillips  thats who originally made it for bliss same great product  almost half the price</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed, I purchased this less than two years ago and it no longer works. At this price I expected something more durable..</li>
    <li> Works well but it&#x27;s pretty loud.</li>
    <li> Looks great and easy to charge and set up.  However, it doesn&#x27;t work.  The micro shaver does not work at all.  It did not remove one hair.  The precision trimmer/comb barely works.  It does cut a little hair but if you are wanting it to maintain and keep you really closely shaved do not buy this.  Very disappointed and Phillips needs to take it off the shelves.</li>
    <li> Felt like I was being trimmed by the Barber of Seville.  The shave was close but I had cuts everywhere.  Disappointed in this product and the amount of money I paid for it!</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, however it did a fine job. I hope it lasts longer than the more expensive trimmers i have owned in the past (Panasonic and Braun) which lasted 6 months to a year.&lt;br /&gt;**Update** 5 months in and I still like it better than others from my past :-)</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected. I followed the directions to a T and everything worked out fine, it&#x27;s very easy to use. Cleaning is also easy.</li>
    <li> I have seen many reviews saying the micro shaver didn&#x27;t work. I thought that at first too. I learned that you need to use the trimmer head without the comb to get the hair short enough for the micro shaver. I almost only use the micro shaver now.</li>
    <li> The packaging and product itself is nicely made and I love that it comes with a cute little pouch to put everything in.  With that being said, the trimmer and attached comb works quite well and it helped me from getting the usual shaving bumps.  My main concern is with the micro shaver as I have yet to get it to shave anything.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a lemon or I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  Overall, it is a well made product that isn&#x27;t bulky and conforms well to your hand when holding.  I love that&#x27;s waterproof and thus easy to quickly rinse off.</li>
    <li> This razor is horrible!!!  I am very careful when I shave and I get cut by this razor at least five times while shaving.  I thought it would be a lot better than shaving with a normal razor... wrong.  I really recommend not purchasing.  This is a horrible razor that doesn&#x27;t trim well and will cut you!!!</li>
