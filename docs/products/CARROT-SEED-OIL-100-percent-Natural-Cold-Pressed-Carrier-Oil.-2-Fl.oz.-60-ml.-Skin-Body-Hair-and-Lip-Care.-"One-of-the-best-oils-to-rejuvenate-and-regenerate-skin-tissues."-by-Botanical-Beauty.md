      <li>It works very well and I am pleased with the product.</li>

      <li>I got what I asked for but I kind of wish it wasn&#x27;t a pumpand just a regular bottle of oil</li>
      <li>, also the packaging of the oil makes it very easy to make sure you don&#x27;t get out too much or too little.</li>
      <li>Comes with a pump instead of a dropper, so your measurement isn&#x27;t as exact, so it you are using for a recipe, don&#x27;t just pump it in.</li>

      <li>This was not 60 ml of pure carrot seed oil, instead carrot seed oil is in carrier oil.</li>

      <li>I have enjoyed using this product as an ingredient in my daily facial regimen.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the raspberry but both products are high quality oils</li>

      <li>made all natural sunscreen!</li>
      <li>Who knows how much carrot seed oil is actually in it.</li>
      <li>Carrot seed is known to have a natural spf</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it as a natural skin protectant</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who&lt;br /&gt;is looking for a natural alternative to Sunscreens.</li>

<li> THIS IS NOT PURE CARROT SEED OIL, IT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH A CARRIER OIL (Jojaba)!</li>

<li> , I use it daily on my face along with other oils as anti aging.</li>
<li> Dry cracking skin on hands.</li>
<li> Read the description carefully.  </li>

<li> Thankyou for careful packaging and prompt shipping</li>
<li> Read the details carefully.</li>
<li> give the product a 1 star as its not what the description implied and not what I expected, nor does it give information on the mixture ratio.</li>
<li> becuase a little goes a long way</li>
<li> other shortcuts are being taken with this company?</li>
<li> You can mix it with other moisturizers as well.</li>
<li> As you have read in previous reviews this is not 100% carrot seed oil and the bottle</li>
<li> The pump that comes with this product is not good for anything; if any product comes out at all it just shoots out of the tiny hole.</li>
<li> This product was too oily for me as it did not come out as a mist but heavy line if oil.</li>
<li> so that&#x27;s another reason to not be heavy handed.</li>
<li> and then I run my hands through my hair to help tame the frizz.  </li>
<li> Used this with Eucerin, no more problem</li>
<li> I am still not happy with this purchase.....</li>
<li> I have acne prone skin and felt that maybe the coconut oil was making the acne worse...</li>

    <li> There&#x27;s no ways around it, this is good stuff.</li>
    <li> I got what I asked for but I kind of wish it wasn&#x27;t a pumpand just a regular bottle of oil</li>
    <li> Love the oil, just wish it were packaged in a glass bottle rather than plastic. 4 stars!</li>
    <li> I was using coconut oil until I stumbled upon this one.  I have acne prone skin and felt that maybe the coconut oil was making the acne worse...I have definitely seen an improvement to where I rarely have breakouts now and I&#x27;ve been using the product for over 5 months now.  I don&#x27;t find this to be super oily so I&#x27;m able to wear under my make-up!  I use morning and night to moisturize my skin and then I run my hands through my hair to help tame the frizz.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> It smelled nice and worked great in my sun screen.</li>
    <li> Love this carrot seed.  I am actually using it in lotions and every morning mixing s drop in with my normal moisturizer to enhance it.  It smells really nice.  The large bottle is a good value for the price.  Comes with a pump instead of a dropper, so your measurement isn&#x27;t as exact, so it you are using for a recipe, don&#x27;t just pump it in.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! I used it in a homemade sunscreen and it worked great. Used it on a cruise and never got burned, and got the best base tan I&#x27;ve had in years! Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I have used this in a couple of cream recipies and love it.</li>
    <li> I used all the time on the beach.Smell delicious.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a sunblock and it works pretty well!  Bought both the raspberry and carrot.  I prefer the raspberry but both products are high quality oils</li>
    <li> I used this ingredient in a facial oil recipe.  Good product, just waiting for positive results.</li>
    <li> Excellent for your skin.</li>
    <li> As soon as I refrigerated it, it froze.  I use carrot seed oil in my REBORN Skin Renewer, a moisturizer that contains 10 organic, essential oils and&lt;br /&gt;nothing else, and I refrigerate the carrier oil, Rosehip Seed, and also the carrot seed.  Well if it freezes, it just isn&#x27;t organic/natural to me...returned it!</li>
    <li> Very oily product; I was looking for a compromise to the Burt&#x27;s Bees carrot seed oil spray. This product was too oily for me as it did not come out as a mist but heavy line if oil.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this oil - I purchased it to up the SPF in my home made all natural sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Read the description carefully.  Although the title says 100% it is not 100% carrot seed oil.  Who knows how much carrot seed oil is actually in it.</li>
    <li> I have been reading about benefits of this oil for the skin especially the face and I think I agree I am enjoying using this great quality product both by itself and with some essential oil blends. Thankyou for careful packaging and prompt shipping</li>
    <li> Read the details carefully. THIS IS NOT PURE CARROT SEED OIL, IT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH A CARRIER OIL (Jojaba)! Also comes in a plastic container rather than a glass container. The pump that comes with this product is not good for anything; if any product comes out at all it just shoots out of the tiny hole.</li>
    <li> This oil is my quick fix for everything - lip balm, cuticle softener, hair serum, dry skin moisturizer, anti aging cream, hand and foot cream ! U name it and it does it all ...</li>
    <li> work for what I needed</li>
    <li> I love my carrot oil!</li>
    <li> I love using the carrot seed oil on my skin &amp; hair. It does not leave an oily residue. My skin feels smooth and looks youthful.</li>
    <li> It feels great on my face and makes a wonderful sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I would order this product again.  Its a very good oil as used for a carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works as a light sunscreen as well as a moisturizer. It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. Also, it does not break my skin out. You can mix it with other moisturizers as well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.</li>
    <li> Lets your skin really smooth</li>
    <li> this is excellent oil. I used it on my face as a natural sunscreen and it has worked perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone who&lt;br /&gt;is looking for a natural alternative to Sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with the company that sells this - Its not 100% carrot oil as indicated in the description - which is why I purchased it. Its already mixed with Jojoba oil - which is a good oil combination. The label also does not indicate what the percentage mixture is either - by the time I figured this out I had already opened the bottle and used it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the product a 1 star as its not what the description implied and not what I expected, nor does it give information on the mixture ratio. If I had known this I would have spend my $$$ elsewhere and purchased the 100% from a local store or another vendor.</li>
    <li> As you have read in previous reviews this is not 100% carrot seed oil and the bottle does not list the ratio of carrot seed oil to carrier oil. If you are looking for 100% carrot seed oil this is not for you.</li>
    <li> added this to lotion and love the feel of it</li>
    <li> This was a Replacement  bottle.  I use oils daily in mixes or individually.</li>
    <li> This was not 60 ml of pure carrot seed oil, instead carrot seed oil is in carrier oil. Misleading description.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, feels good on face.</li>
    <li> Great to mix with essential oils for DIY Sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this product as an ingredient in my daily facial regimen.  The pump works well and the dark bottle is nice, I just wish it was glass, but for this price, you couldn&#x27;t really ask for more!</li>
    <li> I thought it was pure carrot seed oil but it is watery and diluted!</li>
    <li> This is an alright oil. I&#x27;m using it as a natural skin protectant and i can&#x27;t tell if its&#x27; effective or not. I don&#x27;t mind that this product is mixed with another oil because carrot seed oil is an essential oil which needs to be diluted to avoid skin irritations and the such. Throughout the day, my face is a bit shiny with this oil. I recomend only using one squirt if youre going to be using it on your face becuase a little goes a long way and you don&#x27;t want your face to be slicker than a greased frying pan. The smell of this oil isn&#x27;t so pleasant (it&#x27;s not bad either) so that&#x27;s another reason to not be heavy handed. Another thing i didn&#x27;t like about this brand is that the packaging is so boring.  I have not tried to use this on my hair as I have TOO much hair to try to use it in a hair treatment.</li>
    <li> Great hair treatment &amp; for face&lt;br /&gt;good natural sunscreen</li>
    <li> Bought this to use for homemade sunscreen. It works very well and I am pleased with the product. Good price and shipping.</li>
    <li> Why would i spend $16 on an oil that comes in a PLASTIC BOTTLE?&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t and if you know any better you wouldn&#x27;t either.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic is toxic, especially when it bonds with oils such as hand lotions, mayonnaise, and essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;The skin absorbs it.&lt;br /&gt;NO essential oils do not belong in plastic bottles.&lt;br /&gt;This is a cheap shortcut.&lt;br /&gt;What other shortcuts are being taken with this company?</li>
    <li> Dry cracking skin on hands. Been to Dr, creams, etc etc. None worked. Used this with Eucerin, no more problem</li>
    <li> Light oil, not greasy, I use it daily on my face along with other oils as anti aging.</li>
    <li> Smells good. I&#x27;ve used for 2 days and have noticed more even skin, and super soft!</li>
    <li> Its a nice product  ,i like this product , I HAVE BEEN  USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE LAST MONTH  ..IT STOPS HAIR FALLING DRASTICALLY...EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> PERFECT FOR ANTI-AGING PRODUCTS, INCREASES MY INCOME WHEN I ADD IT TO A MASK, SOAP, AND MANY OTHER SKIN TREATS!!!</li>
    <li> I use carrot oil on my face, just one drop in the morning and at night, mixed with some other oils. I have oily skin and I don&#x27;t find this to be greasy at all, also the packaging of the oil makes it very easy to make sure you don&#x27;t get out too much or too little.</li>
    <li> I am using a combination of oils I body on here to use on my face after I dermaroll it and I have been really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;It fully hydrates my skin and takes the sunburn like feeling you get with derma rolling out instantly.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful. Completely moisturizes and protects my skin. My face is now moisturized perfectly It&#x27;s a great natural product.</li>
    <li> Very nice essential oil...works well with the Raspberry oil but feels a bit thicker on the skin. I will continue using because it really does make your skin feel wonderful and looks radiant!</li>
    <li> I bought this to make a homemade sunscreen and it works very well. Carrot seed is known to have a natural spf and it works very well in my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I use carrot seed oil daily &amp; I give my bottle away frequently, so I order regularly. Great seller, good price. High quality oil!</li>
    <li> Great for leave on hair treatment.</li>
    <li> It was not as expected and not as advertised. The description leads you to believe you&#x27;re purchasing pure carrot seed oil and when it comes you find it&#x27;s actually a blend. I don&#x27;t mind a blend when I know that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m purchasing...will not buy from this company again. I am still not happy with this purchase.....</li>
    <li> Great product, good quality.  Arrived on time.</li>
