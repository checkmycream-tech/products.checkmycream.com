<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good smell, and good for thick skins around nails and elows.</li>
    <li> This stuff really seemed to help my nails.</li>
    <li> Just a touch on  the greasy side, but nice to smooth on my nails especially at night when I won&#x27;t have to think about it because it doesn&#x27;t just stay on your nails.  Not sure if it really strengthens nails, I need more time to see.  Does keep cuticles soft.</li>
    <li> This is a nice tin of thick balm that is laden with lemon oil. You rub it into your cuticles to prevent cracking, flaking and drying.  You actually can rub it all over your hands if they are very chapped. The oil even helps to keep nails from splitting and cracking. It smells like a lemon grove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three-pack is nice because you can put one in your office drawer, one at home at your desk and one in your purse.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used Burt&#x27;s Bees Cuticle Cream in a while because I haven&#x27;t been able to get any. I finally decided to order this and some cuticle remover thru Amazon. Summer is coming and my cuticles were in very sad shape, but now they are gorgeous! In fact they looked so great, I used the cuticle remover and this cream on my feet, and these worked much better than foot files, leaving my feet so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lemongrass smell is stronger at first, but does diminish with time. This product also lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue being a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> I used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, but grew tired of the taste. Instead, for years now, I have used the Lemon Butter Cuticle Creme on my lips. It&#x27;s got a great, light taste which does not compete with other flavors. It also has a nice feel on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry it in my pocket daily, and have several hanging around the house. Since you don&#x27;t use much, this sized tin lasts forever. It will go rancid about 1-2 years, at which point you might still have half left, and it&#x27;s a good time to get a new one.</li>
    <li> This is not enough for what I needed for my REALLY dry cuticles. I passed it onto my daughter. It works great for cuticles that are already in pretty good shape. Love the smell though.</li>
    <li> Things I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Moisturizes my cuticles (that&#x27;s the whole purpose, right?)&lt;br /&gt;2-Lasts forever (had mine for over a year and use it almost everyday)&lt;br /&gt;3-Smells great&lt;br /&gt;4- Doubles as an AWESOME lip balm (the ingredient list is 100% natural, so it&#x27;s safe to use on your lips)&lt;br /&gt;5- cute packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;N/A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that tells you how much I love this cuticle cream.</li>
    <li> I picked this cutucle creme up on an impulse, and now I can&#x27;t do without it. The scent is abslutely amazing -- so very fresh and clean and natural. After massaging it into my cuticles, I rub extra around on my hands. It&#x27;s absolutely healing, without any medicinal smell. I smear a touch onto chapped lips. It&#x27;s wonderful any time of year, but in the winter it works magic on chapped lips that actually hurt when I smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002GP5XD6 Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cr&amp;iquest;me, .6-Ounces  (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.  I really like this product; great for the split skin around my cuticles.  A great price for the 3 pack, especially if you are a PRIME member.  I keep one at my desk, nightstand, &amp; briefcase now.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I found heals those painful cracks around your finger nails. I had tried many products until this one and not had a problem[[ASIN:B002GP5XD6 Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cr?me, .6-Ounces  (Pack of 3)]] since.</li>
    <li> I admit that I love manicures. I have really dry cuticles though and was not very happy with the appearance of my nails until I got this product! It smells fantastic and lasts FOREVER. I rub it around my nails before bedtime and wake up with awesome looking fingers. Could not recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff off and on for a few years, and it really does make a huge difference. It makes my nails much stronger, and my cuticles aren&#x27;t dry or flaky after using it. All you have to do is rub it all over your nail and go to bed, in the morning your nails will be awesome!</li>
    <li> I love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this is one of my favorite! You do need to use it everyday. Night time is when I use it, because it is greasy feeling, but by morning my cuticles are very smooth and soft.  In the winter I use it nightly, but other seasons I either use it a few times a week o not at all.  I use it in combination with the buttermilk (I think it&#x27;s called) body cream. I tell everyone with bad, dry, cracked cuticles about this.</li>
    <li> Good product with quality ingredients but takes some massaging the cuticles. Plus would be nice if this was an oil applied with a brush to keep fingertips from getting slick while applying it to cuticles.</li>
    <li> By clicking on two stars, Amazon says I&#x27;m saying I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t like it. It smelled nice, and I&#x27;m sure it works well for some people. However, I have very dry skin, and the Burt&#x27;s Bees just didn&#x27;t do much for that. When I was using it, I was getting a lot of hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream, which is the best I&#x27;ve used. The reason why I&#x27;d tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Cuticle Cream is because Yu-Be doesn&#x27;t 100% prevent me from getting hangnails, and I thought maybe the Burt&#x27;s Bees would work even better. It didn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m back to Yu-Be, which works exceedingly well.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this cuticle cream to help keep my cuticles looking moisturized. It has done the job! Not only does it do what it&#x27;s supposed to it also smells really good :) I carry a tin in my purse and I find myself putting it on after every time I wash my hands</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff nightly before bed for about 8 years. I have a tendency to bite my hangnails and this is the ONLY stuff that keeps the skin around my nails perfectly smooth so there&#x27;s nothing to tempt me. I love the stuff! My hubby buys some for my stocking every Christmas. If used regularly, this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> My husband cannot live without this cuticle cream that he uses like hand cream after coming in from working in the yard and gardens...I like it as well and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cuticle cream for several years. I like to keep it at my desk and apply regularly to keep my cuticles moisturized. The smell is very fresh and natural.</li>
    <li> Makes fingernails look better</li>
    <li> My cuticles were dry and catching on my clothing. I needed something to get them back to healthy. This cream is amazing and the mild aroma is terrific. I rubbed in on the cuticles, put my hands in gloves for a few hours while sleeping. After just a few nights, my cuticles were terrific.</li>
    <li> This product really saved my hands. I use it on my cuticles and fingers for dry skin. Works wonders.</li>
    <li> Chicago winters are brutal on your skin and cuticles, and I carry this cuticle cream with me everywhere I go; I keep another at home and a third at work.  The price for all three on Amazon is the best I&#x27;ve found.  This is a non-greasy cream that keeps your cuticles moist and soft, which in turns prevents them from cracking and splitting.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite cuticle products.  I am a nail biter so my cuticles are always a mess.  The lemon butter is a pleasure to use.  It smells great, sinks right in and moisturizes nicely without being greasy.  I have tried other oil based products but I like to put in on at night before bed and oils leave my fingers too greasy and then I can&#x27;t read, type on the laptop or use the remote without leaving an oil slick in my wake.  I like this stuff so much I always buy it in multiples.  I have one in my bedside table, one in my boyfriend&#x27;s bedside table, one in my desk at work and one in my purse.  Yes, you do have to use it daily to keep the results but that is true of any cuticle cream so I don&#x27;t view it as a drawback.  Just like all moisturizers, the results are temporary and it must be reapplied daily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this 3 pack after buying myself one from a local drugstore and falling in love. I gave one to my sister, one to my mom and kept one as a back up for myself! My mom has to wash her hands quite a bit at work and my sister works in a factory so both of them suffer from pretty dry cuticles. Mine have always been bad, but I hate using cuticle oils because they make my hands feel gross and like they just need washed again. This cuticle cream not only smells amazing, but it actually works! I&#x27;m hooked and my mom and sister have told me that they love theirs as well. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I like the packaging and the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; approach to cuticle cream but this stuff did not fly with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very greasy and does not absorb into the skin around the nails. Even though I used very little and wiped my fingers with tissue paper... I left little finger grease marks all over everything I touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is terrible. At first I thought it smelled like Lemon Pledge, which wasn&#x27;t great, but tolerable. However, after it started drying, it left more of a lemon with a touch of skunk smell on my fingers. Not good.</li>
    <li> This is a winter must-have! The balm is thick and moisturizing. It keeps nails from cracking and cuticles from getting ragged. The lemon oil makes it smell absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s a little sticky, since it&#x27;s so thick, but I find that this is not a problem if you just dab a little on your nails and work it in. Or, I smooth it on my hands right before bed, which gets rid of chapping.</li>
    <li> Not only is this a great cuticle balm (it&#x27;s intended use :-) ) it&#x27;s a great lip treatment, under eye treatments handcream, foot cream, almost anything you can imagine. My husband has extremely dry skin and his hands, especially in the winter, always crack and bleed. I started putting the stuff on his hands, particularly on all the cracks, and they were healed completely within a matter of days. I call this my &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; remedy use it for everything!! Completely amazing all-around product. I am addicted to it.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with how this cream has improved my cuticles.  They are typically a HOT MESS!  I do not get manicures regularly (more like at all) and am rough with my hands.  I constantly have jagged/ratty looking cuticles.  But after a few weeks of diligent application, I can definitely see a difference.  And the smell is fantastic!</li>
    <li> This cuticle cream works really well. I use it about 30 minutes before I trim my cuticles and it moistens them up well. The only down side is that it&#x27;s greasy and I would prefer a formula that felt cleaner. But overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product that works wonders on your dry, cracked cuticles.  I use it at night, just before I go to sleep and by morning my cuticles look much better.  It even smells good.  This 3 pack is a great value!  I bought this to give out as gifts to some very deserving friends.  They loved it!      The only drawback that this product has is that it is a bit greasy.  Since the main ingredient is almond oil, I&#x27;m not surprised or disappointed by that.  The oil in the product is what makes it work so well (as far as I can tell).  Just don&#x27;t apply the stuff right before you want to use your smartphone....</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you have detergent sensitive hands as I do. The skin around my nails gets very dry and cracked and my nails split and peel, and although this doesn&#x27;t completely cure the problem it does help tremendously. I have tins of this everywhere including my purse so I&#x27;m never without it. I am so happy that it is available on Amazon because its difficult to find where we live other than in gift packs</li>
    <li> It is the BEST products for dry cuticles. I put it overnight and in the morning they are supple again!</li>
    <li> If you have never used this and you get sore, cracked fingers in the winter, or any tear on your fingers.. this is the stuff to use.. any cut or slit... clears up in one day!! the best stuff out there!!! I give it as gifts every Christmas!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews and seeing some that said it wasn&#x27;t greasy and some that said it was, I figured it might hit a happy medium.  And I believe that it does!  I love the scent, and while it is a little greasy when you first rub it in, I think that&#x27;s necessary for it to do the job.  I put some on my thumb and use that to rub it onto the cuticle of the opposite hand, then push the cuticles with the thumbnail.  I love the fact that it also moisturizes my nails, which have a tendency to split in dry weather.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that delievers!</li>
    <li> Great smell. I need to use it more often, it helps me to stop biting at my fingers, and helps to moisturize the cuticles and heal them.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what this is good for/supposed to do for your cuticles.  All I know is that it smells good and leaves my fingernails looking hydrated and healthy.  Love this product!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Best cuticle cream ever. Healed up my cracked cuticles in a couple days. I&#x27;ve tried others for weeks and nothing heals my cuticle like this. This works!</li>
    <li> This is an ok product. It leaves my nails soft but didnt do anything for my hangnails. But worst part is the damn packaging! They&#x27;re packaged in tin containers that are difficult to open and tend to rust over time, inside, outside, along the rim which then will touch the product! A few times the packaging was rusted shut. I ended up having to buy plastic containers to transfer the product, but then the smell changed from a nice lemon scent to something that smells like stale cake. threw it out and been using good &#x27;ole A&amp;D ointment which has been working wonders!</li>
    <li> Smells great, and really does the trick on dry, ragged cuticles. I&#x27;ve used it for a long time, and have gotten the multi-pack to share as gifts.</li>
    <li> I stock up on Bert&#x27;s Bees products every year for Christmas. I haven&#x27;t tried this particular product but I have every confidence in it. I have never been disappointed in this brand. My granddaughters look forward to these little items every year.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference, but maybe it has to be used multiple times per day. The smell and texture is nice, though, I just haven&#x27;t seen results. My cuticles are still very, very dry.</li>
    <li> I think my julique hand cream, crab hand cream  can do a better work than this one. It takes time to absorb but it lasts long. Consider it if you have serious cuticle/nails care need.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for several years at various stores.  Love how it softens and keeps the cuticles healthy.  3 pack is the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Only have to use a drop at a time, and it goes a long way. Results almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous cuticle creams, but I always come back to this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I keep it on hand and give it as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to pick at any loose or stiff parts of cuticle and have tried all manner of lotions and creams to help prevent it. This is the only thing that keeps my cuticles soft and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has kept my fingers from being torn up and uncomfortable by preventing the temptation to pick all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have rough spots or work with your hands, I&#x27;d recommend this. The tin is small and easy to carry and the cream rubs in completely and doesn&#x27;t leave oily or slick residue. It only takes a tiny amount to make a big difference and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Not only does this product soften cuticles, but also aids healing cracked skin.  Also good for soothing crusty winter time noses.  I am impressed!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Received quickly.  Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The cream works OK but the packaging is maddening.  Once you get the lid on securely, it&#x27;s very difficult to get off.  With anything on your hands, it&#x27;s impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also was disappointed in the smell.  A light scent of lemon is one thing but this is overpowering and not all that pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still looking for a dry skin/cuticle treatment that is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t load up with odors.</li>
    <li> I have lots of problems with cuticles,they grow so fast.This product helps to control that.It softens them as well.The lemon also helps to keep the nails whiter</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me a small tin of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream and I really liked it.  So, I decided to order some more from Amazon and not only got nice BIG tins but at a great price too!  I highly recommend the cuticle cream and (of course) Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Changed my mind so fast that I couldn’t even figure out what happened until it happened. That’s to say, I didn’t think I needed cuticle cream, but now that I see the difference, I know that I need cuticle cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years because my cuticles get so dry in the winter time.  It has a nice lemony fragrance.  I carry a tin in my handbag all the time</li>
    <li> This is a great cuticle cream. I love it. I only use a small amount and it works great. At first it doesn&#x27;t seem like it does anything, then later when you look at them again you see they look nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Burt bees cuticle cream has been a staple in my life for many years.  I used to suffer from dry brittle nails and awful cuticles until I began a nightly regimen of this cream.  Now my nails look lovely just playing and can also withstand several applications of heavy nail polish without any damage</li>
    <li> Like everyone&#x27;s recommendation this is the best product Burt&#x27;s Bees sells. Deployed to Iraq and this went with me, used it every day. Should be standard issue. Recommend use in desert environment.</li>
    <li> I bought this for dry, beat-up looking cuticles.  I&#x27;ve been using it at least once a day for a couple weeks, and am very pleased with it so far.  My cuticles and nails look nicer.  The cream smells very good, fresh and clean and not perfumed or artificial.  The tin it comes in is cute, and a nice size, I expect it to last a long time since you can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;ve even used it yet.  Overall very pleased!</li>
    <li> Smells great makes cuticle look great too</li>
    <li> when doing my at-home manicure pedicure. It really does soften up the cuticle, making it easily pushed back if you want or clipped. The lemon fragrance makes it enjoyable to use. Great stuff Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
    <li> Keeps ridges on nails in check and cuticles healthy. The manicurist at my barber&#x27;s joint recommends it. I do too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this cuticle cream.  I have tried them all - and this one is THE BEST.  Worth every penny.  If I miss a day, I notice.  Love the smell, too.</li>
    <li> I have been addicted to this stuff for years. I have one in my bedside table, one in my purse, and one in my desk drawer at all times. Its smells delicious and works great. Bye-bye hangnails!</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I&#x27;ve try this cuticles cream and it has done wonders for me.</li>
    <li> My cuticles are nice and soft thanks to this product. I apply it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have very dry  fingers  and this has helped them in 2 days so I would buy it again it is a very good product</li>
    <li> It smells amazing!! I use it often, and my nails and the skin around it look pretty darn good (not dry and/or peeling here and there). I will definitely purchase again when I run out :)</li>
    <li> smells great.  feels good.</li>
    <li> Works great and one tin will last a long long time. I bought the 3 tin pack and gave a tin to my wife .. she uses it frequently and I mostly forget.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, if you *remember* to use it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Has done a really good job at keeping my cuticles moisturized and hang-nail free!  Also seems to extend the length of my manicures.</li>
    <li> I have had a horrible hang nail problem for awhile. My hands dry out super easily after washing after the bathroom. I use this and BOOM! They&#x27;re soft again, no more hang nails. I have gotten into a habit of using this on a constant basis. It makes your fingers super soft and actually improves the hardness and look of your nails themselves. I highly recommend this product. My manicurist has complimented me on the quality of my nails and cuticles as well... very interesting compliment to get, but I guess that just gives me more proof it works!</li>
    <li> Great smell.  Love the feel of the cream on my fingers.  Just as seller described.  Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Cuticle Cream is a wonderful, slow-absorbing cuticle cream with a light lemon scent.  Unlike cuticle oils, it doesn&#x27;t drip down your fingers and doesn&#x27;t appear as shiny.  It stays in place through getting your hands lightly wet a couple of times, making this an ideal cuticle cream for daily wear.  I put it on in the morning before I grab my coffee and after I finish lunch so now I no longer need to worry about one hand washing drying out my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who&#x27;s a school teacher, when I began using a lot of hand sanitizer when a family member was in the hospital.  It seems to work, keeping cuticles soft, although I didn&#x27;t notice it helping to cure hangnails.  Rosebud Salve, which I use for my severe chapped lips, works very well to cure hangnails, and seems to keep the cuticles soft, too.  So, while this is a nice product, I think I&#x27;ll stick with Rosebud Salve, and not have two cute little tins hanging around.</li>
    <li> It is getting difficult to. Find this particular Burt&#x27;s Bees product in stores, but this 3-pack will last a while and was reasonably priced. I keep one in my purse and two at home.</li>
    <li> I got it in the starter kit, and I thought, &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34; and I tried it. As with most of Burt&#x27;s Bees products I notice the scent first. Some people don&#x27;t like it and have described at smelling like a lemon-y cleaning product, but I actually like it. It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the hour of the first time I applied it I noticed a difference in my cuticles (which are always dry and getting hangnails) and now that I use it regularly my nails have grown and aren&#x27;t as flaky and are noticeably stronger. My fingertips are also very soft. It has been described as greasy, and it kind of is, but after a little while it goes away. I usually put it on before bed anyway, and then it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it with or without nail polish, although you will get better results if you use it without nail polish. It will coat your nails and cuticles and fingertips. I sometimes use it as a hand cream but in the starter kit I got a lot of hand creams so I usually use one of those instead. A little bit goes a LONG way, so don&#x27;t pile it on or it will get really nasty greasified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tiny tin from the starter kit lasted several months, and now I buy it alone and it always takes forever to use up a whole tin.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream 13 years ago and I will buy nothing else. It is so easily to apply and not greasy like my old stuff and it really works!</li>
    <li> My hands and cuticles are dry and sensitive especially in Wisconsin winters.  I use a prescription hand cream but my cuticles had been neglected and this spring/summer I tried so many products to get them healed as I had many hangnails.  I tried fancy cuticle oils and salves and they were slowly working but not that well.  I added argan oil to my hand cream and wore cotton gloves at night.  I even had a $52 pair of a big-name spa brand gloves and didn&#x27;t have much luck.  I noticed that many websites that sold Burt&#x27;s Bees cuticle cream had rave reviews.  Yes, I waited until September to try what was right before my eyes in stores everywhere.  I ordered my first tin here and within five days ordered three more.  It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how superior Burt&#x27;s bees is</li>
    <li> This is the BEST stuff ever. I had not had a professional manicure in quite some time. Needless to say my hands were straight tore up after I had one because apparently you have to tear something down to build it up. I tried to pamper them with no luck. Bought this stuff and within two days, they looked great. I have been using this in the morning and at night for about a month. My hands have never looked better. The clincher: this stuff is not greasy and it smells good so you can use it anytime and not have to worry about it getting all over the place. I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> Dry nails and cuticles drive me crazy and this product does a nice job of mitigating that without being messy or overly feminine. It comes in a nice tin that travels well and the paste is easy to apply without getting it all over the place. Very nice lemon scent as well.</li>
    <li> Best chapstick ever! Works well on cuticles too, so it&#x27;s good to buy in multiples to use for different purposes. It smells divine.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff but a little goes a long way so this pack will last a long time</li>
    <li> Fast delivery on great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this cuticle cream! It softens and smooths them so they&#x27;re not dry and white. It smells lemony fresh. It absorbs in minutes. Very good product!</li>
    <li> The skin around my nails always gets dried, cracked and cut, especially during the dry winter months.  I had been using Neosporin type ointments to help heal the cuts.  That&#x27;s until I found this stuff.  I put it on at night and it helps heal the damages caused during the day.  It&#x27;s a little greasy, but this is the only stuff that not only heals but also moisturizes.  Lotion just stings on nicks but this stuff doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s pricey for such a little container but very worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth noting - I am reviewing the product, not the seller.  I bought the pack of 3, thinking I was getting qty 3, 0.6 oz containers (as described).  I received 3 containers of 0.3 oz cream -- half as much as advertised.  I contacted the seller (Bargains by Dan) and he refunded half my money, so that was a fair resolution.  I appreciate them making things right and returning my e-mail so quickly.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help at all. Cuticles are still dry even after applying several time a day. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
    <li> I used to have terrible cuticles, but after using this all dryness and uglyness has gone. Small amount of this works for all nails, so one pack will last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the three-pack, and I will gift one to my sister. It smells a light scent of lemon....... Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best ever.</li>
    <li> Works good, use it on dry, cracked cuticles often</li>
    <li> This + Nutra Nail helps nail growth.</li>
    <li> This the best cuticle cream ever. And this is a great price. My nails never looked better. The lemon scent is very strong. Wish they made it in strawberry.</li>
    <li> I love this products. It really helps keep your cuticle moisturize and smells so nice. I hete artificial smell but this smells like real lemon. I also use this as a lip balm when my lips are really dry. It keeps my lips so soft for long time.</li>
    <li> I like it because it&#x27;s handy to put in your handbag.  It does smell lovely, but frankly, my cuticles are still as dry and crackly as before.  Even using night gloves and slathering the stuff on when I think of it, doesn&#x27;t seem to have make too much of a difference.  Back to basics with vaseline - no better, no worse.</li>
    <li> I have frayed cuticles on my thumbs and index finger. This 90% cured my dry cuticles, in half a day. Getting a manicure to remove excess cuticle and then managing the tips of your fingers with this will keep your hands pristine. Drawback is you have to apply this daily, and even more so if you wash your hands often.</li>
    <li> My nails are always dry.  I&#x27;ve tried various hand creams and brush on treatments (Trind, Avon, Opi) and none of them really worked even with multiple applications per day.  This worked immediately.  I put it on daily and my nails are nice and smooth.  It also has a nice sheen so I can get away without polish...which I only wore because my nails looked so dry. Nice to finally find something that works.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot because of my daughter and her diaper changes. But the constant hand washing has left my hands dry and my cuticles really dry and they even crack. This cuticle cream really helps. It&#x27;s more a balm than cream but it still really helps. It gives my cuticles lots of moisture and I put it on before I go to bed and my fingers looks so much better the next day.</li>
    <li> As a teacher, I wash my hands or use hand sanitizer a lot!  All of that washing wreaks havoc on my cuticles.  They actually get so dry and peeling that they bleed.  While looking for some hand lotion, I spotted some cuticle cream (I don&#x27;t know why I never thought to get any before).  I test tried a few of the brands, but they all seemed too oily, the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream was thicker and seemed like it wouldn&#x27;t make a mess.  I used it for the for the time last night.  It has a lovely fresh scent and went on easily.  This morning, I awoke to cuticles that already looked remarkably better!  I couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference it made.  They weren&#x27;t as dry, seemed softer, and looked so much better.  I expect that a couple more days and they will be 100% better! I&#x27;m going to get more of this, keep one by my bed for night time and one in my purse.  A new favorite!</li>
    <li> Use to buy this at a drug store, but it is less expensive here. I use it each night or any time after a shoower to keep my cuticles from drying out.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this smells, although probably it may be a little intoxicating compared to other cuticle cremes. I would say the texture is more like a wax and I noticed an immediate difference after using it. For my tastes though it could be a little more oily, hence the four rather than five stars. I really recommend this for the reason that it is compact, won&#x27;t make a mess so it&#x27;s good for traveling, and I guess because it is light on the oilyness it&#x27;s convenient because there is no need to wipe off excess oil. Great overall!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this product. Conditions the cuticles without being messy. Improves the look of your fingernails.</li>
    <li> I have horrible, dry cuticles.  If I don&#x27;t use this Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cream my cuticles are noticeably worse.  This is the best cuticle cream I have found and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  It&#x27;s not greasy and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I coat all my fingertips with this product after removing nail polish. I do nail art, so I usually have a bunch of coats of polish on which means I have to take it off with 100% acetone, which is insanely drying on nails and cuticles. I love this product because it&#x27;s all natural and because it does have a really intense moisturizing effect because of all the natural oils. Beware though, it has a bunch of vegetable oil, meaning you can&#x27;t put it on and then work with paper or on your computer unless you want it to be oily too! Put it on, wait a few minutes, wash it off and then put on the base coat, or a regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I used to use the Lemony Flutter Nail Cuticle Butter from Lush Cosmetics, which I do think is better (and also completely natural), but is also significantly more expensive. This is a much more economic version!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve had an obsessive habit of picking and biting my cuticles. Now, this stuff is not a cure. However, by keeping some near at hand I can divert my energy into smoothing it into my cuticles rather than tearing them to shreds. It&#x27;s got a pleasant lemony smell that&#x27;s not too girlie, and helps the cuticles heal up well. It tastes just off-putting enough to remind you that you really should take those damn fingers out of your mouth--although it won&#x27;t deter anyone who&#x27;s &amp;#34;got it bad&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a cuticle cream from the Body Shop, but it was a lot greasier and more expensive. When that ran out, I decided to look for a replacement, and this stuff is definitely *it*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if there was just some remedy for cheek-chewing...</li>
    <li> I hate raggedy cuticles and this stuff is great. I think I bought my tin about 5 years ago and I use it often. You just need a tiny smidge. I love everything Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> use this everyday all year - the winter finger cracks... a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Been using it for years! It really improves the appearance of my cuticles! I have dry skin, especially my hands from washing them a lot, and my cuticles suffer as well. Does have a strong lemon smell, but I like that about it too!</li>
    <li> Best cuticle cream I have ever used! lasts a very long time and Love the scent too. My local grocery stopped carrying it, so I stocked up here. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is truly great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was always someone who more or less neglected my nails. My cuticles would constantly be in a state of dryness and eventually sadly bleeding from picking and neglect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying more chemically based products from local retail outlets I found this and have never turned back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can go on thick or light and provides all day moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically will apply at night and in the morning and maybe once throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After application the product feels gone from the cuticle after about a half hour but your hands stay soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands look  much nicer now and since my hands feel comfortable I no longer pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the pack of three and my girlfriend loves it as well.</li>
    <li> Dry hands and dry fingers mean I always use this at every opportunity.  This product smells lovely and keeps my cuticles smoother.  I try to have one in every knitting bag, beside my bed, on my desk and in my purse.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best product in the market for hangnails and dry cracking cuticles.  I have one with me all the time and rub a little on every time I think of it.  Makes your cuticles look so nice!</li>
    <li> Great consistency but lemon scent is pretty strong - not unpleasant but noticeable.  Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I buy three at a time. I use these all year round. I use them on my cuticles, knuckles, and all over my hands in the morning. It acts like a barrier to keep my hands nice and soft. I also use it on my husbands cuticles/knuckles/hands. He works in a warehouse so his hands dry and crack very easily. He is also &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; sensitive but likes the light lemony scent. It acts like a much needed repairing serum for his poor, dry, cracked knuckles. Absolutely, one of the best products that Burt&#x27;s Bees makes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it is very effective.  I have tried other lotions for my cuticles but none work as well as this.</li>
    <li> Its okay, it is sticky and hard to just put it on in the middle of the day, I would rather do a stick. But, it did not help with my chapped lips anyways.</li>
    <li> I use this cuticle cream every night to keep my cuticles and the skin around my nails from drying out.</li>
    <li> Great tool for the cuticle. I&#x27;m pleased with the pleasant smell and good result! This cream love all my friends. I will take the constantly.</li>
    <li> I paint my nails all the time and I use this to keep my cuticles happy after I&#x27;ve used nail polish remover, and when I lotion my hands I apply this and then the lotion. It is great. Prevents cracking and split cuticles that peel up to your eyelids :)</li>
    <li> I really do love this product. Nothing works better to smooth out cuticles and I do pick at mine, so this is a vital necessity for me and helps me to have soft flawless fingers!</li>
    <li> My nails and cuticles need a lot of TLC. This smells wonderful and works great. I now have strong nails and nice cuticles.  (I also take biotin daily, to be honest.)</li>
    <li> Works good on my cuticles.  I would say it works as good as straight vasoline but feels a little less messy.  I like the nice lemon smell but that turns weird sometimes when putting lotion on after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using a couple of different Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  I love the foot cream, so when I saw they also make a cuticle cream, I wanted to try that out, as well.  I have cuticles that are kind of dry and they creep up my nails.  I like to use a cuticle pusher to push them back down, but they&#x27;re normally too dry for that.  Enter this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not thrilled with the little tin that this stuff comes in; I think a stick (like a lip balm) would be less messy.  You have to put this on a finger and *then* rub it over your cuticles and nails.  Afterwards, it stays greasy for a little while (so don&#x27;t get on the computer or smartphone right away).  It has a pleasant citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once it absorbs in, it&#x27;s wonderfully effective.  My cuticles are in much better shape and are much softer than they were before -- so much easier to push back.  My nails look pretty good, too.  (However, don&#x27;t use this right before painting your nails, or the nails will be too oily for a good manicure.  Use it the night before, instead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that the ingredients are natural and that Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t do any animal testing.  If you have problem cuticles, this is worth a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders, my nails were so dry they would bleed now my nail&#x27;s are always soft&lt;br /&gt;would highly recommend:)</li>
    <li> For about one year my thumbnail was ragged, bumpy, ruff, and the cuticle and skin around it was dry and frayed. I looked through hundreds of pages of my mom&#x27;s college textbooks about nail diseases, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything like it. My local dermatologists couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was. I bought this product in hopes of making the skin around the nail a little less miserable, but to my joyous surprise it completely fixed the problem. I can&#x27;t praise it enough.</li>
    <li> I live in a cold, fry region and this cuticle cream saves my cuticles during the winter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and wash my hands a million times a day. This cuticle cream leaves my cuticles looking manicure-fresh.</li>
    <li> This stuff saves my cuticles daily, I use it twice a day to keep them moisturized and healed, plus I love the way it feels!</li>
    <li> A great deal - these little tins are usually  $6 for one but these were much less, even with the very expensive shipping and handling costs!</li>
    <li> My cuticles are so soft. I don&#x27;t get hangnails any more and I love the lemony sent. The little pods are so portable.</li>
    <li> My cuticles get really dry, peel and tear a lot especially in the winter - this really helps when that happens and keeps them moist to prevent it from continuing to happen. It&#x27;s greasy, yes, but soaks in after about 5 minutes. It smells really nice, strong and lemony tart, not a sugary lemon smell nor a chemical lemon smell. I like the small tins because they&#x27;re travel friendly and easy to put in pockets or purses. The lemon also helps whiten yellow nails!</li>
    <li> I live in Colorado and was always getting dried and cracked cuticles. This product works satisfactorily but I think cuticle oil works even better. But the oil is messy and this cuticle cream is much easier to use.</li>
    <li> It hydrates the cuticle well and smells really nice, a little expensive i think though.</li>
    <li> It does help with cuticles before they get really bad, I prefer it on my toes. It works best as a preventive measure rather than using on a broken cuticle. On my fingers I tend to touch my face and I think something in it causes me to break out(wax?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very nice, clean, and lemony. The .60oz pot should last a long long time too.</li>
    <li> it softens cuticle and improves nail growth i like it will buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> a staple of mine- love the smell and no hangnails.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the product works</li>
    <li> My cuticle on one thumb had been over zealously manicured became detached completely from the nail bed. I could actually see under the cuticle all the way across and everything was getting lodged in there. My thumb was getting sore and red. I tried everything but nothing seemed to help. I used this cream everyday,massaging it in and my cuticle became normal again. I don&#x27;t know if anyone has ever had this problem but it was getting pretty bad until I used this! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day and have for a couple of years.  My cuticles are always in great condition, and it is so easy to apply.  I can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other cuticle creams but this takes the ribbon! It has a thick consistency but it rubs in like \\&quot;butter\\&quot; once the heat from your finger massages it into your cuticle. It really helps to moisturize the cuticle which is essential in cold weather! Since it&#x27;s made with lots of natural ingredients, it also helps the nails to grow since it can get absorbed. Plus, having a pack of 3 is great and a little bit goes such a long way that I&#x27;ve barely put a dent into my first one &amp; I use it at least twice a day! This is a great investment especially because you get a deal that&#x27;s cheaper than buying three at a store.</li>
    <li> feels nice and although it is a bit oily it is not slippery.  works really well and the packaging makes it easy to throw into a purse</li>
    <li> Works well, it will last awhile considering I only use it a few times a week. And it smells great :)</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t really for cuticle repair, it&#x27;s more for maintaining healthy cuticles.  If your cuticles aren&#x27;t already in good shape, I&#x27;d recommend going with a different product.  I do love the lemon scent though!</li>
    <li> This is better than all the other cuticle creams I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. Still not as good as Revlon&#x27;s cuticle cream, which was discontinued a few years ago.  I don&#x27;t get manicures but I do wear rubber gloves when I put my hands in dish water, I use Cerave SA hand cream, and I only put these treatments on my hands at bedtime. I learned this from a friends mom who was a hand model.</li>
    <li> I get a manicure every other Saturday. Before I started using this product, my cuticles would look terrible by the end of the first week - my manicurist would have to spend several minutes per hand fixing them up. Well, I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now, and my cuticles look better than ever! Plus, at my last manicure, my girl literally spent less than 30 seconds per hand cleaning up the cuticles. It was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;ve given four stars instead of five is because you&#x27;ve got to apply it several times a day in order for it to work. Once a day certainly won&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> Not actually three .6 oz lemon butters. Actually 6 .3 oz cuticle butters. Still the same amount if product. Just expecting the larger containers which is why I only have it four stars.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Products, have been using this for years and recommend it highly.  Does the job as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product is great for cuticles of those who work outside a lot. Helps keeps nails looking healthy. These now come in a container much easier to open, and it seems that the creme is more creamy and less waxy now. Love it.</li>
    <li> I never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I have been buying burt&#x27;s bees lemon cuticle creme for years and it has been excellent. This order was very grainy in texture . I am very very disapointed</li>
    <li> I am usually not a fan of lemon sented items, however this product was highly recommended so I tried it. Pleasantly surprised by the fresh scent not over powering at all. It does a wonderful job of moisturizing my nails &amp; cuticles. Its a must have item!</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product but by comparison to the product I used for years it was not quite up to snuff.  I also ordered another cuticle cream along with this one and prefer it to this one.  This product line is excellent so I will keep this one in my handbag as it is slimmer and easy to carry. But at night, I will use the Qtica.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my Burt&#x27;s bees cuticle cream. I used to work at a summer camp and my hands would get incredibly dry, especially around my nails. I started putting this cream on every morning and could definitely see a difference. It also helps with hang nail pain as well. The product smelled nice, but feels a little greasy so you will want to make sure to wipe the palm side of your fingers down before touching anything else. The only downside to this product was the container it was in. It comes in a little metal container but the lid is very difficult to get off. Sometimes I couldn&#x27;t even get it open and would have to give up. I eventually scraped out the cream and put it in my own plastic container to use. Loved the product though!</li>
    <li> this stuff literally saves my cuticles during cold weather...i swear by it and have gotten so many people hooked.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in there, but it&#x27;s magic!!!!!</li>
