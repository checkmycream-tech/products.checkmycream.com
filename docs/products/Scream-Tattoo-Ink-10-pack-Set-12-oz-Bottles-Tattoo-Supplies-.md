      <li>thank you very much.</li>
      <li>is still as it was when you had it done the first day.</li>

      <li>More current inks would be appreciated.</li>
      <li>Plus they were mostly from 2011, so they don&#x27;t have much life left in them.</li>
      <li>They take very well on the first pass and after the tattoo heals the color</li>
      <li>The colors tend to lose a lot of pop after the healing process, but nonetheless, can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>and kabuki is a good black for about the same price as this stuff on this page</li>
      <li>For the money, the ink is decent.</li>
      <li>the shipper said there was nothing they could do they sent me a free samply black ink</li>
      <li>ink seems chalky and doesn&#x27;t take to skin very well without numerous passes!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price was decent, compared to local tattoo supply shops.</li>
      <li>It came in on time just like it said , everything was brand new still in the box and looked just as I expected!</li>

    <li> For the money, the ink is decent. Black is solid. The colors tend to lose a lot of pop after the healing process, but nonetheless, can&#x27;t really complain. Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> Recently used this ink on a pretty good sized tat, takes well and plenty of pigment. You might be dissapointed if you use Intentz ink or similar products....this ink will not have that look, but overall I like it....</li>
    <li> The price was fair, the shipping was fine, and none of the ink was leaked, but after using the ink I am not a very happy customer! I will not be purchasing this product again, nor would I recommend this to anyone. My best advice is to try Intenze or Moms inks, which is exactly what I will be doing.</li>
    <li> Its a bit thin but overall i really like this ink. It sets boldly. It retains the original look well.</li>
    <li> The colors of the ink turns out awesome.. They take very well on the first pass and after the tattoo heals the color is still as it was when you had it done the first day. Great color guys. My hats off to you.</li>

    <li> I used these inks on practice skin and they looked good but when put to skin they wouldn&#x27;t take at all and I called and left a email and the shipper said there was nothing they could do they sent me a free samply black ink but it never took to skin either I will not buy it again I&#x27;ll will buy starbrite or moms ink from now on I would rather have my my money back from them I wasted $31 dollars</li>
    <li> Nice product...fast delivery</li>
    <li> ink seems chalky and doesn&#x27;t take to skin very well without numerous passes!&lt;br /&gt;beware of the red as it has been recalled if I&#x27;m not mistaking, causes skin boils and severe damage to the skin.</li>
    <li> Great colors very briabant and a must have thank u</li>
