      <li>This product its Excellent!</li>
      <li>I just love to share the joy!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Granted, it doesn&#x27;t smell the very best (hence losing a star), but it&#x27;s the one product that keeps the wax room at school clean.</li>
      <li>I am a very satisfied customer and this is why I love shopping on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I would like to try something better.</li>

      <li>This product is just ok</li>
      <li>Works great cleaned off stubborn wax fast and easy.</li>
      <li>Great for getting rid of all those inevitable drips of wax...</li>
      <li>, I could not wait anymore to clean it.  </li>
      <li>You probably need a gallon of this to clean your wax warmer properly and lots of effort scrubbing the surfaces, and of course, a good piece of fabric.</li>
      <li>Regular cleaner and a razor blade work just as good</li>
      <li>use gloves, apply to cotton, wipe and smile ;)</li>
      <li>Really cleans the wax off anything!</li>
      <li>This cleaned it up very well.</li>
      <li>I do not like this product too much.</li>
      <li>Three stars for the smell - the product has a very pungeant smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I heard back from Amazon and they refunded me the full amount.  </li>
      <li>Gasoline works a little better.</li>
      <li>Took the hardened wax off toilet seat, floor, and counters--hey, it was my first time using an at home waxer!</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve walked into some pretty big messes.</li>
      <li>It has brought my humble hard working gigi wax pot back to its original good looks.</li>
      <li>but I still spend a considerable amount of time cleaning up</li>
      <li>I used it once to clean my waxwarmer pot, was a bit messy and lables were removed (the ssurface of the pot is plastic)</li>
      <li>No longer a hot mess.</li>

<li> Be that was wrong; yet the pot is clean.</li>

<li> I received this product and got a half empty bottle.</li>
<li> Takes a while for it to break down the wax I need it to clean.&lt;br</li>
<li> The reviewer who said baby oil works better is wrong because baby oil is useless for nonwater soluble wax.  </li>
<li> We would put gloves on, dab a little on the cotton round, and rubbed a little bit</li>

<li> The fumes are horrible, but I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you are trying to clean wax!  </li>
<li> I have not used this product for a long period of time, so it will be unfair to give any negative review about it.</li>
<li> Gets wax off counters, stinks so ventilate area.</li>
<li> The smell is horrible but who cares?</li>

    <li> This product is just ok</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t really work as great as hoped.  It sorta works but I still spend a considerable amount of time cleaning up surfaces wax got on.  Regular cleaner and a razor blade work just as good</li>
    <li> My instructor had a bottle at the beauty school in the wax room. We&#x27;ve walked into some pretty big messes. This cleaned it up very well. You don&#x27;t need a lot to get the wax off anything it was stuck on. We would put gloves on, dab a little on the cotton round, and rubbed a little bit and it came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it doesn&#x27;t smell the very best (hence losing a star), but it&#x27;s the one product that keeps the wax room at school clean. Though be warned, it does remove paint off walls too if you keep rubbing in. (Yep, wax was there too.)</li>
    <li> This thing does not work. You probably need a gallon of this to clean your wax warmer properly and lots of effort scrubbing the surfaces, and of course, a good piece of fabric.</li>
    <li> Gasoline works a little better. And cheaper.</li>
    <li> Works great cleaned off stubborn wax fast and easy.</li>
    <li> This product its Excellent! It has brought my humble hard working gigi wax pot back to its original good looks. No longer a hot mess. I cleaned half and sent the \\&quot;before and after effects\\&quot; to my cousin, since she recently started waxing; and she bought it from amazon immediatly! I just love to share the joy! Don&#x27;t hesitate. Tiny tip: use gloves, apply to cotton, wipe and smile ;)</li>
    <li> Gets wax off counters, stinks so ventilate area.</li>
    <li> Great for getting rid of all those inevitable drips of wax...</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Really cleans the wax off anything! The smell is horrible but who cares? Very happy with this and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff takes the wax off anything.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I have tried to travel with my warmer and wax got all over it, a lil bit of this and some elbow grease did the job</li>
    <li> I do not like this product too much. I would like to try something better. Takes a while for it to break down the wax I need it to clean.&lt;br /&gt;And I have to apply it several times.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product for a long period of time, so it will be unfair to give any negative review about it. I used it once to clean my waxwarmer pot, was a bit messy and lables were removed (the ssurface of the pot is plastic) I used small paper towel, may. Be that was wrong; yet the pot is clean. So four stars.</li>
    <li> The product definitely works.  The reviewer who said baby oil works better is wrong because baby oil is useless for nonwater soluble wax.  Three stars for the smell - the product has a very pungeant smell. Recommend using it outdoors.</li>
    <li> Took the hardened wax off toilet seat, floor, and counters--hey, it was my first time using an at home waxer!</li>
    <li> I received this product and got a half empty bottle. I had to use it immediately for I spilled some of the wax on my counter and I waited so long for the product to arrive, I could not wait anymore to clean it.  The fumes are horrible, but I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you are trying to clean wax!  I did not want to return the product because like I said, I needed to use it immediately, but I did leave the seller feedback and filed a claim on Amazon.  Still waiting for a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I heard back from Amazon and they refunded me the full amount.  I even got to keep the product.  I am a very satisfied customer and this is why I love shopping on Amazon.</li>
    <li> wax came off my wood floor instantly! lifesaver.</li>
