      <li>Looks and works great like a pro.</li>
      <li>After a while I got so good that I could almost shave with my knife....</li>

      <li>He really liked it though.</li>
      <li>Like I said, I am new and have nothing to compare this razor to, but I am very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He is able to shave very well with the product, but says it may be best to have the razor sent away or taken somewhere to have it professionally honed for the best result.</li>
      <li>He is enjoying learning how to sharpen his own razor, too.</li>
      <li>He showed me good razors from reputable companies (like Dovo)and I felt like there was a significant difference in the quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You are better off getting an antique made with better steel.</li>
      <li>I did expect better quality for the&lt;br /&gt;price.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy shaving with it for years.</li>
      <li>Spent hours looking at how to perfect the honing rock technique.</li>
      <li>The owner took 1 look at it and said he would be happy to take my money and hone it, but it would be a waste of time because it would never shave well or hold a good edge.  </li>

      <li>.. sturdy wood handle, this blade fits comfortably in my hand for a shave.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean sharpen and use amazong product for the price tag.</li>
      <li>this results in the razor itself feeling extremely light.</li>
      <li>Nice wood handle and came Shave ready.</li>
      <li>finds it very useful  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants an excellent straight razor without the high dollar price tag of a Dovo.</li>
      <li>this thing is worth the buy!</li>
      <li>good thing I can say about the razor is that it looks pretty decent from 5</li>
      <li>This is his first straight razor, so he does not have anything to compare it to, but he is very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I was able to get it ready in about three minutes using the my x1000</li>
      <li>, this was not a problem for him as I also purchased a whetstone (for honing) and leather strop, and he was able to get the razor shave ready.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to pay even this much for a razor, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>best value of any straight razor on amazon-hands down..</li>
      <li>Also, I have found my experience as a new user with this razor to be more enjoyable than when I have gotten straight razor shaves from a barber.</li>
      <li>country of origin stamped anywhere on the packaging or product is highly suspicious and again lends more weight to Pakistani manufacture.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The blade it self seems good but definitely needs sharpening right out of the box.</li>
      <li>of the positive reviews sound</li>
      <li>I first saw it listed at $54.99, then it went up to $74.99, then again to $94.99!</li>
      <li>Seems nice enough, the wood isn&#x27;t as finished as it seems in the picture.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the $15 or</li>
      <li>The razor should work well, but unfortunately no amount of stroping has made it shave worthy yet.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s right - threw out my Dovo</li>
      <li>, I also got the book \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; also on Amazon and found it a quick and easy read, but really helpful for starting me off on the right foot.</li>
      <li>I am just starting out using this method and I am pleased to no longer have to buy disposable razors or cartridges.</li>
      <li>It does need a lot of stropping when you first receive it.  </li>
      <li>The metal is too cheap and soft.  </li>
      <li>it was exactly what he was looking for</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t want to drop $$$ on a first time razor.</li>
      <li>The price listing also fluctuated so much during the holiday season that I almost backed out!</li>
      <li>From my perspective, it seems like a very nice razor that should last a long time.</li>
      <li>The seller was absolutely telling the truth and I kind of expected as much.</li>
      <li>My first Straight Razor.</li>
      <li>This was helpful since it&#x27;s the first straight razor we&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>The wooden handle is beautiful and well crafted, and slightly on the large side, but my husband has not had any complaints about its size.</li>
      <li>You just really need to make sure you sharpen it before you use it, it is quite a bit more dull than one would expect for a straight razor.</li>
      <li>So, if I will be tossing razors on a regular basis, I thought I might as well go for cheap.  </li>
      <li>It still isn&#x27;t close to shave ready.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with a straight razor for almost a year now.</li>
      <li>Well the product says shave ready but the seller said honing may be required.</li>
      <li>I received this item I couldn&#x27;t get it shave ready by stropping, so I took it to a well-known place in Los Angeles called Ross Cutlery to get it honed.  </li>
      <li>I have much to learn in shaving technique as well as in honing and stropping.</li>
      <li>it may not come shave ready</li>
      <li>I stropped it for about 30 seconds and it was ready to go.</li>
      <li>The product not only came quickly but it came exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>the handle is sturdy wooden and gorgeous, the blade comes SHARP and well oiled even!</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying I am new to straight razor shaving.</li>
      <li>I am new to the world of straight razors, but I put my trust in the advice of a well-known store over the internet.  </li>
      <li>He is new to straight razor shaving</li>
      <li>I tried a quick stropping with chrome oxide and then a standard leather strop to see if that would do the job.</li>
      <li>I lathered up to shave like I normally do, except this time I went to use this new straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have absolutely no clue at to who manufactured this item or where, but, for the price, they did a fine job.  </li>
      <li>Although the razor does not come shave ready (which is CLEARLY stated in the product description)</li>
      <li>Steel is not hard, so it won&#x27;t hold an edge.</li>
      <li>it dosent open flimsy, the tang is comfortable the size is correct and its actually as advertised with a barber pouch to keep it in unlike...</li>
      <li>This unnamed razor needed a little touchup on my chromium oxide paste strop, then a good regular dry stropping, and it was ready for use.  </li>
      <li>It took alot to get the Kriegar sharp enough to shave, but I didn&#x27;t know any better</li>
      <li>I have yet to use it for a full shave due to lack of time, but I CANNOT wait until I do...</li>
      <li>Definitely didnt come shave ready, but once I got it honed the shave</li>
      <li>after this is achieved the razor is ready for daily use.</li>
      <li>balance &amp; weight play a HUGE portion of comfort and control when handling a straight razor over the smooth, vulnerable neck and under chin areas -- this one meets or exceeds those expectations !</li>
      <li>It came back down to $74.99 but, in my opinion, NOT worth more than $30!</li>
      <li>I have not used any other straight razor, such as the much heralded Dovo, so I can offer no comparison.</li>
      <li>and it was ready to dry shave with..</li>
      <li>It should be noted that my husband has extremely thick and coarse facial hair and he is able to shave with a basic home sharpening (with whetstone and leather strop).</li>
      <li>This seller has been patient and friendly with me, even after I complained about the product.</li>
      <li>other straight razors</li>
      <li>Decent blade but certainly not ready for shaving out of the box.  </li>
      <li>could not get one single whisker off with this brand new blade.</li>
      <li>The handle is a little on the long and awkward side, but other than that, I&#x27;m quite impressed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So disappointed it&#x27;s not even funny. I spent an additional $100.00 getting the straps, honing stones, etc... Spent hours looking at how to perfect the honing rock technique. After a while I got so good that I could almost shave with my knife....This razor is garbage. I use it as my letter opener now</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no clue at to who manufactured this item or where, but, for the price, they did a fine job.  I threw out - that&#x27;s right - threw out my Dovo 5/8 half-hollow after the second time I received a warranty replacement.  It chipped while I was shaving.  Yes.  I have a very tough beard, Neanderthal-style, and I shave twice a day so that I don&#x27;t scare the cats.  So, if I will be tossing razors on a regular basis, I thought I might as well go for cheap.  This unnamed razor needed a little touchup on my chromium oxide paste strop, then a good regular dry stropping, and it was ready for use.  The handle is a little on the long and awkward side, but other than that, I&#x27;m quite impressed.  I know that I&#x27;m going to get a lot of hate mail from Dovo fanatics out there, but it&#x27;s my money and my face!</li>
    <li> it was great my dad really enjoyed it it was a gift for his birthday finds it very useful  it was exactly what he was looking for</li>
    <li> My first Straight Razor. It&#x27;s crafted good. Nice wood handle and came Shave ready. However even though it was shave ready it still needs a little honing. I am overall very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Seems nice enough, the wood isn&#x27;t as finished as it seems in the picture. He really liked it though. You just really need to make sure you sharpen it before you use it, it is quite a bit more dull than one would expect for a straight razor.</li>
    <li> this is my first straight razor, but my experience has been excellent. after a few weeks, it needs a sharpening on a thin beard..(more beard, more often).. sturdy wood handle, this blade fits comfortably in my hand for a shave. i was skeptical to buy a no-name brand blade, but i was pleasantly surprised and still use for every shave .. owned for 5 months.</li>
    <li> This was delivered this morning. I gave it a shot just a bit ago. I lathered up to shave like I normally do, except this time I went to use this new straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not get one single whisker off with this brand new blade. Not one single hair came off onto the blade. I tried every angle, scraped a patch my chin with it until it was raw and bleeding, tried relathering again and again ... nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why someone would put more than one star on this item. It is a razor that you can not possibly shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will buy it.&lt;br /&gt;It will get delivered.&lt;br /&gt;You will try it once.&lt;br /&gt;You will toss it into the trash.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband as a Christmas gift. This is his first straight razor, so he does not have anything to compare it to, but he is very pleased with this product. Although the razor does not come shave ready (which is CLEARLY stated in the product description), this was not a problem for him as I also purchased a whetstone (for honing) and leather strop, and he was able to get the razor shave ready. He is able to shave very well with the product, but says it may be best to have the razor sent away or taken somewhere to have it professionally honed for the best result. It should be noted that my husband has extremely thick and coarse facial hair and he is able to shave with a basic home sharpening (with whetstone and leather strop). The wooden handle is beautiful and well crafted, and slightly on the large side, but my husband has not had any complaints about its size.</li>
    <li> Decent blade but certainly not ready for shaving out of the box.  Ensure you have a good sharpening stone and strop before using.</li>
    <li> Blade is warped, it can&#x27;t be sharpened.  It was not shave-ready when I received it.  I tried to sharpen it, but I couldn&#x27;t because the blade is warped.</li>
    <li> i recived mine this morning i have never written a review on anything but i had to for this! the handle is sturdy wooden and gorgeous, the blade comes SHARP and well oiled even! it dosent open flimsy, the tang is comfortable the size is correct and its actually as advertised with a barber pouch to keep it in unlike...well allot of products...this thing is worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor. It took no time to hone it to a shaving edge. I am just starting out using this method and I am pleased to no longer have to buy disposable razors or cartridges. For the low price, compared to other quality razors, this is a steal!! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy shaving with it for years.</li>
    <li> Looks and works great like a pro. I bought this with a pro leather barber strop to keep it sharp.</li>
    <li> balance &amp; weight play a HUGE portion of comfort and control when handling a straight razor over the smooth, vulnerable neck and under chin areas -- this one meets or exceeds those expectations !</li>
    <li> the wood on this handle feels completely fake. almost like a sponge wood. this results in the razor itself feeling extremely light. when you&#x27;re used to a razor with a carbon steel blade that has some weight behind it switching to a feather light razor is very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Got this razor for my husband for Christmas. He is new to straight razor shaving so I didn&#x27;t want to drop $$$ on a first time razor. This LOOKED like a good deal but the razor was NOT shave ready when I received it! The price listing also fluctuated so much during the holiday season that I almost backed out! I first saw it listed at $54.99, then it went up to $74.99, then again to $94.99! It came back down to $74.99 but, in my opinion, NOT worth more than $30! I had to take it to a professional sharpener and it cost me $25 just to MAYBE get it sharp enough. Sharpener told me that the blade was too thin and that it may warp. You are better off getting an antique made with better steel. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Steel is not hard, so it won&#x27;t hold an edge. Blade, scales, and grind quality are all indicative of Pakistani origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No country of origin stamped anywhere on the packaging or product is highly suspicious and again lends more weight to Pakistani manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the positive reviews sound fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only good thing I can say about the razor is that it looks pretty decent from 5 ft away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $75, save up and buy a Dovo. Or just buy the same thing for a fraction of the price from a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> this razor will require honing before actual use along with stropping. after this is achieved the razor is ready for daily use.</li>
    <li> This thing is really nice.  Definitely didnt come shave ready, but once I got it honed the shave was great.  The wooden handle is a tad bit clunky so I just altered mine.  All in all, good product.</li>
    <li> The razor should work well, but unfortunately no amount of stroping has made it shave worthy yet. It will need to be honed before use without a doubt. I would still recommend it, but only if you have access to a honing stone as well.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this razor.  I took it to a professional and he told me he could not sharpen it because the quality of the blade is poor.  Did some research on this brand online and it maybe a Chinese product going through a middleman. I was very disappointed and felt like I threw $$ away.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my husband. He likes it but thinks the handle is a little long. He will get used to it:) He is enjoying learning how to sharpen his own razor, too. From my perspective, it seems like a very nice razor that should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as a holiday gift for my husband. It&#x27;s the perfect gift for my old-fashion, woodsy man. The product not only came quickly but it came exactly as pictured. As an added bonus the seller included care instructions. This was helpful since it&#x27;s the first straight razor we&#x27;ve owned. We couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The blade it self seems good but definitely needs sharpening right out of the box. I am not impressed with&lt;br /&gt;the wood (if it is wood) handle and the cheap plastic sleeve that comes with it. I did expect better quality for the&lt;br /&gt;price.</li>
    <li> A wood handle was my only mistake on this product but works perfectly. Easy to clean sharpen and use amazong product for the price tag.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am new to straight razor shaving. I have much to learn in shaving technique as well as in honing and stropping. I have not used any other straight razor, such as the much heralded Dovo, so I can offer no comparison. What I can say is that, in spite of my newb status, I have found this razor shaves quite well. I always got irritated skin and zits after shaving with Mach 3, even some electric razors. I have had no irritation or breakout after using this razor. Also, I have found my experience as a new user with this razor to be more enjoyable than when I have gotten straight razor shaves from a barber. Like I said, I am new and have nothing to compare this razor to, but I am very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note for other newbs, I also got the book \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; also on Amazon and found it a quick and easy read, but really helpful for starting me off on the right foot. Definitely worth the $15 or whatever it was.</li>
    <li> I just got I had two blades before this it may not come shave ready but it is easy to strop with the righ tools so make sore you buy the stropping belt or block you will need it. It it&#x27;s the best you could get for$50 it&#x27;s a gem :-D</li>
    <li> I am new to the world of straight razors, but I put my trust in the advice of a well-known store over the internet.  I&#x27;m not happy with the purchase and I have given up on the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this item I couldn&#x27;t get it shave ready by stropping, so I took it to a well-known place in Los Angeles called Ross Cutlery to get it honed.  The owner took 1 look at it and said he would be happy to take my money and hone it, but it would be a waste of time because it would never shave well or hold a good edge.  The metal is too cheap and soft.  He showed me good razors from reputable companies (like Dovo)and I felt like there was a significant difference in the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** This seller has been patient and friendly with me, even after I complained about the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a straight razor for almost a year now. I started with a Kriegar, YES, a Kriegar. It took alot to get the Kriegar sharp enough to shave, but I didn&#x27;t know any better (I used to use a pocket knife until I almost cut my cheek off). I was hesitant to pay even this much for a razor, but I&#x27;m glad I did. This thing was sharp enough to shave out of the package!!! I tested it dry on the neck and you could hear it cleaving through the hair!!!! I stropped it for about 30 seconds and it was ready to go. I have yet to use it for a full shave due to lack of time, but I CANNOT wait until I do...I would recommend this to anyone who wants an excellent straight razor without the high dollar price tag of a Dovo.</li>
    <li> It does need a lot of stropping when you first receive it.  I was able to get it ready in about three minutes using the my x1000 Japanese whet stone(any finishing stone will probably do just as well) six passes on that and two and a half minutes of stropping and it was ready to dry shave with.. Once it has it&#x27;s edge, it keeps it much better then other straight razors I have had-30 seconds of stropping before I shave is about all it takes. best value of any straight razor on amazon-hands down..</li>
    <li> Well the product says shave ready but the seller said honing may be required. The seller was absolutely telling the truth and I kind of expected as much. I tried a quick stropping with chrome oxide and then a standard leather strop to see if that would do the job. Not really. It still isn&#x27;t close to shave ready. I considered honing it myself but decided to take it to be honed. The response from the man at the shop was that the spine was not up to snuff and would require extensive work.</li>
