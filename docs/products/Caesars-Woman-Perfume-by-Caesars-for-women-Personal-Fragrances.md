### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful!</li>
      <li>I was very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>, what was that wonderful smell!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Very good</li>
      <li>She loved it!</li>
      <li>I have lots of great comments on this product</li>
      <li>Because, this scent truly is happy.</li>
      <li>And who doesn&#x27;t like the idea of happy in a bottle?</li>
      <li>Bought it for a great aunt.</li>
      <li>Great purchase.</li>
      <li>The shipping on this was amazing!</li>
      <li>The scent was wonderful but a bit too sexy for that stage of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>smells great not too overpowering just a nice fragrance at a great price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant and approachable.</li>
      <li>She loved it...</li>
      <li>This was an order for a good friend of mine who is in her 60&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Good produce and good price.</li>
      <li>this was a gift for a good friend...</li>
      <li>Bought for my wife and she loved it.</li>
      <li>She smells so good</li>
      <li>Very pleased.  </li>
      <li>, I happened to come across it on Amazon and am so glad!</li>
      <li>I have been using this fragrance for many years!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfectly sexy!</li>
      <li>and she was thrilled.</li>
      <li>A nice lift of something fruity closely follows the flowery: kinda citrusy but not as acidic.</li>
      <li>you haven&#x27;t used this before, be prepared for a very strong sexy scent.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not concerned about running out (and if I did, I&#x27;d just order more).</li>
      <li>I have worn this for many years and am always complemented.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cologne for many years and just can&#x27;t find anything I like as well.  </li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I put it on in the morning and don&#x27;t have to worry about refreshing it anytime of the day or evening.</li>
      <li>Have had many compliments.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not too sexy now:</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more seductive sort of Lady Stetson, if you remember that (discontinued).</li>
      <li>Fell in love with this fragrance while walking through Ceasar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas years ago when they must of had many testers close to the shop&#x27;s doors.  </li>
      <li>I must say, I was pleased with the price and the product itself.</li>
      <li>But when I ran out, and I couldn&#x27;t immediately travel to Las Vegas, I turned to Amazon to pick up my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I immediately fell in love with the smell.</li>
      <li>More an earthy scent with touch of feminiity.</li>
      <li>Great product and fast delivery</li>
      <li>When I run out I will be ordering more from this site.</li>
      <li>I receive so many complements when I am wearing the Ceasars woman perfume.</li>
      <li>It might be overwhelming to some.</li>
      <li>Very nice soft scent.</li>
      <li>Great and lasting scent and matches with wife&#x27;s favorite and commented upon Caesars woman fragrance.</li>
      <li>Kind of strong and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smelling at first.</li>
      <li>It works fine as a room freshener, which is about all I use it for.</li>
      <li>Light but not fruity or flowerly.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy yo have found it again at such a reasonable price and the fragrance is amazing on Sunday mornings.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, not intrusive, but not a wallflower either.</li>
      <li>I first received this fragrance as a gift from friends who went to Vegas years ago and still, I just love it.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this perfume at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas.</li>
      <li>She was so excited when I told her I could get it thru Amazon for her.</li>
      <li>The finish is clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been partial to fragrances that are light, citrusy, and are the aromatic equivalent of happy.</li>
      <li>If you smell a spritz of it just by itself, it has a nice, very innocent scent that seems to be more fitting a young adult, but it seems to \\&quot;grow up\\&quot; once it is combined with human chemistry.</li>
      <li>No, you would smile and think,</li>
      <li>I have always loved this fragrance but due to circumstances have not bought any in years.</li>
      <li>I was glad I didn&#x27;t have to go back to Vegas to get it.</li>
      <li>Caesar&#x27;s Woman starts out flowery (floral?), but not in the cheap diluted way like a girl&#x27;s perfume, or the sticky-sweet overbearing way of \\&quot;Grandma\\&quot; perfume, or have that intense, dark kinda spicy scent that is beyond overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the type of scent that everyone reacts to, in a positive way.</li>
      <li>It is the kind of scent that once it is sprayed onto the skin, it transforms into something far more complex than what is in the bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in a fabulously large size</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying it.</li>
      <li>I really did not expect to get it so soon.</li>
      <li>this is very convenient.  </li>
      <li>Thanks,..</li>
      <li>I still purchase Caesars Women - I really like the product</li>
      <li>Thanks so much Amazon once again for meeting my expectation  on this product</li>
      <li>Caesar&#x27;s Woman first caught my attention in the early 90s, when I received samples of it with my Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood orders.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s cost is a bit high for my budget.</li>
      <li>After reading all the reviews I had high hopes for this scent.  </li>
      <li>I tend to love a heavy musky perfume.  </li>
      <li>The 2 bottles that I received were obvioulsy very old.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a single man, who for 20 years, has found some women in his life to gift with with this fragrance just to enjoy it occasionally</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
      <li>This gift really surprised her.</li>
      <li>I guess I will have to go back to the store and pay more for the product, but at least it will smell like it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
      <li>I used up my samples but saved the vials (as always; nothing like getting a nice nostalgic whiff even if there&#x27;s nothing left to apply!)</li>
      <li>and she really loves this perfume and couldn&#x27;t find it in a perfume outlet that she had previously purchased it from.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good and I will order this again</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for many years! It&#x27;s the type of scent that everyone reacts to, in a positive way. Men follow you and ask you what you are wearing and woman want you to write it down so they can buy it.    The 2 bottles that I received were obvioulsy very old. Neither had a scent. You would have thought it was colored water! I guess I will have to go back to the store and pay more for the product, but at least it will smell like it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for many years and just can&#x27;t find anything I like as well.  I get a lot of comments on this scent and it lasts until you wash it off!  I put it on in the morning and don&#x27;t have to worry about refreshing it anytime of the day or evening.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. I bought it for a friend and she was thrilled.</li>
    <li> The shipping on this was amazing! I really did not expect to get it so soon. This was an order for a good friend of mine who is in her 60&#x27;s and she really loves this perfume and couldn&#x27;t find it in a perfume outlet that she had previously purchased it from. She was so excited when I told her I could get it thru Amazon for her. She was exstatic when it came in!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I had high hopes for this scent.  I tend to love a heavy musky perfume.  I was terribly dissappointed with how cheap this one smells.  You get what you pay for!!  This perfume is not worth $5</li>
    <li> I still purchase Caesars Women - I really like the product but it&#x27;s cost is a bit high for my budget.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a great aunt. She&#x27;s not able to get around like she used too. This gift really surprised her. She loved it!</li>
    <li> I always order.  It is not easy to find locally so this is very convenient.  Good produce and good price.</li>
    <li> Hard item to find locally. I have worn this for many years and am always complemented. Very nice soft scent.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for a good friend...she has used it befor so there was no question as to if she would like it...She loved it...Thanks so much Amazon once again for meeting my expectation  on this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a single man, who for 20 years, has found some women in his life to gift with with this fragrance just to enjoy it occasionally</li>

It&#x27;s really difficult to capture the essence of a fragrance in mere words but I&#x27;ll try. Caesar&#x27;s Woman starts out flowery (floral?), but not in the cheap diluted way like a girl&#x27;s perfume, or the sticky-sweet overbearing way of \\&quot;Grandma\\&quot; perfume, or have that intense, dark kinda spicy scent that is beyond overwhelming. It&#x27;s light, not intrusive, but not a wallflower either. It&#x27;s pleasant and approachable. A nice lift of something fruity closely follows the flowery: kinda citrusy but not as acidic. Whatever it is, it lifts the floral and lightens everything a bit. The finish is clean. If one were to walk by wearing this, there wouldn&#x27;t be a lingering scent assaulting your nose. No, you would smile and think, \\&quot;Wow, what was that wonderful smell!\\&quot; Because, this scent truly is happy. And who doesn&#x27;t like the idea of happy in a bottle?</li>
    <li> smells great not too overpowering just a nice fragrance at a great price. I have lots of great comments on this product</li>
    <li> When I run out I will be ordering more from this site. I was glad I didn&#x27;t have to go back to Vegas to get it.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this perfume at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas. I immediately fell in love with the smell. But when I ran out, and I couldn&#x27;t immediately travel to Las Vegas, I turned to Amazon to pick up my favorite perfume. I must say, I was pleased with the price and the product itself. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Caesar&#x27;s Woman first caught my attention in the early 90s, when I received samples of it with my Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood orders. I used up my samples but saved the vials (as always; nothing like getting a nice nostalgic whiff even if there&#x27;s nothing left to apply!) in my treasured set of fragrances. The scent was wonderful but a bit too sexy for that stage of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m in lifetime relationship with the sexiest man on Earth, I happened to come across it on Amazon and am so glad! It smells as I remember it and it&#x27;s not too sexy now: it&#x27;s perfectly sexy! It&#x27;s in a fabulously large size so I&#x27;m not concerned about running out (and if I did, I&#x27;d just order more). I wear it around the house, going out, whatever, and it keeps bugs off me when I&#x27;m gardening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used this before, be prepared for a very strong sexy scent. It might be overwhelming to some. Imagine if the hottest date were a scent, this is it. It&#x27;s a bit more seductive sort of Lady Stetson, if you remember that (discontinued).</li>
    <li> Great and lasting scent and matches with wife&#x27;s favorite and commented upon Caesars woman fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  Thanks for carrying it.</li>
    <li> I receive so many complements when I am wearing the Ceasars woman perfume. It lasts all day. I Wish it was easier to get tho. Thanks,..</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Came with body lotion and shower gel.  Fell in love with this fragrance while walking through Ceasar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas years ago when they must of had many testers close to the shop&#x27;s doors.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This will never qualify as a &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; scent for me. I purchased it based on other&#x27;s ratings. It works fine as a room freshener, which is about all I use it for.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Kind of strong and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smelling at first. Use sparingly and wait for it to wear down. Then it smells good/fancy/expensive.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my mother for Christmas she loves this cologne its&#x27;s hard to find but when we find it we buy it for her. She smells so good</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent. Light but not fruity or flowerly.  Have had many compliments. More an earthy scent with touch of feminiity.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this fragrance but due to circumstances have not bought any in years. I am so happy yo have found it again at such a reasonable price and the fragrance is amazing on Sunday mornings. Lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Christmas Present for my Wife - she has used this product for years - Loves the fragrance. Used to buy it in Mexico.</li>
