      <li>I guess they figure most people will just say</li>
      <li>Very excited to have been able to find this product.</li>
      <li>&quot;  this is a nice and refreshing and wholly unique scent.</li>
      <li>The first was the best that I purchased in a Whole Foods store but was pricey</li>
      <li>A nice clean even spray.</li>
      <li>Nice smell, not too strong, but not too original either.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the smell and  it last all day. But most important is my wife loves the fragrance!</li>
    <li> Where many colognes today all have a similar \\&quot;ambercrombie finch store smell\\&quot; like you&#x27;re always about to go \\&quot;clubbin\\&quot;  this is a nice and refreshing and wholly unique scent. not overpowering, yet very distinct. and it is all natural and cruelty free to boot. you will ultimatley have to smell it yourself to reach your own conclusion, which is where the nice low price comes into play-if you don&#x27;t (you will though) like it, it was under $25 you spent. alternately some co-oops and health food stores carry it, and have a tester. bottom line-i thoroughly recommend this cologne</li>
    <li> I LOVE how this smells on my husband. Great vegan product!</li>
    <li> These products are wonderful.  The salesgirl said she would follow a man wearing this anywhere. I wouldn&#x27;t go that far since I bought it for my son.  Another man  is another story.</li>
    <li> I have a major sensitivity to scents, especially strong scents, so my husband can&#x27;t wear the cologne or body sprays he likes (unless he wants to repel me, I guess). I tried to find something for him to smell good, since he said he likes to wear scents sometimes. I was hoping this would be different than standard cologne, but it wasn&#x27;t really. It still has the chemically smell that bothers me, and I still had a bad reaction to it. The smell itself wasn&#x27;t bad, but this is not for sensitive noses.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Smells great to my nose and most female noses I encounter.</li>
    <li> You really only need a little to last all day. Looks small but like I said anything more than a squirt is too much.</li>
    <li> This cologne lasted me 5 months! I used it \\&quot;every day\\&quot; two or three sprays each time. Actually, I did miss some days. This cologne is almost empty! Would probably last another 2-3 weeks, but I had to order one. I really love the smell of it! I am a vegan so I am happy to find a cologne that is cruelty-free. I ordered a deodorant from Herba Cowboy (dusk) one. :)</li>
    <li> Very nice woody fragrance, not overpowering. Women love it as they say it is very manly!! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I hate cologne, but was intrigued by this one.  I use the Herban Cowboy Aftershave Balm &amp; so I thought I would check this out &amp; I&#x27;m really glad I did.  It smells great &amp; it doesn&#x27;t give you a headache.  It&#x27;s subtle &amp; UNIQUE.  Everyone else is smelling like Axe spray, but I smell like Dusk.</li>
    <li> This company always produces a perfect product and this is no exception.  I can&#x27;t stop smelling my husband when he wears it!  The odor is truly intoxicating and no animals had to suffer for it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, you&#x27;d never guess it&#x27;s vegan. It has a deep scent but isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Just the right amount of fragrance. I used some the other day before the gym and only occasionally smelled it, which is the right way to wear it. Some other dudes love their pungent perfume and can&#x27;t help but &#x27;share&#x27; it with everyone, not the best use! I want to smell good as someone passes by, not as I enter the room. Herban Cowboy -Dusk- Cologne is my new favorite.  They also have shaving products and deodorant.  Get some today!</li>
    <li> my husband loves this scent.  It smells clean, and is not overpowering.  It seems to last on him as well.  Plus it is not full of chemicals.</li>
    <li> One of the best essences combination for a cologne that you ever had, classy, warm, invigorating and delicate smell. Thanks Herban Cowboy.</li>
    <li> Really great masculine scent without all the garbage.</li>
    <li> I use and enjoy the HC Dusk soap, deodorant, and aftershave balm, so I thought I&#x27;d buy the same fragrance as a cologne. It does NOT smell at all like the other Dusk products. This smells like the cheap, awful colognes my aunts used to buy me when I was 12. It reeks and one spray made my room smell like rubbing alcohol for hours.    I&#x27;m concerned that I got a spoiled/bad batch or something, seeing as I really like everything else in the fragrance/brand.</li>
    <li> First purchased Herban Cowboy soap a year ago and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  It does have a definitive scent but it dissipates fairly quickly outside of immediate contact with the skin - though that scent is less than half of the reason I keep coming back.  I&#x27;ve switched from product, to product, to product and this was the first that leaves my skin feeling refreshed but cleaned.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells so good on my husband- musky yet cool watery, not overpowering, and even if he applies too much for my liking it doesn&#x27;t flare up my allergies like regular colognes.  I seriously appreciate this cologne.  My husband loves to wear scents, and I usually can&#x27;t tolerate them... so its the perfect compromise.</li>
    <li> Pro: all natural&lt;br /&gt;Con: kinda smells like old man old spice so I have my husband wear very little so it&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
    <li> smells great with no chemicals!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne.  Its not overpowering, like some many of the cheaper colognes.  Smells natural without smelling like pine or cedar, yet still masculine.  A fine scent.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne! I&#x27;ve been complimented many times by people about my manly but subtle smell. Goes great with my body chemistry, and I love that it&#x27;s not loaded with preservatives or chemicals! Smells great, isn&#x27;t over-powering, and lasts for hours. What more could you ask for in a cologne?</li>
    <li> Heavy smell, last all day. A little goes a long way. All in all, nice cologne.</li>
    <li> Very Masculine but at the same time doesn&#x27;t come off as too strong.</li>
    <li> Not great. Smells different. Bummed really liked this.</li>
    <li> I like all the Dusk products, the soap, deodorant and aftershave lotion.  The products are gentle on the skin and smell great.  Best specialty products for men.</li>
    <li> Very nice all natural cologne that I have purchased many times at Whole Foods market. However, it is about $10 less here, so very happy with the service and price</li>
    <li> I love herban cowboy product. all natural and a great smell. I just got it and had people asking what are you wearing. I would tell them CLOTHS. they would say no that fragrance? I would tell them and they would say were can I get it? it smells awesome. remember it is only $22 so don&#x27;t expect a $500 cologne. however, do expect a great smell at a small price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, and I think it smells quite nice. It doesn&#x27;t make my nose twitch compared to other men&#x27;s scents. My husband loves it to. I&#x27;ve actually purchased this twice already.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this cologne smells like your average musk, it smells nothing like the soap and nothing like the aftershave cream...Which is too bad because the Heban Cowboy soap is my favorite smell.</li>
    <li> wish it was a more pleasing smell.  i will use it as my backup cologne.  was excited to see that it was all natural but not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> I hate to do this, but I must warn others that this is NOT REAL. Bottle looks cheap and not like the one posted here in the picture and it smells like old spice. When I wrote to customer service after receiving it, they said since I&#x27;ve opened it, I can&#x27;t return it. Imagine!? It was like talking to a robot at customer service. &amp;#34;Sorry, Ma&#x27;am, that&#x27;s our policy.&amp;#34; They send you a fake product and then say too bad, you have to keep it. I guess they figure most people will just say okay and walk away. Amazon fixed the situation, so no worries. But just make sure you are getting the product from an authorized re-seller. I was shocked that I could get scammed on Amazon, but there you go. Unfortunately, there are liars and cheaters selling on here as well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Splendid scent. Doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies. Vegan friendly. Overall, this is just what I was looking for &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This smells great and not toxic. Seems to last nicely. Wife loves it! A nice clean even spray. Screams QUALITY!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  It has a very manly scent that stays throughout the day.  Very good price for an all natural product.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, not too strong, but not too original either. I was hoping for something more...earthy I suppose. A lighter, natural scent. This cologne reminds me old spice aftershave or something like that. Very common fragrance to me but it&#x27;s not bad. I&#x27;d like something new, more original.</li>
    <li> Smells very good, not too strong or chemical.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great considering it&#x27;s vegan. Which might be an ignorant statement but it&#x27;s a good surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never really had a nose for cologne meaning I can&#x27;t really tell the differences but this one I can at least say you don&#x27;t smell like an 80 year old man lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s not sweet, it&#x27;s a good smell not too strong and not abrasive at all in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone that wants something natural and smells great.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day. He prefers organic products. He is also concerned about the environment, so it was a big plus that it was vegan. Best of all it smells great. At least my boyfriend and I like it. Plus I got bonus points for being so thoughtful to think of all these points when getting him cologne.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I&#x27;m not sure that it doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals...it&#x27;s a little vague.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking I was ordering Organic Cologne as stated!  Well the only thing organic is the alcohol!  Big deal!  The rest is \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;  Not Organic fragrance.  If its&#x27; not Organic than what is it?  Chemical most likely or they would proudly state what the heck their lovely fragrance is.  Nothing listed about essential oils or flower waters.  Printed Directly on the box the cologne came in says: Denatured Alcohol (distilled from corn)*, Fragrance.  *Organic.&lt;br /&gt;The word Fragrance does not have the little * by it the way the alcohol does indicating the fragrance is not organic.  I went to their website to try to find out more info &amp; it said the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance can mean anything.  It is such a general term.  \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; typically is a chemical!  It can be 100&#x27;s of chemicals put together &amp; still called the mere innocent sounding term as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.  So it is 95% Organic they boast!  Yeah!  95% of it is Organic alcohol!  What a joke.  What a rip off!  I am so pissed at being duped.  Unless they change their ingredients to include real natural organic ingredients, or flat out say just what the ingredients are in their \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; I will never buy this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, of course it&#x27;s Vegan &amp; Vegetarian &amp; Cruelty Free!  It&#x27;s synthetic except for the alcohol!  Last I checked no animals needed to be harmed while growing corn for alcohol!  What a scam of all scams!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for the organic alcohol, being made in the USA &amp; being sweat shop free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the Environmental Working Group website Skin Deep [...] Fragrance rates an 8 in human safety.  10 being the least safe.  0 being the most safe.&lt;br /&gt;The dangers of Fragrance:  Neurotoxicity, Allergies/immunotoxicity.  Overall it rates Herban Cowboy Dusk as a 4 or \\&quot;fair\\&quot; in regard to human safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously if you don&#x27;t care about these things, you will think I&#x27;m a raging lunatic &amp; buy this anyway.  For those of you wanting something truly organic, I&#x27;d like to think you are glad to know the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, yes this smells wonderful.  So what?  Smelling good doesn&#x27;t mean it is good.y, yes this smells wonderful.  So what?  Smelling good doesn&#x27;t mean it is good.</li>
    <li> nice scent...nice price!</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Bought it for my husband.  Nice that it&#x27;s not what every other man is wearing.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the soap from same brand/scent but this coclogne simply didnt work for me, feels cheap, too agressive. Will buy more of the soap though, love those.</li>
    <li> My lady loves this on me.</li>
    <li> This has a distinctive, rich scent that I think is subtle (depending on how much one wears) without being overly perfumy.</li>
    <li> i got fake not the original cologne.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks different and it smells like cheep car air fresher nothing like a cologne find it else where</li>
    <li> Excellent scent and fair price; however, I sent the following email to the Herban vendor: &amp;#34;The side of the box of a 1.7 fl oz Dusk cologne bottle states: &amp;#34;Alcohol, Fragrance. Corn Derived&amp;#34; Is this GMO corn with built-in pesticides, which cannot be distilled, or organic non-GMO corn? My concerns are twofold: my understanding is that approximately 30% of what is applied to the skin can be absorbed into the body and secondly, I don&#x27;t want to support any GMO related products. Thanks in advance for your response.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Herban vendor responded: &amp;#34;Thank you for your email. In it you asked about the corn in our fragrance alcohol. William we are working with our suppliers to obtain verification about NON-GMO. It is a slow process but we are working on it. For now we can not verify the corn is non-gmo. Thanks again for your email.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this product is often listed in website associated with organic products. I am very disappointed that the vendor is unaware if GMO&#x27;s are present in their &amp;#34;Natural Grooming&amp;#34; products. Wp</li>
    <li> This is an incredible find, it&#x27;s difficult to find a cologne that is natural and smells like real cologne.  This product does both.  The smell is pleasant and long lasting, but doesn&#x27;t overpower.  This is absolutely great and it doesn&#x27;t bother my wife who is sensitive to chemicals.</li>
    <li> Organic or not; this smells great! It has a real masculine scent. It does not smell perfumey or fruity. One thing I really enjoy is that the scent stays and keeps the same smell. For me, being organic does not matter. I&#x27;ve worn this cologne now for 5 years. I wore it while dating my now wife, and now that we are married. She loves the smell! She&#x27;s the honest type and would tell me if she did not. She actually bought a bottle for me one time as a gift. I highly recommend trying this.</li>
    <li> I no longer have a fear that my son is breathing in harmful chemicals. He was using Ax and I cringed every time he put in on knowing the thousands of chemical ingredients that go into making it.&lt;br /&gt;Urban cowboy cologne isn&#x27;t just for cowboys! We are more like city folk but the cologne has a very nice smell and something I can handle with my chemical sensitivities to smells. I just re ordered the set for my son, cologne, soap and deodorant and will be trying the &#x27;wild&#x27; version later. Thank you for a nice product!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for the price</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for my husband years ago in Whole Foods and he really loves it. It&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon. What I like the most about this product is its natural formula, and the smell of course!</li>
    <li> I recently discovered this brand after buying the deodorant and I am really glad i found it. My wife and I are all about ALL NATURE, PURE, CHEMICAL FREE PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is funny how many people care about what they ingest and put in their body but they dont pay much attention to what they are putting on their skin or washing their hair or face with. I love the smell of the cologne, soap, aftershave and deodorant. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Elsha, at least it smells just like it. Maybe you like Elsha. I hate it. My wife hates it. It&#x27;s really overbearing, and smells as cheap as it is. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap cologne, you found it. I really wanted to like it, and tried for about a week before I threw it away. Hopefully it&#x27;s a better fit for you.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! I&#x27;ve been through several &#x27;vegan&#x27; colognes and scents and this is the only one that I&#x27;ve truly liked a lot. Very subtle, I recommend to anyone looking for a great vegan cologne!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells like a smoother old spice. I quite enjoy it but the bottle is quite small for the price, so not sure I will get again. Depends on how much I use and how much I like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome, and I love that is is vegan and cruelty free. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  I can smell lavender, sage, and rosemary.  If you like the smell of herb gardens then this is for you!  I would think women can wear this too... yummy herbs smell good on anyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne is a gift for a friend of mine who  is vegetarian and lives a very holistic lifestyle. He was looking for something that is made with the least amount of chemicals as possible and focuses more on natural ingredients.  He and his wife love the cologne and are extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have used it for over 6 years. Everyone loves the aroma.</li>
    <li> My son got this and says he gets comments on it.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells so fresh, like clean laundry, that it seems as though someone has just sprayed Fabreze in the room.  Love it.</li>
    <li> good cologne it will be a good gift for the holidays</li>
    <li> Good stuff, drives the wife crazy!</li>
    <li> Awesome enough. Loving it.</li>
    <li> It smells good and hopefully it won&#x27;t contribute to me developing Cancer or Alzheimers because of horrible ingredients, so there&#x27;s not much to complain about. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Most men&#x27;s fragrances smell like a bottle of vermouth with some &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; fragrance over top.  This one does not.  It has an earthy woodsy smell (with maybe a hint of vanilla?) without being abrasive, and it&#x27;s not so strong that you&#x27;ll end up being &amp;#34;Too much cologne guy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could imagine this scent being almost unisex, rather than like the &amp;#34;typical dude&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> I got this because I liked the Herban Cowboy deoderant, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it pretty regularly.  It&#x27;s an agreeable but not overpowering scent, and most importantly my wife likes it :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who suddenly decided to start wearing cologne and bought some horrid purple stuff at the drugstore that made me sick. This stuff smells manly and is all natural so it does not make my throat hurt. We are both happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to compliment the soap, however, he says it made him itch:-(&lt;br /&gt;But for the short time he use it he smelled great.  To be fair though, he&#x27;s not much for colognes or after shave, he&#x27;s an Old Spice guy, hence my trying to move him along. so, if it wasn&#x27;t for that I would have given it a five star rating.</li>
    <li> For the customers who are interested in knowing if this product is truly organic it is NOT. I recently visited WholeFoods market in search of a natural cologne. I came across this cologne and immediately disliked the smell. However, for the sake of inquiry I ask the cosmetics employee whether the product truly contained the listed ingredients and no synthetic derivatives of fragrance. She replied with, \\&quot;I honestly don&#x27;t know, but I will look into this question on your behalf.\\&quot; A few days later I received an email from this proactive employee with the following statement from a representative of the Company who promotes the cologne:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;In your email you asked if our cologne carries synthetic ingredients. The Essential Oils EO(s) listed on the side of the product carton are just a few of the MANY EO(s) in this fragrance. Since the fragrance is NOT 100% organic we can&#x27;t guarantee there are NO synthetics since some EO(s) are derived through synthetic processes. We hope this helps clarify the issue. Feel free to contact us with any other questions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customers who wish to inquire further regarding this product or others can contact the company at the following email address: staff@organic-grooming.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope your find this review helpful! :)</li>
    <li> Great masculine smelling cologne that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my asthma.  Only small negative is the smell seems to wear off quickly making reapplication necessary.  Excellent stuff and I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this cologne!  Bonus is that it is all natural without the allergens or additives found in other colognes.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love the smell of the cologne but it doesn&#x27;t last all day- that&#x27;s okay.  They don&#x27;t test on animals and its a great smell so minor issue.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend smells good</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and at a great price. My girlfriend prefers this over my Burberry and yves saint Laurent.</li>
    <li> Good scent. Previously I broke a bottle of this in my bathroom which I had to replace. The only thing I can recommend is to not do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat deeper scent akin to a wintery sandal woodish (But not) smell. Heavier than say Nautica Ocean, but not too heavy for summer.</li>
    <li> Very manly great scent lasts long not too overwhelming</li>
    <li> Smells delicious!!! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fake. Smells same as before</li>
    <li> Great stuff... Decent price and Prime! Arrived well packaged.</li>
    <li> Finally found a cologne that wasn&#x27;t filled with horrible chemicals and it smells great. I also use their deodorant (forest, dusk, and mountain). Very pleased with the scent and the ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product is quality and for a very reasonable price.  Very excited to have been able to find this product.</li>
    <li> Extraordinarily bad smell, literally! It&#x27;s a -- &amp;#34;Please, would you get away from me so I don&#x27;t have to smell you?!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I think the cologne smells just like old spice. It has a musk smell to it. I love the deodorant they make but this is just ok.</li>
    <li> I like the concept of this cologne, no animal testing but I find it to be very light upon applying it to my skin.  I have used it for a few years now and although I continue to buy it I find that the fragrance is very light after applying it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this cologne for a few years now and have received a different formula to it every time. The first was the best that I purchased in a Whole Foods store but was pricey so I figured buy it on here. The few on here smell like they&#x27;re water down with more rubbing alcohol than the fragrance itself</li>
    <li> Smells different than the dusk soap.</li>
    <li> smells like angel musk with a hint of raw bliss</li>
    <li> This is my boyfriends favorite cologne. I ordered him a new bottle for Christmas and he was very happy.  Not too strong, smells great and best of all it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
    <li> I hope this company never stops making this product.  I started buying this for my husband 3 years ago and I am still crazy about it and he likes it as well.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Herban Cowboy soap and deodorant...for not only their cleaning and oder protection, but also for their smell.  Now he can have a bit more of the wonderful scent any time he wants.</li>
