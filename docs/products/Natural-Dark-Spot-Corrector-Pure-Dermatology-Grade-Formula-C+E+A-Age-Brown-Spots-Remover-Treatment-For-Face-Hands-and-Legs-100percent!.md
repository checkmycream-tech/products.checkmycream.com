    <li> I have been using this for a week or so now.  The change is not instant. I will continue to use it. It appears to be making a difference in the dark spots on my hands.</li>
    <li> I just started using this -Maximum Spot  Corrector-I think I could use a gallon or so of this serum!  It doesn&#x27;t smell-it doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my skin or eyes.  My eyes are very senstive to most cosmetics. I&#x27;m 64 &amp; just started noticing these age spots pop up any where they please. I figure now as soon as I notice a new one-I&#x27;ll put this cream on it. I am concentrating on  a spot on my hand as a test subject!  I swear it is fading!  Thanks for a great product!</li>
