      <li>I have such a hard time finding good eyeliner brushes that are of good quality.  </li>
      <li>The green version of this brush has a much shorter handle and works fine, but the pink brush has the perfect handle length for me.</li>

      <li>I needed a brush fast!</li>

      <li>It is an amazing little tool.</li>
      <li>Expected it to be a bit more angular</li>
      <li>The bristles come to a beautiful delicate point, and allow you to make the thinnest line possible with absolute precision!  </li>

      <li>So easy to use and so precise, I always have a bit of a hard time with eyeliner</li>

      <li>This is the second one I purchased because the first worked so well!</li>
      <li>I wish it was just a little thicker, but it is perfect for thin winged cat eyes.</li>

    <li> I like this brush for gel eyeliner application. It takes a little getting used to, but for the price, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> The best eyeliner brush. Excellent quality!</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted and the price was excellent.  I have told all my friends about this.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s easy to handle and makes a perfect &#x27;wing&#x27; without having to pull at your eyelid corners.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever I never wore winged eyeliner until I bought this and it&#x27;s so easy to use !</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was searching for to apply my new gel eyeliner!  Thanks so much for a quality product, and so easy to purchase through amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eyeliner brushes (bent and straight) and this is BY FAR the best one I&#x27;ve ever used for applying gel liner.  It is perfect for getting that smooth, precise line on your lashline.  You can even wing it out and because the tip is so thin (yet firm), it makes the perfect point.  The tip reminds me a lot of a felt tip eyeliner pen.  In the past, I&#x27;ve made do with other eyeliner brushes and then done the wing with a felt tip eyeliner pen.  Now I don&#x27;t have to do that.  :)  I use the [[ASIN:B0084A5N0A L&#x27;Oreal Paris Infallible Lacquer Eyeliner 24H, Blackest Black]] gel liner and it works perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Cannot wait to buy some of Bdellium&#x27;s other brushes!</li>
    <li> First time I have tried a brush like this and I love it!</li>
    <li> Great tool!! I love the size and the angle helps achieve that perfect cat eye!!</li>
    <li> Finally I can use my gel eyeliners again!! At one time I was in love with the Maybelline gel liner, it&#x27;s in a little pot... The brush that came with it was ok for a while but the line wasn&#x27;t clean. I bought a brush from the drugstore for a couple bucks and it just didn&#x27;t give the fine line results that I wanted, especially so I can do a retro cat eye and get close to the lash line. This does what I want it to do. Plus it&#x27;s vegan and in a cute color. Loveeee it!</li>
    <li> i give it 2 stars coz it absorbs my eyeliner gel.</li>
    <li> love this brush! this is exactly what i was looking for in an eyeliner brush to put on my cream/gel eyeliner.  It really helps to get that perfect winged eyeliner look. recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an angled eyeliner brush for sometime. The price of this brush caught my attention so I decided to give it a try. It is an amazing little tool. Great quality. I&#x27;ve never achieved such a precise thin line (easily buildible as well) ever before. I&#x27;ve tried similar tools of brand names and this one beats them all! Must buy!</li>
    <li> This brush has a precision tip and it is slightly angled.  I have small hooded eyes and it is a must have for a perfect cat eye!!</li>
    <li> The bristles were way too stiff and hard to work with. It&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Good brush for the price but would like it to be just a tad thicker.  It is a bit stingy with the bristles so it takes a while to get the thickness right and I tend to lose patience.</li>
    <li> I already owned one in green. 4 years strong and its still my favorite brush for gel liner. I have more colors in gel liners now so I needed more of these brushes. Still works amazingly well. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for a wedding I went to a few weeks ago. I needed a brush fast! The delivery came just in time. I used the brush for gel eyeliner and thought I would try this instead of an angled brush. It works very well. I wish it was just a little thicker, but it is perfect for thin winged cat eyes. Also, it is easy to add on eyeliner to build up the look if you want. Satisfied with the purchase!</li>
    <li> This brush makes applying eye liner super easy. The angle and thinness of the brush is great for applying my Elf gel eyeliner. goes on in a thin, even line.</li>
    <li> Great little eyeliner brush.  Shape has stayed and no bristles have come out that i know of.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is THE best eyeliner brush I&#x27;ve ever used. So easy to use and so precise, I always have a bit of a hard time with eyeliner but this brush makes it very easy.</li>
    <li> I own several bent brushes and I find this brush to be one of the best.  Stiff enough to draw a perfect line, but still soft so that it feels great against your skin!  Will buy more as I hate cleaning my brushes all the time!  The green version of this brush has a much shorter handle and works fine, but the pink brush has the perfect handle length for me. Nice weight and balance.</li>
    <li> Love my bent eyeliner helps my liner go on smooth and ease I can even draw a straight line on the top useing the gel eyeliner \\&quot;great\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I have never purchased one before. Make applying gel eyeliner so easy.</li>
    <li> I like this brush especially since it has a slight curve. Makes it easier to apply my eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Gives me the perfect lined eyes every day.  I have been recommending this brush to my co workers and friends.</li>
    <li> Great tool! I loved the color and how easy it was for me to apply my eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This brush is much skinnier/thinner than ELF&#x27;s bent eyeliner brush, maybe by half its size or so. Very precise with soft bristles. The brush looks clean and is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> liked it, the only flaw it is very difficult to clean</li>
    <li> Do any of you know if this will help me do a cat eye style&lt;br /&gt;eyeliner ?..I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it for a while but can&#x27;t due to my unsteady hand</li>
    <li> I have trouble using this brush I dont like it at all.</li>
    <li> Perfect for eyeliner and brow shaping! I had to buy another one because I use both every day!</li>
    <li> The best eyeliner brush ever.  Exactly like the green brush - only the handle is pink and about an inch longer.  Both are equally great.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use with Lattise and for that purpose (and I&#x27;m sure for eyeliner too) it&#x27;s PERFECT. I save so much product using this brush because it&#x27;s super tiny and precise. I love this brush!</li>
    <li> Suuuper fine point with just the right amount of springy-ness to make sure the bristles don&#x27;t fray over time. The bristles bend just enough to give a paintbrush-like line, but stick together enough to withstand a thorough cleaning and still have a pointy tip. I use it for generic Latisse and it&#x27;s perfect. I clean it after every use and it still looks/feels like it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
    <li> I love these but I wish they lasted a bit longer. I go through a lot of them kind of frequently.</li>
    <li> Love it bc u can get exactly where u need eyeliner bc of angle!</li>
    <li> this brush has become a part of my daily routine and it never leaves my make-up bag!!! the angle of the brush allows for smooth solid lines!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for applying eyeliner, I only tried with powdered eye shadow but it works very well. The fact that it&#x27;s angled makes it easier to apply the color and as it&#x27;s so thin, you can play with the width of the line</li>
    <li> I wish the tip of the brush was a bit longer but overall good product</li>
    <li> I have been using macs gel liner for six to seven years now, I need a good eyeliner brush that will bend and isn&#x27;t stiff with gel liner. This brush is very stiff it digs into the gel liner and wont bend at al! I&#x27;ve been using the studio gear angled eyeliner brush for a while now and I cant seem to find it anymore. I read the reviews and thought this would be a pretty good brush but I wont be using it anymore. I needed a good replacement for my prior eyeliner brush and this was not it. :(  I like the color but that&#x27;s about all. The bristles are stiff and non moving and so that really messes with the eyeliner lines themselves and also trying to get the eyeliner on the brush. I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a new replacement but I really wish I hadn&#x27;t of bought this one.</li>
    <li> Overall very satisfied with purchase very cute brush sturdy design gives a smooth application with cream or gel eyeliners.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works like they say</li>
    <li> can I get a yasssss!!! Seriously best eyeliner brush I have owned!!!! You can make a bold statement with this or simply a thin eyeliner. What I love about it is creating the wing with this brush is great. Winging out the eyeliner is nothing but perfection with this brush!</li>
    <li> Best eye liner brush so far. I&#x27;ve tried four different brushes for eye liner, the flat edge, the angle edge brush, an elf brand eye liner brush, and this one. The flat and angle ones just were too thick and wide, and the elf one....hah....uneven bristles, pokey, what a mess, wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money. This one is small, but best for detail, fine line work. Wish I&#x27;d started with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how I did my eyeliner before using a brush like this!</li>
    <li> Great tool for perfect winged eyeliner! Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Makes putting on gel eyeliner a breeze with perfect results! Fast &amp; easy to use. Lasts all day without smudging.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner brush!  I have such a hard time finding good eyeliner brushes that are of good quality.  There are no &amp;#34;middle of the road&amp;#34; eyeliner brushes for me, they are either terrible or amazing.  The bristles come to a beautiful delicate point, and allow you to make the thinnest line possible with absolute precision!  They are NOT bluntly cut like some other eyeliner brushes are, I think those are pointless and difficult to use.  The arch of the ferrule makes lining the inner part of the eye a breeze, as well as making a flick.  I happen to have very long eyelashes naturally, and they actually &#x27;get in the way&#x27; sometimes when I&#x27;m trying to put on eyeliner. But with the arched ferrule, I can get right behind the lashes with no trouble.  I will keep buying from Bdellium tools, I&#x27;m excited to see what else they have!</li>
