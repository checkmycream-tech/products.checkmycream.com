<li> I was a little disappointed that it was not in a nice box instead of bubble container with tape over the top.</li>
<li> Smells a little old and on the back of the tube it says &amp;#34;not for individual sale&amp;#34; so why is it being sold individually???</li>
<li> I hurry out the door and need a little extra something.</li>
<li> was disappointed as the container was only half filled with lotion.</li>
<li> I see the ounces, but I was not aware it was so small and would come in 2 separate tubes.</li>
<li> and you don&#x27;t waste any like the spray perfume</li>
<li> The lotion perfume is less expensive than the perfume, last longer</li>
<li> Like I usually do will by again</li>
<li> The Body lotion is old because small bad (rancid).</li>
<li> less expensive then buying the perfume...</li>

    <li> I got this with a gift set, along with the perfume. I actually use the lotion more than the perfume. It is just a bit lighter and softer, and smells wonderful when combined with freshly showered skin. I use it every time I get out of the bath and reserve the spray for days I hurry out the door and need a little extra something.</li>
    <li> Product is great! Love it, smells great! But, of course, it&#x27;s Estee Lauder! I love Estee Lauder&#x27;s products, she does everything with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;greatness!</li>

    <li> Bought it as a gift to put in my moms stocking. Smells nice and lasts a long time. Quite pricey though.</li>
    <li> la crema estaba dañada y olía mal, no la vuelvo a comprar, preferible comprar en tienda para poder ver el producto</li>
