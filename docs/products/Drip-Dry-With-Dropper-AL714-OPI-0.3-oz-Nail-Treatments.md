      <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
      <li>product seems to work as advertised, however, if I had not had a dropper for something else I would not have been able to use it since it did not come WITH a dropper</li>
      <li>If you love or even like OPI, this is a must.  </li>
      <li>Would reccomend to ANYONE who does their nails :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hate waiting for nail polish to dry, and I usually become so impatient waiting for it to dry that I smudge the paint and give up.  This product helped me get the polish dry and keep my nail polish on much longer than I usually do!</li>
    <li> It does help your nails dry faster after 5 minutes, but you still need to be careful not to do anything to dramatic because it will mess up the color.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOT PERFORM AS I HOPED. IT DRIED POLISH TO TOUCH QUICKLY, BUT IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR POLISH TO DRY ALL THE WAY ! POLISH WOULD SMUDGE EVEN AFTER AN HOUR ! POLISH DRYS QUICKER WITHOUT THE DRIP DRY ! I&#x27;VE STOPPED USING IT AND I&#x27;M STUCK WITH 2 BOTTLES !</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t deny the quality of this product, love the way it treats my cuticles :P and I&#x27;m always concerned with the packages, but not  with this one, always come in one piece, not the first time that  buy them trough amazon, and hopefully not the last one :)</li>
    <li> I liked this product. It dried my nails and was very moisturizing to my nails. It does not dry them instantly but fairly quickly. I liked the dropper, it was very useful. The shipping was fast. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this and I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t do my nails without it now. It comes in a tiny bottle, but it lasts a looong time. You only need 1 drop per finger (maybe 2 for the thumb) and you can literally watch it spread across your nail, covering the entire nail in a matter of seconds. And a few seconds later, it makes your nails dry to the touch so you can move on with your life instead of sitting around waiting for polish to dry! A word of caution, though: the polish is probably still wet on the inside, especially if you&#x27;ve used several coats, so it can still smudge if you&#x27;re not careful. But this product definitely expedites the drying process.</li>
    <li> I love it! Easy to use and no more messy manicures! My daughters love it and use it every time they do their nails too!</li>
    <li> It does work somewhat but it doesn&#x27;t totally dry the nail polish and it leaves an oily substance on your fingers which you have to wash up!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AWESOME! I LEARNED ABOUT IT AT A SPA AND IT REALLY DOES WORK! JUST ONE DROP ON EACH FINGER OR TOE.</li>
    <li> used it for the first time today and i am very happy. I was still careful the first few minutes but definitely didn&#x27;t have to wait as long as i would have without it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Completely dries nail lacquer after a few minutes. I am running low and i need to reorder ASAP. Even does the job on thick polish layers. But it&#x27;s best to let it dry out for a few minutes before applying.</li>
    <li> I was amazed this stuff worked as well as it did.  It really does dry nails FAST.  Usually your nails feel dry but the first coat is still tacky, but this stuff really penetrates and seems to dry them in about 2 minutes.  Also, it&#x27;s super moisturizing on the cuticles, which is nice.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I just bought it last week, and it has worked like a charm! It dries to the touch within five minutes and completely hardens in 20-30 minutes. It&#x27;s a godsend for those of us who constantly ruin our nails with smudges and ugly indentations!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well to dry but it does smooth out polish and adds a nice shine.Nothing spectacular as a buy.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast but the bottle did not come with a dripper so no way to put on nails so disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Buy this!  This stuff is awesome!  I really wish I could give it 10 stars. It doesn&#x27;t work quite as fast as the instructions say, but the variation is probably due more to ambient temperature than the product itself.  Either way, I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this.  I polished my nails, waited about 3 or 4 minutes.  Put a couple of drops on each nail and in about 5 minutes they were completely dry to the touch.  I went to bed about 15 minutes after and NO sheet marks.  I&#x27;m so excited!  The only thing that keeps me from changing my color more often is that I never have time to wait for the polish to dry and so I end up knicking it up and having to remove it before I go some where.  THIS has solved that problem.  I&#x27;ll probably repaint my nails every few days now.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product, i use it every single time i do my nails or any of my friends nails and they  are amazed by how fast there nails dry! i highly recommend this product for anyone on the go after you do your nails!</li>
    <li> Drip Dry by OPI is the best product on the market. No more dryers in the nail salon and wasting time! Polish nails wait 5min use the dropper an drip a dot near cuticle they are dry in a few minutes..Try it!! Pricey but worth every penny..</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It does dry your nails to the touch very quickly.  I always use it when I do my manicures, but just keep in mind it really only dries the top coat that you apply. I still wait awhile for my polish to set before doing any activities because you can still mess it up!</li>
    <li> When I first saw it I thought, oh come on. But is really works.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do my nails at night so sometimes I would get a crease or two from the covers. Just when you though your nails were dry.&lt;br /&gt;Not now.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Dries my nails in a matter of minutes while moisturizing my cuticles.  Only problem I have with the product is that it is too small. I was able to do 1 drop per nail and got about 500 drops out of the bottle.  I change my polish every 2 or 3 days, so I got 3 months use out of this bottle.  But if you only do your nails once a week, this bottle will last you a whole year.  So depends on the person.  Stocked up on it while it was 4$ a bottle with free shipping.  I would advise you to do the same if you change your polish and do nail art regularly.  Very good product!</li>
    <li> THIS MAKES MY NAILS DRY IN LIKE 1 MINUTE OR LESS for cereal and I didn&#x27;t even have to wave my hands around to help it out</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for people who is not patient enough to let their nails dry! and it makes my polish last longer as well</li>
    <li> These drops work very well. Dries nail polish super fast. Good for people like me who hate sitting around doing nothing waiting for my nails to dry. One drop on each nail and 5 minutes later they&#x27;re dry enough to go on with your life. You still have to be somewhat careful but this stuff definitely makes a difference.</li>
    <li> this still needs some drying time, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker -- but if you&#x27;re in a bind, it is better than not doing anything.  It was an okay price, if it was costly, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but it&#x27;s not the sellers fault.  It just works okay.</li>
    <li> bought it for my wife, she is always harassing me to get it and apparently it dries her nails super fast and clean. small little bottle lasts a little while (depending on how much you paint your nails) and all around good product since this is my third time buying it :)</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and decided to get it. So glad I did because the product dries my nail nicely.</li>
    <li> AWESOME. if you paint your own nails a lot, it&#x27;s a must have! Just a couple drops and in 10 minutes you&#x27;re good to go</li>
    <li> THE VERY BEST!!!! i loooove opi and all their product.. put it on.. 1 minute and you can touch it. give it 5 minutes and your nails are completely dry!! love love love love!!!</li>
    <li> This makes my manicure dry in the quickest time, I can apply the nail polish at night a few hours before going to bed, and in the morning I have none of the &#x27;sheet marks&#x27; I usually get  if I don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!  It dries my nails so quickly and doesn&#x27;t require that I paint it on my nails, just a few drops on each one and it dries right away!</li>
    <li> it says about 5 mins, but i have been waiting for like 10 mins or more just for my nails to dry...</li>
    <li> works great, drys nail in super fast time.  great when you are in a rush to go out on the time and when you need a repair on the polish</li>
    <li> Works great!! Highly recommend dries fast and looks like a professional did my nails, not me! If ur thinking about getting this, just do it!!</li>
    <li> Where has this dryer been all this time? Works great but I did allow for 2 minutes self drying time for my polish though, then I applied this. No smudges and I&#x27;ll def by again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!!! I bought it last week and it leaves your nails dry in about 2 minutes!! really helpful!!!</li>
    <li> very small&lt;br /&gt;even smaller that i thought&lt;br /&gt;it works good on the surface but it doens&#x27;t work inside that good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when you apply it dries the outside quick</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter who changes her nail color nearly every day - she loves these drops as they shorten the drying time to just a few minutes compared to 10-15.</li>
    <li> It does what it claims and that is drying the nails fast.  I won&#x27;t do manicures without it. Love it</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that helps your nail polish to dry within minutes of application.  I wouldn&#x27;t do my nails without it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. You drip one drop on painted nail and polish is really dry in a flash.  It really works as you would like.</li>
    <li> OMG I am never painting my nails without this again! I have used a UV light before, but for some reason, it make my nail polish have bubbles in it. The OPI Drip Dry drops work exactly as stated on the directions. I use two drops on my nails and within minutes, they are completely dry. I now, never have smudges or marks from accidentally hitting my nails on something before they&#x27;re dry. LOVE&amp;#60; LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Yes it dried but not super fast and it would cause my nail polish to chip faster and it was super expensive...not worth it!</li>
    <li> This was an awesome product, don&#x27;t regret buying this. Serves It&#x27;s purpose, dries your nails in 5 mins! Will never do my nails without this ever again. Even bought the 4oz bottle after this one was empty I loved it so much. :)</li>
    <li> I was in the middle of getting a mani pedi and got a call to come out on a date. With no time to wait for polish to dry I whipped out the Drip Dry and gave it a try for the first time. My manicurist was amazeded and called others over to see and feel my nails. I was still careful out of habit but was able to get to my car and destination without any dents or dings on in my polish.</li>
    <li> This stuff reminds me of the quick dry spray they use in many salons. I love how it conditions my fingers after having been put through the ringer with polish remover, trimming cuticles and sides, filing and buffing, and then back to polish remover with the clean up. Will be buying a larger bottle next go-round.</li>
    <li> This works wonders ! Especially for someone like myself who cannot stay still after painting my nails. Granted it don&#x27;t FULLY dry the nails but with the combo of this and a nice drying fan they will be hard as a rock</li>
    <li> Love this! Dries nails immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to everyone who loves doing there nails and hate having to wait forever to dry!</li>
    <li> Works great with in a few short minutes your nails are completely dry. It saves me a lot of redo&#x27;s I am so impatient when waiting for my polish to dry. Love it</li>
    <li> These make your nails dry so quickly! I don&#x27;t know how I have gone this long without it. A drop or two will do, so it lasts a really long time. I even bought one for a friend.</li>
    <li> The drip dry works perfectly. As soon as I finish painting my nails, I wait about a minute or two then put the drip dry on my nails. It drys my nails almost instantly, and when I go to bed I don&#x27;t wake up with random marks on my nails. They&#x27;re still painted nicely and shiny :) this product also arrived sooner thane specter and was wrapped in protective packaging so that the bottle doesn&#x27;t break. I would definitely recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Works great but you still need to be careful becasue your polish will dent and smudge still but it makes it dry to the touch.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product through a tutorial I found by mistake on youtube! SO glad I found this! It arrived in about 3 days &amp; I tried it just last night. I didn&#x27;t time the duration it took for everything to dry, but it was definitely under 10 minutes. I usually do my nails about 2 hours before I go to bed, but usually get those gross wrinkly marks from the sheets &amp; from tossing around. I woke up this morning &amp; my nails are wrinkle/smudge free &amp; SO shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint: the bottle leaked a little in the package :/ but I easily cleaned everything up with a paper towel. Left my hands feeling super soft :)</li>
    <li> I think It works pretty good. I sometimes would stick my hand in the freezer while it was applied just to make sure it got hard. Sadly I only got to use it twice before my little sister dumbed the whole thing out but I do plan on getting more:)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I am accident prone when painting my nails and when I read OPI had a quick dry solution I checked it out.  If you love or even like OPI, this is a must.  Now I can only get a manicure when I need it. I can paint my own nails and get them dry!  In the end it actually saved me money.</li>
    <li> I love these drops, especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry. But please, make sure you put a base coat or clear coat on top of your natural, clean nail and let it COMPLETELY dry, before painting and using these on any additional layers of polish. I also recommend a good cuticle cream, and proper nail maintenance, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not have a nice coat of completely dry base, your natural nails will dry out and become brittle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, like I said, these are totally awesome.</li>
    <li> the drip drop did a pretty good job at drying the polish on my nails, but I was hoping for a rock hard nail which I guess I&#x27;m being unreasonable. Good product</li>
    <li> THE SALON USED THIS PRODUCT ON ME WHEN I WENT IN FOR A MANI PEDI. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS PRODUCT BEFORE BUT ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. IT REALLY WORKS TO DRY YOUR POLISH INSTANTLY. WILL DEFINATELY BE ORDERING MORE!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves it. thanks for the great price and great product. it works well</li>
    <li> The item was as described and arrived on time without any problems! I would definitely recommend this product and this seller! This was bought for a friend of mine that constantly does her nails, and she loves it! She&#x27;s a big fan of OPI, and this top oat really does dry your nails super fast!</li>
    <li> Drip Dry With Dropper is the best.  One drop and your nails dry through all of the layers of polish. I always use OPI because I think it works the best.</li>
    <li> I love this. My nail tech used it so I could dash out the door after a polish... and it dried so fast! I was so happy and I liked it so much I bought it for myself. Its so easy... just fill the dropper and drip onto each nail. Give it a minute and go!</li>
    <li> This works fabulously, highly recommended.  Cuts dry time down to about 5 minutes.  Saves me time and the money I would spend to buy a quick dry at the salon.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work on my nails. They feel dry at first, but they are still wet and soft (easily messes up the nail polish when touched). I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, nor will I use the bottle I bought. Came very quickly though. No issues with the seller.</li>
    <li> At little goes a long way and I like this product a lot - it does what it says it is going to do.  I would not do the dishes after just polishing my nails but it helps out a lot to set the polish.  Great price too on Amazon....</li>
    <li> I have purchase this many times. Best on market really work in minutes no smudge and your on your way, This a keeper in my polish box. I even bring this to the nail shop with me and request they put this on. And I am on my way.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know WHERE I&#x27;ve been but I heard about OPI Drip Dry a few months ago and decided to order it after seeing rave reviews. I wrote a review on my blog ([...]) and here is an excerpt from it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and think the price is on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: I love the packaging. The dropper is such a great idea and makes this very simple to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How It Works: It&#x27;s very easy and doesn&#x27;t take much effort at all. You just use the dropper to drop 1-2 drops on each nail after painting it. Wait a minute or two, and it&#x27;s dry to the touch and you can go about your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: This product does exactly what it says it will do. I usually do two coats and a top coat. I use the dropper and apply one drop (two drops to my thumbs) to each nail after each coat. I wait a little over a minute and it&#x27;s dry to the touch. No fanning, no nail dryers, nothing. Just this product. I tend to paint my nails after I take a shower, right before bed, and I used to have the problem of messing up my nails because I&#x27;d go to sleep thinking my polish was dry enough, and wake up with smears and marks all over my nails. So annoying. After using this however, I woke up with perfect nails, looking exactly how they had the night before. It has no scent and I&#x27;ve noticed that it actually moisturizes my cuticles. Another cool thing about OPI Drip Dry is that if you accidentally have a bump or little lump on your nail from uneven brush strokes, it will smooth it out. It gives a perfect salon finish every time. I give this 5/5 stars and will definitely be repurchasing this. I would recommend this to everyone that paints their nails and doesn&#x27;t want to wait 30 minutes for them to dry completely. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who HATES doing my nails because I feel like I have to set aside a large chunk of my time just to do them without messing them up before they&#x27;re fully dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have FINALLY found a solution that makes painting my nails quick (20 mins), easy and almost fool-proof. The dropper that comes with the drip dry helps me add a quick dry to my nails without giving me the chance to mess them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. One coat of OPI Natural Nail Base Coat [[ASIN:B004B3YC9M OPI Natural Nail Base Coat &amp; Top Coat COMBO FULL SIZE .5]]&lt;br /&gt;2. Two coats of OPI color of your choice (mine: Bubble Bath, a beautiful nude) [[ASIN:B000NG889Q Opi Nail Lacquer, Bubble Bath, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;3. One coat of OPI Natural Nail Top Coat [[ASIN:B004B3YC9M OPI Natural Nail Base Coat &amp; Top Coat COMBO FULL SIZE .5]]&lt;br /&gt;4. Two drops of OPI Drip Dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use all OPI products which glide on smooth and dry consistent (even with the lack of my nail painting experience). Honestly, I did my nails myself and think they came out better than the last time I went to the salon. I am thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t painted my nails and used my hands in a rough way or gone to sleep immediately after. I&#x27;m not sitting with my hands under a UV light, and I&#x27;m not expecting to push on my nails right after applying this stuff. I have painted my nails and then drove my car and ran errands without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are great and make my &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; manicures awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;They work really well and make things so much easier.</li>
    <li> I love this nail treatment!  I can polish and then put on the tennis shoes and go for a walk.  I highly recommend.  Use generously and enjoy the super fast drying!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. And always find myself ordering more. This really works and dries your nails instantly. I carry it with me to the nails salon every time and/or use myself when I do at home manicures.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly. But do give it time to dry and wait a few minutes to set, or you will be upset and think that it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was a recommendation from a friend....Best recommendation ever, lol. Follow the directions and you cannot go wrong, I always give myself extra time to dry my nails because they will be dry but not hard and still have the ability to smudge.</li>
    <li> Dries your nails in seconds!  I&#x27;m the one that always messes up a manicure, with this product I have yet to mess my polish after a manicure.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> DRIP DRY IS ABSOULETLY PERFECT IN EVERY WAY POSSABLE , IT SPEED UP THE DRYING TIME , MAKE IT TASKE A BREAZE :) LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> It dries super fast, within 1-2 minutes you can touch the nailpolish. I takes about 30 more minutes till you don&#x27;t be getting any dents though. I read reviews about seche vite and people are complaining about polish shrinkage. NO shrinkage at all with this product. Here I am buying my second bottle</li>
    <li> wish i knew about this sooner! I hate waiting for my polish to dry and this stuff cuts the time down to a mere 20 30 mins tops</li>
    <li> i change my color all the time, and i&#x27;m not that patient to make my nail dry. Though, you have to give enough time to dry your color all the day inside. it only dry your surface of it.</li>
    <li> I came across this stuff when i was getting my nails done at a salon(which i hardly ever do). I usually do them myself so this was a wonderful find and really helps to dry the nails.</li>
    <li> This works great!  I love that I can polish my nails, apply this and have my nails usable quicker than usual.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Works very fast.  No mess.  I really love this product and will continue to use it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions but still got dents in my polish. It makes them dry to the touch quicker, but what good is that if you can still get dents in them. Not sure there are really miracle drops that dry your nails.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product. Was used in a spa so I decided to try it. Glad I did. I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will.  Great product! First time I don&#x27;t end up with lines in my polish from going to bed.</li>
    <li> I already knew it would work because i&#x27;ve used it at the salon. It helps not having to wait around for my nails to dry completely, only to having it smudge. It keeps the shine on, and i loved this product so much i just might have to get a new one soon haha.</li>
    <li> This product works great it is very fast and quick drying.. I love it.. Highly recommend..&lt;br /&gt;Def. A must buy especially if you hate waiting for polish to dry.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know the aloe of this product. Not sure what it does other than make my polish thicker. Not going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> product seems to work as advertised, however, if I had not had a dropper for something else I would not have been able to use it since it did not come WITH a dropper AS STATED</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. Don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve never heard of it before. It really does work in seconds. I wouldn&#x27;t go dig in the garden right after using it, but it prevents little dents and dings until the polish underneath is really dry. It also gives the nails a nice, glossy finish!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, and having used it in the past, I knew it was a decent nail drying product. When it got here, I was very disappointed to find it EMPTY.  Yes, it was dry as a bone.  There was none inside the package, like it had leaked out or anything. Since I&#x27;m not allowed (by Amazon&#x27;s rules) to comment on the seller, let me just say I will not order this product from this company again.</li>
    <li> dries nail polish quickly, the only negative is it takes way shine from the top coat i noticed when i use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using OPI&#x27;s nail polish drying drops for years and this is the best you can find on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I have a toddler and may nails are literally dry in minutes and I can go play with the kid or do chores around the house.&lt;br /&gt;And they last a long time!</li>
    <li> Typically after I do my nails I have to sit there for 30 minutes making sure that they are completely dry and aren&#x27;t tacky. And as I&#x27;m sure everyone does, I start fanning my hands around to try to get them to dry quicker. Not anymore with Drip Dry! This product is awesome. After doing my nails, I just have to wait 5 minutes after I put this on and my nails are completely dry and I don&#x27;t have to worry about me messing them up! This product is a timesaver!</li>
    <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>
    <li> Love using Drip Dry on my nails.  Does what it says.  I like the bottle even though it&#x27;s a little bit hard to get the very last drops out. Not impossible though. Wound up adding the last of it to my new bottle.  Would continue purchasing.</li>
    <li> It works AMAZINGLY! Just like it says. It dries your polish to touch in about 2 minutes, and all the way through in about 30 at the most... I always wait longer just to make sure. It was SO helpful doing layers... to help dry them faster. AMAZING! Would reccomend to ANYONE who does their nails :)</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! My nails are dry within 5 minutes. Normally they take hours to dry. I will never paint my nails again without it.</li>
