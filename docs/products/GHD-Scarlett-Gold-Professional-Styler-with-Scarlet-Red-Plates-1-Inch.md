      <li>I love ghd....</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>The Shipping was very fast (which was good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite amazed that Amazon don&#x27;t have checks and balances in place to make sure everything &amp;#34;sold by Amazon&amp;#34; is the genuine article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As far as operation, works great and heats up fast--same quality you&#x27;d expect from ghd Gold Series.</li>
      <li>Even my husband thought it was cool!</li>
      <li>I have a medium amount of wavey fine hair</li>
      <li>The ghd heats up so quickly and I can straighten my unruly curly hair in no time!  </li>
      <li>The auto shut off is a huge plus.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Suspicions were confirmed when I couldn&#x27;t find the hologram code/label required to fulfil the product registration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>things after almost one year of problem free use.</li>
      <li>The light would flicker a lot</li>
      <li>I love how fast the iron heats up!</li>
      <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>So worth the price!</li>
      <li>It looks great and the build quality seems OK, but it just doesn&#x27;t produce enough heat for her to get ready on time.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I recieved it, but when I tried it, my hair was getting inside the plates and ripping.</li>
      <li>heats up quickly and leaves hair sleek and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Heated up super fast!!!</li>
      <li>Overall, great price on Amazon and more sturdy than most you will find at local stores.  </li>
      <li>Was told to either return the item for a full refund or replacement.  </li>
      <li>Her brand was GHD, which I had never heard of before because I usually use relatively cheap irons or borrow my friends&#x27; CHI irons (which always seemed nice), but I instantly could tell hers was awesome.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s much more gentle on the hair because somehow it straightens without frying.  </li>
      <li>The true test was how well it works, putting my Chi to shame.  </li>
      <li>(that took me to the real GHD website) but the authentic hologram and manufacturer&#x27;s date</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE this straightener. I really like all the accesories too. The only thing is, I wish it had a temperature option. You have either &#x27;off&#x27; or &#x27;fry&#x27; ... which isn&#x27;t the best for your hair.</li>
    <li> i have owned several straighteners, but I travel between several different voltages all the time and it was necessary to buy a straighter for ENgland... Ireland... Singapore..hong kong... etc... So i was in London and I got one, and it was expensive!!! but I used it for a month in Ireland and I came back to California and I bought another when i came back, and all i will use is GHD</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair straightner that I have ever used. When compared to the fhi and chi, I would much prefer my ghd. The ghd heats up so quickly and I can straighten my unruly curly hair in no time!  I love the classy red and everything that is included with the collection. Once you go ghd you ever turn back :)</li>
    <li> I BELIEVE THAT IT IS OVER PRICED AND OVERATED. THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT IT HEATS UP FAST, OTHER WISE I REALLY LIKE IT. THIS WAS PURCHASED AND COMMENTED ON BY MY WIFE</li>
    <li> If you want to give a gift to a young girl that straightens that will impress, this one is it!  I&#x27;m a stylist and this iron is worth every penny.  The price is a little high for a flat iron, but you pay for the silk case that comes with it too.</li>
    <li> Chips in the red ceramic plates and it had no hologram which means it&#x27;s not authentic GHD.  Amazon refunded my money, it&#x27;s nothing against Amazon..........it wasn&#x27;t their fault and they were more than helpful and apologetic.</li>
    <li> My girls love this thing.</li>
    <li> I love this product, style, color, bag and hairpins. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this flat iron. Everything working good. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener I ever owned. Heated up super fast!!! and took like 2 strokes to have my hair glossy and straight. Well worth the money. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the thermal mat that came with it doesn&#x27;t really hold up well when travelling. The zipper broke when I travelled with it. Other than that, its a fabulous buy and I&#x27;ve been using 2 years with no issue!</li>
    <li> GHD is one of the best hair straightners out there! This made a great gift! i would reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> When I received this package I was soooo excited to open ittt and the box and heat protected case is so beautiful.  At first, I felt like this hair straightener might have been cheapy because the straightener isn&#x27;t as heavy as my previous hair straightener (turbo chi) but then I used it and I&#x27;m in love.  The straightener is really cute, I feel like it made my hair shinier and softer than usual and pretty straight.  My hair is naturally wavy, really long, coarse and thick but it didn&#x27;t take long to straighten it.  I don&#x27;t know if this straightener is meant for thick/coarse hair but it did a good job.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery! I am very happy with my new straightener. I am so happy I was able to register it on ghd.com to get the manufactures warranty.</li>
    <li> I got it for my daughter for Christmas. She likes her $30 one better. This one doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. It looks great and the build quality seems OK, but it just doesn&#x27;t produce enough heat for her to get ready on time.</li>
    <li> Good iron with useful travel items included to pack away soon after use. Like other GHD irons look after it &amp; its a reliable product that performs well.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was an amazing deal. I have a medium amount of wavey fine hair and I love trying new styles. This product has become my backup. I also tried the HTC which is smoother on your hair. To be honest the best deal is the Remington. It&#x27;s cheaper, ceramic and heats put to 450. I have that for 2+yrs.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of use, it stopped working.  I have owned other GHD irons and never had this problem.  I highly suggest registering your GHD through their web site so if you have problems you can return.  I am in the process of mailing this one back to GHD for a replacement hopefully.  I will update later.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with GHD flat irons about 3 years ago and so when my old one died (at 5:30 am as I was trying to get ready for a trip), I was crestfallen... until I saw this one.  This gorgeous GHD flat iron is just as wonderful as the original, only more beautiful!  Love the case (heat resistant, very nice for business travel when you have to toss it into your bag hot), love the color, and of course, love the results.  Seller shipped the product very fast, but also required signature confirmation of delivery which was a bit inconvenient - would have liked the option to decline signature confirmation of delivery.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to buy a ghd on amazon after reading that a lot of people received a fake. If I didn&#x27;t have amazon gift cards I would have waited and bought a ghd directly from their website...at the time they had an awesome sale. I took my chances, bought it, and chose  &amp;#34;Amazon.com&amp;#34; as the seller.  Once I received the flat iron, I immediately registered it on the ghd website.  I was a &amp;#34;chosen one&amp;#34;! I received an authentic ghd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron works splendidly! It glides effortlessly through my hair with no pulling or tugging.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my old ghd IV pink styler, but my hair stays however I style it with the iron (straight or curly) all day.  I have thick, wavy hair and live in the humid south so that is quite an accomplishment.  I love how fast the iron heats up! I&#x27;ll turn it on and start sectioning my hair in clips.  Before I&#x27;m done putting my hair up, the ghd is ready to go! The auto shut off is a huge plus.  The red bag is adorable and oh so useful when traveling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Hands down the BEST flat iron I have ever owned.  This was recommended by my hairdresser cousin and I was not disappointed. The packaging is beautiful, and it straightens my very thick, very wavy hair in one pass.</li>
    <li> Takes about 5 seconds to fully heat up and keeps my hair pin straight for days. If you don&#x27;t keep your hair sections small and fully on the plates, then it causes a lot of breakage. That&#x27;s my only complaint. Love the case that comes with it! Red is my favorite color so it was perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I hoped I would get the genuine product after reading most of the warnings from various customers below.  I got it and one look at the packaging, I instantly had a bad feeling I might have received a counterfeit ghd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspicions were confirmed when I couldn&#x27;t find the hologram code/label required to fulfil the product registration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That blows because it being so expensive, I&#x27;m just not comfortable without getting the real deal.  I&#x27;m quite amazed that Amazon don&#x27;t have checks and balances in place to make sure everything &amp;#34;sold by Amazon&amp;#34; is the genuine article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, sending it back and getting a refund.  Sometimes, I guess it&#x27;s worth paying a little extra elsewhere at a Planet Beauty or something so you know you&#x27;re getting the real thing :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh....</li>
    <li> heats up quickly and leaves hair sleek and smooth.  By far the BEST iron I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived, I registered it with no problem and looked for all the tell tale signs and there&#x27;s no question it&#x27;s authentic (purchased directly from Amazon). The true test was how well it works, putting my Chi to shame.  With the Chi, I could never get my hair perfectly straight . . .it always seemed like 80s hair poufy sort of.  Using the ghd, my hair is perfectly straight and for most of my head, only one pass was necessary.  I tried it last night when I got it and its still straight.  A counterfeit simply wouldn&#x27;t work as well because materials used would be inferior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while its likely GHD won&#x27;t honor the two year warranty should something go wrong, because it wasn&#x27;t purchased through an authorized dealer . . .I&#x27;m willing to take that risk at a HUGE discount.  It&#x27;s a gamble, I know . . .but considering I paid far less than retail, why should GHD honor a warranty I didn&#x27;t pay for because its built into the retail price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product, in fact . . .love it so much, I purchased a second for my daughter.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is 100% legit GHD.  I was able to register it on their website and have the 2 yr warranty.  Also, it is awesome.  I previously had a knock-off Chi, and this iron is in a totally other realm.  It heats up super fast, it straightens amazingly well in no time, and it actually doesn&#x27;t get that hot even though it produces amazing results.  So it&#x27;s much more gentle on the hair because somehow it straightens without frying.  I am so glad I bought it and also so glad I didn&#x27;t pay over $200 for it! I was wary buying it since it was so much less than the normal price, but it is the real deal and I saved about $125!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect straightener for any kind of hair! I&#x27;ve stuck with cheap straighteners all my life, but finally decided to upgrade to a ghd! So worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have very long and very thick hair. With any other flat iron it takes me anywhere from 1 1/2-2 hours to straighten my hair. I was amazed that with this flat iron it took 30 minutes! Fantastic!</li>
    <li> it is the best. I tried hundreds kind of straightener but this one is amazing&lt;br /&gt;very happy to say that</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on these and I finally picked this GHD.  I was very worried about authenticity after reading some bad reviews so I made sure to buy from &amp;#34;sold/shipped by Amazon&amp;#34; and everything is great!  Registered my product the moment I got it and it is legit!</li>
    <li> I freaking love this device. I have very long hair and it&#x27;s quite wavy. I can straighten my hair with in 30 - 45 minutes. Perfect for traveling and it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous!</li>
    <li> I went from a Chi to this flat iron.  I cannot tell much of a difference.  I really don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as some flat irons out there.  I do love the auto shut off feature and it heats up extremely fast.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. She told me it just glides through her hair and smooths it nicely.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine directly through Amazon and I&#x27;m happy to report that my straightener is authentic. I registered it on the ghd website with no problem. My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years. Very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a too good to be true price.  After reading the reviews from previous customers I decided that they may be legit.  After TWO WEEKS of having this flat iron, the ceramic plating chipped.  I know that it wasn&#x27;t anything that I did because I put it away after every use and used the protective cap.  I got on the GHD website to be informed that my product is NOT authentic.  I then contacted this seller(asapbeauty)and even forwarded a screen shot of what ghd.com was telling me.  I was told that all of their products are proven authentic and they even have a GHD employee on their payroll.  Was told to either return the item for a full refund or replacement.  So naturally I returned the item and was promised a new one.  I was even told that my replacement was \\&quot;sitting right here on my desk\\&quot; and would be shipped once he/she got confirmation that the one I sent was received.  Finally after 2 weeks, I get my replacement (this morning) and open it to find that it IS THE EXACT ONE I RETURNED.  This is just ridiculous!  I am so overwhelmed with anger about this.  Whether it is a \\&quot;good deal\\&quot; or not, $150 is a lot of money to pay for a flat iron.  I contacted the seller this morning and haven&#x27;t heard anything back as of right now.</li>
    <li> Caution! This product works so well, everyone will want to borrow yours.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my wife, now my daughter and two nieces ask to borrow it every time they visit.</li>
    <li> This scarlet was beautiful, I was excited when I saw it!... But!! It was such a regret going for looks!... It crimped my hair! Left it nappy! Nothing smooth like my Sedu! Sadly paid for return, for trying a new 1, &amp; just ordered my Sedu! I&#x27;ll stick to what I know works next time!! Curiosity cost more!</li>
    <li> I love it! So amazing so glad I purchased this product. Doesn&#x27;t snag my hair it does get a bit hot when trying to style and burns my fingers but it does a great job</li>
    <li> I just bought it a week or 2 ago from here, it&#x27;s not good at all! Maybe if you have very thin ALREADY straight hair then yeah, but if you have thick hair and naturally wavy..then its not for you. I was so excited when I recieved it, but when I tried it, my hair was getting inside the plates and ripping. I&#x27;m not sure if the flat iron is supposed to be like that or if the one I recieved from here is fake. Another issue is that there is only one setting that you can keep on. VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> I had a GHD flat iron for the past 5 years, and it still works well, but i had a lower end ghd. I could tell a huge difference in the flat iron when my mom purchased this exact one a couple years ago when they were first introduced. I finally found it here on amazon for a much lower price! Works amazing and keeps my hair smooth all day, even in humid weather!</li>
    <li> My stylist swears by GHD and when my old flat iron died I was devastated to miss a big sale on the premium brand, GHD at a premium discount. I got on Amazon right away and scored the next best thing: this GHD Scarlett Gold Professional Styler. I chose the model based on the competitive price and didn&#x27;t read the other reviews until I ordered it. I got a bit nervous over the next couple of days as I began to worry I had paid a lot of money for a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I found not only the registration information card inside (that took me to the real GHD website) but the authentic hologram and manufacturer&#x27;s date stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After registering, I was thanked for registering and informed &amp;#34;You are now a chosen one.&amp;#34; Sigh of relief! In response to the other reviews that say it does not get hot enough for thick or curly hair, that may be true; however, is not the result of the authenticity of this particular item. I have blonde, thin, fine hair and am quickly getting spoiled rotten by my new styler. Its awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a sleek sexy styler that is every bit as genuine as the one my stylist uses when I visit her private salon. Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned A LOT of straighteners at every price point and this by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used (even better than the ones used at my high-end ultra luxe salon). I straighten my hair everyday, and this has cut the time I need to spend with the straightening iron in half. As a result, my hair has never been softer or shinier.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that it didn&#x27;t have variable temp setting, but found the temperature was pretty good so really no complaints. The plates are like silk- they never snag or stick. It is everything I was looking for in a styling tool and exceeded my expectations. It heats up in 15-20 seconds and beeps at you to let you know it&#x27;s ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about a month, so I can&#x27;t comment on its longevity. I&#x27;m rough on my straighteners so usually expect a good one to last 2-4 years depending on how often i accidentally leave it on. This one has an auto-shutoff so it should last in the 3-4 year range, but I&#x27;ll have to wait and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9 months later, it&#x27;s still running strong. I took it to France and it seemed to work fine at the higher voltage like the product specs says it should. However after testing it I opted to use a voltage converter just in case. It still heats up really fast, but seems like it&#x27;s slowed down a little, it&#x27;s in the 20-30 second range now. I still highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with some trepidation after reading about buyers receiving counterfeit stylers.  I ordered this from Amazon and registered on ghd&#x27;s website with no issues.  One note--ghd website said the hologram code is on the safety notice wrapped around the cord--I actually found it on the iron itself, across from the on/off switch, so don&#x27;t panic if you don&#x27;t see it on the notice.  As far as operation, works great and heats up fast--same quality you&#x27;d expect from ghd Gold Series.</li>
    <li> It worked well , but replaced as need higher temperature for quicker results for my thick wavy hair. I was still utilizing the heat resistant mat but horrified to find that when I moved to a new home recently my mat instead of protecting surface somehow permanently left large pink stain on white/grey granite and has stained my drawer as well. Unsure what made the silky fabric&lt;br /&gt;stain things after almost one year of problem free use.</li>
    <li> I had an older version ghd flat Iron, I believe it was a 3.2. But I had it for about 4-5 years (which is a super long time for a flat iron) and it just recently started giving out on me. The light would flicker a lot and sometimes I would have to tap it to get it to turn on. Anyways though, I decided it was time for a replacement. After lots of browsing the internet and figuring out which ones are fakes and which ones are real I decided to go with the Scarlet collection limited edition flat Iron. Which I&#x27;m glad I did! The Shipping was very fast (which was good cause I didn&#x27;t know how much time I had left with my old one) and it arrived it great condition! The red case is beautiful! Even my husband thought it was cool! It&#x27;s so much better then my old one, completely different design. I absolutely love ghd and I will not buy any other brand.</li>
    <li> So I went to Europe this summer and while I was in a hostel, my converter broke and I had to borrow my roommate&#x27;s straightener for a night. Her brand was GHD, which I had never heard of before because I usually use relatively cheap irons or borrow my friends&#x27; CHI irons (which always seemed nice), but I instantly could tell hers was awesome. I took note of the brand  and when I got home I had to order one of these for myself and although it&#x27;s a different iron (she had a small travel one), it&#x27;s just as amazing. It was like finding a long lost love. After 10 years of all kinds of irons and brands, I have finally found one that is for me. It heats up fast, it doesn&#x27;t pull out hair in its edges, it doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers (since some leave too big of a gap between panels when you try to curl), and my hair is shiny and sleek in no time (no need to run over some areas twice). This one doesn&#x27;t have different heat settings, but I usually just set mine to a temperature (around 350 degrees) and never change it, so this one is fine for my full medium thickness wavy hair. I would at least recommend finding a GHD iron if you want one with more heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red case is very fancy looking and has a separator within the pouch to divide the iron and the cord. It shipped \\&quot;faster than expected\\&quot; and was at my door the day after I ordered it. Very impressed and happy with the service and product!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to GHD flat irons in an Aveda salon and decided to get one for myself.  I love the look of the red SCARLET GHD iron.  I like the fact that it has its own heat setting, so I won&#x27;t fry my hair by turning up the temp. I am somewhat disappointed that the iron did not work as well as it did in the salon, but I&#x27;m sure it could be \\&quot;user\\&quot; error.  I will look into getting the same Aveda products that were put in my hair to see if I get better results.  Overall, great price on Amazon and more sturdy than most you will find at local stores.  I also love the case the iron came in.</li>
    <li> I WAS READING ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT FAKE GHD&#x27;S. AND IT MADE ME QUESTION IF MINE WAS REAL. I WENT ON THE GHD SITE AND I TRIED TO REGISTER THE DATE CODE AND HOLOGRAM CODE. IT DID&#x27;NT GO THROUGH. BUT I RECIEVED A CONFORMATION FROM GHD THAT IT DID. I EMAILED GHD AND ASKED ABOUT IT. AND THEY TOLD ME IF I BOUGHT MY GHD FROM AN UN AUTHORIZED SELLER THE WARRANTY WOULD NOT COVER. BUT OH WELL. I LOVE MY GHD SCARLETT. IT DOES WONDERS FOR MY HAIR. :)</li>
    <li> i love my new flat iron. I am a stylist and this was a great deal plus the product works wonderfully-much better than other flat irons i&#x27;ve tried in the past. It arrived quickly and in great shape!</li>
    <li> Ordered this January 2013. I contacted the manufactuer to register for warranty but, they informed me they will not warranty the item becasue they suspect that it is a counterfeit item. Very disappointed. The item looked great and felt sturdy but, at that price, I need to be sure it&#x27;s warrantied. I have returned the item.</li>
    <li> I love ghd....they have yet to disappoint me...I own a hair salon and use only ghd in them...and have bought this as gifts and everyone brags about how great they r...I would recommend to everyone ...</li>
