<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great tools for manicure but took long to recieve</li>
    <li> The brushes i recieved are sturdy and made well. They are shorter, which makes them easier to store, as opposed to the longer brushes i have for my acrylics. The bristles are uniform. They do not fall out, even when pulled on. When used, the brushes performed to my expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try and be more crafty doing my nails. It works well when I do gel pots or glitter. It really sucks doing french tip though, a make up brush works much better! Not bad for the price though.</li>
    <li> I always get nail polish around the edges and those stupid pens never work. I felt like I was a real nail tech using these to get nail polish off. Before using these brushes I would only get manicures at salons because mine would turn out super messy. Thanks to these brushes my nails can look like I went to the salon.  Great purchase  especially for new moms that are used to going to the nail salon but with a new baby has to result to doing her own nails ( that would be me!).</li>
    <li> I use these brushes to remove any polish I may get around my cuticles. I just dip them in acetone and wipe it away. Works well on my gel polish.</li>
    <li> Great brushes I really like them</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, they havent fallen apart on me yet and ive had them almost a month and used them about 4 times. It&#x27;s good quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Purchased these and on first use the metal tip of the brush (part holding the hair) came off the handle. Grabbed another brush and it did it to that as well. Literally all but one tip has fallen off! also the hairs on the brush are cut bad and spread out making it hard to control the gel. This product is also mis advertised. I never received the free gel or nail tape. Now needing to look for better brushes</li>

    <li> perfect size brushes,I will recommended them to others..</li>
    <li> No glitter or nail tape with package. One tip has come off, and I haven&#x27;t even used that brush yet! The brush I have used seems to be doing fine, but I&#x27;ve only used it to remove polish - not to apply.</li>
    <li> I didnt recive the nail tape</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for gel nails or nail art. It was a good deal with the included glitter. The glitter I received was gold.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price</li>
    <li> Great set for the price. Would recommend it. Love the glitter and the color it came with. Bruches are good quality.</li>
    <li> Everything looked fine and then I opened the package. First, one of the brushes fell apart then when I started using the brush I needed, and the bristles started falling out on the first nail! I will use them but am very dissapointed with them.</li>
    <li> nice to have for cleanup!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve had no problems with these brushes.  Applying gel was very easy with these brushes.  So Glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> The glue that holds the metal end with the brush on it comes away from the pink plastic area quickly and you&#x27;re left with a a TINY brush.  I&#x27;ve tried to glue them back together with different types of glue...nothing works!  The brushes themselves are just ok and I&#x27;ll be purchasing something else</li>
    <li> If you are practicing how to do gel tips.... use these brushes for learning... its great for all size fingers...</li>
    <li> Cute and they don&#x27;t shed</li>
    <li> By the looks of the picture, there should be two slimmer brushes and this isnt the case. All 7 brushes are flat and look almost the same. The package the brushes came in was completely destroyed (which wasnt necessarily the sellers fault). The Title of the product says &amp;#34;with Bonus Glitter and Tape&amp;#34;, my package did not contain either. They will work but a little disappointed.</li>
