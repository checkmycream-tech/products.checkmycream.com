      <li>Wild Yam per my Doctor is very close to estrogen that is why it works.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Wild yam cream/gel has helped me with nightsweats, PMS, anxiety, and even lengthened my cycle which had shortened in the last year.</li>
      <li>That is a problem for a lot of us, since we are using the Wild Yam to balance the estrogen (in other words we have too much in the body, and not enough progesterone to keep it in check).  </li>
      <li>Funny how a little dollop of yam gel makes all the difference!</li>

<li> With that said, it could have been worse.  </li>

    <li> I use this in conjunction with Meno Herbs with wild yams.  This is an excellent product.  Also a healthy alternative to prescription medicine.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference using this product so wil lnot purchase again.</li>
    <li> I go through intense hot flashes up to 4 times an hour.  The medical hormones are $450.00 a month wild Yam works for $20 a month.  I have tried numerous herbal remedies and nothing helped. This is a Great Company every tube I have purchased has been the same. US herbal remedies are not regulated. If your herbs are not working as they should try buying one packaged in England,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild yam gel takes about 4 to 5 days to work completely and stops my hot flashes and mood swings for $20 a month.  Wild Yam per my Doctor is very close to estrogen that is why it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tablets never worked for me</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed!  I feel like my old self again! No more hot flashes…no more mood swings.</li>

Giving it a 3 because of that...but when a company slips a bad guy into the mixture and does not give warning, then it throws up all kinds of red flags for their ethics in general.  Do your own research.  Don&#x27;t trust what I have found so far, thats what I am doing before I give it up for a purer product.  Good luck ladies!</li>
    <li> Love the gel consistency but I&#x27;m not sure if it really helped with peri-menopause symptoms&lt;br /&gt;but why not use an all natural gel on your soft skin areas?</li>
    <li> Wild yam cream/gel has helped me with nightsweats, PMS, anxiety, and even lengthened my cycle which had shortened in the last year. I did extensive reading and discovered this ingredient may up regulate progesterone receptors to better use your own progesterone and counter estrogen dominance. I don&#x27;t want to be without this.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after I ordered my usual progesterone cream and found that they had changed the formula, dropped the wild yam extract. With the progesterone cream without wild yam I was experiencing restlessness and sleep loss. After 3 nights, adding the At Last Naturals Wild Yam gel to my progesterone regimen, I am back to a comfortable nights sleep. If I do wake up I quickly fall back into a restful and pleasant dream state, no tossing and turning. I know there are other benefits yet to come but sleep is priceless to me!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about something so simple being helpful to me, but I have to say, this product does what it advertises!  My sister said it did nothing for her, but for me, it performed a miracle without harmful medications :)  I would always recommend this product, and will keep buying it :)</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered.  Must follow directions, if I miss it monte I do notice a difference</li>
    <li> This gel/cream has been a godsend in helping me alleviate PMS. I started using it a month ago and I have had no pain! I didn&#x27;t even know I was going to get my period. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Did nothing, disappointed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any relief.  Won&#x27;t bother with this again.  Not much else worth saying about it.  Glad it worked for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wild Yam Gel now for 2 or so years.  My peri-menupausal symptoms are minimal. The best part is its all natural and been a proven aid for centuries.</li>
    <li> works better than the caps or pill form and is stronger because you rub it on.  I still get hot flashes using it twice a day but they are a lot milder.  Yes this is a product worth trying.</li>
    <li> A friend told me to get some yam cream when menopause symptoms started showing up. I listened to her and am I glad I did. Funny how a little dollop of yam gel makes all the difference!</li>
    <li> GREAT HORMONE CREAM.  EASY TO USE AND THE RESULTS ARE DRAMTIC. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANY WOMAN THAT WANT TO GET BACK THEIR DESIRE FOR ROMANTIC INTERLUDES.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I continue to reorder again. It has relieved my night sweats and can now enjoy a good night&#x27;s sleep uninterrupted.  I will continue to buy this product again and again.</li>
    <li> Feeling blue?&lt;br /&gt;Down?&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s your life saver!!!&lt;br /&gt;And it keeps you sexually driven.&lt;br /&gt;No more moodiness, full steam ahead...&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy :-)</li>
    <li> Eased my hot flashes so i am able to sleep at night . I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! I really like this one. I have been using it through pre-menopause to fight depression and some other symptoms that accompany the loss of estrogen;) This raises the progesterone level just enough to keep the unpredictable estrogen swings in check. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all. It did cause some extreme dizziness and increased perspiration. Not at all what was advertised.</li>
    <li> This product does not work for my symptoms. :(</li>
