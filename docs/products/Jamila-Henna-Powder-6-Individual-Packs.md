      <li>Unbelievable deal, great product!</li>
      <li>I am in love with this henna because when I had mixed it up it turned into a nice creamy paste.</li>

      <li>I do henna once a month...and the color is not bad either.</li>
      <li>You have a new customer :)</li>
      <li>Great conditioning treatment with the added perk of a little color.</li>
      <li>it probably won&#x27;t change much if at all, light hair probably will.</li>
      <li>The dark hairs don&#x27;t really change color with henna but the highlights pick up the color beautifully.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping, will be ordering again!</li>
      <li>&amp; I got a beautiful red stain that is just starting to fade.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>

      <li>Shipping is very fast.</li>
      <li>I mixed mine with lemon juice, sugar, coffee and my choice of essential oils and the stain is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ready to go!</li>
      <li>Definitely will buy more.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>so i was expecting it to be very vibrant(to</li>
      <li>Be sure to have old towels, old shower cap and old clothes.</li>
      <li>and it was kind of hard to tell if it was or not .</li>
      <li>Too bad my very wise hair strands are popping up faster than i care to color.</li>
      <li>These shipped out so fast and are dated on the bottom to show they are in fact last years summer crop.</li>
      <li>Although my hair was noticeably soft and shiny(a plus).</li>
      <li>If you have dark kinky curls, you&#x27;re gonna get some cool reddish highlights.</li>
      <li>My hair is very thick and dye resistant (ethnic hair) sobI was very sceptical about it working since it was my first time applying henna to my hair.</li>
      <li>the orange color i got was very weak(meaning you could only notice the color in sunlight), also my hair was previously a dark red-auburn color</li>

    <li> Wonderful product . It was delivered on time . I will re order again soon.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cover everything but works good enough. If you have dark kinky curls, you&#x27;re gonna get some cool reddish highlights. If you want it darker, you&#x27;ll need to follow-up w/an indigo dye. I used Zenia and it worked really well.</li>
    <li> I had a good experience with this henna.  It was not like another brand I used which was grainy and difficult to wash out.</li>
    <li> This was a good price and delivered on time by Abid.</li>
    <li> Great price for real henna. Shipping is very fast. This is my second order and I will not order from any other seller. My wife loves this henna. It covers her greys and last 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Best henna brand. I use it for my hair and it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and dye resistant (ethnic hair) sobI was very sceptical about it working since it was my first time applying henna to my hair. It worked wonderfully and I was so happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Not grainy at all. I will continue to order this product!</li>
    <li> My pack of 6 were hit and miss but that&#x27;s how it goes with Henna for hair. One box is greener than another one. However, the properties are still great and I love the way my hair feels after a Henna treatment. For the price, this deal can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I LOVE how my hair looks after application. Yes, it&#x27;s messy, yes it takes some time, but if you want a gorgeous reddish shine to your hair without the chemicals this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE: I have very dark brown hair with blonde highlights. The dark hairs don&#x27;t really change color with henna but the highlights pick up the color beautifully. So if you have very dark hair it probably won&#x27;t change much if at all, light hair probably will.</li>
    <li> Looove this product! It came as advertised and I received it within 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for Mendhi (my first time) &amp;&amp; I got a beautiful red stain that is just starting to fade.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality! And product was delivered so quickly that I was in shock! Great job!</li>
    <li> So far so good. If everything remains great I will reorder from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable deal, great product!</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm on my hair. Long lasting color and no gross buildup. 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> This brand of henna is awesome. I received 6 boxes that all were manufactured last year. The quality is great as well. You will enjoy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my henna. Excellent price and shipped super fast. Great conditioning treatment with the added perk of a little color. Comes with printed crop date as well as expiration date</li>
    <li> I have always loved this brand of henna.</li>
    <li> Produced good results! I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Great color on my daughters hair. Be sure to have old towels, old shower cap and old clothes. Henna stains everything it touches.</li>
    <li> Shipped extremely fast great product at a great price..... My family uses @ least a box per week.... It&#x27;s wonderful for African Americans who have transitioned to natural hair.... Adds a hint of color in the light and works well as a conditioner</li>
    <li> the orange color i got was very weak(meaning you could only notice the color in sunlight), also my hair was previously a dark red-auburn color so i was expecting it to be very vibrant(to be fair it might be because i used a boxed dye previously and messed with the color disposition). That wasn&#x27;t a down side for me anyways because my aim was to later use indigo to dye it black. Although my hair was noticeably soft and shiny(a plus). I followed the direction as instructed but next time i henna my hair i will make a little changes to see if the results is a little better(and if not i will still continue to use this brand because i believe its a good quality and natural henna and i am aiming for black hair not copper-orangy.</li>
    <li> I use henna powder for more than 20 years. This is a quality product. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this product.Too bad my very wise hair strands are popping up faster than i care to color.</li>
    <li> This was total crap I did so much reader has on this trying to figure out if it was jamila for hair or body art and one of the differences was the expiration date in the bottom ! It was said only jamila for body art had that other that the metallic box and it was kind of hard to tell if it was or not . So I bought it and this is for HAIR it&#x27;s not stated any where do don&#x27;t buy if your looking for body art henna !!!</li>
    <li> I just ordered Jamila on Thursday and got it Saturday! Awesome shipping and the packing was nice and tight. The crop is June 2014, so it is current.Thanks! You have a new customer :) I use this with either green tea or hibiscus powder (into tea) and this is a great strengthening treatment for my fine, coily natural hair. I do henna once a month...and the color is not bad either. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Good natural product. I am happy to find chemicals free ways to dye my hair.</li>
    <li> Watched a youtube video were the product was used decided purchase it. After mixing ingredients, applying to natural hair this slightly brown color was derived. My hair is shinier, stronger and has less breakage. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Awesome Sauce. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;kimberly</li>
    <li> I previously used another type of henna for conditioning my hair but this one was so smooth and the price is very good. Definitely will buy more.</li>
    <li> Softens my hair instantly</li>
    <li> AMAZING price for Henna powder! I love Jamila henna powder and this is an insane price for 6x 100 gram boxes! These shipped out so fast and are dated on the bottom to show they are in fact last years summer crop. I mixed mine with lemon juice, sugar, coffee and my choice of essential oils and the stain is AMAZING! Some people have said this isn&#x27;t good for body art and a totally disagree! This powder is sifted fine and doesn&#x27;t even need to be sifted again for henna. It&#x27;s ready to go! Love, love, love this shop for the amazing deal and quality henna. Just purchased more!!</li>
    <li> Good Henna.  Mixes and rinses well and provides a beautiful copper penny color to my grey roots.</li>
    <li> The henna did not have a expire date.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this henna because when I had mixed it up it turned into a nice creamy paste. It wasn&#x27;t even messes when I had applied it to my hair. It went on nice and smooth, I loved it. Also, I liked that I had got 6 boxes for that cheap price and more henna in the pack which was good!!!!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Did what it was suppose to do.  Turned grey hair reddish orange - used indigo after and it turned hair black. Love the results.</li>
