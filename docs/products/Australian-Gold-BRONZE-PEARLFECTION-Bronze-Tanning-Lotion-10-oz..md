      <li>Bronze Pearlfection is an amazing lotion.</li>
      <li>You get a nice tan.</li>
      <li>After the first use,I wasnt real thrilled with it.</li>
      <li>It leaves you smelling great after tanning, and accelerates your tan quickly.</li>
      <li>I was real excited to get the product &amp; use it.</li>
      <li>Tried the Precious metals and this is still my all time favorite!  </li>
      <li>worth the money and GREAT prices for them on here.</li>
      <li>Love, love love it!  </li>
      <li>and I used it a couple more times and still looked orange.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m apprehensive to make any more purchases from this seller.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I love the color this gives me.  </li>
      <li>I could tell I was darker the first time I used this!!!</li>
      <li>It goes on really smooth, and has an amazingly sweet smell before and after tanning, and gave my skin a shimmer (which is why I&#x27;m giving it a two), but I&#x27;m pretty sure it made me paler!</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone interested in this product for sure</li>
      <li>My favorite is Designer Skin- Ultimate Love Junkie and Austrilian</li>
      <li>Just make sure you wipe your hands off really well with a towel BEFORE you tan or it will turn your skin golden between your fingers..</li>
      <li>I totally LOVE Australian Gold bronze Tanning soooooooo much, unbelieveable the color I am, and how quickly it works, I only need to tan once weekly in lowest tanning level to maintain color, I certainly recommend this product and plan on buying more !!!!</li>
      <li>While the transaction itself was smooth and I received the product fast</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Before discovering this lotion, I used Australian Gold Almost Famous tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>I saw no benefit from the bronzers, and I really regret purchasing the sample!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Australian Gold Pearlfection!!</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with the product itself.</li>
      <li>highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Also, with several years experience in tanning I enjoy the tingle products and find I get a better tan with them due to the oxygenation of the skin.</li>
      <li>little goes a long way!!!&lt;br /&gt;Has a great smell!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>the burnt smell is not appealing but you do get amazing color results.</li>
      <li>With the delayed bronzers I am able to tan less.</li>
      <li>Gets you dark Quick!</li>
      <li>I gives me a very natural tan.  </li>
      <li>Ive used this for 2hrs and only lotion that really works!..</li>
      <li>I am not sure if its authentic.  </li>

<li> Nothing personal, just being careful.</li>

<li> I highly recommend this lotion if you have a light to moderate base tan, and you like delayed bronzers.</li>
<li> The only reason it might turn you orange is if you were too pale upon using it, because it has delayed bronzers.</li>
<li> I went to the salon where I tan and the owner agreed, so she tried mixing it with 2 other samples of lotions</li>
<li> I have used other products with DHA, like Snooki, and not had a problem.</li>
<li> You can tell it isnt fake and wasnt stored in a hot storage unit.</li>
<li> I turned orange , this has never happened with any other lotion.</li>
<li> I dont think it works as well as some of the other lotions I have</li>
<li> Pearlfection works the same, if not better.</li>
<li> Works extremely well!</li>
<li> The girls at my salon said it was due to all the heavy bronzers.</li>
<li> My salon was having a sale on the sample packets, so I decided to give it a try since the woman behind the counter said it would give me instant gratification with the bronzers.</li>
<li> I have researched DHA and it reacts with your bodies amino acids in the dead layer of skin.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t agree less!</li>
<li> The after smell is not wonderful though :-(</li>
<li> , I ended up buying something else to help with base color and get rid of the lines.  </li>
<li> and since I hadnt tanned in awhile I got \\&quot;streaks\\&quot; something terrible on my legs</li>

    <li> While the transaction itself was smooth and I received the product fast I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with the product itself. I am not sure if its authentic.  After comparing the smell and the look of it to the one at my salon. There is a visible difference. Plus the packaging was bubbled up when I bought it. While I am not 100% sure that this was fake. I&#x27;m apprehensive to make any more purchases from this seller. Nothing personal, just being careful.</li>
    <li> I was real excited to get the product &amp; use it. After the first use,I wasnt real thrilled with it. It does leave you with the \\&quot;after tan smell\\&quot;. I dont think it works as well as some of the other lotions I have tried.[[ASIN:B00654WGDE 2012 Australian Gold BRONZE PEARLFECTION Bronze Tanning Lotion 10 oz.]]</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and does not turn you orange! You get a nice tan. Just make sure you wipe your hands off really well with a towel BEFORE you tan or it will turn your skin golden between your fingers..</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lotion!! for a third of it&#x27;s price!!!!! highly recommend! Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is the best indoor tanning lotion. You use this product one time and you ccan see the difference. Gets you dark Quick! im on my seccond bottle!</li>
    <li> This lotion turned me orange. I had a good base tan before I purchased the bottle and I used it twice and my daughter looked at me one day and said \\&quot;mom, you are looking orange.\\&quot; I was not at all pleased!!! I went to the salon where I tan and the owner agreed, so she tried mixing it with 2 other samples of lotions and I used it a couple more times and still looked orange. They gave me a bottle of another lotion for the same price that I bought the pearlfection for and I could not be happier. I like the smell of the product and the \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; look it gives afterwards, but use caution when tanning with this lotion. I believe the problem is the DHA in it. I have researched DHA and it reacts with your bodies amino acids in the dead layer of skin. If there are alot of bronzers in the lotion the orange effect can occur. I have used other products with DHA, like Snooki, and not had a problem. Also, with several years experience in tanning I enjoy the tingle products and find I get a better tan with them due to the oxygenation of the skin. Hope this helps. Happy tanning!!!!</li>
    <li> I totally LOVE Australian Gold bronze Tanning soooooooo much, unbelieveable the color I am, and how quickly it works, I only need to tan once weekly in lowest tanning level to maintain color, I certainly recommend this product and plan on buying more !!!!</li>

    <li> yep one of my favorite lotions at a very good price. You can tell it isnt fake and wasnt stored in a hot storage unit.</li>
    <li> Bronzers the Bomb!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent feel!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!!!!&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way!!!&lt;br /&gt;Has a great smell!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy It!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Australian Gold Pearlfection!! The bottle is catchy and shiny. It leaves you smelling great after tanning, and accelerates your tan quickly. It does not turn you orange at all! The only reason it might turn you orange is if you were too pale upon using it, because it has delayed bronzers. Before discovering this lotion, I used Australian Gold Almost Famous tanning lotion. Pearlfection works the same, if not better. I highly recommend this lotion if you have a light to moderate base tan, and you like delayed bronzers. With the delayed bronzers I am able to tan less. Amazing Product!</li>
    <li> I turned orange , this has never happened with any other lotion. The girls at my salon said it was due to all the heavy bronzers.</li>
    <li> great lotion!! great price..Ive used this for 2hrs and only lotion that really works!.. try it ans see for yourself</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It work&#x27;s really good and dosen&#x27;t stink either. I get a lot of color when I use it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I could tell I was darker the first time I used this!!! I love it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell therefore I smell burned after I use it. But the color I get out ways how I smell.</li>
    <li> Bronze Pearlfection is an amazing lotion. Got here the same week. Would recommend to anyone interested in this product for sure</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome and I used it along with Risque Hottest Tingle Lotion.  I alternate between the two to get the maximum effect!</li>
    <li> I love the color this gives me.  I gives me a very natural tan.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My salon was having a sale on the sample packets, so I decided to give it a try since the woman behind the counter said it would give me instant gratification with the bronzers. I couldn&#x27;t agree less! It goes on really smooth, and has an amazingly sweet smell before and after tanning, and gave my skin a shimmer (which is why I&#x27;m giving it a two), but I&#x27;m pretty sure it made me paler! I saw no benefit from the bronzers, and I really regret purchasing the sample! I definitely won&#x27;t be trying this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a salon so I paid $$$ for it and since I hadnt tanned in awhile I got \\&quot;streaks\\&quot; something terrible on my legs, I ended up buying something else to help with base color and get rid of the lines.  My favorite is Designer Skin- Ultimate Love Junkie and Austrilian Gold- Gilded....worth the money and GREAT prices for them on here.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion! Works extremely well! The after smell is not wonderful though :-( the burnt smell is not appealing but you do get amazing color results.</li>
