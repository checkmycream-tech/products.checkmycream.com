      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>It does not have a strong smell and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this lotion.  </li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t fantastic but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
      <li>I liked this product because it was affordable, light on my skin, moisturizing-even through a very dry winter, and the ingredients are safe for use while I am pregnant.</li>
      <li>The lotion does not have a strong smell, but it does smell pretty.  </li>
      <li>I bought this lotion/cream on the advice of another pregnant friend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant.</li>
      <li>It is pretty mild and clean smelling.</li>
      <li>My daughters allergist recommended this product for her sensitive skin and eczema, it works wonders I love it</li>
      <li>It sounded like exactly what I needed for my 7 month pregnant belly and body.  </li>
      <li>I think I had lucky genes;) I think it kept me from being itchy though, even when my tummy &amp; boobs were at their hugest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>I used this every day during my first pregnancy, gained about 40 lbs, and do not have any stretchmarks.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks.</li>
      <li>So for my second pregnancy I bought more.</li>
      <li>Love this cream have been using it thru my entire pregnancy(8 1/2 months preg.) and have had no stretch</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I enjoy that it uses lots of natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I still use the complimentary body wash on my 2.5 year old and his baby sister.</li>
      <li>but I have found that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to absorb.  </li>
      <li>my husband likes it as well, and he&#x27;s very picky about texture and greasiness.</li>
      <li>All in all I realize now that I could have just utilized a nice smelling body butter from a local store to achieve daily moisturizing and daddy bonding time.</li>
      <li>Love it, no strong fragrance and it leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I am aware of the fact that stretch marks are genetic, but I thought it would be fun to get a lotion that my hubby could rub in for me so that he could connect with the baby on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>Wife used this during her first pregnancy and it worked overall pretty well.</li>
      <li>I am currently 32 weeks pregnant.  </li>
      <li>I am currently using this product once a day, and at 24 weeks pregnant I still do not have stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this and the Bella b stick that is nice for hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>I love this product as my everyday lotion.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin really soft!</li>
      <li>It sits on top of my skin and later in the day it creates an odd waxy film that flakes off.  </li>
      <li>I use it everyday, unlike other creamy stretch mark lotion, this is relatively light and quick absorbing, i just used it together with bio-oil, although i recently found i got some stretch marks already on my side waist...</li>
      <li>you skin silky soft.</li>
      <li>I have a few other Bella B products, and I love them all!</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this and used it on myself throughout pregnancy but soon learned the preservatives in this blend are not great for sensitive baby skin.</li>
      <li>This lotion is thick, but absorbs very quickly.</li>
      <li>(However, from what I&#x27;ve heard stretch marks are due to your genes and creams/lotions really don&#x27;t prevent them anyway.)</li>
      <li>The lotion shipped fast and I am very pleased with the fragrance as I usually hate all smelly things.</li>

    <li> Nice cream! I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant. I put it on my body and it&#x27;s so nice, moisturized each inch of my skin, smoothly touch, and my husband said it touched like baby skin. I bought three from Amazon. I&#x27;m going to use it during and after pregnancy.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this lotion.  It sounded like exactly what I needed for my 7 month pregnant belly and body.  It smells great and goes on nice but I have found that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to absorb.  It sits on top of my skin and later in the day it creates an odd waxy film that flakes off.  I have found the Earth Mama, Angel Baby products to be better.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  I love this lotion! I am currently 32 weeks pregnant.  I have been using this lotion since about week 12.  I use it every other day on my belly.  I have no stretch marks at all!  (However, from what I&#x27;ve heard stretch marks are due to your genes and creams/lotions really don&#x27;t prevent them anyway.) I primiarly use the lotion to help prevent dry skin and itching.  The lotion does not have a strong smell, but it does smell pretty.  I highly recommend this product.  I have a few other Bella B products, and I love them all!</li>
    <li> I used this every day during my first pregnancy, gained about 40 lbs, and do not have any stretchmarks.  I&#x27;m obviously not prone to getting them but I believe this lotion helped to prevent them.  It is not as greasy as other lotions and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.  It makes my skin really soft!</li>
    <li> I bought this on amazon because I was traveling for 2 weeks and forgot the \\&quot;belly jelly\\&quot; that I usually use. My usual product wasn&#x27;t eligible for prime shipping so I decided to try something that was. The lotion shipped fast and I am very pleased with the fragrance as I usually hate all smelly things. It is pretty mild and clean smelling. I like that the product is thick enough to last all night but not so yucky that it ruins your clothes. the other nightly jelly that i usually put on my belly is pretty nasty and does ruin clothes but i swear by it none the less! I don&#x27;t feel like this cream is substantial enough for women who have stretch marks in their genes like I do. I usually use bag balm and it prevented stretch marks with my first baby till i passed my due date... then they showed up just days before my son was born :( I would recommend this as a product to use during the day to keep your belly from drying out &amp; getting itchy and something thicker for night time if you are stretch mark prone.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells great and feels awesome...my husband likes it as well, and he&#x27;s very picky about texture and greasiness. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It does not have a strong smell and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and used it on myself throughout pregnancy but soon learned the preservatives in this blend are not great for sensitive baby skin. I still use the complimentary body wash on my 2.5 year old and his baby sister. I love the scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion/cream on the advice of another pregnant friend. She said she used it throughout her pregnancy and came up with little/no stretch marks. I am one who does NOT believe that there is a miracle product to keep away stretch marks during pregnancy, but I wanted something that didn&#x27;t smell like cocoa butter. This product has a light scent that I find very appealing. Regardless of my opinions on miracle products, I religiously lathered myself with this lotion after every shower during my pregnancy - JUST IN CASE. Miracle of miracles, I did not get a single stretch mark on my belly, boobs, or behind -however, I did not get very big (only gained 20 lbs) and plus, my mom said she never got stretch marks with me or my sister, so I think I had lucky genes;) I think it kept me from being itchy though, even when my tummy &amp; boobs were at their hugest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it sometimes since it it very light and not greasy. I enjoy that it uses lots of natural ingredients. I&#x27;d recommend it to any other preggy friend.</li>
    <li> I like to use this as a hand cream. It&#x27;s nice and moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, and has a light fragrance. Recently bought a bunch of these for stalking stuffers for Christmas. Have to wait for the responses from my girl friends but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks. So for my second pregnancy I bought more. I&#x27;m using this and the Bella b stick that is nice for hard to reach places. I use the lotion for everywhere because it rubs in nicer than the stick kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and its worth every penny to not have stretch marks.</li>
    <li> My daughters allergist recommended this product for her sensitive skin and eczema, it works wonders I love it and I recommended it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Wife used this during her first pregnancy and it worked overall pretty well. The smell isn&#x27;t fantastic but it&#x27;s not bad either. I would suggest doing research and seeing what works for everyone.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. This lotion is thick, but absorbs very quickly.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a another great Bella B product.  I love this product as my everyday lotion.  It&#x27;s especially nice after shaving.  I usually itch pretty badly but when I use this after shaving I don&#x27;t itch and my skin feels lovely.  I use this in the morning on my arms, chest, and neck and I only have to apply it one time and I&#x27;m moisturized for the entire day.  A nice light fragrance and it soaks in rather well.  I personally love it!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday, unlike other creamy stretch mark lotion, this is relatively light and quick absorbing, i just used it together with bio-oil, although i recently found i got some stretch marks already on my side waist... I&#x27;m almost 38 weeks now.</li>
    <li> I like it! it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it was affordable, light on my skin, moisturizing-even through a very dry winter, and the ingredients are safe for use while I am pregnant.</li>

    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s thick and non greasy.</li>
    <li> I wish I could use this lotion, but the smell makes me nauseous. I don&#x27;t know what it is; the smell is just awful. It&#x27;s not strong or anything, just has a sickly odor to it...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great product!!</li>
