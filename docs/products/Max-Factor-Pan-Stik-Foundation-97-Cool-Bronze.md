### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Still think it&#x27;s the best foundation.</li>
      <li>the best!!!</li>
      <li>My wife is very happy with this makeup</li>
      <li>It came promptly and is a perfect size for her purse.</li>
      <li>It is the very best skin protection</li>
      <li>My favorite foundation ever!!!</li>
      <li>The sellers were great and offered a return.  </li>
      <li>This was great for using as a contour color.</li>
      <li>AND SHE SAID SHE LOVED IT.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Been using this for years and still love the product!</li>
      <li>Glad there is a replacement to the Original Max Factor Panstick, this  color 97 is to match to the original MF 137 sun tone ,but it is a bit darker than the original product, but just so happy they make Panstick still!!</li>
      <li>The bronze color was not as bronze as I would have liked - otherwise fine.</li>
      <li>Love Max Factor a lot.</li>
      <li>still glad I can get it here.</li>
      <li>My favorite bronzer now</li>
      <li>Love panstiks..</li>
      <li>It is a great product, but their &amp;#34;color match&amp;#34; to US max factor is completely off</li>
      <li>I LOVE how creamy and full coverage</li>
      <li>color fine</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe they make a light tan or caramel shade anymore.  </li>
      <li>So  enjoy Ladies</li>
      <li>I also love that I can apply with a wet sponge for a more natural flawless look.</li>
      <li>Thanks Max Factor!!!</li>
      <li>So glad new source is available!  </li>
      <li>Darker than the original.</li>
      <li>Until such time as another cosmetic manufacturer can match their superior quality, I am grateful Amazon has provided an alternative method of to secure these products.</li>
      <li>Cool Bronze is the closest I could find.  </li>
      <li>This product is really good for the price you pay, &amp; I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>so the 97 cool Bronze.</li>
      <li>and I would not recommend if your full on oily skin type.</li>
      <li>she is going to start using the Cool Bronze.  </li>
      <li>Although coverage isn&#x27;t as good as the old panstik, the new product is adequate and worth using.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this would be close to the rich beige that I liked and used for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for drag contouring if you have a slight tan mixed with medium and fair to get the fishy look</li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>It is very creamy</li>
      <li>and I would order as much as I could.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately the color I chose was a little too warm for my face, but it worked amazing to contour my nose!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sorry that the size of the stick itself has been greatly reduced,  but not the price.</li>
      <li>I suppose  I should have noticed that it was for a 1/2 the normal size and amount, but didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>While I like the makeup, the makeup was packaged at 1/2 the size that I normally get.</li>
      <li>All the reviews are accurate,  smaller, different size than the old MF and color is much darker.</li>
      <li>Getting older and this stuff hides the old age</li>
      <li>I wish mfr would increase the size to the old size</li>
      <li>the old  Man Factor.but with every day</li>
      <li>A little darker but not bad.</li>
      <li>Ordered the same color I normally use in Max factor - this product was about 2 shades darker.  </li>
      <li>This cool bronze is really pale.  </li>
      <li>Max Factor is back and with grate new colors and still stays on all day was using 137 but no longer has that color</li>
      <li>Also about one third the amount that used to be in the old sticks for the same price.</li>

    <li> The colors are like they used to be.  This cool bronze is really pale.  I don&#x27;t believe they make a light tan or caramel shade anymore.  The sellers were great and offered a return.  I decided to keep it as an under eye concealer.</li>
    <li> Used Max Factor cosmetics for MANY years and was very disappointed when they were no longer manufactured in the United States.  Until such time as another cosmetic manufacturer can match their superior quality, I am grateful Amazon has provided an alternative method of to secure these products.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this makeup</li>
    <li> Have been using this foundation/stick for 20years! Love it!</li>
    <li> Love Max Factor a lot.</li>
    <li> My favorite bronzer now</li>
    <li> size of the Panstick diminished by half...color fine...texture about the same..but was shocked at the size...still glad I can get it here.</li>
    <li> I have always used Max Factor Suntone.  Cool Bronze is the closest I could find.  A little darker but not bad.</li>
    <li> Perfect for drag contouring if you have a slight tan mixed with medium and fair to get the fishy look</li>
    <li> Love panstiks..but have a hard time finding them anymore..in the colors that I want...and shame on Max Factor for cutting the size by what seems like 50%!..</li>
    <li> this pan stick is smaller than a tube of lipstick.</li>
    <li> Used this for years and now, hard to find in stores.  So glad new source is available!  It is the very best skin protection&lt;br /&gt;and cover-up I&#x27;ve ever used.  Max Factor was way-y-y before his time, a genius in skin care.  Bless him!</li>
    <li> PURCHASED THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE CALLED ME THIS MORNING AFTER USING THE MAKE-UP AND SHE SAID SHE LOVED IT.  DOES IT COME IN A LARGER SIZE?</li>
    <li> too small for the price.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using Suntone panstik, so now that it is discontinued she is going to start using the Cool Bronze.  Thanks!  It came promptly and is a perfect size for her purse.</li>
    <li> Ordered the same color I normally use in Max factor - this product was about 2 shades darker.  Can&#x27;t even use it.  It is a great product, but their &amp;#34;color match&amp;#34; to US max factor is completely off</li>
    <li> Max Factor is back and with grate new colors and still stays on all day was using 137 but no longer has that color so the 97 cool Bronze. Is the closed that I could get to it. It  just a shade darker but mot bad . a lot smaller.then the old  Man Factor.but with every day use I get about 2 weeks out of it.I have being using Max Factor for 25 years,And was so sad to see them move.So  enjoy Ladies and I would order as much as I could.D in TN.</li>
    <li> Too dark, even though they said it was the closest to the old color that I used to use.  Also about one third the amount that used to be in the old sticks for the same price.</li>
    <li> Darker than the original. Very much smaller than what ipurchasedyears ago in the US.</li>
    <li> While I like the makeup, the makeup was packaged at 1/2 the size that I normally get. I suppose  I should have noticed that it was for a 1/2 the normal size and amount, but didn&#x27;t. Hence my disappointment.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and still love the product! Have ordered it several times before but this time it was half the size but the same price. This was not clear on the order form.</li>
    <li> I have been using pan stik for over 40 years and my mother before me, I&#x27;m grateful I can still get this makeup. It is not available in store anymore.</li>
    <li> Getting older and this stuff hides the old age the best!!! Thanks Max Factor!!! Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if you guys ever discontinue this product!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be close to the rich beige that I liked and used for a long time.  The shade is too dark and the size was much smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Although coverage isn&#x27;t as good as the old panstik, the new product is adequate and worth using. I wish mfr would increase the size to the old size</li>
    <li> All the reviews are accurate,  smaller, different size than the old MF and color is much darker. Product is similar in texture</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation ever!!! I still can&#x27;t get over the fact Max Factor no longer sells in the US. I LOVE how creamy and full coverage it is. I also love that I can apply with a wet sponge for a more natural flawless look. It is very creamy and I would not recommend if your full on oily skin type. I&#x27;d say it lasts about 4/5 hours.</li>
    <li> Glad there is a replacement to the Original Max Factor Panstick, this  color 97 is to match to the original MF 137 sun tone ,but it is a bit darker than the original product, but just so happy they make Panstick still!! Only problem is we have to order out of the U.S.</li>
    <li> It is a very small container! Will order from Drugstore.Com next time.</li>
    <li> Been using Max Factor Panstick for years. Still think it&#x27;s the best foundation. The bronze color was not as bronze as I would have liked - otherwise fine. I&#x27;m sorry that the size of the stick itself has been greatly reduced,  but not the price.</li>
    <li> This was great for using as a contour color. Unfortunately the color I chose was a little too warm for my face, but it worked amazing to contour my nose! This product is really good for the price you pay, &amp; I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Been searching for Panstik forever since the stores discontinued carrying it.  This is small, relative to the size I remember, but definitely fits the bill as far as I am concerned.</li>
