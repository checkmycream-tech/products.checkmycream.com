### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;the seller was great and the packaging is nice</li>
      <li>They felt good on but that&#x27;s just about it.</li>
      <li>I order these often and am very satisfied with the results, both with the product as well as the service.</li>
      <li>Ok, I got these and thought, yeay!</li>
      <li>Maybe I should purchase more of the collagen eye mask!  </li>
      <li>loved them need to order more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice quality on this price.  </li>
      <li>But they work great and stay on pretty well</li>
      <li>Im glad she thought that.</li>
      <li>love this product thank you</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, and the price is great.</li>
      <li>I am giving this three stars because the patches are very soothing and refreshing and go on nicely under the eyes and stay there until you remove them.</li>
      <li>The Collagen Eye Mask does a wonderful job on dark circles, bags and wrinkles too.  </li>
      <li>I love it very much.</li>
      <li>The results were okay, the mask reduced puffiness but not by that much</li>
      <li>If you wish to use this more than once a week, as I do and believe is necessary to see any results, then more than one application a week is needed and hence this is not a month supply.</li>
      <li>compared to other creams and lotions and eye packs, this is so far the best .</li>
      <li>Love it, skin feels fresh and soft.</li>
      <li>you would have to wait a couple of weeks longer for it as it has to be shipped from Asia, but well for the price difference it might be worth it.</li>
      <li>and i found that they just feel more refreshing if you take them off after half an hour or an hour, as the instructions recommend.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it comes with absolutely ZERO instructions!</li>
      <li>after using my skin was smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>But then, maybe it is too much to wish for five treatments to do anything.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel soft, refreshed and it is worth the money...</li>
      <li>The effects are very short-term.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: if you really want to try this product out, give ebay a try.</li>
      <li>So thought maybe it was just me, and took them to a lady i know who is older and had worrisome bags under her eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll look young and new again!</li>
      <li>I guess I expected more obvious results.</li>
      <li>I only use each patch once as they do not stick for me after the first use and I feel I do not want to take chances applying something that may now have bacteria on it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference in my dark circles but other than that it is okay mask.</li>
      <li>First of all, I am not sure this is really a month supply.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money, and time too.</li>
      <li>Im looking into other products with lots of high ratings.</li>

<li> My only complaint is that they weren&#x27;t clear like the photo suggests.</li>
<li> i just spent my money for nothing i did no recomend that product dont buy it</li>
<li> Not great: the stickiness of the patches is so that it really hurts the skin upon removal.</li>
<li> and I cant say I noticed any difference in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my dark circles or bags.</li>
<li> but I know that after five applications, there is no difference whatsoever in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>

<li> I have thin, fragile skin</li>
<li> i was searching eye masks and saw this for less than 2 dollars including shipping by at least two sellers.</li>
<li> I look and feel rested, no more puffy eyes.</li>
<li> sorry, it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just 5 eye mask, so it&#x27;s too expensive for almost any result.</li>
<li> They need to check the package instructions, they are really bad to follow.</li>
<li> That is very disappointing.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my dark circles or bags. They felt good on but that&#x27;s just about it.</li>
    <li> Love it, skin feels fresh and soft. I look and feel rested, no more puffy eyes. I highly recommend it, and the price is great. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Not great: the stickiness of the patches is so that it really hurts the skin upon removal. I have thin, fragile skin and it didn&#x27;t like it one bit! The effects are very short-term. I think I would have got the same results with packing tape on my wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;Also, it comes with absolutely ZERO instructions!</li>
    <li> Ok, I got these and thought, yeay! I&#x27;ll look young and new again! They didn&#x27;t work. sorry, it just didn&#x27;t. So thought maybe it was just me, and took them to a lady i know who is older and had worrisome bags under her eyes. She thought she saw a slight improvement. Im glad she thought that. To me it looked the same. So for myself, no- nothing changed. Im looking into other products with lots of high ratings. So should you!</li>
    <li> loved them need to order more</li>
    <li> First of all, I am not sure this is really a month supply. you order five packets and each is for one use only. If you wish to use this more than once a week, as I do and believe is necessary to see any results, then more than one application a week is needed and hence this is not a month supply. I applied all five patches within eight days and I cant say I noticed any difference in the dark circles under my eyes. But then, maybe it is too much to wish for five treatments to do anything. Maybe in the long-term the effects will be visible. I do not know about that but I know that after five applications, there is no difference whatsoever in the dark circles under my eyes. That is very disappointing. I am giving this three stars because the patches are very soothing and refreshing and go on nicely under the eyes and stay there until you remove them. i slept with them a couple of times and they stayed put until the morning but then they dried out completely and i found that they just feel more refreshing if you take them off after half an hour or an hour, as the instructions recommend.&lt;br /&gt;the seller was great and the packaging is nice but i dont think i will be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: if you really want to try this product out, give ebay a try. i was searching eye masks and saw this for less than 2 dollars including shipping by at least two sellers. you would have to wait a couple of weeks longer for it as it has to be shipped from Asia, but well for the price difference it might be worth it.</li>
    <li> I did not find any difference on my puffiness in the morning after using it overnight for two consecutive nights.</li>
    <li> I order these often and am very satisfied with the results, both with the product as well as the service. I would give them an A+ all around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just 5 eye mask, so it&#x27;s too expensive for almost any result.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that they weren&#x27;t clear like the photo suggests. But they work great and stay on pretty well</li>
    <li> Maybe I should purchase more of the collagen eye mask!  The bags, crinkles-are still visible under my eyes. Maybe another week or two will make the difference!</li>
    <li> I got my order recently. I used it as soon as got it. It&#x27;s a nice quality on this price.  I love it very much. after using my skin was smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> like them a lot. They stay on well and do seem to help with swelling that I get under eys while sleeping. It is a temporary fix but is helpful. I also found it helpful to cover blemishes and they seem to heal a bit faster. I only use each patch once as they do not stick for me after the first use and I feel I do not want to take chances applying something that may now have bacteria on it. You can also cut these to size to make them last longer if you want to.</li>
    <li> I used them and I didn&#x27;t see any results, it&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money, and time too. They need to check the package instructions, they are really bad to follow.</li>
    <li> The Collagen Eye Mask does a wonderful job on dark circles, bags and wrinkles too.  The effect lasts about a day or two.</li>
    <li> I used it and did not see any diferrence under my eyes. Is it too soon to rate this product?should I continue using it?</li>
    <li> compared to other creams and lotions and eye packs, this is so far the best . It makes my skin feel soft, refreshed and it is worth the money...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my dark circles but other than that it is okay mask. I would try something else.</li>
    <li> I guess I expected more obvious results. The results were okay, the mask reduced puffiness but not by that much</li>
    <li> love this product thank you</li>
    <li> It dosnt work i just spent my money for nothing i did no recomend that product dont buy it is a fraud</li>
