      <li>I love that it is organic.</li>
      <li>Been suffering from crampy stomach pains and even diarrhea for days before I did more research and found that colostrum with the fat not filtered out still has the lactose in it.</li>
      <li>Colostrum makes a lot of promises and this is one of the most premium brands out there.  </li>
      <li>started giving her homeopathic remedies dissolved in herbal childrens cough syrup, and altho, it worked better than the antibiotics</li>

      <li>I love the taste of this supplement.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know its effects, but taste and delivery speed satisfied me.</li>

      <li>I really wanted to like this brand of Colostrum as I had read good reviews, it&#x27;s from certified organic dairy farms</li>
      <li>The immune system benefits alone are pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>Great colostrum sourced from pastured American cows.</li>
      <li>I started taking this because I have candida overgrowth and have learned that having a fully functioning immune system is important to fight it and prevent it.</li>
      <li>I would say very much worth the money!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a certified true 6 hour colostrum.</li>
      <li>The product is very powdery and a bit challenging to mix in liquid, (alot of it ends up on e</li>
      <li>But what we do know for sure, is that after drinking 2 lbs of this stuff and spending 200 bucks on it I still have the VERY intestinal problems this product claims to cure.</li>
      <li>Mild taste hides in a smoothie.</li>
      <li>I ate about 2 lbs of super premium colostrum.  </li>
      <li>was symptom free for 4 months, no joke, until she started sneezing and getting feverish again, and I started her on the regime again, and in 5 days, she was good to go.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this for a whole month yet, but I expect great results after long term use.</li>
      <li>but hell I spent a lot more on doctors and they have not been any more useful.  </li>
      <li>I have had chronic pain for 18 years in both shoulders, neck, right bicep, right achilles heel.  </li>
      <li>Daniel Vitalis has been right all along.</li>
      <li>I felt better in general.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully 300g of L-glutamine costs about $15, so much cheaper than colostrum!</li>
      <li>I have been taking this exactly for one week</li>
      <li>in the first month I was taking it</li>
      <li>Well with Surthrival, I didn&#x27;t feel any difference at first.</li>
      <li>I am not sleeping any better, my bowel movements are not any different, and my pain levels are fluctuating like they always do.  </li>
      <li>so I decided to go with a different brand, but I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I actually found L-glutamine a lot more effective towards soothing my gut as the point of taking colostrum was due to research that indicated it helped with leaky gut (increased intestinal permeability) which athletes experience.</li>
      <li>Upon opening my package, I could immediately tell there was a difference in the colour and texture compared to two other brands I have tried - the really popular Symbiotics brand and a Canadian brand Harmony.</li>
      <li>started putting it a cup of water and using a little handheld whip (called an aero latte) and it dissolves way better than it was in a shaker cup!  </li>
      <li>It is expensive but I have vetted other brands as well and strongly believe that this is the best on the market.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I am amazed that it healed it as I was ready to see a dermatologist about it.</li>
      <li>I polished off a whole container in one week one time.</li>
      <li>Thanks for stocking this.</li>
      <li>So I am using a more natural path and am figuring that all these issues are gut related.  </li>
      <li>I found that if I put it in my cup first and add only the tiniest bit of water, I can stir it into a paste and it dissolves okay, then I add all my other ingredients and water.</li>
      <li>if I missed a day or two, symptoms would come right back, and I was spending $30 a month on this stuff.</li>
      <li>I wanted to get these magical benefits as soon as possible, so I took two heaping tablespoons on an empty stomach.  </li>
      <li>There is a pretty extensive body of scientific evidence on the benefits of bovine colostrum and reading some of it made me convinced that it was worth trying and possibly making a regular part of my supplementation.</li>
      <li>This is one of those whole food supplements that I can say actually works.</li>
      <li>That is really the only way to avoid the clumps I was getting otherwise.</li>
      <li>But for the rest of us with sensitive systems, the fat must be filtered out.</li>
      <li>Effects so far:  </li>
      <li>The good news in all this is that I don&#x27;t have to buy an expensive product to aid in the healing process.</li>
      <li>My TSH, Free T4, and Free T3 have been pretty stable for two years but the last result I have had all numbers have gotten a little worse.</li>
      <li>Not sure if there are noticeable benefits, but that is because we use a lot of different supplements and eat very clean, organic foods.  </li>
      <li>In about a week the wound grew new skin and is no longer open and weeping.</li>
      <li>But when I started to up my dose to 3 tsp a day, I started to develop an unusual pain dull-ache on my upper left quad abdominal area that continued until I quit taking Surthrival.</li>
      <li>she drinks it right down!</li>
      <li>I have to put it in a large cup of water and use a whisk like a madman to get it to somehow to break down.</li>
      <li>The other close competitors are Sovereign Labs and some New Zealand company.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of those whole food supplements that I can say actually works. There is a pretty extensive body of scientific evidence on the benefits of bovine colostrum and reading some of it made me convinced that it was worth trying and possibly making a regular part of my supplementation. The immune system benefits alone are pretty amazing. I did not experience a jolt upon using or any earth shattering, life changing immediate effect but after several weeks, I noticed an improvement in my overall health that I could feel. I felt stronger and more energized. Also, I normally suffer horribly at the beginning of allergy season. I have been taking Surthrival Colostrum for 5 weeks and my allergies hardly bother me at all this year. I do not see this as a coincidence. I have always suffered from an over-reactive immune system and this product has calmed it down. It is expensive but I have vetted other brands as well and strongly believe that this is the best on the market. I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It does not dissolve well in liquid and I am not a smoothie person so I eat 2 tsp. a day mixed with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know its effects, but taste and delivery speed satisfied me.</li>
    <li> I myself have never tried any other brand of Colostrum before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to any other C.- Product, but since me and my wife have been taking this stuff,...(about 8 months so far and not even every single day, mixed into our daily fiber drink in the morning on an empty stomach) none of us ever got a cold while everybody else around us did! I think we are going to keep taking this stuff, even though its a expansive supplement, you only need a very tiny amount, not even half a tea-spoon so it will last you a long time! I would say very much worth the money!</li>
    <li> Probably would have to take it for a few months to see any real effects of the product. Taste was alright... Just didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
    <li> Prompt shipment, great product, at an excellent price...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for a whole month yet, but I expect great results after long term use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle for children, and the year around flu and cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 6 year old daughter was sick almost all year, last year, and was constantly having a runny nose, and mucus problem. I kept taking her to the doctor and getting rounds of antibiotics that seemed to never  really make the cold and runny nose problem go away.&lt;br /&gt;I started giving her homeopathic remedies dissolved in herbal childrens cough syrup, and altho, it worked better than the antibiotics, it seemed Id have to give her these herbal concoctions every morning and evening to keep it away, and if I missed a day or two, symptoms would come right back, and I was spending $30 a month on this stuff. Not anymore!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix up a half teso to a teaspoon of this stuff in a just a small amount of milk and  pancake syrup, or just a dash of hazlenut flavored (or whatever flavored coffee creamer)and she drinks it right down! I do this morning and evening, and in a week and a half, cold completely gone, that she had for a year!&lt;br /&gt;She was symptom free for 4 months, no joke, until she started sneezing and getting feverish again, and I started her on the regime again, and in 5 days, she was good to go. A little goes a long way, and I start with a tsp first few days, then a half teasp. The product is very powdery and a bit challenging to mix in liquid, (alot of it ends up on e the sides of the cup) so try to whip it vigorously, and it seems to work well. Awesomeness. This container can easily last you 6 months or more, its great :))</li>
    <li> I use this for my two chihuahuas for their overall health and for one who has allergies. I didn&#x27;t know how well this was working for my one chihuahua with allergies until I went on a trip and didn&#x27;t use it for about 4 days. She started sneezing, chewing on her paws and got a runny nose. I put her back on it when I got home and her symptoms went away after two days. I&#x27;d say this definitely works!</li>
    <li> I took this until it was empty and I didn&#x27;t notice that it help me at all.</li>
    <li> I had taken another brand of colostrum for years and switched to Surthrival.  I felt better in general.  I am a senior citizen and I feel colostrum is essential for me to maintain my immune system.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love that it is organic. I would have given it 5 stars but there is one problem. When added to a shake, it does not dissolve. I found that if I put it in my cup first and add only the tiniest bit of water, I can stir it into a paste and it dissolves okay, then I add all my other ingredients and water. That is really the only way to avoid the clumps I was getting otherwise. It is a nuisance to have to do the extra step but I haven&#x27;t yet found another organic option.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I started putting it a cup of water and using a little handheld whip (called an aero latte) and it dissolves way better than it was in a shaker cup!  If you plan to use it in a blender, I think you won&#x27;t experience any problems.</li>
    <li> The best product you will ever need, boost  your immune system. Help for your over all health .&lt;br /&gt;Help build muscle, stamina. Take before you go to bed to help with the growth hormone.</li>
    <li> So disappointed! I researched this item like crazy and the website stated that those with lactose intolerance can use this because it doesn&#x27;t have the lactose in it. That is so not true. Been suffering from crampy stomach pains and even diarrhea for days before I did more research and found that colostrum with the fat not filtered out still has the lactose in it. I blamed everything else, since admitting that this and the capsules which cost me a whopping $86 together, was the cause of this. Please, if you have a lactose intolerance, this will wreck your system, guaranteed. For all those who swear by the colostrum with the fat in it, by all means go buy it. But for the rest of us with sensitive systems, the fat must be filtered out.</li>
    <li> Have used this little over a month. I noticed that it has improved the thrush that I have had for two years. This is prior to taking Nystatin for three months before that made little difference in the thrush. I also had an open wound that wouldn&#x27;t heal or grow a scab for about a month. On a whim I decided to apply the colostrum to the wound to see if it would help. In about a week the wound grew new skin and is no longer open and weeping. I am amazed that it healed it as I was ready to see a dermatologist about it. The only thing I worry about is that I have Hashimotos and that it may be making it flare. My TSH, Free T4, and Free T3 have been pretty stable for two years but the last result I have had all numbers have gotten a little worse. I may have to discontinue taking it because of this reason. FYI I started taking this because I have candida overgrowth and have learned that having a fully functioning immune system is important to fight it and prevent it. I do believe that it does strengthen the immune system.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this brand of Colostrum as I had read good reviews, it&#x27;s from certified organic dairy farms and it&#x27;s a certified true 6 hour colostrum. Upon opening my package, I could immediately tell there was a difference in the colour and texture compared to two other brands I have tried - the really popular Symbiotics brand and a Canadian brand Harmony. Unlike the other two brands, Suthrival Colostrum was a brighter creamy yellow and had a creamier texture (I&#x27;m guessing due the fat content) but there was an odd &amp;#34;cheesy&amp;#34; smell. The product still tasted good (it&#x27;s somewhat like creamy milk), but I&#x27;m not sure if perhaps I received a bad batch. Oddly, I didn&#x27;t experience any type of die-off with Surthrival Colostrum compared to when I took the other two cheaper brands. With the previous brands, I became unusually tired/sleepy (usually my energy will wax and wane, with moments of feeling awake and moments of feeling tired) that was unrelenting and my nose started to run and I developed a slight cough. All this lasted for 1.5 days. Well with Surthrival, I didn&#x27;t feel any difference at first. But when I started to up my dose to 3 tsp a day, I started to develop an unusual pain dull-ache on my upper left quad abdominal area that continued until I quit taking Surthrival. After a week break, I decided to try again, and the pain returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have a positive experience with Surthrival which sucks because it&#x27;s really expensive and I was looking forward to being a huge fan, and buying more. I only finished half of the jar which costed $50. It is possible that I received a bad batch, unless it&#x27;s suppose to smell cheesy? The other brands I had definitely did not have that smell.  But it&#x27;s too expensive to give this product another try. I actually found L-glutamine a lot more effective towards soothing my gut as the point of taking colostrum was due to research that indicated it helped with leaky gut (increased intestinal permeability) which athletes experience. Thankfully 300g of L-glutamine costs about $15, so much cheaper than colostrum! The good news in all this is that I don&#x27;t have to buy an expensive product to aid in the healing process.</li>
    <li> Colostrum makes a lot of promises and this is one of the most premium brands out there.  The other close competitors are Sovereign Labs and some New Zealand company.  I have been taking this exactly for one week and I would like to share my feedback as of now.  Reasons for my taking it:  I have had chronic pain for 18 years in both shoulders, neck, right bicep, right achilles heel.  Very poor sleep and various digestive issues along with gluten intolerance, season allergies and seborrheic dermatitis.  Obviously doctors do not see any of these things as related and I am tired of going to them.  I have had my share of ibuprofen, cortizone shots, surgeries, etc to last a life time.  So I am using a more natural path and am figuring that all these issues are gut related.  Impressions:  - Very hard to mix.  It is a chalky, albeit pleasant smelling powder that seems to stick to everything.  To the spoon, to clothing, countertops, etc.  I tried putting a teaspoon in my mouth and washing it down, bad idea - just sticks to the gums, teeth, etc.  I have to put it in a large cup of water and use a whisk like a madman to get it to somehow to break down. - Taste is good.  Sort of like condensed milk.  Dosage: I wanted to get these magical benefits as soon as possible, so I took two heaping tablespoons on an empty stomach.  One in the morning, one in the evening after work.  Effects so far:  Basically, nothing.  I am not sleeping any better, my bowel movements are not any different, and my pain levels are fluctuating like they always do.  Conclusion as of one week:  This is not a miracle substance like other reviewers make it out to be, but: - One week and just over 6 oz (still got 2 TBs left) may be too soon.  I have another canister waiting and will post an update later. - No side effects.  I am not feeling any worse, except down $80 bucks - but hell I spent a lot more on doctors and they have not been any more useful.  Update: 4/24/15  This is going to be a reflection on all Colostrum.  I actually had Genova Labs test my gut permeability and gut health *after* taking this colostrum and another brand.  All in all I ate about 2 lbs of super premium colostrum.  The test results showed I have gut permeability, intestinal inflammation and a very low diversity gut flora.  So the primary claims for colostrum completely and utterly failed for me.  The only reason for not giving this one star, is for all I know, without drinking the 2lbs the results could have been worse.  But what we do know for sure, is that after drinking 2 lbs of this stuff and spending 200 bucks on it I still have the VERY intestinal problems this product claims to cure.</li>
    <li> Awesome when blended into coffee or Almond milk.  A delicious immune boosting food.</li>
    <li> I have taken 1 t per day-- in the first month I was taking it my husband got a cold-- and for the first time ever I did not get his cold! I used to get sick if I was even near someone sick, I have had 3-4 tests of this since then --not once did I catch what others had.&lt;br /&gt;It does not mix well -- so i put it in the blender in a smoothie&lt;br /&gt;There is research on the internet about it helping all sorts of immune disorders and even spiritual beliefs that it helps with breast cancer.&lt;br /&gt;For me-- I am sold.</li>
    <li> This stuff is extremely yummy.  I polished off a whole container in one week one time. It&#x27;s extremely expensive so I decided to go with a different brand, but I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product increased my overall health. I recommend taking it for a minimum of three months to get good results.</li>
    <li> Great quality colostrum. Daniel Vitalis has been right all along. Colostrum is truly a superfood. Great for bone, joint, immune, respiratory and hormonal health. Great colostrum sourced from pastured American cows.</li>
    <li> I love the taste of this supplement. I use it daily. I give it to the kids whenever they get sniffles and they don&#x27;t get sick.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Delivery From America to Spain in About two weeks.</li>
    <li> Seems like good stuff.  Will probably purchase again.  Not sure if there are noticeable benefits, but that is because we use a lot of different supplements and eat very clean, organic foods.  It&#x27;s supposed to be great for your immune system and digestion, which is why we will probably continue to use it, as you can never have too much good of either. I learned about Surthrival brand on Patrick Timpone&#x27;s One Radio Network.  Colostrum is part of our wellness program, as prescribed in our daily smoothies by our health practitioner.</li>
    <li> is helping me with Recovery in my weight workouts and Immune system, anyone and everyone you must try this One and for the Price very Good Buy-HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS...</li>
    <li> have been searching for organic grass fed colostrum, this fits the bill! Thanks for stocking this. Mild taste hides in a smoothie.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and was satisfied.  Unfortunately, not enough people look to alternative healing.  That&#x27;s too bad.  Thanks.</li>
