      <li>, mine is 51, lol</li>
      <li>very handy to use, and the air foam saves a lot of the product.</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and the foam is pleasant too</li>
      <li>This cleanser would also be good for someone suffering from break-out.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Depends on your skin type, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
      <li>but once I heard J-Lo say she used rose scented products.</li>
      <li>The foam is really nice, and my makeup is removed with one pump.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
      <li>Great foaming action with great fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the quality of this face wash, as my face is very sensitive.  </li>
      <li>The rose smell to me is more of a cotton candy smell.</li>
      <li>So far, I am amazed at the feel, the cleansing and the smell is wonderful.</li>
      <li>so this is very important quality of this product.</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love Andalou.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure it is doing anything</li>
      <li>I love that it is all natural and it has made an incredible difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>Smells like delicious flowers and fruit, cruelty free, vegan, GMO free, and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>You get that very clean feeling without feeling like your skin is stripped.</li>
      <li>It seems to clean ok, but I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
      <li>Just the smell is worth it!</li>
      <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
      <li>It smells good enough to eat!</li>
      <li>So nice for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>All natural, no chemicals and has been great for my sensitive (aging) combination skin!</li>
      <li>It washes makeup off gently and easily without over drying skin.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced that, but I always like to put on a little moisturizer before bed, anyway.</li>
      <li>I used skin ceuticals for years, but wanted a more natural cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Smile lines disappearing after 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>With an easy to use pump that gives a mousse like dollop of the most fragrant face wash - my elderly skin is on the dry side, and this product does not make it drier.  </li>
      <li>Skin feels soft, clean and lightly fragrant after using.  </li>
      <li>Smells amazing, lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I started using this after Zia went out of business (or was bought out and stopped making my previously favorite facial cleanser).  </li>
      <li>but she said it was very inexpensive but kept her face looking like a million!</li>
      <li>Also,leaves skin feeling clean and fresh but not dry.</li>
      <li>As an esthetician, I feel this cleanser would be better suited for someone with skin that is on the younger, normal to oily side.  </li>
      <li>I still have not received andalou pure pore serum willow bark 1.1 oz and earring clip</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and gentle, and it&#x27;s lasted me a long time so far.</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding face washes that actually remove makeup (though many brands claim to), and I have been thrilled with Andalou.</li>
      <li>My face feels really clean but not dry.</li>
      <li>1000 roses is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Very gentle facial cleaner.  </li>
      <li>So far, I like all the products and my face is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough to use to remove eye makeup (in the shower).</li>
      <li>Beside, it leaves your skin soft and silky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like I can&#x27;t get the moisturizer on fast enough.</li>
      <li>It does not dry my face out too much, but I found that I still put face lotion on afterwards because I like my face moist, but others may feel differently.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and if you have eye makeup on, wash the eyes first and repeat whole face again.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
      <li>got it because it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t contain SLS and because it&#x27;s for sensitive and dry skin, plus it smells</li>

    <li> I give this cleanser only 2 stars because it does not clean the skin well at all. It is not economical as well. The smell is pleasant and the foam is pleasant too but it does not matter since this cleanser does not do what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells amazing, lasts a long time. Gentle enough to use to remove eye makeup (in the shower). Never leaves my skin dry or irritated, and I am in my mid-40&#x27;s with dry, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It cleanses without stripping my skin.  It&#x27;s the only cleanser I use now.</li>
    <li> I used skin ceuticals for years, but wanted a more natural cleanser.  1000 roses is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I still have not received andalou pure pore serum willow bark 1.1 oz and earring clip</li>

    <li> I use everything in the 1000 roses line. This wash is a foam. It washes makeup off gently and easily without over drying skin. All natural, no chemicals and has been great for my sensitive (aging) combination skin! No more breakouts!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this cleanser. I love that it is all natural and it has made an incredible difference in my skin. Beautiful results. Smile lines disappearing after 2 weeks. My skin is glowing. People keep commenting! That&#x27;s never happened before! Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> With an easy to use pump that gives a mousse like dollop of the most fragrant face wash - my elderly skin is on the dry side, and this product does not make it drier.

    <li> So far, I am amazed at the feel, the cleansing and the smell is wonderful. It is almost like a candy treat, without the calories. It smells good enough to eat! The rose smell to me is more of a cotton candy smell. A little goes a long way and if you have eye makeup on, wash the eyes first and repeat whole face again. So far, I like all the products and my face is very sensitive. I have Lupus so it is red to begin with. I can&#x27;t say for sure it is doing anything but once I heard J-Lo say she used rose scented products. Don&#x27;t know if this is the product but she said it was very inexpensive but kept her face looking like a million!</li>
    <li> It was a little drying for my skin.  As an esthetician, I feel this cleanser would be better suited for someone with skin that is on the younger, normal to oily side.  This cleanser would also be good for someone suffering from break-out.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding face washes that actually remove makeup (though many brands claim to), and I have been thrilled with Andalou. The foam is really nice, and my makeup is removed with one pump. I see some reviewers feel the product is drying. I haven&#x27;t experienced that, but I always like to put on a little moisturizer before bed, anyway. Depends on your skin type, I&#x27;m sure! The scent is lovely, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very nice product!  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Very gentle facial cleaner.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Just the smell is worth it! Also,leaves skin feeling clean and fresh but not dry. I have very dry skin so this is very important quality of this product. Plus, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product all that moisturizing. It seems to clean ok, but I don&#x27;t wear makeup. Maybe it&#x27;s meant for a younger face, mine is 51, lol</li>
    <li> Great foaming action with great fragrance. My face feels really clean but not dry.</li>
    <li> love this also!!!! very handy to use, and the air foam saves a lot of the product. Beside, it leaves your skin soft and silky.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;I got it because it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t contain SLS and because it&#x27;s for sensitive and dry skin, plus it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;It unfortunately dries my skin out - by the time I get my face washed and dried, my skin is all tight and stiff. It&#x27;s like I can&#x27;t get the moisturizer on fast enough. Oh well, back to the drawing board!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. So nice for sensitive skin. Andalou has great products.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin and this is the only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t make my face look like I have a rash after washing.</li>
