<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I suffer from eczema on my hands and arms and this is the only product that has given me almost immediate relief.  I have steroid creams from my doctor, and OTC anti-itch creams, but none come close to the effectiveness of this miracle cream.  It feels amazing on your skin and I actually enjoy the smell.  It is tea tree scented, of course, but the scent is not overpowering and fades very fast.  I am so happy that I came across this product and that I decided to give it a try for my problem skin.  It says that it relieves sunburn, diaper rash, blemishes, dermatitis, etc. and I don&#x27;t know how it does, but it really works for all of these skin conditions!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Goes on without that greasy feel.  If you don&#x27;t like the scent of Tea Tree don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> This is great healing cream, soothing for many skin irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can aggravate other contact dermatitous issues, though, so be careful. For most skin conditions I&#x27;ve encountered, though, it works very well indeed.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several years. This is the only cream to significantly improve the damaged skin on my hands, and ditto for the cracked skin on my feet. Regular use! You must use it regularly and consistently. It absorbs well and quickly and is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a somewhat medicinal smell (think Noxema), but it is not unpleasant &amp; fades quickly if you are concerned about how you smell to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important caveat for dog owners (I don&#x27;t know about cats). Tea tree oil is poisonous to dogs. I don&#x27;t know if the small concentration in this cream is enough to matter, but it would be prudent to not let a dog lick your hands for a while after applying this cream.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for skin, after shaving. Hubby uses it on his beard area</li>
    <li> I use this creme as a daily moisturizer feeling that it leaves my skin clean and protected. The moisturizing effect lasts all day. Creme smells great. Tea Tree Oil is the 1st ingredient listed and definitely lends its fragrance to the creme.</li>
    <li> the only med. used to clear a unknown rash.  Many precription med.s that never worked and cost $.  6 on hand</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning as a moisturizer and put my make-up on over it. I have oily skin and still have problems with acne but this product has helped clear my skin and heal some of my scars. I would recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Love it look younger I feel great using this product I always recommend it to people no need to wear make up</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Feels great!</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing.My son has skin problems always itching and gets dry skin spots.His doctor perscribed him ointments and they do work but not as good as this.I also like that it is natural.I apply it on my son once he is asleep.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for winter-cracked hands &amp; fingers! Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> This is a FANTASTIC product that I&#x27;ve been using for decades.  It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my skin clear and clean.  Unfortunately, the last shipment contained a product that was obviously not fresh.  The cream was already very think... which is what it tends to do when it sits on the shelt for a while.  So while I will find use for it, I will make sure that next time, I order directly from [...], bypassing any middleman delays.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Living in a sub-tropical climate, it is too easy to get a rash from sweating. I read the reviews for this, and I have used other Tea Tree oil products, so I thought I would try it. I put it on at night and could tell the difference in the morning! Now I am using this for any skin irritation. I see in other reviews that people are using this as a facial cream but I find that it clogs pores around my mouth. I will use it occasionally as a cream though because of the antibacterial properties. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I like the product.  It does smell antiseptic like and I don&#x27;t know why but I like it.  It is making my skin look nicer I am sure.  I have aging skin and it is so disappointing.  This makes it feel and look good at least until I have to re-apply anyway.</li>
    <li> I love this creme.  Other than having to mix it up in the palm of my hand to achieve a smooth warm consistency before putting on my face, this creme is wonderful. Not greasy, pleasant smell, absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way.  Definitely makes my skin feel supple and smooth.</li>
    <li> These products are the best ones for my need and use.  I rate them the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The books are true life happenings from the past and the present time.  They give us much to think about in how we receive what the Lord Jesus has for each of us.</li>
    <li> good stuff price is right</li>
    <li> Have used for years and find it indispensable.</li>
    <li> usedthis product for years love it</li>
