      <li>The quality is so-so, the stencils are HUGE (no normal person could use those unless you wanted to have clown or drag eyebrows), the powder colors aren&#x27;t natural.</li>
      <li>not what I was expecting, the colors are different the texture of the powder is not good (doesn&#x27;t stay on for long) good brushes in the kit</li>
      <li>when I try to do winged eyeliner, it frequently looks like I&#x27;ve applied it with a sharpie, using my left hand, while standing in a moving bus).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how many people have JET BLACK eyebrows!  </li>

    <li> Good product, will order again</li>
    <li> The stencils are pretty large making them unable to use in my brows. The tweezers are low quality. The brushes are okay and the brow powder is okay. I was really excited to get this kit and was disappointed by it. I&#x27;ve only used it once...you&#x27;d be better off using your money on an anastasia brow wiz or powder.</li>
    <li> I just received my brow perfect in the mail. I couldnt find the right stencil for my eyebrows. I am 53 and never really cared about eyebrows. I have a very fine line of eyebrows. I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep on trying.</li>
    <li> The brushes are my favorite part about the kit but when I received the kit the eyebrow powder was broken and that was a big let down because that&#x27;s the main reason why I ordered the kit.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. My 17 year old loves it!</li>
    <li> The eyebrown shaper is too big</li>
    <li> I am not blessed with girly-girl skills. I really struggle with makeup (when I try to do winged eyeliner, it frequently looks like I&#x27;ve applied it with a sharpie, using my left hand, while standing in a moving bus). So consequently, the prospect of doing anything with my eyebrows has always been terrifying to me. But this kit was utterly wonderful!! All the tools were easy to use and the stencil was PERFECT for my eyebrow shape. Also, as a person who doesn&#x27;t use make-up much, I don&#x27;t really have a lot of brushes/tools/make up accessories. But you get so much stuff in this little kit for such a great price!! You have everything you need!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend!! :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this kit. Everything that you need in one handy case and it is so easy to use. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who writes these reviews but let see if this get published. You have to be a makeup artist to use this kits. The eyebrow stencils must be meant for ladies with large eyebrows, they are all large. Tried it and I look like a clown.</li>
    <li> There are problems with the kit.  The instructions seemed to be partially missing and the brushes keep falling off the sticks....</li>
    <li> I never thought I could get my eyebrows to look as good as this! The kit makes it so easy. Everything you need is right there at your fingertips. I definitely recommend this kit to anyone who wants perfect eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Great product, the stencils are easy &amp; fun.</li>
    <li> It should have come with instructions.  The tweezer is cheap, and the stencils are difficult to situate so both eyebrows are symmetrical.  I was excited when I received it for Christmas and extremely disappointed I waited for a gift I can&#x27;t truly utilize.</li>
    <li> I wish there were actual eyebrow pencils included in this kit, it works ok.</li>
    <li> Great product, for someone not blessed with natural brow shaping skills these tools will get you look you desire, it did for me at least. I used everything in it. Would recommend this for beginners brow shapers.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. The kit is so cheap! Nothing in it is quality and the case broke after a week!!! Awful.</li>
    <li> Love it...I have very thin eyebrows and this made them look full and the stencils are easy to use.</li>
    <li> All right. Color are good but tweezers is dull</li>
    <li> This was bought as christmas Gift. Cannot give any review at this time. I am hoping she will love it.</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it looks cheap quality not worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> Great selection of powders to mix and match to my color.  Nice brushes.  GREAT customer service, even a month after purchase they are there with great suggestions and instruction!</li>
    <li> Very hard to use the stencils. Have to have someone else do it for you otherwise you&#x27;ll have two different shapes. The tweezers are worthless, the scissors are too. The zipper broke after the first use. Not impressed at all!!!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it, it was perfect</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, the kit was nice, would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have always used an eyebrow pencil but filling in my eyebrows with powder maintains its shape and lasts all day! I really have enjoyed having a stencil to guide me on shaping my eyebrows. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to make their morning routine a little easier as well as keeping a perfect brow! Thank you this product it awesome!</li>
    <li> I only bought this for the stencils. The stencils are great. However when I tried using the tweezers they were terrible. Every time I tried pulling an eyebrow the hair would just slide off. No matter how I held the tweezers tight. My three dollar tweezers worked better than the one provided. I like the eyebrow powered provided. The scissors did not work that well nor the razor. The zipper alone keeps getting stuck when trying to open or close it. I was hoping for a lot better quality kit for the $30 I spend on.</li>
    <li> Has everything I need, and receive emails from them to give me tips of styling my eyebrows. Love this product and my eyebrows now!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this.  I gave it 2 stars for the stencils (which are CLEAR) and utensils.  As far as the eyebrow colors……SMH I don&#x27;t know who in the world can wear these colors.  If you are a person who is of color this is not for you.  I&#x27;m not sure how many people have JET BLACK eyebrows!  Luckily, I had a eyebrow powder that works with my complexion, but I would like like a clown if I had to depend on these colors…I could probably use the colors as an eyeshadow or something… :/</li>
    <li> not what I was expecting, the colors are different the texture of the powder is not good (doesn&#x27;t stay on for long) good brushes in the kit</li>
    <li> I do drag and absolutely have to have fabulous brows.  This kit does the trick for a queen on a budget.  Everything I need to create the perfect brow.  The stencils are divine.  The powders flawless and the brushes are perfection.  If you do drag and are looking for the best brow kit for the best price - this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous seller, quick shipping and all around 5 star experience.</li>
    <li> I have never been into makeup and spent little time on my eyebrows. Then when chemo forced me to notice. I had no hair and eyebrows are important.

The quality is so-so, the stencils are HUGE (no normal person could use those unless you wanted to have clown or drag eyebrows), the powder colors aren&#x27;t natural. The only thing I use in this entire kit is the scissors.</li>
