      <li>Do not mistake them for something like a mint toothpick as they are way more strong.  </li>
      <li>Just the right amount of cinnamon! !</li>
      <li>Strong cinnamon flavor</li>
      <li>Strong flavor.</li>
      <li>I think the splintering could be potentially hazardous considering you are using them in your mouth hole with a possibility of inadvertently swallowing tiny pointy shards of wood, which couldn&#x27;t be a good thing to happen.</li>
      <li>Thursday Plantation is NOT cruelty free.</li>
      <li>One 2 pack was fantastic.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy these.  </li>
      <li>very powerful.</li>
      <li>nothing too special.</li>
      <li>However, it gives off a very strong cinnamon taste, which is actually quite refreshing.</li>
      <li>Overall a good chew stick</li>
      <li>Now, the taste isn&#x27;t really sweet, at all.</li>
      <li>Good alternative to gum, especially if you have braces, retainer, etc.</li>
      <li>If some spice deters you, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend them, even though it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
      <li>They have really helped, but be aware the cinnamon flavor is VERY strong and he got a couple of irritated spots in his mouth.</li>
      <li>I got the cinnamon and the regular tea tree flavor chewing sticks, and I could not be more pleased.</li>
      <li>Beyond that, I enjoy the cinnamon flavor very much.</li>
      <li>Very tasty and strong flavor (cinnamon/tea tree oil, but predominately tastes like cinnamon).  </li>
      <li>They taste great, and the flavor lasts for awhile, not as long on the cinnamon flavor, more so on the tea tree which is essentially a mint flavor.</li>
      <li>Well packaged and it arrived exactly on time!</li>
      <li>These could be great if they weren&#x27;t so heavily dowsed in flavor.</li>
      <li>Not enough of an issue to keep me from loving this product.</li>
      <li>Fun to chew on at work.</li>
      <li>Love the natural chewing sticks.</li>
      <li>You get used to this pretty quick.  </li>
      <li>I came right online and purchased two packages for him.</li>
      <li>Apparently there is more than one place these can come from.</li>
      <li>You do generally want to chew on them as you will get more flavor from them that way.</li>
      <li>I prefer the taste of the cinnamon, but the cinnamon sticks tend to shred really quick, not so much with the tea tree.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>My favorite part abotu them is that they don&#x27;t not shred up and cause splinters like regular toothpicks.</li>
      <li>Too hot burned my lips.</li>
      <li>They are shaped exactly like a fancy toothpick with one pointed side and one fancy side.  </li>
      <li>My only reason for four stars and not five is because I would prefer more cinnamon.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine bought me a pack of these a few months ago and I loved them--</li>
      <li>A friend whom I suggested the picks to, reported the same (seemingly lack of) quality control issue, but recently had another order of the good picks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and they tend to splinter and become soft mush rather quick.</li>
      <li>These chewing sticks are  tasty and just strong enough to satisfy my smoking urge for awhile, I also like the container it come in, I can throw it in my purse or put it in my pocket.</li>
      <li>These were recommended by a smoking cessation counselor and my husband really likes them.</li>
      <li>: Really does freshen breath, wont knock out that liver and onions though.</li>
      <li>Thanks  Erik</li>
      <li>They are also made from Birch which is a very renewable tree to grow.</li>
      <li>You really aren&#x27;t supposed to ingest much tea tree oil</li>
      <li>That being said the flavor is different than i was expecting but not a bad thing.</li>
      <li>Other&#x27;s (like me) will like the flavor and think the sticks are cool!  </li>
      <li>I thought these were the greatest ting until i read that tea tree oil is bad for your liver.</li>
      <li>I love these chewing sticks, they pack a little heat!</li>
      <li>They really stand up to chewing and fidgeting with like no other toothpick could even aspire to.</li>
      <li>The other was soaked in tea tree oil, had no cinnamon, and was super brittle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just the right amount of cinnamon! ! I&#x27;ve been using these to quit smoking!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love these! Got them for someone as a smoking cessation tool. They love them, so I ordered for myself as a appetite suppressant. They work great for all that and fresh breath. Beware: for the weak, they are strong, or &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; as my daughter says.</li>
    <li> Great for that oral fixation....soothing too ! I like the long lasting oils and the wood shreds, bends, but doesnt break or hurt you.</li>
    <li> TASTE GREAT AND GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Soooooo overpowering. These could be great if they weren&#x27;t so heavily dowsed in flavor. The tea tree oil makes me nearly gag and long term use of these resulted in every day headaches. I would NOT RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffers. Teens and adults love these. Have them in our car for after dinner fresh breath and they taste great.</li>
    <li> Great help since I stopped smoking</li>
    <li> My husband just recently stopped smoking in the last few months and these are a Godsend for him. helps with the oral dependency.</li>
    <li> The shipping and delivery was great like always with prime. The taste on these last the entire time you chew it, however there is a catch. I ordered the cinnamon packs, and while they do have some cinnamon flavor its not much and doesn&#x27;t last as long. I previously had the Hotlix picks which had intense hot cinnamon flavor as long as they lasted. These picks have some cinnamon but it fades and is overcome by the menthol and tea tree flavor. The menthol and tea tree flavors are strong but not overwhelming and do last the entire time. That being said the flavor is different than i was expecting but not a bad thing. They don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the Hotlix picks though. I tend to aggressively chew these while i study and they tend to splinter and become soft mush rather quick. Overall a good chew stick but if you are looking for that cinnamon flavor these are not your best pick!</li>
    <li> The Package: Came in a bubblewrapped envelope with the actual package inside. The stick package itself is about the height of a toothpick, 1.5\\&quot; wide, about a inch deep, clear plastic with a label on it, (as shown by the picture) nothing too special. The sticks are somewhat packed in there tight, so getting the first few out is a little bothersome, but hardly an issue.  The Product: To be entirely too specific, they&#x27;re toothpick shaped, with one end being flat with an ever so small crevice carved into the same end (for aesthetics i suppose?). Now, the taste isn&#x27;t really sweet, at all. However, it gives off a very strong cinnamon taste, which is actually quite refreshing. It yields some heat a first, something akin to weak Tabasco type heat. You get used to this pretty quick.  Overall: Really does freshen breath, wont knock out that liver and onions though. Good alternative to gum, especially if you have braces, retainer, etc. If some spice deters you, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend them, even though it&#x27;s not bad at all. Otherwise, buy them. Good taste, good habit, great product.</li>
    <li> I have used these since the dentist told me I needed 750 dollars worth of peridontal surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Started using these after meals now my trips to the dentist twice a year are happy times!!&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil has a pleasant taste and picking my teeth is a priveledge to do since I am in my 70&#x27;s and have all of my own teeth!!</li>
    <li> A girl in my son&#x27;s college class had these and he came home and HAD to have them!  I came right online and purchased two packages for him. He&#x27;s in heaven! He loves them.  They are a little pricey but they go a long way and sometimes you just gotta have something when you want it.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is an antiseptic--consider how good this is for your gums and your breath.  Beyond that, I enjoy the cinnamon flavor very much.</li>
    <li> I love chewing on these, the flavor is robust and freshens breath but they do fall apart really fast which is kind of a bummer!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 - 2 packs. One 2 pack was fantastic. The other was soaked in tea tree oil, had no cinnamon, and was super brittle. You really aren&#x27;t supposed to ingest much tea tree oil and it made me nautious. I had to throw away two packs. Try to buy these in a store!</li>
    <li> Too hot burned my lips.</li>
    <li> Great tool for helping to break bad habits...nail biting, smoking, overeating.  Packs quite a flavorful punch!  They can be addicting!</li>
    <li> So awesome! Strong cinnamon flavor</li>
    <li> The cinnamon teatree oil sticks were great for me as a cigarette deterrent. They helped me get past the whole \\&quot;oral fixation\\&quot; thing. Anytime I wanted a cigarette I just chewed on one of these.</li>
    <li> Bought these to help husband quit dipping.</li>
    <li> Fun to chew on at work. And I love the cinnamon flavor. Great price on amazon makes this a great add on product.</li>
    <li> Normally these toothpicks are great. But in this case they were dry and had lost almost all their flavor and fragrance. A great disappointment. I will still go with Thursday Plantation, because they are better than others on the market, but I prob won&#x27;t by them online anymore as I can&#x27;t verify their sell by date. In this case I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> Very tasty and strong flavor (cinnamon/tea tree oil, but predominately tastes like cinnamon).  Some people will find the taste too strong and feel weird about chewing a stick to freshen their breath.  Other&#x27;s (like me) will like the flavor and think the sticks are cool!  Give em a try and see what you think.</li>
    <li> The only toothpicks my husband will use!</li>
    <li> Professially Delivered!</li>
    <li> These toothpicks are great for chewing on and they have a lot of flavor. My favorite part abotu them is that they don&#x27;t not shred up and cause splinters like regular toothpicks.</li>
    <li> Love the flavor, but they sometimes split when I use them.</li>
    <li> I got the cinnamon and the regular tea tree flavor chewing sticks, and I could not be more pleased. The flavor is powerful and very long lasting. In fact the flavor outlasts the sticks themselves. My only complaint would be some of the sticks are weak and break easily. Not enough of an issue to keep me from loving this product.</li>
    <li> NOT chew sticks but simply tooth picks so they should definitely change this listing.    Thanks  Erik</li>
    <li> Stopped smoking my pipe by using these toothpicks.  I continue to buy them to reduce plaque on my teeth since Tea Tree is a natural antiseptic.  Worked great for both uses.</li>
    <li> These are not chew sticks, they are toothpicks! They allowed me to stop smoking with very little cravings. They taste great, and the flavor lasts for awhile, not as long on the cinnamon flavor, more so on the tea tree which is essentially a mint flavor. I prefer the taste of the cinnamon, but the cinnamon sticks tend to shred really quick, not so much with the tea tree. They smell great and taste great what more could you need... beats a cigarette any day.</li>
    <li> I thought these were the greatest ting until i read that tea tree oil is bad for your liver. even in small amounts.</li>
    <li> Not worth the time. Taste is terrible, not mnuch flavor like any tea I&#x27;ve had. Poor quality on the package I received, Many slivers, not smooth finish to them at all.</li>
    <li> Great stuff here! It leaves a nice tingle in your mouth. Only thing is, if you chew on the end that is not pointed, be ready to have some let over wood chips in your mouth. Great flavor though</li>
    <li> These chewing sticks chew very well and don&#x27;t splinter like ordinary toothpicks. My only reason for four stars and not five is because I would prefer more cinnamon.</li>
    <li> I have bought these now twice for my husband who recently quit chewing tobacco and he loves the taste. Good!</li>
    <li> Brilliant product,and exactly as advertised! Well packaged and it arrived exactly on time!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these.  It is something I can chew on a bit and get a nice flavor from.  They help with bad breath and are an okay substitute for snacking.  These have a very strong flavor.  I&#x27;d go so far as to say they burn a bit.  Do not mistake them for something like a mint toothpick as they are way more strong.  They are shaped exactly like a fancy toothpick with one pointed side and one fancy side.  You do generally want to chew on them as you will get more flavor from them that way.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband who recently quit smoking. They have really helped, but be aware the cinnamon flavor is VERY strong and he got a couple of irritated spots in his mouth. You have to put them in and out of your mouth and not hold them in one spot for too long. These were recommended by a smoking cessation counselor and my husband really likes them.</li>
    <li> Flavor is good but prepare to be very careful as they are flimsy and fragile as crap and splinter quickly. I think the splintering could be potentially hazardous considering you are using them in your mouth hole with a possibility of inadvertently swallowing tiny pointy shards of wood, which couldn&#x27;t be a good thing to happen. Definitely keep away from kids.</li>
    <li> Weren&#x27;t even cinnamon although they were advertised as so, and even said on the sticker on the back of the package that they were cinnamon, and definitely were not.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine bought me a pack of these a few months ago and I loved them-- they are the perfect after-meal toothpick because the spicy cinnamon flavor makes your mouth fresh.  ALso great if you&#x27;re feeling hungry and can&#x27;t eat for a while-- the strong flavor kind of distracts from hunger.</li>
    <li> These chewing sticks are  tasty and just strong enough to satisfy my smoking urge for awhile, I also like the container it come in, I can throw it in my purse or put it in my pocket.</li>
    <li> Great product! Lasts a long time. Strong flavor. Great packaging. This is NOT a toothpick. It&#x27;s a chew-stick! Love them.</li>
    <li> very powerful. i am currently using these to help me quit smoking and it works. the flavor is long lasting and keeps my mouth fresh</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great for after dinner.  They&#x27;re great when your sitting on a couch.  They&#x27;re great for when your working.  I love these.</li>
    <li> I love these chewing sticks, they pack a little heat!</li>
    <li> WARNING! Thursday Plantation is NOT cruelty free. This company DOES test on animals!</li>
    <li> I order these frequently in both the cinnamon and Tea Tree flavors. They really stand up to chewing and fidgeting with like no other toothpick could even aspire to. They are also made from Birch which is a very renewable tree to grow. Don&#x27;t let the sticker shock stop you. 1 or 2 sticks lasts for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Apparently there is more than one place these can come from. My first order was awesome and I bragged them up to everyone for how well they held up, but my last 2 orders have decreased in quality, fall in apart quite quickly. A friend whom I suggested the picks to, reported the same (seemingly lack of) quality control issue, but recently had another order of the good picks.&lt;br /&gt;flavor is awesome for both flavors and quantity is great.</li>
    <li> Your basic flavored toothpick.  Good flavor.  Spicy cinnamon!</li>
    <li> Love the natural chewing sticks. Great for someone trying to quit a bad habit such as tobacco products. Great cinnamon taste!</li>
    <li> I used these to quit smoking. It was still a tough go, but it has worked. I&#x27;m still chewing on these sticks. A little less each day. It&#x27;s been about two months since I&#x27;ve had a cigarette.</li>
    <li> Sharp flavor! Lovely.</li>
