### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It was a gift, which the recipient loved</li>
      <li>your product is a &amp;#34;NO NO!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll give you one star for a comical pun on the name!</li>
      <li>NO NO, but you sure lived up to the name....</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t give any more info.</li>
      <li>I got a better result, probably because I don&#x27;t ever shave my arms and the hair is finer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad.</li>
      <li>but I kept hoping that somehow magically I would get it to work.</li>
      <li>I was really, really hoping it would be as good as it is advertised.</li>
      <li>First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).</li>
      <li>It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.</li>
      <li>This did an OK job of removing the peach fuzz on my cheeks, but I could never get it to remove the hair from my upper lip.  </li>
      <li>She is sure the product works well for younger users with thicker skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this product received good reviews, and I can&#x27;t understand why the product still advertises on TV.</li>
      <li>It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>To treat a large area you would need to spend hours on it.</li>
      <li>I ordered it for a specific purpose and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>I never got the whole leg because it did not burn the hair, it did burn my skin, and the sand paper...</li>
      <li>bought the product on a special discount using a promo on the TV commercial.</li>
      <li>It takes too long to use and it doesn&#x27;t get your legs smooth.</li>
      <li>When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial.</li>
      <li>After 3 uses, it stop working completely.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, if you are looking to buy this thing, donate that money to a charity - at least you&#x27;ll feel good about it afterwards instead.</li>

    <li> That is only because  there is no 0 stairs. Its a total rip off.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial. It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is nothing like it claims. First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing). When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming. I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result. To treat a large area you would need to spend hours on it. It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway. The product claims that it will not grow back over time, but the hair does grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product on a special discount using a promo on the TV commercial. I was worried about getting my money back given how false the other claims were. It took some aggressive screaming over the phone to get them to give me a refund, but they never refunded the cost of shipping the No!no! unit back even though in their advertising they promise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2) Did not work on all hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4) Hair grew back&lt;br /&gt;5) Return process was difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO! NO! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> Despite some troubling reviews, I bought the NoNo Pro and I like it!</li>
    <li> This did an OK job of removing the peach fuzz on my cheeks, but I could never get it to remove the hair from my upper lip.  I stuck with it for 3 weeks and used it multiple times, but the upper lip hair was always still there.  I would not spend the money on it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair to smoothness. Seems to only singe the tip of the hair leaving stubble that grows back in a matter of a few hours.</li>
    <li> Terrible product that is entirely overpriced. I would have returned it but received it as gift and it was too late. I feel bad for the person that bought it because I gave it a chance and did exactly what the instructions said but with no real results. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Save and go get laser or electrolysis.</li>
    <li> I Bought this product after watching the infomercial- seemed legit.  Well, it&#x27;s total junk! I found myself constantly going over and over just one small part of my leg before any result was found. The real result on the small part was after I used the sand paper. Let me stress, this was only a small area of my leg and it took at least 30 minutes for that one small part. I tried the long hair on my arm. I got a better result, probably because I don&#x27;t ever shave my arms and the hair is finer. Another fact, you will get burned. My No No started to skip over my leg when I would get to my knee or the outline of my muscle. I would go back again to get that part and would burn myself.  Also, dealing with customer service was awful when I tried to return before the trial period was up. My money was never refunded, I finally gave up and called it a loss. No No did not work for me, maybe I did it wrong, maybe I did not have the time to do it, maybe mine was defective. Either way, I felt this product was misrepresented on TV for my needs. I understood that you would have to use the product, buff, then use again, and eventually hair growth would be slow growing. I never got the whole leg because it did not burn the hair, it did burn my skin, and the sand paper...I could purchase at my local hardware store (crazy).  I&#x27;m not sure why this product received good reviews, and I can&#x27;t understand why the product still advertises on TV. This is my opinion and mine only, but as someone who bought the product late one night after watching all the celebrities say how it changed their lives, I was suckered into a purchase.  I had to learn the hard way and I say to anyone looking to buy.....&amp;#34;save your money!&amp;#34;  Sorry NO NO, but you sure lived up to the name....your product is a &amp;#34;NO NO!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll give you one star for a comical pun on the name!</li>
    <li> I do not understand some of the comments on this product.  I ordered it for a specific purpose and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> TRASH!!!! Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money on this. I should have returned it for my money back but I kept hoping that somehow magically I would get it to work. It smells terrible as it burns the hair off your limbs and doesn&#x27;t even do a good job at that. Seriously, if you are looking to buy this thing, donate that money to a charity - at least you&#x27;ll feel good about it afterwards instead. So, I&#x27;m back to waxing and my trusty epilator. If this review steers at least ONE person from making the same mistake I did. I&#x27;m glad. This product should really not be on the market it&#x27;s junk and false advertising</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work as good as they show on TV :(</li>
    <li> It takes too long to use and it doesn&#x27;t get your legs smooth. I don&#x27;t have that amount of time to dedicate to shave my legs</li>
    <li> Worst product ever!!! Hate it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin feeling raw and red, PEELING FOR DAYS AFTER USE!!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t remove hair just melts it to the skin, then you have to buff off the burnt ends.&lt;br /&gt;STINKS your entire house with burning hair smell and it remains in your nose for hours.&lt;br /&gt;Awful product  !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was a gift, which the recipient loved but I can&#x27;t give any more info.</li>
    <li> I want to return the NONO for a refund.  Purchased it for my wife who is unable to use it alone, she is 70 years old.  She has very thin loose skin.  She is unable to use the NONO without another person to hold the skin as taut as is needed for using the NONO.  She is sure the product works well for younger users with thicker skin.&lt;br /&gt;Please send me a return shipping label with Return Authorization.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for me.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I received one of these blue shavers as a gift.  I was really, really hoping it would be as good as it is advertised. I also read some of the negative feed back but I was hoping these people were wrong.  Warning...don&#x27;t bother to even try it.  It takes forever to remove a few hairs.  When it finally works, the smell of burned hair is disgusting.  After 3 uses, it stop working completely.  When I received it, the box looked like it had been previously purchased and returned by someone.  Save your money &amp; go back to shaving the regular way.  I&#x27;m so disappointed &amp; now this gift has to be returned by the purchaser.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use.</li>
