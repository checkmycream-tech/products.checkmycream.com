<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The device barely straightens the lashes.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite new beauty tool.  It took some practice, but works excellent for me.  My lashes are blond, fine, long and straight and I get just the right amount of natural looking curl.  I agree with other reviewers that it does require frequent battery changes, but it is worth it to me.  I use Maybelline Great Lash, apply 1 coat (so I can see my lashes), curl and then 2nd coat on just the tips.  The mascara does need to be cleaned off the comb frequently doing it this way, but this works best for me.  I purchased this almost a year ago and it still works perfectly.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Does not work. Doesn&#x27;t even maintain a curl for longer than five minutes. Waste of money. Would return if possible.</li>
    <li> These are great for putting a natural curl in false strip lashes without pulling the lashes off, as with a mechanical curler.  It also works really well for smoothing out mascara--no more clumps!  Really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read previous reviews about the battery not lasting but, as with many battery-operated devices, the battery is drained even when the device is off.  I take the battery out after use and I&#x27;ve had the same one for over a month.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this curling wand. It&#x27;s the only thing that has worked so far on my straight, Asian lashes. Really helps to give them a nice curl after using an eyelash curler and mascara.</li>
    <li> This is just a little piece of junk in my opinion! Don&#x27;t waste your money...it doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to use it as it was described.  It is not something that I will recommend or use.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Simple...right? Wrong. It&#x27;s simple if it actually works. Sorry to disappoint, but the product did not curl or heat up just enough to add even a little bend. Enough said:(</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this, I was extremely excited to receive it.  My eyelashes are straight as a board, and regular eyelash curlers didn&#x27;t do much for me either.  I used the product as directed, and unfortunately, got no results.  My eyelashes didn&#x27;t curl hardly any.  I even tried applying a little mascara first, letting it dry, and then curl, but all that did was melt all my mascara off.  Perhaps this might work for someone with longer, thicker eyelashes...but it did nothing for me.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.</li>
    <li> Mine broke after only 4 months. It no longer turns on with a new battery. No obvious reasons why. Otherwise I liked the product</li>
    <li> I have used another brand of heated eyelash curler which used up my batteries rather quickly. This curling iron doesn&#x27;t have this problem. In addition, I really enjoy the fact that it has a change of color on the back of the curler which identifies when the iron is heated.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyelash curler and I honestly can&#x27;t understand how anyone gave this less than 5 stars! I have straight eyelashes that point almost downward, and normal eyelash curlers leave my eyelashes crimped no matter how I use them. I have tried what seems like a MILLION products, and this by far is the BEST. While other heated curlers of similar design worked well at my curling lashes, they did not allow me to re-curl once I had applied my mascara. This one can be used before or after mascara application (or if you are me before AND after). I found this device VERY easy to use and was really surprised to read reviews claiming otherwise.</li>
    <li> This has always been in the back of my mind since a review from Eki at ekimura.com quite a long time ago, and my interest was renewed after seeing a version in Sephora.  I would say this adds upwards curl, and I think is best used as an evening refresher.  In the morning I find that if I do not let my (fiber) mascara completely dry, this curler will melt the mascara off.  In the evening this is a good way to refresh your curl without gunking up your regular eyelash curlers.  Finally - despite the fact that I have not experienced any issues yet, I am slightly wary of using this while wearing contacts.  Overall I think it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll have to experiment with to see if it works for you, and it is a bit overhyped in Youtube and Blogger reviews.  The sparkly blue cap is a nice touch.  (:</li>
    <li> Goes through batteries but works I still am using it</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail and didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it out for a while but when I finally opened it and put the battery in and tried to turn it on... nothing happened. Wouldn&#x27;t turn on and it wasn&#x27;t the battery. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited for this product after debating for a year. Eki at ekimura has stuck with this product for quite a while so that lured me in even more. The product is not /bad/, but it&#x27;s not the best either. I have short and straight lashes so it has always been troublesome to keep them up and curved. Maybe I just haven&#x27;t mastered at using this heater. It does lift my lashes a bit but they don&#x27;t stay curled much.</li>
    <li> Just followed the reviews on how to use this and I love it.  Works great for my thin and stubby lashes - especially when I have mascara on.  Seems to melt the mascara and form the lashes how I want them while brushing clumps out of them.  Also great for forming my lashes before adhering false lashes so that they blend well.</li>
    <li> Does NOTHING. It stopped working after first week. BOOO !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes through your lashes but the heat provided is very VERY minimal and your eyelashes will look the same afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bueno.</li>
    <li> This is soo hard to use, and it probably works way better on a person with longer lashes. Other than that, it heats up fast and curls after a hundred strokes on my short asian lashes.</li>
    <li> This curled, just as it said.  However, I did notice on the 3rd use that the indicator light that tells you when it&#x27;s ready didn&#x27;t change but it still heated.  Anyways, it surely made my lashes looked longer &amp; combed through them at the same time.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife has tried them all... Most recently a curler from Sephora. I went through two dozen of them and found the best and after a few days it fell apart. We went back to them and it happened over and over. The Panasonic has a great battery life. Good product.</li>
    <li> it curls, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was interested in the idea of an eyelash curler that would not break off your eyelashes so I ordered this one. I am very pleased with it and it works best when you have mascara on (your favorite brand will do), which you could never do with a regular curler. The only caution here is that it is a good idea to watch the YouTube video on how to use it (just type in &#x27;heated eyelash curler&#x27;) if you have never used one. If it touches your skin, it can slightly burn, however, it IS easy to get used to and you do get a nice, natural curl (without pull) that will last throughout the day or evening.</li>
    <li> Bought this off of a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  Was skeptical after reading some of the reviews on Amazon but decided to give it a try.  I am always looking for new gadgets to improve my routine anyhow.  Unfortunately I should have went with the other reviews that this doesn&#x27;t really work.  This eyelash curler does not curl very well and I was so hoping to use heat to make the curl last like when I curl my hair for the day. My hair curls easily too but this tool is not easy to use.  I&#x27;m a girly girl so I&#x27;m use to using all sorts of gadgets but this is just difficult to use and took too much time for so-so results.    You have to angle it just right and lay your mascara on thick before using because of the heat it takes a lot of it off.  The battery life runs out quickly and you can&#x27;t use rechargeable batteries on it so it&#x27;s a waste of money if you use it a lot.     I just made my own perfect heated eyelash curler since I wasn&#x27;t able to find a good one.  I&#x27;m back to using THE BEST eyelash curler my trusty metal curler by Shiseido.  Now I heat up the rubber part of it for a few seconds with my blow dryer and wha la the perfect heated eyelash curler with lashes that last all day.    I so wanted to return this but it works well at de-clumping. When I put my mascara on and some of my lashes get stuck together I use it to unclump them.  Works great since it takes off excess mascara with the heat and separates each lash.  I use it to comb out my lashes for that defined look and take off excess mascara so I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon.     I highly recommend this product as a de-clumper but not as a curler.</li>
    <li> This heated eyelash curler was recommended by a friend.  I&#x27;ve tried it a couple of times and still need to practice.  One of the suggestions that I read that has worked for me is to apply some mascara FIRST and then use the curler.</li>
    <li> I tried this out and it does nothing!  Do not buy this!  This heats up and that&#x27;s it!  I did buy a curler that heats up but it&#x27;s the one you crimp and use heat.  Get that one!  I love the other one.  Don&#x27;t waist your time with this one people!</li>
    <li> I got these after some research. It&#x27;s been a year and still love it. It heat up pretty fast and will not burn your lids if used correctly. Without it my lashes flat out within 2 hours, but this curler hold up the curl at least 8 hours. For short-lashed or coarse-haired, this is essential.</li>
    <li> Took forever to never to heat up. The indicator never worked. I returned it.</li>
    <li> At least, it doesn&#x27;t curl MY lashes... I got this because the reviews were pretty positive, and I saw a couple of Asian Make-Up Guru YouTubers using this (or a similar product) to curl their lashes. Tried the same techniques both through watching videos and reading this curler&#x27;s instruction manual. It doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes, which point straight down (seriously), so I&#x27;ve mainly used it for finishing touches to get the crimps out of my lashes - which I get from using a normal curler. It&#x27;s really good at separating my lashes though, so there&#x27;s that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people have said that it drains the AA battery really quickly. For this reason I bought a bunch of Dollar Store batteries. I&#x27;ve found that I can get 4-6 uses per battery. Not sure if this is typical for everyone else.</li>
    <li> My friend was doing make up on me and swears by this heat lash curler, she said she had tried so many brands and this one is the best by far.  I was told that this item was discontinued but I found it on Amazon.  I am not one to wear make up but I started wearing mascara because of the results I have seen, I get compliments everywhere, a lot of times I get asked if it was fake because it looked so good.    The only con is that I have to switch to a new battery about every 10-14 days, but it is totally worth it.  Please follow directions and put on a layer of mascara before applying heat lash curler, afterwards keep applying until you reach desired length and thickness.</li>
    <li> I bought this heated curler because my traditional eyelash curler was breaking off my lashes. The Panasonic did curl my lashes (although not as much as a regular eyelash curler). It was also good for unclumping mascara. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks it barely heated up. Changed the battery and no difference. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I have a few lashes in my upper lids that grow straight down, irritating as all get out. This picks those lashes up and bends them upward, out of the way; the effect has lasted all day, so far. I don&#x27;t use mascara with it, although you can. I tried another heated comb-type eyelash curler, but it barely heated up, using only a single \\&quot;AAA\\&quot; battery. This one uses a \\&quot;AA\\&quot; battery, so it heats up more and better (I remove the battery between uses, so as not to use it up so quickly). Has a nice little \\&quot;ready to use\\&quot; indicator (changes from deep purple to pale pink). The comb is removable -- and if you do remove it while the unit is heated, you&#x27;ll find that the heating element underneath is hot -- not just warm. The comb in place is pleasantly warm to the touch. Unit is nicely shaped and (with the battery in place) nicely weighted. Even if this doesn&#x27;t last long, I&#x27;d get another.</li>
    <li> I trust Panasonic products and love this one, too.  Very easy to use and works GREAT!!    Use it after applying mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian, and had medium length lashes for an Asian.  I tried using this eyelash curler, but didn&#x27;t like the preliminary result (didn&#x27;t curl enough, took too long to heat up and curl each day) enough to stop using my regular shu uemura eye lash curler.  I&#x27;ve been using Latisse for the past 4 months, and my lashes are notably longer (for an Asian).    Just for yucks, I tried the heated eyelash curler again, and it worked much better with longer lashes.  Because my lashes are fairly long now, using the regular eye lash curler leaves notable crimps in my lashes, and they really do curl up way too much (they tend to point straight up with normal eye lash curlers).  The Panasonic heated eyelash curler, however, gives me a soft, natural look to my lashes.      I use the heated eyelash curler PRIOR to putting on my mascara.  Using mascara after the fact does NOT at all change the natural, soft curl achieved by the heated eyelash curler.  I can see how this item would not work for everyone, but I&#x27;m sold on it enough to purchase another one for a friend!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the Panasonic heated eyelash  curler, but I gave it a try and am pleased.  Putting the heated curler on my eyelashes isn&#x27;t as scary or creepy as I expected.  It&#x27;s not that hot and there are ridges that the lashes fit into that keep the heat from your skin.  After very little practice, I&#x27;ve developed a routine that basically follows the instructions that come with the curler.  It takes a little longer - 3 seconds in each position - but the curl honestly lasts all day, unlike the regular curler.  And with the regular curler I pinched my skin often.  I haven&#x27;t hurt myself once with the Panasonic.  You put in the battery and when you turn it on and it heats up there&#x27;s a little color change spot to tell you when it&#x27;s ready.  If my Panasonic wore out, I would definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of mixed reviews on this product, I was a bit hesitant to get this curler, but after noticing that my Shiseido curler pulled out a lot of my lashes, I decided to ditch that and give this a try.    I am SO GLAD that I did.  A bit of background: I am Chinese and have stick straight, very stubborn lashes.  You can hardly see my lower lashes because they poke straight out instead of curving down.  Manual curlers would barely work on me, even though I squeezed pretty hard for a long time, and the curl rarely lasted more than an hour or so.    The Panasonic heated curler is amazing for me.  It&#x27;s much faster than my old curler, doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch, works wonders on lower lashes, and keeps the curl all day!  Make sure to use it after putting on your mascara.  I turn it on and allow it to heat up for a minute while I apply my mascara and let it dry.  The curler is warm but doesn&#x27;t burn if I touch it to my skin, so don&#x27;t be afraid of it!  Just use the comb to push your lashes up directly vertical, hold for 3 seconds, then slide it up and push the ends of your lashes slightly downwards at a 45 degree angle and hold it for another 3 seconds, and voila, perfect curl!    Not sure why it&#x27;s not working for other folks, but I think if you read the instructions, it should be fine.  I&#x27;ve read a couple of reviews that said that the brand of mascara might factor in, so for reference I can say with confidence that it works great with Cover Girl Lash Exact as well as Fairy Drops mascara from Scandal Queen.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a higher heat setting because it&#x27;s way too low and takes FOREVER to curve my lashes. Wow. Horrible.</li>
    <li> I tried this because of the price. Works real good after you get used to it. FYI: I bought a small charger for AA batteries because all these curlers go through batteries really quick.</li>
    <li> I bought it and tried to make my eyelash curler. Maybe I am not good at it. The result is so so.</li>
    <li> I have straight asian lashes, though they&#x27;re not particularly short. Not sure using this heated eyelash curler does any better than using my normal shiseido manual eyelash curler... Some reviewers recommended using this AFTER applying mascara, but I currently use the tube kind that comes off with heat so that won&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> My Lashes have never Looked so Wonderful, It&#x27;s a pleasure to use, so simple, I can even put the battery in all by myself.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product! I first wanted to test how long the curl would last, so I decided to try it overnight without mascara. I applied some lash conditioner, allowed it to dry for about 1 minute while the curler heated up, then I proceeded to curl my lashes as the instructions indicated. I am very pleased to say that I woke up 11 hours later with my lashes still curled! In the morning I washed off my conditioner, applied mascara, used the curler again, then swiped on a second coat of mascara, and the results are magnificant! My lashes have a very nice, natural-looking curl that I could not achieve with a standard curler, and it even helped to separate my lashes for a flawless look. I will be keeping rechargable batteries close by at all times so I never have to go without this beauty tool again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eying this product for a while now and finally gave in after reading several good reviews about it. I tried it first without any mascara and it didn&#x27;t curl my lashes at all. After putting mascara on, it was able to curl my lashes slightly, and after fiddling around with it for a bit I was able to get it to curl my lashes significantly (but only after first curling with a standard curler and putting on a second coat of mascara). The good thing about this heated lash curler is that you are able to curl those small corner lashes that you normally wouldn&#x27;t be able to get with a standard lash curler. It also combs out any clumps of mascara and gives a natural curl instead of that crimp you get with a normal eyelash curler. The curl also lasts longer than a curl achieved with a standard curler. But unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really curl your lashes by itself. I&#x27;ve tried different techniques and even looked at a few videos/tutorials and no matter how I use it, when I compare my lashes that have been curled with this heated lash curler and my lashes that have been curled with a standard lash curler, there is no significant difference. My lashes aren&#x27;t any more curled, longer, or faux lash-like, in fact they look almost exactly the same (except for that crimp you get with a regular curler of course). It also takes longer to curl your lashes with this than it does when you use a regular lash curler. All in all, I think it&#x27;s okay.. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than a standard lash curler. I guess I should have listened to all the other reviews.. if you already own a lash curler, save your money.. this one isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received this heated eyelash curler so hopefully it wouldn&#x27;t do that much damage to my eyelashes than a regular eyelash curler. At first I tried it out I got really fustrated since the curler took a while to heat up. There&#x27;s an indicator strip on the other side of the curler, so when it turns pink, its fully heated up. At first it took 10 minutes for the heater to heat up and I just figured the curler was busted. Then I replaced the battery and found out it wasn&#x27;t the curler that wasn&#x27;t working but the cheap battery it came with. Now it heats up in less than a minute. You don&#x27;t even need the curler to heat up all the way for you to start using it. What I also like about it is that you use it after you applied your mascara. It takes about a minute to properly curl each eyelash so it doesn&#x27;t take that much time. It gives a natural curl to your eyelashes and last, for me, for about 5 hours until it starting falling down which is still better than a regular curler. Also it has a nice comb connected to the curler to separates your lashes. Overall it was confusing at first but I really like this product now, just remember to use a good battery.</li>
    <li> Worst ever. It does not work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this heated eyelash curler for 4 years, &amp; recently lost the brush on it &amp; was delighted to find a new one available on Amazon.com!  After decades of using the old \\&quot;pinch style\\&quot; eyelash curlers - I found the Panasonic Heated Curler and was amazed at what a huge difference it made in the health &amp; appearance of my lashes.  They grew longer, and thicker (could this be due to the gentle heat?).  And the Panasonic never \\&quot;yanks them out\\&quot; like the old fashioned curler.  I just hope that Amazon continues to have the Panasonic Heated curler available for the next tine I lose mine!!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye lash curler.  it heats up very quickly and works great.  I have had other brands and this is the best&lt;br /&gt;to me.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler. It heats up pretty quickly and it is very easy to use. curls just as well as a regular eyelash curler</li>
    <li> I still have to use regular lash curler but it comes out straight up.  This one helps to curl the ends to look natural.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work......</li>
    <li> You can feel the warmth from the eyelash curler, but even pressing hard against my eyelashes (and for a long time), it doesn&#x27;t do the job.  I&#x27;m going back to my ole&#x27; faithful, regular eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> i got this item right away and works really good with japanese mascara.   came with two aired cushions with well packaged.   Thank you very much!!!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a BAD product.  It&#x27;s well made, and like I said it gets very hot. Hot enough to curl other lashes I&#x27;m sure.  It also isn&#x27;t that bulky so it&#x27;s easier to carry around than the awkwardly shaped metal eyelash curler.  It&#x27;s also easy to clean since the top piece is removable. Fits well in my hand, doesn&#x27;t feel awkward or uncomfortable.  Also the top of the curler is shaped well enough to reach the corners of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance wise: this tool lifts the lashes but does not curl them (for me).  I am half asian and have straight eyelashes that curl easily with metal eyelash curlers.  I purchased this product for more natural and permanent curl without using waterproof mascara.  I find that it ends up taking off all of my mascara (waterproof or washable) and looks worse than if I were to curl my lashes without mascara using a traditional eyelash curler.  It gets really hot and it can burn if you&#x27;re not careful (not a visible burn, just feel burning hot - it&#x27;s a little startling but nothing major). This product only works (slightly for me) with mascara on, not on naked natural lashes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping that it would be my new best friend. Boy, was I wrong. It did absolutely NOTHING to my lashes. I have long, straight lashes and it&#x27;s difficult to keep curls all day with the weighing down of mascara. I tried this curler before and after mascara. Did nothing before, and it didn&#x27;t separate all my lashes naturally after. In fact, it clumped groups of eyelashes together. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this useless thing.</li>
    <li> It takes some time for it to heat up, but worked well. I would recommend it anyone with hard to curl lashes. Also, delivery was fast &amp; efficient.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good and works on me. I tried other brand name ones and none of them worked. Becuase the it&#x27;s not hot enough and I just throw them away. After hearing good reviews about this, I decided to give this a try and I am happy that it works well. I have fine and super stubbon straight eyelashes so I have to apply mascara first then use curler. So I apply mascara first then wait until it dries completely then apply this heated curler, I got very curl eyelash and last for all day. I love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. I have come to the conclusion that heated eyelash curlers do not work.</li>
    <li> As previous reviews stated, apply mascara prior. I love it, as I get older (today I turn 50) my old metal curler frightened me. NO MORE pulling eyelashes out!</li>
    <li> My 5th heated eyelash curler, the only way to really &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the curl and smooth out your mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the AA battery vs the AAA - means the battery lasts longer, gets hotter and is more consistent than many.  If you&#x27;ve wanted to try one out, I&#x27;d recommend you go with this model despite it being about $5-8 higher priced than many similar models.  Worth the extra $.</li>
    <li> Heats up but doesn&#x27;t actually curly lashes.</li>
    <li> I brought this item few days ago and yesterday was my first day trying to use it. I think it should be use without mascara instead of using it after you apply mascara because it will melt the mascara a little bit. It really make my eyelash curl but with lots of patient because you need to wait for the product to heat up and put it on your eyelash and wait some times. You also might need to repeat the steps to ensure your lashes curl.     I personally think it takes time. But, the advantage of using this product is it won&#x27;t spoil your eyelash.</li>
    <li> I eyed this product for a couple of months and after seeing some YT tutorials, decided to get it.  Super fast shipping, as always, with Amazon.  The discounted price is very reasonable.    The product is lightweight, travel friendly and works without any hitches.  It does take a bit of time for the tool to heat up, but once it does, curling is quick and efficient.  I would recommend you store the battery outside of the tool so that it gets used up less.  I think those who don&#x27;t know how to use this product are giving the bad reviews.  As for me, I don&#x27;t like the typical eyelash curlers and wanted a tool that would minimize tug on the eye area as well as not yank out my lashes.  This tool does it all.  I have beautifully curled lashes that last all day...and I&#x27;ve noticed, even to the next day after washings.  I would highly recommend it!  Definitely look up YT tutorials on how to use it to maximize results.</li>
    <li> The curler works very well and is easy to use and clean.  The only negative is that the directions say not to use rechargeable batteries and the battery needs to be replaced at least twice a month.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
    <li> It works for someone have a lot time and patience to mess around with theirs eyelashes....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a life saver! The down side is that the energy in the batteries don&#x27;t last! I would recommend this product strongly!!!!</li>
    <li> No more medieval torture instrument necessary for nicely curled lashes.</li>
    <li> This product seems like such a great idea but it fell short. The battery lasts maybe a week if that. The colour indicator no longer works. It does give a bit of a curl to the lash but takes a while to warm up enough to use. This product has potential but as of now it falls short.</li>
    <li> I agree with some customers. This product is a waist of money. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for your lashes. They look exactly the same before and after using this curler!</li>
    <li> I love this product for curling my lashes because when I curl my lashes using a regular curler, it sometimes give me a very weird curl that doesn&#x27;t look appealing at all.  However, this gives me a much natural curl compared to the regular curler.  It is also quite cheap and even cheaper if you compare it to the high end curlers that are sold in department stores.  It heats up and cool down quickly and this is definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009DT39W Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curler, Blue]]    I bought this a few weeks ago.  I put a battery in it and nothing will make it even turn on as described. Something must be wrong with the mechanism.  I no longer have the packaging (only the instructions) and therefore cannot send it back.  Besides the hassle and postage would cost more to send it back then it would be worth.</li>
    <li> It works great! I turn it on and while waiting for it to heat up, I can do my moisturizer, foundation and eyeliner. Once it&#x27;s on, it gets quite hot if you hold it close to you so I always use a piece of cardboard to make sure the curler doesn&#x27;t touch my eyelid. I&#x27;m Asian so my eyelashes grow downward and are quite stubbon and this definitely gives them an eye-opening curl! However, after 5 uses or so, it no longer gets as hot and the indicator no longer goes pink. Tried it with a new battery and nothing. I will be trying a different eyelash curler next time.</li>
    <li> It died after 3 weeks and I hardly used it! Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work if you have thick lashes it curls them for a little while then they go flat after a little while. I&#x27;ll just stick to an old fashioned curler</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not curl my eyelashes AT ALL.  It seems pretty simple to use, but it didn&#x27;t do anything.  It was way faster &amp; way easier for me to heat up my manual curler with the hair dryer.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> If I were stranded on a desert island and could only take one item of makeup, it would be an eyelash curler.  I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all.  This one is my favorite.  This doesn&#x27;t create an angled crimp on your lashes like some of the other heated curlers I have used.  And it doesn&#x27;t pull out lashes like the metal curlers can.  The Panasonic eyelash curler works much better than the Blinc model, which has the same design.  Perhaps this is because the Panasonic&#x27;s curling platform is broader.  This allows a greater sweep of the lashes and it&#x27;s easy to hold for 3 seconds (as directed) to create the curl.  Also, I had some trouble with my mascara kind of melting after using the Blinc, and that hasn&#x27;t happened with this curler, despite what seems to be a hotter temperature.  [It does heat up quite a bit, but although I have touched my lids numerous times with the device, I have never burned them.]  I also love the snap-on cap, which keeps the curler from getting accidentally turned on while in my purse, and therefore saves battery life.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I still use the cheap drugstore metal curler before applying my mascara, and use this one after my mascara dries.</li>
    <li> It is alright. I have short lashes so I can&#x27;t tell the difference if it helps.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic Heated Eyelash Curler is a very good product. It heats up quickly enough and the color changing temperature indicator is a nice feature. My favorite feature is the removable lash comb that slides off for easy cleaning with the included brush. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Works like a flat iron only for your eyes :)</li>
    <li> I think i kinda like it(?what??)&lt;br /&gt;I mean it is really helping my lash to be more curl but they are not as curl as i expect.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after i apply my mascara. Hmmmm i kind of feel it hard to comment.&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm, i will say give it a try, if you don&#x27;t like it, just return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just not sure how this curler got so many great reviews.  It makes me wonder how many received this for free to try it out and give it good reviews.  I HATE it!!! It does not work and my eyelashes are not hard to curl.  I also followed the instructions completely.  Sending back.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes very well</li>
    <li> Takes a long time for my eyelashes to be curled and did not last long at all. I have dense and thick eyelashes but doubt this would work significantly better on other people.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to be able to curl lashes that don&#x27;t naturally curl in the \\&quot;right\\&quot; direction.  It is so-so at that and the fact that you have to remove the battery between each use (or it goes dead in 2 days even when it&#x27;s turned \\&quot;off\\&quot;) is a real negative.</li>
    <li> Works really well. small, heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a pretty handy to have around. I have long asian eyelashes and this doesnt really seem to give me as much curl as a normal eyecurler gives me. it still curls, but it&#x27;s less noticeable. The batteries definitely die fast after maybe around 5 uses? My eyelashes dont fall out when i use this as opposed to the normal eyecurler. It just doesn&#x27;t give me the oomph i want in my eyelashes. It helps separate my lashes and give them a slight natural curl. if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Well, it technically does curl your lashes but not very much. You have to hold it on for 1 minute to get anything. Then you need to apply mascara or something right away in order to keep any curl. I haven&#x27;t used it more than once since I got it. Not very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product. It did not heat up nor curl the eyelashes. I had to go and purchase a different one within 2 days. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT PROBALLY WHY ITS CHEAP IS BECASUE AFTER THE SECOND USE OF THE PRODUCT IT NO LONGER WORKS ONLY GOT 2 USES OUT OF IT</li>
    <li> Remember those old viking and gladiator movies where they stick super-heated pokers into the eyes of the dungeon dudes?  If you&#x27;ve been looking for a poker, Panasonic&#x27;s got this for you. Conveniently electrically powered, it banishes the need for a boiling caldron and the portability...awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this thing gets so hot it would burn a bathroom cabinet. Definitely not for kids or me. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic heated eyelash curler really works but the downside is that it uses the AA battery up after about two uses which is a pain if you dont have a new battery every other day!</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler much better than the normal eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used for years.  I think my eyelashes look longer and I lose fewer lashes with this than with the &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; type curler.  It doesn&#x27;t curl up my lashes quite as much as the other, but overall I prefer it.  This is what I use now &amp; I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchase this product from watching a youtuber. It can get really hot so becareful when using it. I have asian lashes, therefore it&#x27;s thin &amp; it don&#x27;t stay curl all day but this really does the trick.</li>
    <li> This is the best heated eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used!  I was having a problem with traditional eyelash curlers - they were just bending my lashes.  With this heated lash curler, my eyes look so much more open and my lashes look so much longer.  I use it before applying mascara and then again after I apply mascara and my lashes hold a curl all day long.  Really makes a big difference in how much longer my lashes look.</li>
    <li> Curled burns eye..no adjustments - gets way too hot!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t heat up hot enough or grip my eyelashes well enough to curl them.</li>
    <li> I got it based on a YouTube review by a beauty guru. Her lashes were amazing and long; almost fake-looking. I have long lashes myself; and was looking forward tot he noticeable progression of length. It didn&#x27;t occur. Don&#x27;t misunderstand, the product was working. The purple turns to pink when it heats up and blah-blah-blah. It just didn&#x27;t produce a difference. I was better off spending the money I bought this with on some new mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. ^.^</li>
    <li> I have Asian lashes. This means they go straight out and down instead of curling up nicely. It gives the illusion that I don&#x27;t have lashes at all and is very frustrating. I hate going without mascara because of this and simultaneously resent having to wear mascara all the time. This little tool has solved my problems. It warms quickly and work fast, curling lashes in about 3 seconds. I was left with normal looking lashes, not amazing by any standards but this tool can&#x27;t grow lashes for you and I didn&#x27;t expect that. It did do as promised and curled my straight lashes up, making them look as long as they possibly could.</li>
    <li> I really love this heated lash curler cuz it gives such a nice natural curl to my lashes with no weird crimping line.  It might take longer than a regular lash curler but it makes the curl last longer.  Just be sure to hold for a couple seconds in place on your lashes like you would with your hair and a curling iron.  You can&#x27;t brush it through and expect to magically have perfectly curled lashes.  It takes a little patience.  I also like curling my lower lashes downward cuz its pretty much impossible to do that with a regular lash curler.  And don&#x27;t hold it against your skin cuz you could possibly burn yourself cuz it does get pretty hot.</li>
    <li> I bought this curler about 3 weeks ago and so far I really like it...I do think that it could be a bit hotter when it&#x27;s ready all the way..the back of the curler actually has a color change \\&quot;window\\&quot; type of this which goes from purple to pink when it&#x27;s ready all the way...i did find that it only curls the lashes at the very tips, and doesn&#x27;t give you a dramatic curl, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;r looking for. BUT, if you use mascara first, let it dry, and then carefully go over with the curler and work the curl the way you want it, it should be fine..overal, it&#x27;s a great product and does the job well. You just have to experiment with it a little...</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I did what the other people suggested doing, but maybe because I have stubborn eyelashes, it just wouldn&#x27;t work. Kind of wasted my money.. On a side note, I kept it in my bag and the top came off (the part that has the bristle things), and I didn&#x27;t realize. I tried using it and totally burned my skin (it hurt but didn&#x27;t leave a mark). That was completely my fault though, but just a warning to make sure it&#x27;s on there! Haha.</li>
    <li> These heat up pretty quickly so I curl my lashes in the 10mins I have on my way to school in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I curl my lashes without mascara since I don&#x27;t want the product to get dirty and have to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> For its very reasonable price, this product does the job exactly as described. I stumbled upon this product when I watched a youtube makeup tutorial and this was the product the recommended. Don&#x27;t expect sky-high, cosmetic advertisement lashes because you&#x27;re probably going to have a difficult time using this to get them that high (and obviously it&#x27;s not use for that purpose). This gives it a nice, natural gentle curve. While no mascara curled lashes did not last very long (an hour or two), if you apply mascara (I suggest at least two coats of your favorite, but I heard 3 coats of Fiberwig mascara can make your real lashes look as dramatic as falsies), and then use the curler, it would keep the curls for more than 6 hours (which is basically a work day).    I don&#x27;t really see why some reviewers are so critical of it because I have some very hard to curl lashes (middle length, completely straight, and points at a 45 degree angle DOWNWARD), and this does the job even better than the clamper eyelash curlers (and I can get the edges instead of just the longest ones in the middle! No \\&quot;eye shape doesn&#x27;t match\\&quot; problem. &amp; you can \\&quot;curl\\&quot; (basically getting them downward) your bottom lashes too! I&#x27;ve tried other curlers (heat and no heat), but this one is definitely the winner.    Plus, it&#x27;s just such a pretty blue (sparkly cap!) and comes with a little brush to clean the mascara off the brush head of the curler. So if you have hard to curl (I guess easy to curl would be even better!) lashes and want something that would give you a natural curl, I suggest you should grab this! :)</li>
    <li> it heats up great &amp; easy to hold &amp; handle.  But there is nothing to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the lashes so its difficult to get them in just the right spot to apply the heat long enough to acquire any shape.</li>
    <li> It drains the battery in 2 usage and it didnt even curl my eye lashes. I dont know if maybe my eye lashes are to stubborn but it didnt do anything.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  My lashes are so difficult to curl and this really works!  Be prepared to replace batteries often.</li>
    <li> Ive had a heated curler before from Avon and this one is soo much better. Ive only had it for a week but so far it gets much warmer and seems like an all around better product. So far so good. ++++</li>
    <li> This curler is unusual in that it has a broad, flat heating pad, so it is diffult to manueuver your curl.  The visuals displayed on this site do not portray this. I returned this product after finding it nearly impossible to use without taking a long time.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this item. It doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> Not bad but I prefer my Tarte curler over it. I find I use it more for touch ups before going out in the evening. Less trauma to the lashes compared to a regular curler if mascara is already applied.</li>
    <li> bought it as a gift for family</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd heated lash curler.  I was a little skeptical of the design but decided to try it anyway.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I like that you don&#x27;t have to hold the power to heat the unit, and it has an indicator to let you know when it is ready.  As long as you put the lid on it when you are done, there is no need to remember to turn it off (to save the batteries).  The battery lasted longer than I expected as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is that the curl looks natural.  No \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; in the lashes like with other versions.  A secret I learned early on with heated curlers was to put a light coat of mascara on first, curl, and then finish putting on your mascara.  The curl will last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why, maybe it has something to do with the design but, I do not seem to need to clean the lash part of this one as much as others I have had.  When you do the mascara first trick, usually you have to clean each time.  Not so much with this model.  If I wear this one out I will be ordering another.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I cqnt seee! I cqnt seeee!</li>
    <li> I have very straight lashes, I had high hopes for this product, but it&#x27;s just meh. I use it after I curl my lashes with a crimper to help hold the curl, but applying waterproof mascara does that all day anyways.</li>
    <li> Does not work to curl the lashes.  Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyelash curler for 3 years, and it finally broke, so this is my second order. I&#x27;m in love with heated eyelash curler and it is the only eyelash curler that works for my Asian eyelashes. The normal eyelash curler has never worked for my very straight eyelashes. It never curl enough, or even my eyelashes curl, it only can stay for a while. However, using heated eyelash curler can keep my eyelashes curl for all day. I use heated eyelash curler before and after applying mascara. If you think heated eyelash curler doesn&#x27;t work for you, you might need to try to use it after applying mascara, and reapply one more coat or mascara. The result is more apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I recommend that the battery should be removed after being used because this eyelash curler draws electricity rapidly.</li>
    <li> Love the &#x27;comb&#x27; attachment (comes off to clean) for separating lashes so no clumps.  Tastes a dab of practice because you can sweep off too much mascara!  Wand can get pretty hot after a while so be careful.  What&#x27;s really unusual is that it also curls lashes without mascara!!!  i just love it!</li>
    <li> This thing heated up well, but it really didn&#x27;t do much curling that I could tell.  It definitely did seem to lengthen my lashes though, so I liked that.</li>
    <li> A great buy with reasonable price.  The direction says you can use it after applying mascara. But because the heat this curler delivers is pretty strong,  you&#x27;d lose almost all mascara afterwards. So usually I use it before applying mascara, and use it in combination with Shu Uemura eyelash curler. (I don&#x27;t think that using this heated eyelash curler alone would curl your lash too well).)  Anyway, the heat makes the lash stay curled all day. As far as I have tried so many heated eyelash curlers in an attempt to make my lash stay curled, I think this one is the best pick in terms of cost, design and function.</li>
    <li> This applies heat to your lashes, but DOES NOT curl them.  You are better off to take your blow dryer and heat your plain metal drugstore curler for a few seconds than to buy this.  It does absolutely NOTHING to curl them.</li>
    <li> I honestly did not notice any improved curling with this product, in fact, I think that the heat melts my mascara and the comb makes my lashes look thinner and sparser (I had heard that it worked better AFTER putting on mascara).  No better when done before mascara either. Metal eyelash curlers are the better way to go.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It Works really well, and allows me to get as much curl as I desire.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it should! Great buy for a great price. It got here very very fast. It does take a little practice but by the second day, it only took 30-45 seconds per eye and the curl stays literally ALL day (and night if you&#x27;re like me and forget to take your makeup off occasionally). It heats up very quick and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot to the point where it&#x27;ll singe your eyelid. The comb works great and gets rid of any clumps. It even comes with a little cleaning brush to get the dried mascara-junk out of it. I&#x27;m Asian and have super short and straight lashes. The photo shows it after use with 2 coats of mascara.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dark eyelashes and I was never a big fan of the look mascara gave to my eyelashes but my eyelashes stick straight out with zero curl to them. I also have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes which would give me the worst dark circles under my eyes. I was trying to decide between one of these curlers and the old fashion kind thats heated. I decided to go with this one because the idea of clapping my eyelashes with a piece of hot metal didnt seem like a smart idea. It took me a couple tries to get a technique down. I usually use this without any mascara but I do like that you can use this curler after mascara unlike the other type. Since it uses a tiny brush it makes my lashes look a lot fuller. I actually didnt realize mine were as long as they are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked the tugging and pulling, traditional eyelash curlers did to my lashes. When I tried this I was amazed at how fast and easy this little wand curled my lashes. But I was equally pleased the fact they stayed curled all day. I found the best way to use this wand is to curl the lashes Before you apply mascara NOT after. Even my best water proof mascara came off with the heat. Another recommendation I would make is, don&#x27;t use cheap batteries from the dollar store, they do not last long and might even ruin your curler. I love this curler and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This heated eyelash curler work wonder on my straight Asian lashes. No other curler really works for me, they all curl at first but later on, the curl would be gone. This actually works and holds the curl all day long. It is neat and fits my makeup bag; the cap only fits when you turn off the curler. The design is a little bulky and the curler is a little bit on the heavy side. It took me a while to get a hold of how it works. It gives my lashes a natural curls that look very pretty. Some other people say that it melt all the mascara but I don&#x27;t have any issue with it although I do brush it quickly through my lashes to melt the mascara clumps, but then I just press it like in the directions.     It works with AA battery and the battery runs out pretty quick so you may need to have some spare ones just in case. One trick to save on your battery: With a brand new battery I use it with the plastic comb and when the battery starts to die out and the curler becomes less hot, I remove the plastic comb and use it with only the metal coil. There were times that the heat indicator didn&#x27;t even turn blue but I could still work it out just fine, just need to be more patient and wait a little bit longer. But you have to really careful when you use it without the plastic comb because the coil is actually still very hot.</li>
    <li> very good&#x27;&#x27;just a little heavy! But works good! I like panasonic, those Japan stuffs! Good quality!&lt;br /&gt; You can buy it!</li>
    <li> To get best results, use this in combination with a mechanical eyelash curler and mascara. It can be time consuming if you&#x27;re in a rush, but it does warm up fast. I have straight thin lashes. For my routine, I use a Tarte mechanical curler, then I put 1 coat of mascara, use this heated curler, add another coat of mascara and then use the Tarte curler again. If needed, I use this heated curler to touch up any clumped or rigid looking areas at the end. It works great and leaves a natural looking curl, unlike using a mechanical curler alone.</li>
    <li> This just does not work for my lashes, I doesn&#x27;t give them any curl at all.  It heats them a little bit so that they are more receptive to my mechanical curler, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on that basis.</li>
    <li> This curler works great!  I don&#x27;t have to use a regular curler any more.  I am buying this for my family and friends.  It&#x27;s too good not to share.</li>
    <li> After A LOT of experimenting, I&#x27;ve found that this is the best product for my Asian lashes--even better with a coat of mascara on. Using the Shu Uemura manual curler or Sephora heated curler on my lashes prior to mascara doesn&#x27;t work because my lashes straighten out before the mascara dries. But I&#x27;ve found if I heat this product up slightly (not all to full strength by any means), my lashes maintain curl all day. Like hair, the first coat of mascara (some lengthening product) is like styling gel and then afterwards I add another coat of mascara (something that doesn&#x27;t smudge and volumizes) as my hair spray. It&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve come to the looks in magazines without fake lashes and touch ups!</li>
    <li> I used to have the Sephora heated eyelash curler which I loved, but since they don&#x27;t make it anymore, I was forced to find a new one. I have had one other heated eyelash curler from a beauty supply store and it was terrible. The Panasonic had the best reviews and the design of the comb/heater was the closest to Sephora&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month but so far so good. It gets hotter than I would prefer but it&#x27;s the best available option in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It came broken .I couldn&#x27;t even use it. I want to return it so badly and don&#x27;t know where and how so I can get back my money or even I can get new one.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve purchased many over the years. You don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking off your eyelashes with this one as the heat along with the mascara curls the lashes upwards gently. (The old style crunch-in-a-vice eyelash curler has broken my eye lashes off before.) It&#x27;s also a more natural curve to the lash than what you get in the crunch style curler. I find too, that using this daily \\&quot;trains\\&quot; the newer lashes growing in as to which direction I want them to grow. As I age and my lashes are dryer, my lashes can be obstinate and grow straight in undesirable directions. Following their use instructions helps as well as a second layer of mascara and more heated curling. I&#x27;m a big fan of this and have given it to family and friends. (The only negative is that the plastic cap and container can crack, but mostly have much use.)</li>
    <li> Panasonic has a great reputation... but for TV&#x27;s and other electronics. The reviews ran the gamut, so I decided the price was worth gambling I would finally find the eyelash curler of my dreams. One reviewer mentioned the curler is flat, and that&#x27;s correct; it&#x27;s shaped like a little toothbrush. So you can envision the problem with that: If you have George Clooney lashes, no problem.  If you have short, straight lashes like me (which is why I use a curler in the first place), BIG PROBLEM!  It&#x27;s not only scary to put a hot mini-iron so close to your corneas, but just not worth the risk of a slip-up.</li>
    <li> I had bought several of different kinds of lash curler and they don&#x27;t do much...but this one was&lt;br /&gt;warm and works well.  I like this product and would recommend to all lash proffesionals.</li>
    <li> It is worthless, did not work at all. Had to trash it</li>
    <li> This product curls my lashes and it only takes about 15 seconds for both eyes. My lashes are so hard to curl and I&#x27;ve tried other heated curlers before and this one is the best! I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I am so please with my results that I had to share my experience. It also does a nice job of combing my lashes after my mascara is applied. So happy I purchased this!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! If you use it as directed (which is by putting a little mascara on your lashes before curling to help your lashes stay in place), it can make a HUGE difference. I should note that I have fairly long lashes, so I&#x27;m not sure how this would work for someone with short lashes. The downside is it burns through batteries. When the battery is fresh it only takes a minute to warm up, but as the battery drains it takes longer and longer. This curler is good, but you may also need a huge pack of batteries from Costco to keep it from burning a hole in your wallet.</li>
    <li> Barely had any effect on my lashes and died (i.e. stopped heating up at all) within a few months. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> GREAT lash curler it uses a AA battery so I gets hotter and last longer too great product</li>
    <li> Not really my favourite. Takes ages to get it warm. N didnt do much to my lashes. Well m asian . N my lashes arent that gorgeous . But still just not my fave prefer to curl my lashes using the manual eyelashes curler</li>
    <li> The curler ONLY curl eyelashes for a few hours...and the battery is not so good either....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an eyelash curler before, let alone a heated one. But for my wedding I figured I should try something new. It worked great! It was very easy to use, and I wasn&#x27;t afraid of burning myself or poking my eye out. It definately held better if I used it after I applied mascara though.</li>
    <li> You still have to use the curler first to manually curl your lash first, then this heated wand would help a bit to stay as is. There is really nothing much it can do.</li>
    <li> Another flop- does not do as they say. Buy locally- so you can take it back and not have to jump through all the hoops.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have VERY long lashes but they are straight and tend to point downward. I got this to see if it would help and it has! It isn&#x27;t dramatic but I notice a big difference when I use this product. I usually use it before mascara and after and it helps point my eyelashes up.</li>
    <li> I bought this and forgot to return it- so when I went to return it, it was too late- the thing never worked and it is super light- the quality of it is pretty awful. This product should not even be on the market.</li>
    <li> Warms the eyelashes without burning.  Gives a nice curl</li>
    <li> Does need some time to warm up. Just like any other curling iron that you use for hair you&#x27;ve got a pre-heat before use. Once it&#x27;s nice and warm I use it over my mascara. I normally go over each I 3 to 4 times. When I&#x27;m done I&#x27;m able to use a Q-tip to clean off the combing guide with a little make up remover.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of an eyelash curlers.  I just got this gadget a few days ago and this heated curler is excellent.  I have long unruly lashes and this little gadget gets them into shape and into a very pretty curl.  I also love panasonic&#x27;s eyebrow trimmer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To properly use the curler, allow it to heat up and use it as you would use a hot iron to curl hair, pausing for about 3 seconds for each section of the eye lashes.</li>
    <li> It did not work well with my eye shape</li>
    <li> It heats, but results are not lasting. Do not suggest this as a item for purchase.  Add in shipping and price is out of site</li>
    <li> One of the best heated eyelash curler&#x27;s I&#x27;ve found!  Good price.  Worth every penny!!  Hopefully Panasonic never gets rid of it!</li>
    <li> Love it but suck that they don&#x27;t have build in an automatic power switch off. If u forgot to turned off u can run through batteries pretty quick</li>
    <li> Now this is a heated curler I can recommend. It works really well and doesn&#x27;t get too hot. It doesn&#x27;t burn through the batteries either. I&#x27;ve tried two other ones and this one is the one to buy and use.</li>
    <li> It gets way too hot, and I haven&#x27;t had success with it working.</li>
    <li> My manual metal lash curler works far better than this wand style or clamp style curler- I&#x27;ve tried both with no luck!</li>
    <li> We be only had this since April and have not used it during the summer months , it stopped working , we put new batteries and till won&#x27;t heat! Don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
    <li> Love the product! Have been looking for another heating eyelash curler for awhile and finally caved in and got this one. Very satisfied customer with this!</li>
    <li> This thing gets really hot! It really doesnt do anything to curl my lashes. It does separate them a bit but if you use it after mascara, it removes it a bit. Save your money.</li>
    <li> curled eyelashes last for an entire day with mascara</li>
    <li> Great small thing helps make my life easier....</li>
    <li> Works well, but time consuming.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews even though I shop online often. But, this curler merits a 5 star rating. I&#x27;ve looked at several heated curlers for the last couple of years, but was skeptical of how well they worked. I decided to take a chance on this one, and I wish I had bought it sooner. It works great on my bare lashes, and is phenomenal how well it works on my lashes after mascara. The mascaras I use are Diorshow by Dior and Maybelline Mega Plush. Since neither are waxy, none of the mascara is removed by applying heat. It sets the curl, and makes the occasional stray lash that tips to the side stand out like it should. If you are on the fence - buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I never curl my lashes because the traditional metal clamps scare me. I&#x27;m Asian and have really straight short lashes. Bought this to try it out because it was pretty inexpensive way to get a curl without using the clamps...  Love this thing! It heats up super fast, and gave me a perfect natural looking curl the first time. It does &amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; some mascara (I already had it on when the curler came in the mail, but couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out). But I can see that being really useful to get rid of any clumps. So I would apply a coat of inexpensive mascara and curl or just curl without mascara and then apply mascara after. It will definitely be part of my make-up routine. Fast and simple to use. And I am seriously a no fuss kinda girl. At most I put on is mascara and maybe some lipstick for going out. But I&#x27;ve been using mascara more regularly because I like the way it makes my eyes pop. This makes a huge difference in how open my eyes look. I use to get lash extensions, but I really like the look this curler gives me with a nice lengthening mascara. Even though the wand is bigger than most other heater curlers, I bought this one because the comb is detachable and think it will be easier to clean than the other mini mascara wand size ones that can&#x27;t be taken apart.</li>
    <li> It heats up, but doesn&#x27;t do too much for my eyelashes. If I pair it with a manual curler, it actually does better to hold that curl. So I recommend you get this, if you want a good hold (and don&#x27;t forget the mascara!).</li>
    <li> Oh boy, I LOVE this thing! It&#x27;s easy to use and I was very skeptical about using with mascara on but it really works! It separated the lashes that love to stick together and got them looking almost perfect. (I have a few lashes that gap apart for some reason that won&#x27;t behave no matter what). It doesn&#x27;t give that crazy bent crimp that the other curlers do. My lashes don&#x27;t get super curled but at least they go mostly in the same direction now.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really curl my lashes....I have lashes that slant straight down. I would just invest in a better lash curler instead</li>
    <li> I must honestly say, I was very apprehensive about purchasing this eyelash curler. I did not know if it would work for me. As a African American woman, mixed with a quarter of Native of American my eyelashes are so wild! The twist and bend in so many directions, this also stems from the fact I may roll over on my stomach and sleep at night. I received this product three days ago and, I use it faithfully every morning to straighten my lashes. My mascara goes on perfectly with no issues or lashes going in a sorts of directions. This is a must buy and I will stand by this product! The heat is minimal but effective and does the job.</li>
    <li> Curls lashes beautifully!</li>
    <li> I was never able to get my eyelashes to curl with this</li>
    <li> This is not effective at all.  It didn&#x27;t work for me.  If you really want it to curl, you have to work really hard at it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin and even so, it may not work.</li>
    <li> I feel like this was a waste of money.  It does not a thing for my lashes.  I was really hoping it would.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much been a waste of money for me.  I feel like it needs something to clamp the lash down to effectively work.</li>
    <li> I mean, it made my lashes warm, but did nothing to curl them.  Absolutely nothing.  I tried it 5 times before I finally gave it away to a friend and told her, &amp;#34;good luck!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The heat is quickly to curve your eyelash, and it never hurt your eyes area. The effect is very good after you use it, the eyelash is very curl.</li>
    <li> I decided to try one of these to see if it&#x27;d make a difference in making my lashes stand out but I was quite disappointed. It heats up very fast which is great but it&#x27;s too hot and you have to be very careful when brushing from the base of your lashes. In addition, it made my lashes straight rather than curl them despite me using a curling motion. Luckily it was cheap so I don&#x27;t feel cheated from the purchase.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use. Curls the eyelashes really close to the roots, so all the little fine eyelashes get curled too which is great making the eyes really open up!</li>
    <li> My lashes curls beautifully with them. It works great with mascara that clumps. It really spreads the lashes out perfectly. Temperature works great. Now I don&#x27;t have to get my lashes permed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get a curl but I like this product to straighten wayward eyelashes or eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I want to say Wow, I really like it! It isn&#x27;t too hot, but it works perfectly on your eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Complete waste of your money... I used it once and that&#x27;s about it. It does NOT curl your lashes. I would recommend buying the other panasonic eyelash curler in pink.</li>
    <li> Even not work as good as traditional curler,I tried several times and cost more than 5 min per time,not curl my eyelash at all.</li>
    <li> Heated semi-quickly but didn&#x27;t really curl the lashes.  Whatever curl I could get out of it didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great!  I&#x27;ll just be sticking to my regular eyelash curler for now!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really heat up that well.</li>
    <li> Really works nice.  It only takes a moment to heat up and separates and curls the lashes very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;It is so much nicer than than the contraption that can sometimes hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the forced turn-off feature when you put back on the cap, That way I don&#x27;t have to worry when I put it back in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Returned it.</li>
    <li> Did not curl eyelashes as it claims too.</li>
    <li> The beauty equipment is excellent.But after using it twice I don&#x27;t know what went wrong, it stopped working anymore. It doesn&#x27;t heat up @ all after 2 use.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a few months ago and I don&#x27;t think it is all that.  I probably should have choose a different eyelash curler, but I will continue to use it from time to time</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the positive reviews but sadly it did not work for me. I do have thick eyelashes though but I would leave them under my lashes for 20 seconds to no avail.</li>
    <li> I followed the manual and other viewers&#x27; instructions.  I applied mascara first, let it dry a bit then use the heated curler.  It did lift up the eyelashes but they only stay up for minutes.  I suppose you can carry it in your purse and do it right before you head out meeting people for lunch or after work.  Just don&#x27;t expect your eyelashes to stay up long.  One good thing is it doesn&#x27;t crimp my eyelids like manual curler.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned. I dropped my other one so many times hat it bit the dust after a couple of years. Great item when used according to directions. Not for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to wear mascara since it melts the mascara and sets your lashes when they cool. Long lasting, all day curl. Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Hard to use and didn&#x27;t see much difference. Takes too long to do.</li>
    <li> this will curl your bare eyelashes really well but my problem is that if i curl with this heated curler after ive put on my mascara, he mascara will thin out which defeats the purpose of buying volume enhancing mascara.  i end up using a conventional lash curler because this one doesn&#x27;t work well once mascara is already applied. lashes are curled by do not look thick.</li>
    <li> I know this looks really different from regular eyelash curlers, but it works way better. It gives you a natural looking curl rather than a 90 degree crease. I was skeptical at first but it works just like an eyelash comb. It allows you to manipulate your eyelashes wherever you think you need more curl. I use it with mascara, then I comb it through and sort of push the tips of my eyelashes back and keep it there for a few seconds and repeat if I want more curl. It&#x27;s great because if you&#x27;re like me, with short/straight eyelashes, regular curlers don&#x27;t really curl the corners well. With panasonic&#x27;s heated curler you can target certain areas that need more curl as well as remove clumps.Pain free,easy to clean,heats up fast too!</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have owned over the years... the first, I loved it! But after a few uses, the wand wouldn&#x27;t heat as hot and didn&#x27;t really do much. I assumed I had a faulty one but never bothered to replace it after tossing it. Fast forward a few years and my husband tucked another one into my Christmas stocking. I was excited again - it works great and so much better than the basic non-heated clamping curler -- but again, loses it&#x27;s ability to heat up well (and thus work) after a few uses. Bummed.</li>
    <li> People that this sort of heated curler is NOT working for are probably not using it right. Using this device intails a learning curve to get it right, and the instructions it comes with are rather basic and poor. Once you play with it, and get the angles right, it really does work well, particularly if you use clear mascara, or a primer, before curling. I can get a little bit more dramatic of a curl curve with my traditional eyelash curler, but I often pinch my lid, and it&#x27;s just more of a PITA...! This unit can get a teeny bit hot near your delicate lid skin, but you quickly get used to it. Check out EnKore Makeup&#x27;s video on YouTube for a great instructional video on using heated eyelash curlers. It REALLY, really helped me to start using this thing faster...</li>
    <li> I was in love with this curler it heated very well the first couple of weeks, but now it barely heats, and  if I want to return it I have to pay the shipment.  I&#x27;m sooo dissapointed!!</li>
    <li> Great product. For lasting effect, I use it after curling my lashes and mascara. It really works!</li>
    <li> I love false strip and individual lashes, but taking them off every night takes a toll on my sensitive skin. I tried the permanent individual lashes, single and cluster styles and found that sleep on my side can lead to crimped eyelashes the next day. Natural lashes don&#x27;t seem to do this so my false lashes looked so fake. I tried this heated curler, running the comb side through the lashes against the side of my pinkie as a guide and WOW!! It un-crimps the ends and recurls them to their original glory. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot to place against my finger but definitely gets hot--not just warm. Also tried this against my natural lashes with mixed results. Followed the advice of other members and used an old fashioned curler first, then the heated curler but didn&#x27;t get very curly lashes. It seems to help if you run the heated curler against something like and orange stick or a finger, placed along your top lash where your eyeliner would be. That presses the lashes into the heat element and provides the best curl I&#x27;ve been able to achieve. I would gladly buy again and recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> Love it, it really makes a dramatic difference!&lt;br /&gt;I have small eyes and it makes them appear much larger.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely keep the brush on, as the plate gets quite hot.&lt;br /&gt;I also find it works well after applying a small amount of mascara and letting it dry half way, then I comb and curl and add more mascara.</li>
    <li> This thing works great as a follow up to a regular curler. Separates lashes, and gives a nice even curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars... it does eat up batteries quickly.</li>
    <li> Does not curl my lashes at all.  Battery lasts a very short time.  Does not replace an ordinary eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Great curling tool, gentle, allow it to warm up before using. Glad to know I&#x27;ll never poke my eyeball again with a female torture device (eyelash curler).</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lash curler. I place it at the base of my lashes CAREFULLY to lift them up and then press back to make them appear longer. From there I start brushing it along my lashes to give them a soft curl. Much more natural look than using the traditional metal pincher curlers. I never clean my curler which is not a good thing. I&#x27;ve never had any problems other than it gunking up. That is this user&#x27;s fault because once it gets gunked up, it is extremely difficult to clean. They include a cleaning brush which I should use. I&#x27;ve been buying these, this particular curler, since 2006. I&#x27;ve had 2 during that time actually stopped working. Not bad in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different heated curlers. From Sephora&#x27;s little pink one, their long thin black one, Ardell&#x27;s curler, anther Panasonic version, which actually spun and was $30!!!, and a couple others here and there that I was curious about. None of them heated or gives me the same long lasting curl as this particular one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to use caution because it does get very hot. I think this is why it&#x27;s the best performing out of the bunch. I&#x27;ve burned my lid several times. It&#x27;s hot enough to cause me to tear up a second but not hot enough to seriously harm or singe the skin. Just be careful :)</li>
    <li> Love this!  Curls great, combs your lashes and doesn&#x27;t cut your eyelashes! Also lasts a long time. Really no need to use every day</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of heated lash curlers for years now, but the one I usually use is hard to come by and a bit pricier so I was eager to try this one out.  It does curl the lashes well which is great, but it does get pretty warm.  It&#x27;s fairly hot to the touch with your hands so when you do accidentally make contact with your eye lid it gives quite the jolt of heat!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that- curls well!</li>
    <li> Should have never purchased it! While it does heat, it is too hot to use. You have to be very careful how close you get to the eyelid because it can actually result in burning your eye.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It takes some getting used to at first, but when you get the hang of, it really works very easy!</li>
    <li> I use this little guy before I apply eyelash extensions and it does wonders to straighten out those unruly eyelashes, I would recommend 100%.</li>
    <li> Received it today and works awesome! I believe its so worth it for the price. Curled my lashes right away and left them separated as well. If your considering on buying this product go for it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with my lashes hitting my glasses and my daughter told me about electric lash curlers.  I had never heard of them before.  I bought several different brands and styles and tried them all.  This is my favorite by far!  I use it to get a curl before I apply mascara, then again afterwards to set the curl and remove any wayward mascara clumps.  The curl stays in all day, until I wash off the mascara.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This curler heats up quickly and gets nice and hot. It goes though batteries too fast, but worth it for the results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and lasts at least a couple of years.  This is my second one and I use it all the time.  Easy to handle too.</li>
    <li> I have pretty short length eyelashes. They are so short that a normal eyelash curler can&#x27;t even grab them. SO I tried this without make up. Ya know, just to see how it works with and without mascara. However I have to put it fairly close to my eyes (due to the severe shortness of my eyelashes) to get to the base of my lashes so it burned me a couple times but not bad. It took a while to get it to curl but it didn&#x27;t stay very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it with mascara on it lasted longer however, you HAVE to let the mascara dry before using the heat. Otherwise it will take it right off. Also, you can&#x27;t let it sit on your lashes longer than a couple seconds for the same reason - mascara will start to come off. It&#x27;s really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However on the plus side, if you have really crappy or old mascara that gets chunky or &#x27;spidery&#x27; when its applied, the heat removes the chunks and makes it look smooth on the lashes. Other than that the only other pro that I could find was the fact that it did not take long to heat, and it does not take long to use (depending on how much curl you want or can get out of the damn thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is a passable product unless you have long to medium lashes based on my own experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of these... first one lasted about 18 months. Be diligent about cleaning it, especially when you use it with mascara or it seems not to stay heated.  The batteries go kind of quick but using rechargeable ones help. Overall, a great find and curls lashes easily.</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these a long time ago but never had good results.  I think I might have actually thrown it away whilst cleaning out old makeup.  Really glad I gave it another shot!  The wider comb attachment that goes over the heating element makes it much easier to use in my opinion.  I still use my Shu Uemura curler first and then follow up with the heated one to set the curl.  The result is pretty, upswept lashes that make mascara application much easier and more effective.  The best part is it really maximizes the lengthening and volumizing properties of any mascara I use.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I might not know the trick for using this but as far as I can tell it does nothing.</li>
    <li> My favorite heated curler. I actually bought this before but it broke so I&#x27;m getting another one cause it&#x27;s just that great.</li>
    <li> Best heater curler out there...especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly and curls my lashes all day&lt;br /&gt;works way better once mascara is already applied</li>
    <li> Works nicely once you get used to how to use it. Nicely combs and separates lashes after you apply mascara. For a more dramatic curl I still use a regular crimper first.</li>
    <li> It takes forever to heat up and it doesn&#x27;t even curl my lashes that much. Not worth the money. Sorry!</li>
    <li> Does what it claims!  Remember to wait for the color indicator and you are all set.  Will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Mum said it didn&#x27;t work. Sent back. Need to check on my refund. I&#x27;m writing this for my wife who is making eggs right now and they said I need more words in the review.</li>
    <li> I love this heated eyelash curler, it does the job perfectly. It head up fast and not too hot to burn your eyes</li>
    <li> This was something I thought would be awsome. But completely wrong. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually curl the eyelash. It&#x27;s too bad that the return policy wasn&#x27;t a little longer. I forgot I had it and missed returning it by days. Now I&#x27;m stuck with an item that doesn&#x27;t work. So buyers beware this honestly doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love this! I stopped curling lashes before because it pinches my eye or pulls the hair but this changed everything. It creates a natural curl. I use rechargable batteries, it&#x27;s cheaper. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is I burn my eye accidentally when I&#x27;m being careless. More practice works best</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone, even with shorter lashes like mine. Hold all day and very easy to use. Just remember to let the mascara to dry before applying, it&#x27;ll be much better that way.</li>
    <li> This heated curler is my new favorite beauty item.  It works very well, and I have short stubby lashes.  Planning to buy my sister one as a stocking stuffer.  I don&#x27;t know how some ended up disappointed as I found you can use this both before and after mascara.</li>
    <li> I think this doesn&#x27;t work well on me/ My lash became very rough and not curved in a good way.</li>
    <li> This product definitely helps make your lashes longer, but does not curl them. It says to use after mascara, but I&#x27;ve found that it works best before and after. A nice product for a reasonable price. Not a miracle product, but it does work.</li>
    <li> Personally, I prefer this over the standard eyelash curler tool sold at most beauty supply stores. Recommend keeping spare batteried because it takes a new set approximately each month depending on how frequently you use it. Love it and it helps my eyelashes look like falsies.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service love it best curler ever</li>
    <li> After using this products my friends asked me if I was wearing fake eyelashes, the answer was NOOOO I&#x27;m using the heated eyelash curler from Panasonic! your eyelashes won&#x27;t suffer any collateral damaged.&lt;br /&gt;It worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
    <li> Works well--creating a gentle curl--so much nicer than those harsh bends from mechanical curlers.</li>
    <li> This started out working great and by day 5 it wouldn&#x27;t get hot. Piece of crap, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Curler works as advertised.  It was quickly delivered.</li>
    <li> I bought both this and the Panasonic EH-SE60VP Heated Eyelash Curler to see which was better. The truth is they are both OK but neither is great. It seems like they would be more effective if the heating aspect could be combined with the traditional crimping curler but apparently there must be some engineering issue that prevents anyone from designing such a tool. I&#x27;ve found it to be most effective if I first use the traditional crimping curler then use one of the heated curlers and then follow up with the traditional curler again.</li>
    <li> You have to be very patient to wait for it to heat up, to curl, to do anything. It doesn&#x27;t even deliver an impressive curl, it makes my eyelashes slightly turned up and that&#x27;s it, no matter how hard I tried and how patient I was with it. I&#x27;d rather just use my clamp eyelash curler. Don&#x27;t bother with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter and her eyelashes look great. She is very pleased with it, and now has to share with her sister. LOL</li>
    <li> Could not believe positive reviews.  This doesn&#x27;t curl your lashes.  You need the crympting version to do that.  Does not matter how long you hold the heated brush in an up position, doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  Wish I had purchased the other that I have used for years.</li>
    <li> It works well and does what it&#x27;s suppose to but be careful until you get use to it, it will burn you if it touches your skin.</li>
    <li> This made my mascara clumpy and worse.  I do use a mascara that puts &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; on your lashes (one coat of white / one coat of mascara) so I am not sure if that has something to do w/it.  But an overall disappointment that just sits on the shelf now.  I rather use Panasonic EH2331P Heated Eyelash Curler B4 I start on my bare eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Warms up quickly.  Just slowly sweep it under your lashes and up to curl. No pinching and you can easily get all your lashes.</li>
    <li> This design could be better. If you warm up your eyelashes and use the conventional curler, then the curl stays a little longer. But I would return it if I had the packaging still. Not really worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much I will use this.  It gets pretty hot and seems to take quite a while of contact with my lashes to have an effect.</li>
    <li> I use this every day!  Works really well on my straight full lashes.</li>
    <li> Great product but it stopped working and I can&#x27;t return it. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to heat up but it does the job. I normally apply it AFTER I put mascara on, and yes, while it does take some of the mascara off, it&#x27;s actually doing me a favor by removing some of the clumps. To curl my straight lashes, I curl it up at the base first then move the wand up towards the middle of the lashes and then try to curl the top half in.</li>
    <li> It works but no how I expected</li>
    <li> Great product. It actually works well</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this lash curler but I got no curl. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to get warm... it didn&#x27;t curl my lashes at all. Very disappointed . I &#x27;m going to return it. a waste of money!</li>
    <li> My original curler from Sephora broke, and after some research, I settled for this one.  Definitely steps above the Sephora one.  It&#x27;s very well made (sturdy).  The brush part is removable, and it comes with a little wire brush so you can clean the heating coils of the mascara that inevitably gets stuck there.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have typical Asian lashes that are straight and point down.  I use this first to push my lashes up and outwards, then a Shu Uemera curler to curl them.  Then I use mascara and follow up with this to clean up any clumps.  Comes with a brush to clean off mascara.  Takes a few seconds to heat up, and there is an indicator that turns pink when hot. Some reviewers complain about the battery life, but I have used it at least 10 times and its still running!  Cap is sometimes annoying to remove and pops off the comb, but whatever.  Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I use this every day that I wear makeup. I have gotten to the age where some of my eyelashes are growing straight or downward which is really frustrating - thus my hunt for a heated eyelash curler. This was SO reasonably priced and although it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; the lash, the heat/wand combo allows you to re-position the eyelash upward. My method is to use a standard eyelash curler first, apply my mascara and then follow with this wand. I&#x27;ve also used the wand prior to using mascara which also works effectively. The wand will &amp;#34;go through&amp;#34; batteries with daily use so I use rechargeable batteries and always make sure to have some on-hand that are ready to go &amp;#34;just in case.&amp;#34; At the back/tip portion of the wand is a colored heat indicator - it goes from dark purple to pink when heated up - this is super handy. I would buy this product again -</li>
    <li> this is such a waste of money! this product it did absolutely nothing for my eyelashes and melted my mascara!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my precious Shiseido curler that I lost, hoping it could be a replacement that would work faster and easier.  I tried not to have too high of hopes because I have short, stick-straight, extremely stubborn eyelashes.  I was right in the sense that this doesn&#x27;t really do much to curl or lift my eyelashes and so I ended up buying a Shiseido curler anyway.    However!  This does wonders on my lower lashes!  My lower lashes always point towards the outside corners of my eyes and are a little messy, and this curler is the only way to get them to curl downwards.  With this and some mascara, it makes my eyes look better than they&#x27;ve ever looked (lower lashes really make a difference).    All in all, if you already have nice eyelashes, this might help boost them a bit and increase the hold of your mascara.  If you have awful eyelashes like mine, this won&#x27;t do that much to help, but it&#x27;s a handy tool for touch-ups and reaches the pesky lower eyelashes.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t heat up any more, only used it three times and I&#x27;ve tried several lots of batteries.  When it did work it worked great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it becuase it damaged my lashes, it doesn&#x27;t culer, and in my last effort to use it, my eyelid got burned.</li>
    <li> This is the best between 3 others heated lash curlers I have tried (including the mini[[ASIN:B001PMKLEC SEPHORA COLLECTION Mini Heated Eyelash Curler]] one and the professional[[ASIN:B00021CVZE SEPHORA COLLECTION Professional Heated Lash Curler Professional Mini Heated Lash Curler]] one from Sephora). It heats up a tad slower than the ones from Sephora, so if you are often in a rush this is not what would make you happy. It however heats up to a slightly higher temperature which gets you a more dramatic curl to the lashes. It is awesome for lash extensions (which cannot be curled using those pincer type curlers), the tip is easy to clean and can serve as a mini comb to some extent because of the plastic grid lines longer than the border of the tip. It is meant to be used after mascara, but still curls lashes without mascara on, just gives a less dramatic effect and the curl does not last as long. Two of my work mates ordered it after trying mine.</li>
    <li> Although it took a couple of attempts to get the swing of using this product, my eyelashes have never looked so nice...I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to the manual way if I can help it.</li>
    <li> It does not create any visible curl. That&#x27;s all I had to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the battary dies within a week of use.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Nothing happens after using it. And you cannot use rechargeable batteries on it.</li>
    <li> its great dont like to use the regular curler they hurt and dont see how they can be good for your lashes&lt;br /&gt;this was is good</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t really curl my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of these.  They burn out with frequent use (after about a year), but they&#x27;re cheap enough it&#x27;s jot that big of a deal to replace.</li>
    <li> The curler works great to fan out my lashes AFTER I&#x27;ve curled them with a regular curler and applied mascara. Doesn&#x27;t work so well curling my lashes as is. However, all of the tutorials I&#x27;ve seen online instruct you to use a heated curler after regular curling and mascara, so I don&#x27;t think this curler was invented to substitute normal metal curlers anyways. No problems with the product breaking on me.</li>
    <li> I have tried several heated eyelash curling wands.  This one is HANDS DOWN the best out there in my opinion.  Reasonable price for the quality you get.  I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool to create a dramatic look! I use a traditional lash curler first and use this tool after to create more smooth curls and it&#x27;s been great. The awkward L shape you usually get with the traditional lash curler is fixed and you can have a long-lasting big curl. I don&#x27;t recommend to apply mascara before using it though because it&#x27;ll all be gone with the heat and you&#x27;ll have to reapply again. I curl my lashes with this tool first and apply mascara afterwards, and the look is AMAZING, as if I am wearing fake lashes. The only thing is that after using it for 2 weeks, you&#x27;ll notice it takes longer to heat up. I would have given a 5 star review if I don&#x27;t have to change the batteries that often.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler was so useless. I was super disappointed that it didnt curl my eyelashes at all.</li>
    <li> applies heat to the lashes but as another reviewer indicated, it does not curl. I gave up on this curling wand as after a while it started to take a long time for it to heat up. I went back using my regular eyelash curler and on occasion would apply heat to it by blasting it with my blow dryer for two seconds. this yield much better results then using the curling wand.</li>
    <li> This product works really well.  I like to use it along with my manual eyelash curler for extra definition.  I also use it for a touch up in the afternoon.  I like that I can use it after I have mascara on and don&#x27;t have to worry about damage.  This product does burn through batteries so be careful not to leave it on for too long.  Also, mine only lasted a year.  I contacted Panasonic who had me ship it back at my expense only to tell me that they could repair it for $45, SERIOUSLY!!!  Regardless, it&#x27;s worth the $12 to buy it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> It does not work well. It doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes</li>
    <li> I love this little curler. I used to use a metal one but I got tired of it pinching my skin and pulling my lashes. I find this curler works best when I put a base coat of mascara first, then I layer my mascara as much or as little as I want when I&#x27;m done curling. Just make sure your mascara is dry before you use the curler. I usually put my first coat and then turn on the curler, by the time it&#x27;s fully heated my mascara is dry. I curl the outer lashes, middle lashes and inner lashes in that order. I hold the curler on my lashes for about 5 seconds because they&#x27;re pretty stubborn. If I want an extra little curl I press the curler down right on the tips of my lashes. Also works well on bottom lashes. For a more dramatic effect I put another layer and curl them again.</li>
    <li> Previously I had used a heated eyelash curler from Avon, which worked well but did not last long. My new Panasonic one is much more sturdy, easy to use and meets all my expectations. Thank you</li>
    <li> I loved this for the first few weeks, but mine has aleady died and I have had it for about three months, and I didn&#x27;t use it on a daily basis either.  will try again, and am hoping that it was just a problem with the one I had.</li>
    <li> The only thing I dont like about this product is the battery dies within a week of use ! Other than that it is amazing . It saves my lashes from falling down from the humidity like the other curlers do, and ive had less lashes fall too. The first time I used it it didn&#x27;t do so well and I thought I wasted my money, but I read online from a user on how to use it properly. Here goes, as you curl your lashes, bend your lashes with this wand towards your eye once you get about halfway up your lashes, like your lashes are curving into the letter &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; and hold it there for a couple seconds. If you do that motion , going up and then push down on your lashes so it curves into a C, then you will get an amazing natural looking curl</li>
    <li> This thing has been working nicely so far. Just be warned: you must take the battery out after each time you use it unless you&#x27;d like to replace the battery every other time you turn it on. Even when it&#x27;s off it seems to be draining the battery. That being said, it does what it says it does. It curls your lashes nicely. I only use it one one eye because I had LASIK and my lashes fell out and grew back in stick straight and pointing down. This helps my eyelashes on that eye match the other one a lot better. Be careful, though, as it might singe your lashes if you leave it on them too long. I do about 5 seconds and then curl my lashes with a regular curler. It seems to work.</li>
    <li> This helps to curl my straight eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I write review on Amazon. This does not curl at all. I don&#x27;t get where those positive reviews come from. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well.  My eyelashes are very unruly, due to chemotherapy. They grew back in pointing in all directions.  This helps to at least get them going in the right direction!  I use right before applying mascara.</li>
    <li> As a heated eyelash curler, this one does get hot. However, I still prefer the one from Sephora, which gives just the right temperature. This one, powered by AAA battery, heats too high and didn&#x27;t work with my eye lash.</li>
    <li> This seems to work but I am always afraid that it will burn my eyelashes right off. It gets hot quickly for me.</li>
    <li> I tried this curler several times (with and without mascara) but didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference. My lash is still flat.</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone with straight lashes! I have owned this product for over a year and it has been working flawlessly. I am actually planning to buy a backup heated curling wand here on Amazon since they have the best price (unfortunately my first curling wand was bought somewhere else for a higher price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian with short, straight lashes and I use a lengthening mascara then use the heated wand on my lashes  making sure I curl everything. I add more mascara afterwards to thicken the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curling Wand is so worth it. I have tried other eyelash curlers (non-heated) but my eyelashes are too straight and too short so I only end up hurting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only eyelash curler that works for me!</li>
    <li> I really like the contoured handle and the brush cover.  I thought the brush / heat element design was intriguing.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t heat very well, the ready indicator NEVER changes color and the brush design has only resulted in my poking myself in the eye.  If you remove the brush and use the element directly, you can curl your lashes......eventually.  As I tried to purchase a heated eyelash curler in a local store and was unsuccessful, this is better than nothing but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> I have thin-to-average lashes, medium to long length, quite straight.  At first I didn&#x27;t get much of a result with this product but after a little experimenting, found it is now my favorite beauty tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the way to achieve curled lashes (works with or without mascara, but using mascara - even a gel tint - will help retain the curl).  Start at section of lashes closest to your nose.  Apply the heated coils to your lashes from underneath, starting quite near the lid margin.  Sweep the wand toward lash edge while pressing up AND ROTATING the wand slightly, so that you&#x27;re sort of curling/pulling the middle/ends of your lashes back toward your top eyelid.  You will have rotated the wand about 130 degrees at the end: at the start, the color indicator is facing nearly downward; at the end, the indicator should be turned almost toward your eyebrows.  Hold there for a second or 2 to let the lashes cool/set in that position.  Repeat at the middle and outside sections of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using mascara, it will remove some (it&#x27;s GREAT at removing excess/clumps).  If you find that you want a more dramatic look or that your lash tips don&#x27;t have enough mascara, just wait a minute and apply a little more mascara.  This time, apply the mascara while your eyelid is about half closed, and pull the mascara wand up, so you&#x27;re maintaining/enhancing the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: some people may find that the coils are too hot at full strength - if so, just learn where your comfort zone is and once the wand reaches that temperature (use the color indicator), switch it off briefly and back on during the process to maintain the temperature that&#x27;s comfortable for you.</li>
    <li> This totally works for my eyelashes. I think it all depends on the hairs. Just like a curling iron. Some people can get their haur to curl easily and some can&#x27;t. I guess you just have to try it to see if it works for you. The reviews can&#x27;t help. I see some that think it&#x27;s horrible and some that think it&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;m one that just went ahead and tried it and ended up loving it!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and it makes my lashes look longer and prettier. This is healthier than the manual curlers, which can break of my lashes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> it is my 2nd one, because my first one broke.  but after using it everyday for 5 years (and i believe i dropped it on hard floor for more than a few times), it was only normal it broke, and there was nothing wrong with the product itself.  my lashes are long but so straight going downwards.  i apply cheap drugstore waterproof mascara first, then use this curler, and use more expensive mascara for touch-up and finish.  it makes my lashes perfectly curled up, and people always think they are extensions.  batteries do run out fast so i recommend you use it with rechargeable batteries.  the price on amazon was great, it was less than what i paid in japan for the first one.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have the opposite problem then most people, I have super curly lashes and I use this to straighten them. Works wonders! No pinching, no pain,  takes a few seconds and done!</li>
    <li> burned my eyelid. not as easy to use as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric eyelash curler before and this gave me a great first impression. It curls well for my Asian eyelashes and stays up all day, although it takes off mascara if the lashes aren&#x27;t completely dry. Amazing product at an unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard about a heated curling wand from a friend but the one she told me about was discontinued so I took a chance at purchasing this one online.  What a great product!  It works!  I believe the instructions say to curl your eyelashes with this device prior to applying mascara but I found it doesn&#x27;t work very well that way--it works better if you curl after mascara is applied.  Additionally, the &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; eyelashes after mascara, for me, kind of seals the mascara and keeps it on all day long without flaking!  I learned to not get the wand too close to the eye lid keeping it only on the lashes as the heat can get pretty hot.  I hold the wand in place for a count up to 10 and my lashes curl and stay that way for the entire day.  It doesn&#x27;t take very long before the unit heats up but if you leave it on for any length of time the battery dies fairly quickly--I&#x27;d say I have to replace the battery at least once a week.  Washing up the device is a bit tricky.  The little wand head comes off but don&#x27;t remove it over an open drain in the sink because it&#x27;s so tiny it goes down the drain faster than you think!  Clean it in a little bowl with a gentle eye makeup remover and you&#x27;re good to go.  This is a sturdy little product and I&#x27;ve enjoyed it immensely!</li>
    <li> I can never keep a working battery in this and the bottom part gets hot.</li>
    <li> I received this item in no time but It was returned I received an email telling me that item was incomplete I really don&#x27;t know if they send it to me with missing parts and thats why it did not worked for me. What I know is that I returned all parts that I received and know it seems that I wont get a refund back so what its the point of returning items very disappointed with this</li>
    <li> I love this thing!!! I CANNOT get my eyelashes to curl with a regular crimper for nothing! But I can with this heated eye lash curler. The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it goes through batteries like crazy! Speaking of batteries, I bought Energizer Max to see if it would last longer, and it made the curler get super hot! Like I couldn&#x27;t touch my lid with it. Not with other batteries however. Got the best curl ever, though! Lol</li>
    <li> I had read a few good reviews of this eyelash curler and it had been recommended by a gal on a beauty discussion board I belong to, so I purchased it.  My experience is that it is OK.  It takes a long time to actually curl the lashes once you figure out how to.  Perhaps because I have staight-as-a-board eyelashes, but the curl doesn&#x27;t seem to last. It sits rarely used in my beauty drawer.</li>
    <li> I have used the lash curler from Sephora for some time but had to keep buying them because the casing always ended with a tiny crack which prevented good contact with the battery.  So far the Panasonic has been great and seems to have a more secure connection.</li>
    <li> This heated lash curler will curl your lashes, but it does have some quirks. You may find that in order to get your lashes to hold the curl, you&#x27;ll need to apply a thin coat of primer or mascara before using it. Depending on the mascara/primer used, you could end up with a mess. You don&#x27;t want to use this over the wax mascaras that make little tubes on your lashes, unless you want to be digging it out of the tip. The only way to find out what works is trial and error. The other issue is battery life-- there isn&#x27;t much of it. It&#x27;s good for a few uses and then you&#x27;re changing the battery again. I&#x27;ve found this to be the case with any heated device, though. The cap design is very good-- when you put the cap on, it automatically slides the switch into the off position. Overall for the price and the results, this is a good product that performs well. I doubt if I&#x27;ll go back to regular lash curlers after this.</li>
    <li> Works great,but it eats batteries.</li>
    <li> I had heated one ever since 15 years ago and bought so many different kinds this is the best one ever! I bought it for gift and everyone so happy with this one! Recommend!!! Best one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times before doing a review.  I&#x27;m still on the fence on whether or not I&#x27;ll keep using it.  Here are my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;2) gets really hot&lt;br /&gt;3) does curl your lashes (I have asian lashes, so it took a few swipes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) uses up batteries.  It took awhile for my lashes to curl the way I like them.  I think that if your eyelashes are already curly, you would save a little bit of batter power.  But it won&#x27;t be by much.  For me, it&#x27;s almost one battery per one and half usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in all, it&#x27;s not a bad little tool, if I had the time to use it.  I think I&#x27;m just so used to my manual eyelash curler (Shu Emura) that I find that using this is a little tedious.</li>
    <li> This item did not perform at all.</li>
    <li> This is an affordable heated eyelash curler that works really well. Simple as that! If you want to see my full review and a tutorial you can check out my Youtube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6r_gpHZqqbQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Megan Joy&lt;br /&gt;http://meganjoy.ca</li>
    <li> This is great! It really curls my lashes... and those curls last long! I love it!</li>
    <li> Tis lash curler gets pretty warm. But it doesn&#x27;t curl much.. it&#x27;s ok not sure if I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I have had several electric eyelash curlers and this one is the bomb! The wide head really curls well. It heats up fast but not too hot.</li>
    <li> used it ONCE, then it broke and it can&#x27;t even turn on. i tried replacing the battery for like 3 times, still didn&#x27;t work. the worst payment i&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> Love this product -- it works! My eyelashes are straight/flat. The manual eye curlers never worked for me. This did the trick; curled my eyelashes nicely.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product through Amazon!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes aren&#x27;t long, but aren&#x27;t really too short either. They stick straight down so I&#x27;ve tried many curling products and this works best for me.The brush that came with it to clean any mascara off (since it is recommended to use after applying mascara)is great! It also cleans my eyelash comb or seperater really well. If you don&#x27;t do this carefully you can curl your eyelashes in a really weird way which happened a couple times at first.It said not to use when wearing contacts, but when I use it before wearing contacts, then put my contacts in my eyelashes get a little wet and then my eyelashes go straight down again not to mention that there is some mascara on too. I tried using it while wearing contacts since you put on mascara before using the curler and it was fine. Contact wearers I&#x27;m not sure if it is 100% safe using it with your contacts in but I took a leap of faith and I think it&#x27;s fine. Everybody is different so this might not work on some people&#x27;s eyelashes. The one problem about this is that batteries need to be replace A LOT. This curler devours double A batteries within a week or two, but if you don&#x27;t use it everyday it should last longer before the battery drains.Overall it works for me so I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this little gadget. It heats up quickly, gets warm but not too warm, and does the job. It gets down at the root of the lashes much better than the pinch type lash curler (which always pinch my eyelids). I use it to curl my lashes before mascara, and then do another quick swipe after I put on a coat of mascara. Works great and makes my lashes POP!</li>
    <li> It curls the lashes, but if you&#x27;re using an extending mascara, it actually pulls some of the fibers out, so you need to be careful.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.  The head heats up very quickly and there&#x27;s a little window that changes color to let you know when it&#x27;s ready.  My lash problem was some lashes curling sideways rather than up and I was hoping this would make them curl up like they&#x27;re supposed to.  It does!  All my eyelashes are curling straight up like little soldiers all in a row.  An unexpected bonus is that they look much longer.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t clunk out too soon as these products tend to do, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results  I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> I have been using the standard eyelash curler for 20 + years.  I was so sick of pinching my skin, getting watery eyes and having to fix makeup that I knew I needed something different.  Once my eyelashes were falling out every time I used the old curler I was done!  I saw many reviews for different heated ones, but thought this one was simple and straight forward.  It works better than any videos I saw.  It doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  Even if it touches my eyelid it never burns me.  My lashes have NEVER curled like this before.  I found the trick is to first put on one thin coat of mascara or you could use a lash primer, then use the curler.  Next put on mascara as usual and you&#x27;ll be amazed how your lashes look, I was!</li>
    <li> It heats up like it says it does, but I cant really tell that it actually curls my eyelashes. I get the same result from the old fashioned metal eyelash curler...</li>
    <li> I have used many types of eyelash curlers, but this one is amazing. It is fast and it actually separates lashes with mascara on them! I am buying a second one for my travel case.</li>
    <li> I know some people were complaining about how this doesn&#x27;t work, but I will tell you how I use it and it works beautifully. Curl your lashes with your normal cheapy curler, you don&#x27;t have to buy a Shu Uemura or eyelash curler that costs more than a couple of dollars. I always curl first with a regular curler, but you don&#x27;t have to if you don&#x27;t want. I just think it works better. Put your mascara on, then slowly hold and sweep lashes up with the Panasonic heated curler. If you want you can put another coat of mascara on after, but I never need to. Your lashes will say BEAUTIFULLY curled ALL DAY! I get compliments on my lashes  all the time a few people have even thought I got extensions... If you get a few clumps of mascara the fine teeth of the curler will get them out. Trust me I sleep with my face on my arm so my eyelashes are wild or point downward when I wake up. This keeps them all curled and nice just make sure you gently clean the comb out when it gets too much mascara on it. I say buy it. I just wish it came in pink or purple... lol :)</li>
    <li> This piece of junk is not even 2 months old and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> The Panasonic heated eyelash curler does aid in curling my lashes.  It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> this is great! i love. i would buy this in my future! great product! You guys should buy it too</li>
    <li> She loves it!  I got this for my girlfriend based on other reviews.  She previously had another type, but they didn&#x27;t last long.  When she started using the Panasonic,  she mentioned how much better it works.  It also seems to be constructed better, although the price was comparable to others.</li>
    <li> Do not waist your time and money,It will not grab the eyelash to curl stick with the  classic style curler.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a great idea, but my lash will not curl using this.I have to switch back using my regular curler. It also goes through battery once a week with regular use. Way too expensive for the result.</li>
    <li> I used to use one from Sephora, but it constantly required changing batteries...wasting a lot of money.  As Panasonic is a great brand, I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  It heats up quickly and does a fabulous job of curling your lashes....use AFTER putting on your mascara for the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; results.  This was my &amp;#34;first&amp;#34; pick and I&#x27;m glad I chose it!!!!  It works great!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot, but it burns through batteries so quickly! Other than that, it&#x27;s a great tool to give lashes long-lasting curl.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. It&#x27;s simply a waste of money. Really can&#x27;t say another thing about it.</li>
    <li> My monolids force my eyelashes to grow straight down, and manual eyelash curlers only bend the lashes upwards. This product actually curls the lashes upward - lifting and separating, giving a much more natural look. It even makes my lashes look longer! If I really want my lashes to show, I&#x27;ll curl them at the base only with my manual curler to just lift all of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using mascara with it, though - it only melted the product off. I feel that I don&#x27;t even need any additional makeup once I use this. I absolutely love this product and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It is honestly not worth the money.  After one use, I would rather stick with my regular manual eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever written a review for a product, but I had to write a review for this product, because it was amazing. For the record, no one has EVER been able to get my lashes to curl for more than 5 minutes with an eyelash curler. I have bought heated eyelash curlers before, and they didn&#x27;t work either. Finally, in a last ditch effort, I looked up \\&quot;the best heated eyelash curler on the market\\&quot; and everywhere said it was this Panasonic Heated eyelash curler. Everywhere was right! I am still learning the best technique, because I am new at curling my lashes, this lash curler, and what works best for me. However, I have NEVER had my lashes look so good, worn mascara every day, or been so happy with a lash curler. I think it&#x27;s amazing and would recommend it to anyone. If you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re not using it right. And I feel I can honestly say that, because sometimes I don&#x27;t use it right and I notice a difference, switch the angle or whatnot, and magnificent! I am not buying a second one for my car and on the go.</li>
    <li> Excellent...The safest way to curl eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is great! I have short, nearly invisible lashes, and regular eyelash curlers don&#x27;t do much. Between this heated eyelash curler and a good working mascara I actually can end up with long beautiful lashes. I will never go back to another curler again. I use waterproof mascara and curl after they dry and don&#x27;t have any problems with the mascara coming off... it also helps to smooth out any clumps as well. I have used a non-waterproof mascara with this to try it and it did take some off so I&#x27;m not sure how well it will work with some mascaras. But overall I have no complaints and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Heats up well.  My lashes might be more stubborn than most.  It curls them up but had to keep repeating it over and over and over... to get it to stay.  Used mascara right away afterwards and that seemed to help.</li>
    <li> I try this product , from it getting good review in YouTube . It did not work for me. It felt nice the heat, and this product was delivered on time and package well.</li>
    <li> It did not curl my lashes!  I tried all of the suggestions in the enclosed directions....  None of them worked!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really curl lashes much. Used after eyelash curler and seemed to make curl lash a bit longer. Wouldn&#x27;t not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, but it didn&#x27;t deliver. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot- barely warm, actually. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to my eyelashes unless there&#x27;s already mascara on them, and even then, the effect is minimal. I&#x27;m bummed.</li>
    <li> I honestly had really high hopes on this product after reading a lot of great reviews from various beauty blogs, but unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work out for me.  It took a long time to heat up and much like other Amazon reviewers stated, this heated lash curling wand does go through batteries pretty often.  I had to change out with a fresh battery at least once a week.  At the end, it just completely stopped working and ended up returning.</li>
    <li> Simply does not work. Watched the video, etc. no go. And I do not have hard to curl lashes.</li>
    <li> Granted, my eyelashes are stubborn, but this thing didn&#x27;t work at all.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.</li>
    <li> I used it daily until it stopped working after having it about 2 months. The battery didn&#x27;t last long, changed it about every other week. One day it just stopped heating up at all. Here shopping for another one</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and i really like it!</li>
    <li> I have tried over and over again but I can not get it to curl my lashes. I had high hopes for it, but it simply did not work for me.</li>
    <li> It was able to curl my lashes but they only stayed curled for a minute, even when I put on mascara first.</li>
    <li> It works.. heats quickly and has a nice protective guard. the only down side is batteries only last a couple of uses.. I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> It takes forever to heat up and the batteries don&#x27;t last long.  I guess that is because it takes&lt;br /&gt;so long to heat up each time.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> the preheating time is too long. And it didn&#x27;t work in me at all. returned in 1 week. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd heated eyelash curler I&#x27;ve tried.  The first looked like a regular eyelash curler, but with heat, and was impossible to use or get a good shape with.  The second was a sephora stick-type heated curler a lot like this one.  I fell in love with the way these curlers work, but it fell apart (the casing holding the battery compartment on wasn&#x27;t strong and started slipping out all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I love this one.  It gets WAY hotter than the sephora version.  Definitely hot enough to burn yourself if you are not careful, which is why I took off one star.  However, once you get used to it, it is SO EASY to shape your lash exactly how you want it, and the curl holds.  I love using this after mascara, since it also deals with clumps.  You do need to learn the trick of it, but once you do, you can get whatever shape you like without pinching your lid or having weird crimps in your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 July 2012 update - still loving this curler.  I haven&#x27;t had to change the battery yet.  With the other stick curler, I would have had to change it at least twice by now.  The construction is holding up very well, and the curling is still effortless.</li>
    <li> This item seems good enough quality, but it does not seem to curl my eyelashes very much.  Guess I&#x27;ll return to &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; curling!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas-she loved it!  It did everything advertised...for about six weeks.  The heater stopped working, even though she tried multiple battery changes.  Of course, the return date expired ten days before the product did...  : (</li>
    <li> Easy to use, the comb on the tip protects your eyelid get burn. And of course works amazingly well !</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up fast!</li>
    <li> Only fair.  Had to use too long to get curl.</li>
    <li> Careful using it to curl lashes and yet not burn self since the eyelids are very sensitive.  A bit of a learning curve but I do like the results.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Much better than what&#x27;s sold at Sally Beauty Supply.  A definite keeper.</li>
    <li> A must have!  Easy to use, battery use minimal, curls &amp; brushes at the same time!</li>
    <li> Great Product works as advertized</li>
    <li> I have had issues with my eyelashes falling out, probably from years of using the clamp curler.  Now I don&#x27;t have this problem anymore! My eyelashes curl perfectly, and there is no need to put on mascara first as others have recommended.  It heats up quickly, and so far the battery is still lasting after a few months use.  It&#x27;s not so hot that I am afraid to use it near my eyes, which I was originally concerned about.  The price is incredible. What a great find!</li>
    <li> The product works great. My eyelashes maintain a perfect curl all day long. The only negativity would be that it requires a fairly new to new battery at all times or it won&#x27;t heat. That can be annoying when you think it&#x27;s been heating for the last 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is a total piece of crap, yes it heats but does nothing else.  I have had good luck in everything I have ordered from Amazon but this is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am not sure but I had extreme burning in my eyes after using this.  The ophthalmologist said it was the nerve in my eye not closing all the way, but he did not know why.  I would be cautious using this heat on the eyelid.  I will repeat that I am not sure this  eyelash curler is the culprit.</li>
    <li> I would give it negative stars if possible.  The heat indicator never did work, but I&#x27;m rather lazy about returning things so ignored it.  But the thing is barely impressive anyway.  And now - LESS than 2 months after I received it, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I&#x27;m throwing it out.</li>
    <li> After I started using this everyday some people asked if I was wearing false eyelashes. It uses one AA battery and heats up in about two minutes. It only takes me about 10 seconds per eye to use and the curl lasts all day. It does suck up batteries so you have to be careful about leaving it on.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product. It takes a lot of time to heat up, and I hear that if you leave the batteries in then it will drain the battery juice, so it takes a lot of hassle taking out the battery after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, on my eyelashes, it takes so much time to have the heat fully penetrate the lashes and you have to swipe it along your eyelashes multiple multiple times, for each eye! I personally don&#x27;t have time to do that every day unless it was for a special occasion and I spend extra time heating up my eyelashes. I personally would just stick to the traditional eye lash curler for now.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this particularly easy to use or very effective.  The heated crimper is easier and better.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and everything but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t really curl my lashes much. At the end of the day, my lashes will go down a bit...</li>
    <li> Either I dont know how to use this item, or it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.. I am going to end up buying a manual eyelash curler .. :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what people mean when they say you need two different kinds of curlers. I love this one alone! You do need to put your mascara on first, then use it. That helps set the curl so that it lasts.it even helps me deal with a few wonky lashes that would rather turn inward!</li>
    <li> This product is all that I expected.  I would recommend it to others!  Great price and great product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> thought a big name brand would be better, but the shape does not curl the lashes near as good as other heated lash curlers I&#x27;ve tried in the past. its a flat head, which is weird. usually they are curved so your lashes follow the curve and curl. this one just helps to lift the lash line, but not curl. not too happy with it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but NOT worth buying. This was a wasteful money spent.</li>
    <li> I guess I thought this would be a magic wand for my eyelashes. Being an Asian woman, I was hoping to  improve the appearance of my eyelashes. It didn&#x27;t hold the curl when I put mascara on after curling it. It didn&#x27;t hold the mascara if I put mascara on before curling. And the device went through batteries really fast. But the bottom line is it does curl the lashes. Hopefully yours are thick enough to where you can skip the mascara and this curler would be the ace for you.</li>
    <li> I had a Sephora brand version that never worked as good as this one.  I will definitely buy another one when this one dies.</li>
    <li> if you want to achieve nice curls you still need to use an eyelash curler, then put on mascara and use this. the heat sets the mascara. otherwise you won&#x27;t have nice curls. but sometimes if you&#x27;re in a rush this can make do.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that it was worth buying. was tired of using an eyelash curler but I guess not. it mentioned that the battery should have worked about 14 times...didn&#x27;t even do that. WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> I am actually a male customer. I decided to buy this item because I am growing handlebar mustache.&lt;br /&gt;I have quite thick beard so it is difficult to naturally curl up the hair. So, this product seemed like a good solution,&lt;br /&gt;given that it will apply heat on to hair. The instruction calls 3 seconds to curl, but I give like 10 seconds since&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s thicker than eyelash. You will want to use your index finger and the comb to sandwich your hair and slowly guide&lt;br /&gt;from the inside to the tip of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to give an extra minute after the heat indicator turns pink. It just requires a good amount of heat to&lt;br /&gt;curl. The comb socket is a neat feature because I can grab on to the hair, and it can also help spreading it out so uniform&lt;br /&gt;heat can be applied. The battery seems to last long (1 battery for 10 days at least by the daily use). It&#x27;s a small tool,&lt;br /&gt;but you can expect a lot!</li>
    <li> I love this, and I have also bought for my daughter, and a grand daughter..they love it as well !!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy this product. it does not work. there are all these reviews that rave about it but personally i tried several variation of this technology &amp; it&#x27;s nothing but a scam.</li>
    <li> This curler Curl eyelashes without breaking, pinching or bending.  You can even use it with mascara on to separate lashes.  Makes lashes look longer.</li>
    <li> I opened the child and adult proof container that it came and read the directions (even though all you need to do is put the battery in) before operating. When I tried to use it for the first time...it didn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t even get warm. Nothing. Unfortunately for me I tossed all the packaging before using it (assuming that since it was sealed as if it came straight from the manufacturer why would I have any issues with it) so I can&#x27;t return it. Overall, faulty product that didn&#x27;t work from the get-go.</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely nothing for your lashes and is a complete waste of money. The head piece does not get nearly warm enough for it to be effective. In addition, the color indicator on the back does not work nor does it change color to tell you if it is ready, not that it really matters because it&#x27;s barely warm enough to burn your skin. The product drains the batteries very quickly, too and takes a long time to heat up. I would definitely recommend others to buy another brand or product because this one is flimsy and does not work. Definitely a great disappointment.</li>
    <li> Works absolutely wonderfully and is WAY cheaper than any store has it for sale! Works beautifully on false lashes and it works best AFTER mascara has been applied. MUST BUY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Look this good, it is very cheap, I think it can help me to do some small change, just began to use, the effect can also.</li>
    <li> I have very long eyelashes that are shortened by their natural curl pattern. This has helped greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have burned my eyelids a few times, but it&#x27;s worth it. When I really want to get glammed up, I straighten my eyelashes and then push them upwards for extra awesomeness.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product worth buying at all. It heats up yes BUT it doesn&#x27;t make your lashes curl even a bit! Probably the brush is made flat not concave and it doesn&#x27;t follow the shape of lash line. It&#x27;s says it&#x27;s a CURLER so it should curl the lashes, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Followed instructions and had no results.</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job in curling the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;goes through batteries too quickly&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind changing out the batteries, then you may like this product.</li>
    <li> It wasnt worth the money. Stopped working after a month or so.</li>
    <li> It does not work on my lashes. I manually curled them then combed them with this curling wand and the curl just disappeared. What??? Yea, it doesn&#x27;t curl m lashes at all</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s so handy and great for a mid-day touch up. I normally put on mascara first and then curl my lashes with this. I leave it at the base for a little longer, about 10 seconds or so, and then slowly move up the tip. My eyelashes curls and stay curl for most of the day. The only negative about this is that the battery does drain fast.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this not as a curler but to use warm the area of my lashline  next to the meibomian oil glands.  I get dry eyes if I don&#x27;t use a heating pad on them every so often and this is convenient for that. But I have tried it out as a curler and it doesn&#x27;t work very well IMO.  I have very thick, full lashes so if yours are similar I don&#x27;t think this will work for you.  It sort of curls but it takes a long time. Maybe my lashes are harder to curl with this kind of wand curler?  The best heated eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used was a cheap Ardell heated lash curler.  The Ardell heated lash curler was a traditional clamp type style, not the wand type that this Panasonic is.  The Ardell broke after I dropped it one day and it was a pain to have to hold the clamp down the entire time it while it was working.  But it really gave the nicest curl of any lash curler I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not working as great as i expected but ok.&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking to give it to my girl friends as a chrismas gift but I forget it.</li>
    <li> Works great! You cannot use cheap off brand batteries or it won&#x27;t work. My eyelashes look beautiful! It does take my mascara &amp; eyeliner off but I started using it before I did my eye makeup (not including eyeshadow)</li>
    <li> Not as hot as the other brand</li>
    <li> I have very straight lashes that point downward. This is the only eyelash curler that will give them some girl. I can use it before and after applying mascara.</li>
    <li> Well built curler. The battery compartment won&#x27;t split like other models.</li>
    <li> I just got this, so it&#x27;s too soon to say how durable it is, but I love it so far. Make sure you read the directions. A few reviewers have obviously not read the instructions, and as a result some of them aren&#x27;t getting good results.    1 - Use it AFTER mascara!  2 - Hold it for 3 seconds at least twice during the duration of the curl formation.    It is not hard at all; I did it successfully on the very first try. The curl from this curler is much fuller and natural-looking because your lashes aren&#x27;t crimped in half. The curl also lasts a long time. I slept in my makeup the other night and the lashes were still curled the next morning!    You may get different results if your lashes are very straight or short. Mine are fairly long and don&#x27;t curl naturally, but they&#x27;re also not that straight, either. I imagine different brands/formulas of mascara might make a difference in how long the curl lasts, too.    Other great features include the sleek design (not as bulky as regular eyelash curlers, fits better in your bag, etc.) and the cap that pushes the power button to the \\&quot;Off\\&quot; position. It also looks pretty; the cap has sparkles. :P Anyway, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love lashes. Anything I can do to improve how they look, I&#x27;m all in. I really like this. I use it addition to regular curling.</li>
    <li> I used this eyelash curler a total of maybe 15 times and then it all of a sudden stopped working. This is egregious product failure, and I have just returned it (Amazon was kind enough to grant me a return label even though I was a couple days out of the return window). I would expect higher quality from Panasonic considering their expertise is in electronics. Granted, this isn&#x27;t a TV, but is a pretty simple concept. Perhaps Panasonic is having issues with counterfeit. Regardless, I will not be recommending this product to family or friends, and i do not recommend that you purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not curl very well, it gives a *slight* curl... look for a curler that provides a more dramatic curl. This is not a good product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, it never curl my lashes at all. I have long eye lashes but I wanted to make them curly. And I thought this would help, but instead it gave me a headache</li>
    <li> This item did not work for me... I was looking for an alternative to the damaging traditional eyelash curlers but as it turns out, they work much better for me...</li>
    <li> This simply did not work. AT ALL! I heated it, and followed the instructions on how to curl my lashes and it DID NOT curl my lashes. I&#x27;m better off with a manual eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I have had prob 4 of these over the past 7 years, I love this thing!!! It makes your eye lashes look amazing,  I would def recommend this product.  I tell all my friends about this and alot of them have bought one and they love it too.  This is a must have!!!</li>
    <li> Maybe because I have stick straight, short eyelashes as I am Asian American but still, this did absolutely nothing for my lashes.  I tried it before mascara and then after mascara, but nothing!  I&#x27;ll stick to my standard eyelash curler (shuemera).</li>
    <li> This item did absolutely nothing for my eyelashes.  It may work on mascaraed eyelashes, but that is not how I wanted to use it.  I did not have any success with it.</li>
    <li> I have long eyelashes but they are hard to curl. I thought maybe this would help. It does an ok job. I also found it useful for removing clumps and separating lashes after applying mascara. It has a little color indicator that lets you know when it is hot enough to use.</li>
    <li> This product could not even give a curl comparable to what I can get with my mechanical eyelash curler. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still just trying it out.  I think I need a little practice to get the best effect on my lashes.</li>
    <li> My lashes were breaking off due to age and using a eyelash curler everyday.  This is a perfect solution.  I use it every day and can see that my lashes are fuller after one week.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was losing eye lashes because of the eye lash curler so I thought this would do the same thing, Curl my eye lashes. Bascially it did nothing for me. I used it for about 15 minutes and tried to curl my lashes. Really did not work like your basic curler. I will keep it only because it is a pain to return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked that this works so well.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble learning how to use it.  It&#x27;s quick and easy and It WORKS! Wow!</li>
    <li> Curls my eyelashes in seconds, I use it after applying mascara to have a natural look. The cleaning brush works great to get the mascara out of the curler.</li>
    <li> I find this worthless, the times I have use this I don&#x27;t see a difference really. This is a extra step I don&#x27;t need, a waste of time.</li>
    <li> Great little product very easy to use.Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of eyelash curlers and this one sounded interesting, but it really does nothing.  If I work at it for a very long time, I may see a little difference in my lashes, but a metal curler works way better and much faster.</li>
    <li> It curl my eyelashes without burn it. It is easy to use and fast to get heated. I am so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. DON&#x27;T BOTHER!&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of time having to write so many words.&lt;br /&gt;A cheap eyelash curler works much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this with mascara and without. You should definitely use this without mascara and then apply afterwards. If you use mascara before using this eyelash curler, it just melts away the mascara so you have to reapply anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also gets quite hot.  I&#x27;ve burned my eye lids a couple times and it hurts! So be extra careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anybody I know. After I use this I always have to use my manual curler but I use this only because I bought it and it feels like I wasted my money if I don&#x27;t use it once in a while.  I think the idea is great but they should make the wand curved like a U instead of being flat. It&#x27;s not that good the way it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does curl my lashes but not as well as my manual curler.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a different panasonic eyelash curler, one that clamped onto my lashes.  It was fine, but it would sometimes cause a sharp upward angle.  This one is great, and gives me that long, gentle curve that I want in my eyelashes. It heats up quickly, but on the downside, it seems as though it also cools off fairly quickly. It comes with a cleaning brush, but I haven&#x27;t had to use it yet.  The battery life seems to be pretty decent and the price is awesome.  A great product, but could do with a mechanism to help it stay hot/warm until you turn it off.</li>
    <li> It works better than the cheaper version, but a regular eyelash curler does the same thing.</li>
    <li> I used the heated curler after curling my lashes with regular lash curler and applying mascara. Made sure the mascara was dry before using heat. Not only didn&#x27;t it curl my lashes more, it seemed to make them straighter and it removed the mascara. My mascara ended up on the curler and the battery started to run down already!!</li>
    <li> I really was skeptical about this product but for my short (barely there) stubborn asian lashes this thing really works!! i put my mascara on first and then hold it to my lashes for not even 5 minutes and it curls it. :-D</li>
    <li> Difficult to use and to make it work. Could be operator error though:(</li>
    <li> My last eyelash curler was pulling out my eyelashes. So I ordered this one and I love it. I  have my dad&#x27;s straight Norwegian eyelashes and curling is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to apply mascara before curling. But It does cook your mascara and make it fall off. So use the curler on clean eyelashes and THEN put your mascara on.  If there&#x27;s a mascara that can tolerate the heat, i&#x27;d love to know what brand so I can buy it.</li>
    <li> I have very straight and hard to curl lashes and this did nothing. I let it heat up all the way and tried both combing quickly through multiple times, along with going slowly at points making my way up. Both ways did absolutely nothing. I would recommend just buying a $1 eyelash curler from the drug store and blasting it with your blow dryer for a few seconds instead. It works much better.</li>
    <li> I do not recomend to anyone piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I was surprised but this actually works and does a pretty good job of curling lashes. Nice alternative if you don&#x27;t want to use a standard eyelash curler. Some of my eyelashes stick straight out and this was able to get them going in the right direction. Downside is that it&#x27;s not a permanent fix.</li>
    <li> I used it and my lashes just would not curl and I don&#x27;t know what to do with it now. Oh be careful when using.  IT IS HOT!!!!</li>
    <li> This works well but not alone. You need to curl your eyelashes FIRST then use this to keep the curl. It heats up pretty fast and you will see an area where it turns from white to purple when it is fully heated.</li>
    <li> Before I got this product, I was wasting so much time trying to curl my eye lashes with the conventional curler.  Now it takes half of the time and stays up longer.  You do have to use the initial mascara just like the hair gel on your hair prior to styling.  I actually use the conventional curler to curl it a little then put one coat of mascara them use this product to curl it all the way.  Then I put another coat of mascara to finish it up.  My only complaint is that when the battery is new, it gets so hot that it burns my eye lids so I actually turn it off and let it cool off first before putting it on the eye lids...</li>
    <li> I have lashes that curl in all different directions on one eyelid.  This wand is better at helping straightening them out than the other curler I bought.  It is a little hard to get use to since it has a flat surface between the two combs.  It does require a new battery each week.</li>
    <li> I love my lashes curled but I never found a mechanical curler that didn&#x27;t pinch or pull lashes or create fake looking curls. Once you get the hang of this heated curler you will use it every day. The natural looking curl lasts very well if you are using mascara - apply mascara first then curl! one star off because this thing uses up batteries like crazy, and there is no auto magic shut off so if you forget to turn it off that&#x27;s a battery down the tubes. I am going to invest in rechargeable though, that&#x27;s how much I love this thing!</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference in curl.  I already have naturally long lashes so the old fashioned crimp style curler works much better for me</li>
    <li> If I was stranded on a desert island and only could have one beauty product with me, this would be it. It curls without tugging at lashes. I&#x27;ve had lashes rip out with the traditional kind, and that is not fun. The heat in this product seems to make the curl stay the whole day, and it really curls the angle and direction you want it to. WIN. I&#x27;m on my second one because I lost the first and can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
    <li> This is great!  I bought a different brand previously and it died within 3 months. This product gets hot enough without wearing out the battery within 3-4 uses.  Love the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; that is on it along with the brush that cleans it.  Easy to use and well put together.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what more to say other than it doesn&#x27;t work. If you order it, you will just end up returning it.</li>
    <li> I have loooooooong but straaaaaaaaaaaaaaaight and spaaaaaaaaaaarse lashes. The sparse part I can deal with, as there are trillions of mascaras in the market that can give me some volume for a fairly reasonable price (and not that reasonable, who am I kidding). But the straight part? Hell no... I tried every single mascara out there promising to hold a curl or even better, promising to curl your lashes!! And no, no, no, no. Lashes still straight. Many of you will say: why you no use a lash curler, woman??? Because every single time I did, I pinched my goddamn eyelids to no end and my lashes would go back to their straight nature in 0.1 seconds. With this little device, my lashes remain curled, i don&#x27;t pinch my lids and, in winter, it&#x27;s even more pleasant to use (warmth on your face?? Hel-lo!! Please also note that I live in Belgium, where it rains 360 days a year and it&#x27;s cold the other 5, so double win). I even use it to tame my BROWS!!! Money well spent. Thank you, Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT A DIFFERENT ONE AND IT WAS TERRIBLE AND THIS ONE IS GREAT. I LOVE IT. IT WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> I have really long(but straight) lashes so most of the time I make a hot mess when I&#x27;m trying to curl them up. I used many products. Including Shu Uemura(didn&#x27;t do its magic for me!) and then I used to use Sephora brand heated curler which was cheaply made, worked only for a little time then would stop working and you would have to buy it again! Wasn&#x27;t very good but for me the idea was better then traditional curler so I continue to purchase this poorly made product till I came across to Panasonic Heated Curler on Amazon. Had mixed reviews but I know I had to try it to see it for myself. Glad I did. Much better quality, heats up very fast and good. Works for me!</li>
    <li> Great buy!! The heat Makes my lashes long and easier to apply my mascara.</li>
    <li> To stright needs to be curved to fit you eye lash</li>
    <li> It heatens very quickly. It does get a bit too hot, but then again maybe I have to learn to handle it a little bit better.&lt;br /&gt;It has an easy brush. All in all, satisifed.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful it would work but it does help with curling your lashes. The light indicator has stopped working but that may be my fault w/ some accidental water splashing. I can tell by putting my finger near the top if it&#x27;s ready or not. I heat up my lashes, use my curler and throw my mascara on. It helps speed up the whole process of curling my lashes. It helps separate my lashes as well which is nice. I&#x27;ve used it consistently every day. You definitely need it in conjunction with a curler, though. Don&#x27;t expect it to curl for you!!</li>
    <li> This is the 8 or 9th Panasonic Eyelash Curling Wand I&#x27;ve purchased.  They last about 6 months or so...and then they start to die off.  Wish they last longer.  But it&#x27;s probably one of the best on the market.  It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> love it! better than the traditional lack curler. can also be used to tame curly eye brows right out of the shower. for best results- use BEFORE putting on mascara, then on the ends AFTER the mascara has finished drying.</li>
    <li> Excellent eyelash curler.  Fast and efficient.  Use it carefully as it is quite hot against the skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this. I really, really did. When it came, I was very excited and took it out of the package so I could use it right away. Unfortunately, it required a AA battery, which it did not come with and which I did not have in my house. Mildly frustrating, but I should have anticipated that it wouldn&#x27;t come with batteries. After picking some up, I read the instructions and followed them exactly. Only the teeniest, tinniest curl was noticeable. I used it again, with no improvement. I tried it again the next day, with the same results. I&#x27;ve used traditional eyelash curlers for years, and I was hoping to find something that worked better and would help my eyelashes stay curled throughout the day. Sadly, the Panasonic Curling Wand didn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t very useful it didn&#x27;t make any difference on my eye lashes.</li>
    <li> Curling does not last long enough as same as regular eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> This is perfect it takes away all the clumps</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d never find something to curl my lashes and help them to keep the curl. My lashes are short, straight and point downward. It takes a little work and patience but after awhile it&#x27;s easy and very much worth it.</li>
    <li> i was hoping to do away with my old school lash curler with this but that is not going to happen.  I does, however work in conjunction with it.  Using the two together makes the end result much better than either alone.  So, if you are looking for a stand alone product, I don&#x27;t think this is what you want.  If you are looking for something to help your oldschool curler this might be just what youwant.</li>
    <li> Love how it stays heated for a while and the curl is great... Also I&#x27;m not replacing the battery as often as I had to on my previous curler.</li>
    <li> It was good, but I have to change the battery often. Other than that its good and I enjoy it :)</li>
    <li> This works great for curling eyelashes.  It really goes through batteries fast so I suggest taking the battery out between uses</li>
    <li> It takes a while to heat up but it works. For me, this product works best when you use it after mascara.</li>
    <li> I have really thick eyelashes, and a few of them stick straight out.  The top lashes would get caught on the bottom lashes, I tried multiple curlers.  Nothing worked, until I found this.  It curls the straight ones, and I can get through the day without the eyelashes bugging me.  The first one I got didn&#x27;t work, never heated up.  Super quick and easy return/exchange with amazon, so glad I gave it another chance!!</li>
    <li> This type of eyelash curler is harder and just slightly more time consuming than the crimp style ones to use, but produce a far more natural and long lasting curl. I&#x27;m Asian with straight downwards pointing lashes and I&#x27;ve used all types of curlers and this one is by far the best. If you&#x27;re not used to this type of curler it takes some practice, but it is worth it. The curler heats to a very high temperature and if you tried to use it without the protective comb you&#x27;d probably burn yourself, but the comb is what sets this curler apart so you wouldn&#x27;t use it without it. Because of how hot this gets it also goes through batteries fairly quickly, but for how well it works I&#x27;ll spend the money on changing it&#x27;s battery every couple weeks. It will take most your mascara off if you use this right after applying it, I&#x27;d suggest waiting until the first coat dries and then combing through with this curler, I use Shiseido&#x27;s Majolica Majorca mascara which is waterproof and wait until the first coat dries, it still takes off a good amount, but not as much if it&#x27;s dried first. So, I crimp my lashes with a regular mechanical curler first since my lashes point downwards naturally, then a coat of mascara, let it dry, comb upwards with this curler and turning it in at the tips for a more natural curl, and then finish with another coat of mascara. With this curler and mascara combo I have achieved lashes that I never would have thought possible without false lashes. I actually stopped wearing falsies because this gives me a similar look, but using my real lashes. I hope this is helpful, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews so I&#x27;m not quite sure what makes a good review...actually good. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent for my short lashes. I do not pinch my eyelid anymore! Just be sure to follow the directions and do not touch your eyelid it definitely gets hot.</li>
    <li> After applying my L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic carbon black mascara, I used this heated curler and it separated my lashes really well and great for that natural look. But it looks like it wiped off all of the mascara ): So, I continued curling it but my lashes ended up looking shorter but more curled. But the look turned out alright after applying mascara afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend applying mascara first, curl with those metal squeeze curlers, curl your lashes with this heated curler, then apply another thin coat of mascara. If you have a tiny comb, you can try combing out the clumps o:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;ve touched my eyelids with this heated curler, it didn&#x27;t hurt, it was just really warm. But while removing my eye makeup, the areas that this curler touched felt a bit swollen and rash-like. ):</li>
    <li> nice i like it. willing to purchase next time. thank you very much. as the as i expect. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Reading some of the reviews, I was a little reluctant. Some said &amp;#34;too hot&amp;#34;, melted the mascara, etc. Well, I didn&#x27;t find that to be the  case at all. The heat is just right and none of that other stuff happened. I can&#x27;t use a regular eye lash curler and was having a hard time finding one that was just heat. Of course, Amazon has it all. The seller was fantastic. I received it in record time and I use it every day. Just wanted to say thank you to all that made this happen and I HAVE just what I needed and wanted!</li>
    <li> I have straight Asian eyelashes and it is almost impossible to curl my lashes. This does the trick and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, better any other I&#x27;ve tried. I like the color changing indicator. The battery lasts a few weeks even with daily use.</li>
    <li> well, it does kind of work, but after a few hours it makes all of my mascara dry up and does not stay up. if i was u guys, i wouldnt buy this.</li>
    <li> It works best to separate your lashes and curls too.  Works great for straight Asian eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Be careful not to poke your eye. It works amazing my eyelashes curl so much faster and they look amazing</li>
    <li> Reviews were good, so I thought this item would work, but item did not work for me at all. Idk if maybe I got a defective item or something, but this item did not curl my lashes at all. They are issuing me a refund thankfully.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these last year, and it worked incredibly until it stopped working 2 months later.  I was so disappointed, and went back to using my manual eyelash curler.  I saw this same product again on Amazon, and figured maybe my first one was defective, so I purchased a new one last month.  Four weeks later, and once again it stopped working.  I tried new batteries, nothing.  Tried rechargeable batteries, nothing.  Total waste of money.  Disappointing because it&#x27;s an incredible product when it works.  Just a shame it doesn&#x27;t work for more than a few weeks, even when replaced with fresh batteries.  :(</li>
    <li> It works! I tryed it with and without applying mascara first. The best result is WITH mascara first, since besides curling and separating the lashes, it also elongates them!!! It was a gamble for me, since I live in Brasil and wouldn&#x27;t be able to return it in case it didn&#x27;t work, but I hit the jackpot!</li>
    <li> I must have the straightest lashes on earth. Nothing happened when I used with and without mascara.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price for item -- definitely more gentle than a handle eyelash curler although I occasionally use both, but very small and compact -- love it!</li>
    <li> Would be better if it clamped lashes with heat into a curl... I didn&#x27;t get a curl affect at all.</li>
    <li> I have short, thin lashes and I was recommended to this by a friend with the same type of lashes. It shipped quickly and it came without any batteries (so make sure to buy some). I use it everyday and I noticed it eats up batteries reaaally fast. But, it won&#x27;t be that bad of a problem since it only takes a few seconds to curl. I like to use this with Dolly Wink Long Mascara (a fiber mascara: it adds fibers to the ends of you lashes to make them longer) and it looks great! Make sure when you use it to press on your lashes instead of swiping it up like applying mascara. It will wipe it off.</li>
    <li> not strong, not surprising</li>
    <li> Works like it&#x27;s supposed to. It does seem to take the mascara off while you&#x27;re doing it but my eyelashes are so straight I&#x27;m willing to use/lose extra mascara to make my lashes curly. Heat&#x27;s up fine. Overall, really great.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really curl lashes.  I think it needs a end on it like a regular eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based upon some of the reviews and let me tell you as a make up artist...this product sucks!  It does not work at all, on real lashes, extenstions or false lashes.  It is a total waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me really.  Kinda feel like I wasted money.</li>
    <li> My Asian lashes are straight and short. After watching secretlifeofabionerd on YouTube, she recommended to buy an electric curler to make the lashes stay curl longer. Following her routine on YouTube, curl with a reg curler, mascara, then electric curler, my lashes has been godly ever since! I love it!</li>
    <li> It does get very warm so be careful around your delicate eyes. It did work eventually but it took too long. I don&#x27;t know anyone who has the time for this in the mornings. I&#x27;ll stick to the regular eyelash curler from now on.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this would curl my non existent straight eyelashes, and keep them curled all day. Guess what it does! It does take some practice and time compared to a pinch curler but the results are better and way less painful.  I turn on the curler to let it warm up, put one coat of mascara on, let it dry for a minute, then curl my lashes following the diagrammed instructions. The position you hold the curler to your lashes in is where it will stay! I apply a second coat of mascara and viola- curly eyelashes. Total time approx 3-5 mins. I&#x27;m buying one for my sister now!</li>
    <li> Curls my lashes great and they stay all day. I use it before applying mascara, otherwise it just melts the mascara off. Just be careful because it gets pretty hot.</li>
    <li> only good if you have long enough eyelash... the lash stays curl longer than the regular manual one but not as long as 8 hr..</li>
    <li> This is my second one, I love them, I have very hard to curl lashes.</li>
    <li> Very nice for curling your lashes!  I cannot use those metal torture chamber curlers. This works so well and does not hurt or pull your lashes out!</li>
    <li> Great product, useful and it works perfect on the eyelashes :)</li>
    <li> I just got this delivered today. I put a  New battery unless than 5 minutes it was ready.It does curl your lashes and separates. You hold the wand at the bottom of your lashes and brush up and hold for a second Walla your lashes look lifted and great. When your done remove battery and put mascara on and your ready for your close up.</li>
    <li> My second one...This is the best out there</li>
    <li> I ordered this product originally due to the highly rated reviews from other buyers. I used to use a crimping curler which would often cut my lashes off. I was super excited when I got the product in the mail but was disappointed when I used it. I read back through the reviews and listened to many of the users that first applied a coat of mascara and let it dry before using. After following those instructions the curler worked very well! It combs through the lashes and helps unclump at the same time of curling. It works best when holding the wand to the lashes for a good 3 seconds a few times! Great product!</li>
    <li> I am half chinese, and I have long medium-thick eyelashes that stick straight out. I love this product because it gives me the eye lashes that I can&#x27;t get with a traditional eyelash curler. What I do is I use my traditional eyelash curler first and I apply a coat of mascara. I just personally do this for the extra lift, i dont even really need to do it. I then let the mascara dry and then I use the Panasonic on my eyelashes and it smoothes it all my eyelashes so nicely and gives me that natural eyelash curl. When I use my traditional eyelash curler, my eyelashes look like an L, it just has that big dent at the base of my eyelashes which I hate. And my lashes dont even stay curled with it either, they literally fall flat down again most of the time right after i apply mascara plus I have to recurl them during the day. But when I use my Panasonic my eyelashes last ALL day. It is so amazing. Also, everyone complains about the battery life and such, I personally havnt had a huge problem with it. Mine has lasted for a month and since this morning I need to change my batterie. Yeah, a longer battery life could be better, But that doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much, other then that I love this product! I recommended it to anyone, this is now my holy grail product.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I bought this with a huge level of skepticism and when I finally gave it a good honest try I was completely floored!  I&#x27;m Asian and my lashes are short and completely straight.  I tried the eyelash extensions thing and not being able to wash around my eyes were making them itchy and was driving me crazy.  So I had the extensions removed and used Latisse.  I&#x27;ve been using Latisse for about a month now and my lashes are longer, but still straight.  I first tried this nifty device without mascara on and the response was \\&quot;meh\\&quot;...so I went back and put a thin coat on and tried it again and VOILA!!! My lashes actually curled and looked dramatically curled.  Not just bent at the base, but really CURLED.  It takes anywhere between 30 seconds-1 minute to heat up and change to pink depending on your battery.  So for the price, I&#x27;m so so so so glad I gave this item a try!!!  Obviously there&#x27;s a learning curve and definitely heed the instructions for how to use it properly.  Also, I got this wand fairly close and while I could feel the heat from it, I never burned myself.  The curl lasts all day (for me I timed it about 12 hours)!!!  It looked so good still I didn&#x27;t want to wash my make up off!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Perhaps my eyelashes are too thick, but it never curled them. It is a neat product in theory, and not expensive, but it never worked for me. I ended up buying a heated one that is very similar to the non heated ones that clamp your eyelashes, and it would perfectly. I&#x27;d recommend something like that. For me, this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The heat is not strong enough to actually curl my thin eye lashes.  The little bit of curl maybe at 10 degree angle will not be much noticed or last a half day.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product!  Did not curl my lashes at all!!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all.  I followed the instructions, tried with and without applying mascara, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have tried one or two others that I purchased at local stores, then gave away.  I thought that it was just my lashes, but this one worked.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me with or without mascara on.  It is back to the old crimp kind eye lash curler.  I have decently long easy to curl lashes.</li>
    <li> I knew from the other reviews that this would eat up AA batteries quickly so that wasn&#x27;t a complaint, but I just got it in November and now it doesn&#x27;t work. Of course, I&#x27;m unable to return to Amazon. I used this about twice a week and never left it on for long periods. It just got slower and slower during the warm up phase (to turn the indicator pink) and now won&#x27;t heat up at all. I&#x27;ve tried replacing with several different batteries and even bought a new package last night to make sure. Nothing. I&#x27;m mad that it died so quickly, but it really works beautifully, so I&#x27;ll give in and buy another. Maybe somewhere else so I can return if it happens again.</li>
    <li> Cutest thing ever and it works. I have naturally long eyelashes and this gives it the extra curl in the morning or for a special night on the town. I care it with me wherever I go. It heats up very quickly and definitely does the job well.</li>
    <li> First time user of a a heated eyelash curler, and I am very disappointed with the Panasonic EH2351AC model, I found two problems.  FIRST: I had to change batteries several times, because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working or not.  Typically, I am used to seeing the light green to show its ON and then changing color when its ready.  With this item, I finally figured out that the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; indicator only works after the unit is heated and ready to go.  After troubleshooting for several minutes,  I found a SECOND problem: Although the heating element is the right temperature, the problem is that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; your lashes.  It works more as a &amp;#34;LIFT&amp;#34; but they are still somewhat straight, not curly.  As other reviewers commented, you have to use a regular eyelash curler first, apply mascara and THEN use this as a touch up item, defeating the expected purpose altogether.  The only one good thing about this curler is that if you use a lot of mascara, it gets rid of the clumps as it &amp;#34;sort of&amp;#34; melts mascara away.  I believe the brush needs a better design.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used others easier to get a good curl.  I&#x27;d pass on this one as it is difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I think this wee contraption is alright.  I tried using it today, and I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it made any difference to my lashes.  I have the false extensions, and was told a heated wand was all I could use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just.. meh.  Not awful, but not brilliant.</li>
