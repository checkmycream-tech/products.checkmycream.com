<li> This is NOT true though--</li>
<li> I have thick, long hair</li>

<li> and I use it everyday!</li>
<li> The handle is so small!</li>
<li> Wish the hair didn&#x27;t get pulled by the handle so have to use very small sections to correct this problem</li>
<li> sorry brush people :(</li>

    <li> I love this brush. I have medium to long with curls. It takes me to blow dry and straighten my hair , Frizz Free in less than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> My salonist uses a large brush to blow dry my hair.  I would use the smaller versions at home and it would take me forever to dry my hair.  I purchased this brush and now my hair is done in half the time and comes out smooth and silky!</li>
    <li> This is a best brush you will ever own if you have thick frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s non tangling, and easy to clean.  It gives hair a great lift and leaves it bouncy and non frizzy.  The only negative I have about the brush is the handle which could be a little wider for an easier grip.  All in all an amazing brush.</li>
    <li> Got what we expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect. If it&#x27;s the size you are looking for, get it. This is great for managing long hair.</li>
    <li> I want to like it specially after paying $30 for it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth this much at all...it should be selling for $20 max! I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, can&#x27;t tell it yet. I have long dark thick wave hair. I often dry it straight. This brush hurts a bit and it&#x27;s kind of unpractical. I have tried like 5 times already but can&#x27;t seem to learn the right way to use it. My hair gets caught on it a lot and it hurts. I have to use it kind of slow to prevent the tangling. it has not improved the speed of my drying time at all. I can&#x27;t tell if it make it smooth and shiny, I don&#x27;t think so. I kind of want to return it as I don&#x27;t think it works...I&#x27;m taking it to my hair stylist next week and see what she thinks.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. For the first time in my life I can skip the flat iron and curling iron, and walk out of the house without looking like Tina Turner! Beware this is a big brush. My husband calls it \\&quot;the weapon\\&quot; LOL. I have abundant, thick AND  frizzy hair and it was made for me.</li>
    <li> the bottom handle and the round part of the brush are two separate pieces fit together so there is a seam/edge that can catch your hair and pull it. Other than that, its fine.</li>
    <li> It works great. Made my hair shiny and soft. It takes away the frizz compleatly. My hair is long so this was perfect for me</li>
    <li> My daughter has one of these and her hair looked so good I decided I needed one too. Love it! Smooths hair nicely and gives me the look I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and with this brush it is so easy to blow dry it and I can finish quick!  Love the fact that the hair does not get tangled up like with other brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Makes drying faster and leaves hair soft.</li>
    <li> The hair brush was good, but it was bigger than I expected. It is for people with really long hair, my hair is pass my shoulders and this brush was too big. I got later the CL-65 and it was the perfect size for me</li>
    <li> Great brush..really nice to use.. Does the job</li>
    <li> Too large to handle easily. Does not do much for my long hair.</li>
    <li> i recieved this product in half the time as promised by amazon. so way to go AMAZON... its a very good quality brush, works very well , almost does half of the job making it  effortless for the users and especially beginners. i highly recommend it and hope to buy a few more olivia garden products soon..!!!</li>
    <li> Love the size. I bought it because it claimed to be 100% seamless body and absolutely snag-feel. This is NOT true though-- there is a bottom seam which pulls, traps and breaks my hair! Also the rubber grip will grab and pull hair, too. So I am returning and am still on the hunt for a brush that does not harm my hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. I&#x27;ve had it for over 3 years and I use it everyday! Like some of the other reviewers mention, my brush does not have rubber edges, but I don&#x27;t find that to be a problem. I never touch anything other than the handle when I dry my hair.  I have thick, long hair and I love it for eliminating frizz while I dry. The size of the brush also makes it perfect for getting straight hair with lots of volume at the roots. On the downside, the brush is a little difficult to clean. I often use hair spray and other products so it does retain some build-up that needs to be cleaned from time-to-time. However, that has been the case with any round brush I have ever used. If anything ever happens to my brush, I will definitely buy another one. I have recommended this brush to all my friends and family. I have never found a brush that I loved more.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to say anything, but since I got an e-mail prodding me to post a review, here I am! The brush was $25.00 and not worth it! I thought it would be something special, but I was wrong.....sorry brush people :(</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, the brush&#x27;s hairs starting falling off after the first use, no head cover included. She did not like the results she got. Ended up returning it. Size was good but it did not seem to be of the expected quality. Returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> I do love this brush.  Wish the hair didn&#x27;t get pulled by the handle so have to use very small sections to correct this problem but I love the way it smoothes out the hair and gives a touch of body--It won&#x27;t give curl.  I have shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I like the brush but i feel like I am going to get carpel tunnel syndrome if I use it to much. The handle is so small!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. At first I thought I went too big but it works very well. My hair is shoulder length &amp; this brush does very well drying frizz free without overly curling hair.</li>
