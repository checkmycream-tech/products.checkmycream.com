      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I can apply it more than one day in a row.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>The hairstylist that introduced it to me described it as &amp;#34;teasing in a bottle.&amp;#34; Pretty good description.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, I have fine hair and it makes all the difference in styling process.....</li>
      <li>I was soooo surprised and happy with what it did for my hair.  </li>
      <li>As with any other hair product, you may have to work with it until you figure out how to get the best results for your hair, but once you do you will be hooked.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I did not pay full price for this product.</li>
      <li>I have always had extremely fine hair and am forever on a quest to find products that will add volume to my hair.</li>
      <li>Great lift that lasts until your next wash.</li>
      <li>Great product, works better than expected</li>
      <li>and i did get my roots more volume but not as much as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I love that it performs well without the tackiness and recommend it highly.  </li>
      <li>I flip my hair all back into place after that, then I have to smooth out the top and occasionally backcomb any stubborn flat spots, but, if used in this way this product really works great to add a lot of body to the roots.</li>
      <li>I bought this product at a salon the first time and have been hooked on it ever since.</li>
      <li>I first tried this when a trial size was included in another purchase.  </li>
      <li>Love the uplift it gives to my fine, limp hair.</li>
      <li>It really is true that you can spray it onto dry hair, style with a blow dryer or just pouf out your curls if you have curly hair, and for two days you will have volume and an easily maintained style.  </li>
      <li>I have fine thin hair that has no body or volume, so I thought this will be good for me.</li>
      <li>I knew from the first spray it wasn&#x27;t the real deal, just by the smell.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so full and soft.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair and want to add lift and body, look no further!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still learning, but my hairdresser uses it and it works very well</li>
      <li>Great stuff for us girls with thin hair.</li>
      <li>Works very well</li>
      <li>The real product doesn&#x27;t smell like hairspray.</li>
      <li>What I received was not the real product.</li>
      <li>Another plus is that it&#x27;s not so full of laboratory chemicals as most other such products are.</li>
      <li>This product did absolutely NOTHING for my thinning hair except to make it feel like straw, act completely unmanagable and take away any shine it might have had.  </li>
      <li>i have fine and flat hair, this product gives it volume and texture without leaving the hair dry.</li>
      <li>I got it on sale, but definitely not worth full price.</li>
      <li>this product works when you first spray it in, but after a few minutez it is right back to the ssme old hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and thin.</li>
      <li>My hair is so thin at 60 years old, that I cannot afford to loosen any more follicles by having to tug and pull as I style.</li>
      <li>I have grown it out longer now, past my shoulders, and I love this product, as I put it on after wash, and blow dry.</li>
      <li>I only tried it twice so far</li>
      <li>This is a good product and it&#x27;s definitely helped to lift my thick, heavy hair.</li>
      <li>Really gives you a lot of boost, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky or feel weighed down.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair and this gives me added volume.</li>

<li> Read multiple good reviews about this item - bought it  and am so disappointed.</li>
<li> I spray this product on after blow drying and then use a flat iron.  </li>
<li> i have very thin, fine hair.  </li>

<li> I have grey hair and so limp!</li>
<li> It is slightly sticky too so you can tell that there is product in your hair.</li>
<li> but this is really small for the price</li>
<li> I usually buy this product from my hair sylist</li>
<li> Leaves hair stiff and hard to brush through where I have sprayed the Root Blast.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s the only hair spray I use and I love it because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and hard to comb.  I wish I could find it at the local stores.</li>
    <li> I first tried this when a trial size was included in another purchase.  I was soooo surprised and happy with what it did for my hair.

    <li> I spray this product on after blow drying and then use a flat iron.  This combination give extra lift to my limp hair. Works very well</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading reviews and seeing it on TV. I have fine thin hair that has no body or volume, so I thought this will be good for me. I used it and did not see a difference, yes it smells good but that is it. It did not give any lift to my hair which is why I bought it. It is slightly sticky too so you can tell that there is product in your hair. I got it on sale, but definitely not worth full price.</li>
    <li> Like it when my hair is shorter.  Didn&#x27;t care for it when I let my style grow out and tried using it.</li>
    <li> Great product, works better than expected</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I have fine hair and it makes all the difference in styling process.....almost looks like I have a lot of hair</li>
    <li> I usually buy this product from my hair sylist but she didn&#x27;t have any on hand. I decided to buy on-line. What I received was not the real product. I knew from the first spray it wasn&#x27;t the real deal, just by the smell. The real product doesn&#x27;t smell like hairspray. It has a very pleasant smell.In addition, it was real heavy on the hair and didn&#x27;t provide any volume. I will stick to buying it from a hair stylist.</li>

    <li> I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This gives the hair themappearance of volume like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have always had extremely fine hair and am forever on a quest to find products that will add volume to my hair.

    <li> This is a good product and it&#x27;s definitely helped to lift my thick, heavy hair. I took a chance ordering a product that I had never tried before and it worked out for me.</li>
    <li> i have fine and flat hair, this product gives it volume and texture without leaving the hair dry. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely NOTHING for my thinning hair except to make it feel like straw, act completely unmanagable and take away any shine it might have had.  What a fool I felt like!  I will never, ever purchase anything by this company; they are not only overpriced to the HILT, they are untruthful in their advertising.  Snakeoil!</li>
    <li> This works for the purpose intended and it&#x27;s light weight enough on my thin fragile hair I can apply it more than one day in a row.</li>
    <li> they were alot smaller then I thought !!!  I like the hold but this is really small for the price</li>
    <li> lasts only half an hour.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! I love it. I have fine, thin hair and this gives me added volume. I use for that added lift on dry hair.</li>
