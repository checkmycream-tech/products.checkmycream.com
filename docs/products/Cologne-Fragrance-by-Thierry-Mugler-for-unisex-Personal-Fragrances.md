      <li>Definitely nice for the summer.</li>
      <li>the number #1 fragrance all men should own</li>
      <li>Nice soapy cologne for all day wear wheter</li>
      <li>Because of that, it&#x27;s perfect for almost any occasion, and it won&#x27;t offend anybody unless you spray too much.</li>
      <li>This is a great clean scent.  </li>
      <li>I have used others, but I find Thierry Mugler is light, and has a great clean smell that has prompted many to ask what I am wearing, and where can they get it.</li>
      <li>Love this cologne.  </li>
      <li>I just wish it had more staying power.</li>
      <li>Offered by many others</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Irish Springs Soap in a bottle\\&quot; is the best description for this scent.</li>
      <li>and i still love it.  </li>
      <li>This is the most favorite cologne that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Extremely fresh scent I love it..</li>
      <li>the scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Very clean, fresh smell.</li>
      <li>This smells like Creed&#x27;s Original Vetiver - at 1/3 the price, and like other Mugler releases, has very good longevity.  </li>
      <li>You will smell clean and fresh out of the shower for hours.</li>
      <li>Fresh, clean, unoffensive scent.  </li>
      <li>Despite being safe, it doesn&#x27;t smell generic, and you won&#x27;t find a better cologne at this price point.</li>
      <li>this provides a nice clean scent somewhat like Irish Spring.</li>
      <li>i wanted to know what this smelled like before i bought it, so i wrote to the thierry mugler company and they were kind enough to send me samples.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so fresh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fresh citrus fragrance for summer.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and fresh on application, but quickly fades into nothingness and you will totally forget you were wearing any cologne in the first place.</li>
      <li>It is, in so many ways as I also own/wear Creed Original Vetiver, yet at the same time it is different with more of a linear note about it.  </li>
      <li>Thierry Mugler cologne comes out of the bottle very nice but does not last more than a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Since &#x27;Alien&#x27; was a very nice scent, i decided to take a chance and order Thierry Mugler.</li>
      <li>True to multiple other reviews read before ordering - Great summer time scent.</li>
      <li>It was intentionally made a soft and light fragrance, and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Hope to be able to purchase this in the future, through Amazon prime!</li>
      <li>delivery was quick and professional</li>
      <li>When I run out of this, I will certainly be replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it</li>
      <li>Bought from Amazon on a Wednesday evening, it arrived to me Monday afternoon, and this is a real Mugler</li>
      <li>Smells much like a soap from a high&#x3D;end hotel.</li>
      <li>I was very please with the service and product I had bought from this company</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll enjoy the rest of this bottle but will look for something that lasts longer for my next purchase.</li>
      <li>Clean and light but only lasts a short couple of hours.  </li>
      <li>I bought this as I was led to believe it is similar in scent to Creed Original Vetiver,  </li>
      <li>i enjoyed them enough to buy a full bottle on amazon, which as usual gives you a better price than your local retail store.</li>
      <li>really really love it because it is unisex, and it can be worn everyday.</li>
      <li>this doesnt remind you of springtime, you must live somewhere that doesnt have that season.  </li>
      <li>Another reviewer said &amp;#34;inoffensive&amp;#34; and I totally agree with that - it&#x27;s very &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and doens&#x27;t have any notes that really stand out or make you want to take another whiff.</li>
      <li>for a date, i&#x27;d try something a little stronger, but this would fit the bill as well.</li>
      <li>My husband got this as a gift and rarely wears any of his other fragrances since.</li>
      <li>Some say it smells like Irish Spring soap - and it is certainly along those lines, but this does not have a soapy smell to it like other fragrances.</li>
      <li>I like to use this as my &amp;#34;workout cologne&amp;#34; because I don&#x27;t notice it at all after the first few minutes, it doesn&#x27;t bother anyone else in the gym</li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
<li> So like I said, it definitely does not smell bad but there are tons of other better colognes out there.</li>
<li> I found a tester for Thierry Mugler &#x27;Alien&#x27; but could not find a tester for Thierry Mugler Cologne EDT at any local perfumery.</li>
<li> Not worth the $40 I paid.  </li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not super flowery or heavy.</li>
<li> He thinks it has a little feminine smell to it.  </li>
<li> Compared to the cologne we bought at Nordstroms, this cologne had very little scent, but it came with an after shave moisturizer.</li>
<li> It had been hard to find at the usual places</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s just so bland and forgettable.</li>
<li> Or you have a broken nose.</li>
<li> When perfume returns are not alloowed, how does the consumer protect itself against bad products?</li>
<li> The worst smell ever!!!!</li>

    <li> i wanted to know what this smelled like before i bought it, so i wrote to the thierry mugler company and they were kind enough to send me samples. i enjoyed them enough to buy a full bottle on amazon, which as usual gives you a better price than your local retail store. the scent is light and not overpowering. as others have said, it&#x27;s reminiscent of irish spring soap. the only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last that long, but i heard that was the idea when mugler designed it. it&#x27;s a great scent to wear at the gym or just at the office. for a date, i&#x27;d try something a little stronger, but this would fit the bill as well. a good purchase for anybody looking to add a lighter scent in their repertoire.</li>
    <li> This cologne makes you smell like you just got out of the shower. Because of that, it&#x27;s perfect for almost any occasion, and it won&#x27;t offend anybody unless you spray too much. If you&#x27;re looking to purchase a fragrance for somebody as a gift, this safe scent will make anybody happy. Despite being safe, it doesn&#x27;t smell generic, and you won&#x27;t find a better cologne at this price point.</li>
    <li> The best soapy fragrance</li>
    <li> I purchased for my husband but I have tried it on as well.  He thinks it has a little feminine smell to it.  I smell the male portion in it.  Good thing is if he decidesnot to wear it, I will keep it.</li>
    <li> Beginning to have difficulty buying this cologne.  Love this cologne.  Very clean, fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it it smells like limes not soap</li>
    <li> Compared to the cologne we bought at Nordstroms, this cologne had very little scent, but it came with an after shave moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells amazing! &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Fresh, clean, unoffensive scent.  This smells like Creed&#x27;s Original Vetiver - at 1/3 the price, and like other Mugler releases, has very good longevity.  Some say it smells like Irish Spring soap - and it is certainly along those lines, but this does not have a soapy smell to it like other fragrances. This could be worn for almost any purpose.  When I run out of this, I will certainly be replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;If this doesnt remind you of springtime, you must live somewhere that doesnt have that season.  Or you have a broken nose.</li>
    <li> I must apologize to the shop that I totally missed out for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I really really love it because it is unisex, and it can be worn everyday. The scent was just faded fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was quick and professional especially the secured packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> The best fragrance...like spring time</li>
    <li> My husband got this as a gift and rarely wears any of his other fragrances since. It had been hard to find at the usual places but now we get it by mail order without any problem.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised and arrived as promised. Offered by many others but I always try to keep with Amazon. I know it will be what I am ordering and will be delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> True to multiple other reviews read before ordering - Great summer time scent. Clean and light but only lasts a short couple of hours.  I looked for Mugler products after using these toiletries stocked in my Caribbean vacation room.  I&#x27;ll enjoy the rest of this bottle but will look for something that lasts longer for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the most favorite cologne that I have ever used. I have used others, but I find Thierry Mugler is light, and has a great clean smell that has prompted many to ask what I am wearing, and where can they get it. Try it, and you will like it.</li>
    <li> this provides a nice clean scent somewhat like Irish Spring.</li>
    <li> the number #1 fragrance all men should own</li>
    <li> Extremely fresh scent I love it.. It doesn&#x27;t last long but it smell very good that is the reason for the 3 stars</li>
    <li> The worst smell ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Sometimes you don&#x27;t feel like wearing cologne, so put this on. You will smell clean and fresh out of the shower for hours.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Unisex so it&#x27;s not super flowery or heavy. Really great for every day wear. Definitely nice for the summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I was led to believe it is similar in scent to Creed Original Vetiver,  It is, in so many ways as I also own/wear Creed Original Vetiver, yet at the same time it is different with more of a linear note about it.  One day I will buy Mugler body gel in this fragrance</li>
    <li> This is a great clean scent.  Can probably be worn an time without offending anyone.  Smells much like a soap from a high&#x3D;end hotel.</li>
    <li> Hope to be able to purchase this in the future, through Amazon prime!</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance and it lasts all day, which is a attribute to a quality product.</li>
    <li> years ago i had gotten a tester of this fragrance and i absolutely loved it.  i treated my self to a bottle for my birthday and i still love it.  it&#x27;s so fresh.</li>
    <li> Smells great but fragrance is fleeting. I guess that why it&#x27;s called COLOGNE. It&#x27;s a fresh citrus fragrance for summer.I just wish it had more staying power.</li>
    <li> I found a tester for Thierry Mugler &#x27;Alien&#x27; but could not find a tester for Thierry Mugler Cologne EDT at any local perfumery. Since &#x27;Alien&#x27; was a very nice scent, i decided to take a chance and order Thierry Mugler. Thierry Mugler cologne comes out of the bottle very nice but does not last more than a few minutes. Not worth the $40 I paid.  When perfume returns are not alloowed, how does the consumer protect itself against bad products? I wont order perfumes from untrusted sources again, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and fresh on application, but quickly fades into nothingness and you will totally forget you were wearing any cologne in the first place. Another reviewer said &amp;#34;inoffensive&amp;#34; and I totally agree with that - it&#x27;s very &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and doens&#x27;t have any notes that really stand out or make you want to take another whiff. I like to use this as my &amp;#34;workout cologne&amp;#34; because I don&#x27;t notice it at all after the first few minutes, it doesn&#x27;t bother anyone else in the gym (Axe body spray anyone???)  and it&#x27;s gone by the time I&#x27;m done working out. It smells good but it&#x27;s just so bland and forgettable. This is not a cologne that someone would smell on you and then walk away with an impression. So like I said, it definitely does not smell bad but there are tons of other better colognes out there.</li>
    <li> Love it, my wife was all over me!!!</li>
    <li> I was very please with the service and product I had bought from this company and I will shop with them again.</li>
    <li> Bought from Amazon on a Wednesday evening, it arrived to me Monday afternoon, and this is a real Mugler cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Irish Springs Soap in a bottle\\&quot; is the best description for this scent. It was intentionally made a soft and light fragrance, and not overpowering. Good daytime scent, or whenever you want to smell like you&#x27;ve just taken a shower.</li>
    <li> Nice soapy cologne for all day wear wheter you are at work or play…my favorite go to!</li>
