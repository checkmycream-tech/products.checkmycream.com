<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for skin. Makes the skin feel soft and good for making cosmetics</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Beautiful color and aroma, typical raw cocoa butter texture.  Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Keep this out of reach of your dogs, they will eat it if they can.</li>
    <li> Nice. Good cocoa smell. Just dont like that it doesn&#x27;t have expiration date</li>
    <li> They are totally wonderful. They are the people to go to for all your cocoa butter needs for sure. Welcome to my permanent supplier list..what more can I say..</li>
    <li> Its not what i expected... its not moist and no frangrant however i melt it down with coconut oil and  its much better for my family to use.</li>
    <li> Good quality and melts easily.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product was 2.96 oz of tiny dust type bits. No where close to 8 oz. Even with the bags on it it was not over 3 oz. I would save your money and buy from wholesalers online, I wish I would have.</li>
    <li> The only reason that I rate this three stars is cause its so hard to spend on skin. I do t know if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to be. It just hard for me.</li>
    <li> Loved how smooth this cocoa butter is. It came in a package as white rocks, similar in size to my thumb. The squirrels at my house tried to get into the package, thats how yummy it smells! I will order it again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Yeah the package isn&#x27;t beautiful but the product was perfect. I made lotion bars with it and it was awesome!</li>
    <li> 좋아!! It smells really good like chocolate! And it makes my face feel smooth! 네, 감사합니다!</li>
    <li> Great smells like chocolate. Will update review after i use it in my lotions and soaps.</li>
    <li> Part of a Christmas present.  It came a whole week early!  Now maybe i can get my part done and out!</li>
    <li> Product came in wrapped perfectly. It&#x27;s exactly what I need to make lip balm!</li>
    <li> I combined this with Shea butter and coconut oil and it had worked well for my body skin and hair. But I have not used it on my face and will give it a try</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my skin. I will continue to use it daily and will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> If I could wipe this on everything in my house I would.  Got this for Christmas,  can&#x27;t stop putting it on,  and smelling my own hands.  I think I&#x27;m addicted to this cocoa butter.  The most delicious chocolate fragrance I&#x27;ve ever smelt.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet but it smells awesome! I purchsed this cocoa butter to use in my next batch of whipped body butter.  I was very dissapointed in the packaging.  When I opened my box, the cocoa butter had spilled all over everything in it.  What a waste!!!!!  That&#x27;s less product for me to use and I&#x27;m not happy about that.  Packaging needs major improvement.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again in the future</li>
    <li> cheaper to buy chocolate already made.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping!  Will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Two words,  love it. Would recommend,  and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than buying it at a grocery store. Used to make an all natural vapor rub (like Vicks) to help with allergies. Turned out great! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells like chocolate, delicious on the skin</li>
    <li> This coco butter definitely smells of chocolate.  It comes in a strong sealed plastic zip lock bag and it looks just like the picture.  What you see is what I got.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my essential oil products.</li>
    <li> this cocoa butter is best butter i have used.:)</li>
    <li> Worked WONDERS on stretch marks that were several years old.  Very happy</li>
    <li> I weighed it when it came and it was only 2.5 lbs...what a rip off.</li>
    <li> I use this (along with coconut oil and almond oil) to make a marvelous body butter. This stuff worked beautifully in my recipe and I&#x27;ll happily purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The butter is soft and has a good aroma. The aroma and texture are both better than the butters I&#x27;ve used earlier and they should be since the ones I used earlier were not from equador. The packaging as others pointed out is not great but better packaging could also mean higher price of the product and/or shipping. An advice to them would be to use the paper used for baking and then a cling wrap. That way it might help with the issues others are facing. I&#x27;m not sure though, it&#x27;s more of a trial really. That said, as far as the product goes, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome! Great texture.</li>
    <li> smelled like chocolate! will order again</li>
    <li> I use t his in my bitty butter recipe - love how it turns out</li>
    <li> Lovely chocolate smell. I made whipped body butter using this cocoa butter, shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa powder. It came out so delicious smelling and made my skin nice and soft. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> THAT PLASTIC BAG!!! WTF! I hate that it was shipped in that bag. The bag was torn when I received it the cocoa butter was crumbled into itty bitty pieces and I&#x27;m not even sure it was 8 oz. But when I melted it it smelled exactly like chocolate and it makes an excellent body butter</li>
    <li> Best product I have found yet</li>
    <li> I made lavender bath melts and they are delightful!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using cocoa butter, specially in my daily drinks for stamaner.</li>
    <li> The best cocoa butter purchase I have made yet...</li>
    <li> Love it, excellent for making handcream</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED IT OUT YET BUT IT LOOKS GOOD - CHUNKS IN A BAG IS A NEW EXPERIENCE</li>
    <li> Good product, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the soft Cocoa smell that this butter has</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. I didn&#x27;t like the bag it was shipped in because some was kinda coming out but over all great price and smells amazing</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, use it daily. And it smells awesome</li>
    <li> Bought this to make homemade body butter.  Looks like good quality.  Can&#x27;t wait to whip it up!</li>
    <li> I made a lovely batch of almond bark with this cocoa butter. So delicious. I wish I had bought more.</li>
    <li> Nice it&#x27;s really nice when I make my boby butter and mix it with sweet orange essential oil smell real good</li>
    <li> Arrived in a sealed bag in a well padded box. Looked exactly like the picture and smells so chocolatey my mouth is watering.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, texture and softness it adds to lotion. Great packaging! Hope to be able to find more products through this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Great body butter , melts great.&lt;br /&gt;Keep skin smooth</li>
    <li> Is everything I was looking for is great thanks</li>
    <li> Mine came in a all black plastic storage container, and was a smooth hard solid disc. Smells great and has worked well in all of the products I have made so far. I will order it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Smells so good (like chocolate) and mine came in a nicely packaged, resealable bag.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have used this to make body butter and it came out perfectly.  I didn&#x27;t know it came just like the photo but it was good. Im happy.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. 8 ounces is not much, but we were able to make 3 batches of natural butter creams. The strong chocolate aroma enhanced the essential oil that I used.</li>
    <li> Great for removing burn spots helps to improve even tone make skin n out &#x27;ve and smoothe</li>
    <li> I will reorder this....great!</li>
    <li> This coco butter along with other oils and beeswax make great moisturizer bars</li>
    <li> Now my forehead is not rough from rubbing it against the wall! I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality. Exactly as listed</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:b098bd5f93f71bd15b166bf4318973fe]]The top corner of the link says 30 packages; you will only receive one package of melted Cocoa Butter in an 8oz. container. The package is poorly sealed the manufacture person should have used shrink wrap that requires a hair dryer to seal the plastic it would have given the package a tighter seal, or the proper sealer bag. More information on the package would be helpful to the consumer; on how to properly melt the Raw Cocoa Butter and its usage. There was no ingredients listed on the side of the container or bottom of the container, or were the product was manufacture all it says on the lid is 100% Raw Cocoa Butter. I would have used aluminum foil, sealer plastic or wax paper on the inside to enforce that the product has not been tampered with. It does have a strong smell, the product smells just like Okay Cocoa butter (that is used for hair and skin) and has the same texture as Okay Cocoa Butter. Without the proper labeling on how the product can be used I would not take a chance on my wellbeing to ingest this product I would do a sample test on my skin to see what kind of allergic reaction I would receive before going any further with using this product. I hope the video helps on what the package looks like.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a stronger chocolate scent and hard as a rock but alright product!</li>
    <li> works great in lip balm</li>
    <li> It was great to add to my lotions</li>
    <li> OMG! This feels so good on my skin and smells soooooo good I cant wait to try it in recipes. Weight is exactly 8oz, as described and was carefully packaged.</li>
    <li> This butter is a wonder on my severly scarred skin ( skin cancer). I&#x27;m grateful..</li>
    <li> You can practically use this straight on your hands and body as a moisturizer! I made a coca orange hand cream with this, some beeswax, some shea butter, and a touch of coconut oil (and obviously with orange essential oil) I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Good product, kind of pricey for the size but I suppose that is the standard.</li>
    <li> love it in lotion bars and a few soaps</li>
    <li> Appears to be raw, though I&#x27;m not a cocoa butter connoisseur. I made lotion with it and it did it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> When I received this product it was so smashed together it was like a bag powder.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent for my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin at all!</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviews stated, this came a little beaten up. No matter, when I opened the bag I wanted to eat it.&lt;br /&gt;I made suncreen instead and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Again, great for making your own toiletries.</li>
    <li> Smells really loud and fresh. Harder to melt down than I expected but I&#x27;m glad to have the raw and fresh product.</li>
    <li> 100% good...No more words about it. I will buy it again, and again, and again!</li>
    <li> Works well smells amazing</li>
    <li> wonderful raw butter! Worked so nicely in an all natural home made whipped body butter</li>
    <li> Works very well! Very moisturizing. Only thing I wish is that the cocoa smell were stronger, it always seems to get overpowered by my other ingredients. Still great though!</li>
    <li> Man this stuff tighten  your skin. Amazing</li>
    <li> Smells nice.  I bought it to mix with coconut oil for a body lotion.  It melted and mixed well on the stove.  It gives a little more moisturizing for the legs, arms, hands and feet during the winter months.  It wasn&#x27;t enough moisture for my face since I wash my face twice a day and my body once a day.</li>
    <li> I just got this today and I&#x27;m not impressed. It came in a simple ziploc bag and was not securely sealed. I bought it to make desserts but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable eating it now. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have that delicious chocolatey smell. So, I&#x27;ll use it for skin but we&#x27;re disappointed</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love?! This smells so heavenly and I have been using it all over my body. I initially purchased it to use on my belly as I am expecting, but it&#x27;s just too good I decided to use all over my body. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, it is easily absorbed and smells terrific. Next time I will buy a larger quantity.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter was just what my homemade vegan lip balms needed! It adds a great consistency, scent and flavor to them while of course including the natural health benefits of cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I used it to make a whipped body butter with coconut oil, almond oil, and olive oil. It melted beautifully and smelled amazing. I will definitely be buying some more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Smells so good!  Worked great in my products.</li>
    <li> exactly as described very happy will def order again great in soaps with choc scent love it thank you much</li>
    <li> I got this because I was running low on shea butter, which I&#x27;ve used to moisturize for the last year or so (I prefer Lush&#x27;s King of Skin, but it gets used up quickly and is too pricey) but I thought I&#x27;d change it up this time. I had read reviews that said cocoa butter smelled nicer than shea butter, which smells sort of earthy but not unpleasantly so. I was not expecting this to smell exactly like a bar of rich dark chocolate.  It&#x27;s a blessing and a curse to smell this delicious. Cannot use it without wanting to lick my own skin (does NOT taste as good as it smells). Moisturizes well though.</li>
    <li> This was very disappointing. It came in busted. The bag was destroyed and cocoa butter was everywhere. I had maybe two tiny pieces the size of green peas that was salvageable. Amazon tried to fix the issue by giving me some code to order another bag free of charge but that didn&#x27;t work when I tried to use it. VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what this was about, but my intent was to use ti as a moisturizer, and in the bath or shower where it works so well, using like a soap.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect ingredient for homemade deodorants and lip balm. I have really enjoyed working with it! Great Buy!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to make body butter. My 1st batch turned out very nice and this product gives a really nice chocolate smell and it is so nice on my hands! Mine came in a plastic tub vs the plastic bag everyone else is talking about and I did NOT receive 8oz. It would be generous to say I received 6oz. This is very disappointing because I wanted to make 2 batches of the body butter. It&#x27;s a lovely product, but I&#x27;m very disappointed in the amount. This whole order was very disappointing from amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this to make lotions and I just love the creaminess I have only used Shea butter and the cocoa butter is a fabulous to my hand cream.</li>
    <li> the product is good. What I don&#x27;t like is the package. It would be better in a sip-lock</li>
    <li> Raw cocoa is the best for all skin types and hair. Mix with other essential oils and its good to go.</li>
    <li> I used this in massage bars and lip balm, and I&#x27;m going to reorder to try to make a homemade deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful, melts great, and blends in beautifully. It will be hard not to just use it for everything.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, smells strong it will over power your stuff.</li>
    <li> I expected this to smell more like Cocoa, so I&#x27;m not sure if that speaks to it&#x27;s quality or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first time getting this product, and I will try a different vendor next time so I can compare quality.</li>
    <li> Made some home made face/body cream with it and oh do I/we all love it! I whipped it up with some other good fats and it is fantastic! Spreads beautifully and the smell is so so nice. They are perfect chunks of butter.</li>
    <li> it suits my needs. i&#x27;m very happy with it and will buy again. i make my own hair products as my scalp can&#x27;t take too much of the chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great for magnesium body butter! Love the smell &amp; great price!  Arrived melted but we live in AZ--not surprised at all.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how hard raw cocoa butter was.  But it&#x27;s one of the main ingredient in my DIY lotion projects and it moisturizes very well.  Be forewarned...smelling like cocoa butter can get you hungry sometimes!</li>
    <li> Ummmm-huh!  Raw cocoa butter is some very nice stuff.  I love it on my feet, legs and elbows.  I make sure to put a taste of it on my tattoo to keep it looking moist and non-flaky. Talk about keeping moisture in after a shower or bath, cocoa butter is the answer!  My heels and elbows are still soft a day or so later (of course, I keep re-doing the process with each water treatment) but this is some very good softening and moisturizing butter.</li>
    <li> It is hard to handle or do things with, but if you are looking for that &#x27;glitter glow glisten&#x27; nightclub look, definitely add this to your regimen--after shower, before final top coat.</li>
    <li> Okay its nice and buttery soft. It comes in a baggy wraped in another baggy. When you open the first baggy WOOOSSSHHH the smell of coca butter smacks you in the face. I loved it but when i started doing stuff with it it had this weird underlining smell i didnt recognize with my precious brand i tried. This is good cocoa butter but i do prefer you get kasoki brand instead.</li>
    <li> My daughter is going to make soap with the butter.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The heat of your body melts it into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;AND I smell a little like chocolate.</li>
    <li> Very poor not hygienic presentation of the product, received my bag of cocoa butter inside of a ripped wide open bag inside of the box, it didn&#x27;t happened during the shipping since I noticed that it was a snack size ziploc bag for 8 oz of product, very bad experience, they should watch closer their customer service and quality control.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but I don&#x27;t like chocolate of any kind and this gives your house, kitchen and you the scent of hot chocolate. All day.. I&#x27;ve used it all by mixing a little with the Shea butter. I hate to waste anything so I incorporate this product into another butter and it doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Would get more from them again.</li>
    <li> It was a little hard to work with and measure out since it is in several hard chunks, but it smells great and worked great with the products I made.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it smells so good! My only complaint is that it is really hard so if you are using it to make your own lotion like me you might get some chunks (I whipped it with my mixer) but other then that I love it there wasn&#x27;t enough I&#x27;ll have to et more!</li>
    <li> Light cocoa scent. Easy to chop finer for easier melting. Resealable bag - good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make some lotion and it did as was expected and I was pleased</li>
    <li> It smells so strong of chocolate, it&#x27;s almost mind boggling! I used it in DIY stuff and they smelled AMAZING. However, I used it in recipes where I didn&#x27;t want it reeking of chocolate--like a rose scented lotion I was making--and found I couldn&#x27;t drown it out. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough essential oil to do that, but I feel like you have to make something with the anticipation it&#x27;ll work with a chocolate scent. I made lip balm with this as one of my ingredients and added grapefruit essential oil--divine!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s real nice raw cocoa butter. Great for making your own body butters and lotions! Smells delish! You might be tempted to eat it! lol</li>
    <li> Packaging needs to be better. It busted open in the box and was a complete mess, the box had other items in it.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product to make chocolate, and I was not disappointed. All you need to do is melt the cocoa butter (I used 30 second increments in my microwave, be careful not to let it simmer), and then add in the same amounts of powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Add a little more cocoa powder if you want a darker chocolate, and add powdered milk (no real milk, because it has water in it; this ruins chocolate) for milk chocolate. Mix it up well with a whisk, pour it into molds of some sort, and keep it refrigerated if you&#x27;re like me and live in a hot climate! The cocoa butter delivers on taste, and it makes super smooth chocolate.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and is definitely the real deal. Used it to make lotion bars with excellent results. It came in a thicker plastic bag, so I could see how some would have problems with the packaging but I had no issues.</li>
    <li> Good product. I would buy again</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I wanted but it will serve the purpose. Nice product.</li>
    <li> Clean and melts smoothly in the microwave.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t know quality because cocoa butter was in a ripped plastic bag that melted over all my other purchases. Second time I ordered it too. First shipment was lost in mailing.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering this from Amazon and I was satisfied with it. It had the fragrance I was accustomed to.</li>
    <li> This product was excellent! I used it for body butter and it came out great.</li>
    <li> Not as aromatic as some other brands I&#x27;ve used, but still a great quality!</li>
    <li> Was exactly as described.  Made excellent lip balm and deodorant. Smelled fantastic,  melted easily. Very smooth, quality product.</li>
    <li> Smells divine, great size too.  Used mine to make bath bombs.</li>
    <li> Easy to use in diy beauty product recipes, nice chocolatey scent that is not TOO overpowering, and packaged very neatly and clearly. Great product, Awesome price.</li>
    <li> Was very broken up and crumbly.</li>
    <li> Very great for making chocolate!! My family loves it and so do I!</li>
    <li> On time, smells wonderful, excellent quality  (:</li>
    <li> Love the re-closable bag.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Love this purchase and will buy again. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Worth the price. Easy to work with and excellent in making my own product.</li>
    <li> Very smooth texture and fairly soft at room temp. Great moisturizer. I mixed it with shea butter and coconut oil and applied at the end of a shower. Three days and two showers later my skin is still super soft. I can&#x27;t get over the smell. It is amazing without being too overpowering. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Made lots of Body Butter!</li>
    <li> Fresh and very good,thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> Smelled great. Looked like the picture.only crappy thing when i got it out of the shipping box the package it came in was ripped on the bottom.</li>
    <li> Very high quality. I use for skin, hair and even baking.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it smells great and easy to make things with. smells wonderful will buy over and over again. came in a timely manner and in great condition</li>
    <li> Smelt just like chocolate and so moisturizing,  love it. Melts well and worked well in my body butter recipe. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The product smells good,and it worked as expected.However, there are too many small pieces,as though scraps were used to make up an order.Gave 2.5 stars,but will not be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> Seems to be good quality, however the packaging is extreme poor quality!! It was enclosed inside a plastic bag, inside of another plastic bag. Of course the butter had melted in transit, so it was every where! A good bit of the butter was wasted due to the fact. I wish I had taken a photo. I would not buy this product again because of the poor quality in packaging. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but considering a good chunk of the butter was wasted, i would not purchase agai.</li>
    <li> I am not a person who complains a lot. But  I was very disappointed this is not raw cocoa butter it smells like shea butter. I wanted to make my daughter for her birthday some stuff with it because she loves the smell of cocoa butter. Now I have not a gift for my daughter. What are you going to do to fix this?</li>
    <li> well I love cocoa butter for my face because I have super sensitive skin so I have to have it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at all times and I thought this was a very fare price...comes in a ziplocked bag in these big chunks that is pictured .</li>
    <li> Mixed with other butters. Made my skin very soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> This is really awesome however the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is in bits and pieces. It looks like soap but of course once you hold it and it absorbs your body heat, the moisture of the cocoa butter melts easily. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This product smells great.  It  smells like good quality chocolate even though its color is light beige like what you see here on Amazon.  The cocoa butter is hard and I warmed it up and added other butters and oils to make my own cream/moisturizer.  I would buy this product again and I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: When you use this as a moisturizer, it initially smells real chocolaty but the chocolate smell dissipates over time and you won&#x27;t be smelling like a chocolate bar for too long.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love. Whips great,pure smooth</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly and was just as described.</li>
    <li> The cocao butter smells so good . It works well for the products I make. I don&#x27;t mind at all that it comes in a plastic bag. I arrived in good shape and quickly</li>
    <li> I have not used the cocoa butter yet but when it arrived packaged with other items and not packaged well ...it was very disappointing.  The thin plastic bag ripped and the cocoa butter had bounced around and stuck to every thing in the box, wasting the cocoa butter and making a mess.</li>
    <li> Lovely! Smells delicious.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I needed this to make Christmas gifts. I am sure it will work well for my gifts.</li>
    <li> Excellent  for mixing or stand alone.</li>
    <li> Product itself is OK.  Shipped in a plastic takeout container without even taping the lid on - it opened in transit.  Even a Ziploc bag would have been better.  If you purchase this item with other items, likely you will get cocoa butter on the other items, especially if it&#x27;s hot out at the time.</li>
    <li> Thought product was great! Worked just the way I wanted it too. I will be ordering more when I finish this up!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time worked perfect for my essential oils peppermint cocoa Chapstick.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell. It does take longer to melt than other pure butters but I&#x27;m guessing that is the property of Coco Butter not the brand.</li>
    <li> Good for pregnancy stretch marks and when you feel like your stomach is going to just burst from the skin tightness.  Does smell good, too.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought 2 of these because I immediately used the entire container to make body butter! The only thing that I was slightly disappointed about was that I had 7.9 oz instead of a full 8 oz and that seemingly small amount can make a difference when making certain products. That being said, it was 7.9 oz of wonderfully decadent cocoa butter!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit to hard, but it smells great and it feel wonderful on the skin.</li>
    <li> Other than being poorly packaged and squashed beyond recognition and strewn all over the cardboard box...yeah it works and smells divine!</li>
    <li> Great for soap making!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and melts quickly. I am happy with this purchase and will buy it again when I run out. I made face cream and lotion bars with it and they turned out perfect.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, smells wonderful especially if you like chocolate. Great moisturizer</li>
    <li> I need to order more today as I ran out . I made my own body and face cream and it was wonderful . When one lives in the desert it is important to use chemical filled anything . My skin looks radiant .</li>
    <li> the same as on photo, good smell of chocolate, take a liquid form from the heat of my heads, taste good too.</li>
    <li> This was a good item - only one problem - it said 8 ounces - it wasn&#x27;t.  It was only 7.8.  It threw off the recipe I used it in.  If it says 8 ounces, it should be 8 ounces.  Outside of that, the cocoa butter was smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li> Used this when I was a teen and always had success with it helping my skin. Still enjoy the smell and seems to penetrate the skin just as well as before. Need to take the time to let it warm in your hands and then just work it in to your skin. Great quick service also.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and certainly did the job - I used it to make a shea and coco butter whipped body cream.</li>
    <li> wonderful cocoa butter. very good quality</li>
    <li> Used this in a body oil recipe for stretch marks, which has been a miracle so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for dry patches on my skin. It goes on silky and smooth but it isn&#x27;t greasy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone making their own homemade beauty treatments.</li>
    <li> The cocoa butter was not 8 oz out of the plastic tub as the description says. Smells and tastes wonderful though. Worked very well in cocoa butter cookies. :)</li>
    <li> This seems of questionable quality.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like at all to hard for me don&#x27;t like it need a refund please thank you I need something that is good for me an I would like.....</li>
    <li> I love this cocoa butter it smells great and works great. I used this to make a body butter with mango butter and coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, and she told me that I have to get some for myself because it is excellent! She raves over how it feels on her skin. I will purchase some for myself.</li>
    <li> Again, use this with essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with this sellers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks you very much.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, quick shipping</li>
    <li> I ordered raw unrefined cocoa butter. I got refined which I never use. It is white and dry and spongy, not the hard hard yellow butter I&#x27;m used too. The picture is misleading. Will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Smells good!  I use it for soap-making and lotion bars.  Comes in chunks in a bag.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff a little greedy and gets everywhere!</li>
    <li> I love it! Smells good,looks just like the photo!</li>
    <li> I just received my order. It doesn&#x27;t smell like cocoa butter, even a little. The texture of it feels like it should, but this makes me think it is refined cocoa butter instead of raw like advertised. I won&#x27;t order fromt his source again as something seems off.</li>
    <li> Good product, but scent was a little strong for my needs.</li>
    <li> Smells like dark chocolate, it&#x27;s divine. I used this in lip balm as a Shea butter replacement, and it turned out great. It comes sealed in a pouch, it random sized chunks. Good color to it, and it only took a paring knife to shave off pieces for measuring. I was very pleased with the product and service.</li>
    <li> Cocobutter is raw and unrefined. At room temperature it is pretty solid and holds up well to fluxuating room temperatures. I bought this to mix with othwr butters and oils for a home made hair and body butter. Once melted and whipped into a creamy butter with the other oils i noted that the butter&#x27;s scent was very strong and overshadowed the natural scent of shea and mango butters. Price for the quanity recived is well. Packaging was off though. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. The second photo is my mixed butters that I&#x27;ve included coco butter in.  The ones that have a yellowish tone are the ones containg coco butter.</li>
    <li> Old fashion 100% coco butter! Just what I wanted not the 1 oz. in a plastic tube with additives and cost half of this in bulk. This should last me for time but I am glad to know where to come if I want more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to make white chocolate and it ended up tasting awful.  I&#x27;m not sure this product is really food grade.</li>
    <li> Great quality!  Will order again for sure!</li>
    <li> Smells like chocolate lol and works well</li>
    <li> This smells chocolately, just be warned. All of the raw cocoa butters do. Now I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made body butters with this and you cannot overpower the smell with even high grade essential oils. I would only mix it with peppermint or something else you feel goes well with chocolate! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, no complaints! Seems good to me. Packaging was a little cheapy, but this was the best deal, so I don&#x27;t mind putting it in my own ziploc.</li>
    <li> Bought to use in diy lotion and lip chap recipes. Smells great and melted perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great product I combine it with coconut oil and make my own cream.</li>
    <li> Raw and unrefined, perfect for lotion production!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the packaging and the amount seems to be short of 8 oz.  Good enough for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like that it camei n one huge piece, but quality is good</li>
    <li> I guess I got what I paid for. Saw it received good ratings, and the price was perfect, b/c I needed an add on product for free shipping. Got it yesterday and this cocoa butter does Not smell like cocoa butter. It actually smells like nothing at all. Not sure what this is. I&#x27;ll use it, but I will never order from them again. I&#x27;d rather pay more and get the real deal.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  I love this Cocoa Butter</li>
    <li> Came in a plastic bag and was pretty much cocoa butter dust! I wish I took a picture. At first I want sure what it was until I smelled it.</li>
    <li> Great cocoa butter. Used for making homemade soap. Very happy with product. Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, very chocolately and it does tend to overpower the scents in my homemade products. If that&#x27;s a concerned look for deodorized butter but for now i like the smell and the moisturizing effect it gives me.</li>
    <li> Very nice, fresh fragrance.</li>
    <li> The raw cocoa butter is wonderful I&#x27;m sure I will order it again</li>
    <li> I used this in one of my homemade beauty products.  I was a little disappointed in the smell, it wasn&#x27;t horrible but it wasn&#x27;t like other cocoa butters I&#x27;ve smelled before.  It works great for what I used it in.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, the packaging of this cocoa butter was flimsy: the plastic bag had a few tears in it.  Luckily, it didn&#x27;t make too much of a mess inside the box. Otherwise, the product was wonderful for use in lotions and lip balms.  The smell was nice, but not overpowering.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Always enjoyed using cocoa butter. First time ever using raw Cocoa butter.  I&#x27;ts very nice for the hair.  Leaves your hair soft especially after shampooing.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the 8oz bags at 4 dollars each. Was a little dismayed that shipping was also 8 dollars for them which raised prices to 16 dollars. Then I recieved my order and it was two 16oz bags! So I guess them doubling order made up for the shipping and then some. Gonna use them in my lotion bars. will now have twice as much.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s the real thing. it melts when you apply to your skin. It was crumbled when arrived and very strong in scent.</li>
