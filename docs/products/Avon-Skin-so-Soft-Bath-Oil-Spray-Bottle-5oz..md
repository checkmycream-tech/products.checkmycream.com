      <li>this Avon Skin so Soft Bath Oil Spray Bottle 5oz is one of the best purchases i have ever made</li>

      <li>I am impressed and will re-stock for future summers and warm weather trips.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, feels so good on my skin, and makes my skin sooo smooth..</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the convenience of spraying instead of rubbing.  </li>
      <li>love love love.  </li>
      <li>I know others love this product</li>
      <li>Nice, light oil, and I appreciate the spray-on bottle.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love this product for softening and hydrating my skin.</li>
      <li>and WE LOVE</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>for supplying such a great product!</li>
      <li>If you are planning a trip to Lake Michigan, I would make SURE to have a bottle of this stuff with you.</li>
      <li>I tried this on myself when going to Hawaii for the mosquitoes, and it worked okay in Hawaii.</li>
      <li>I am buying more now, just in case I ever see any fleas again.</li>
      <li>more could you want?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But as soon as I put the oil on again, I&#x27;m safe.</li>
      <li>I purchased this more for the moisturizing effects than the scent or mosquito repelling effects.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use many Avon products, but this one is always in my car and my outdoor pack.</li>
      <li>This has so many uses from moisturizing the skin after a bath, during bath or wearing outdoors to keep the insects, even ticks, away.</li>
      <li>The normal one does great</li>
      <li>Anyway, it seemed to do a pretty good job them</li>
      <li>This bath/shower oil spray works really well to keep your skin smooth and smelling great.</li>
      <li>So far it works great.</li>
      <li>and it works great on my \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; areas and keeps them soft as well.</li>
      <li>Nice smell, useful for sand flies</li>
      <li>Based on the reviews I was expecting a nice, fresh scent.</li>
      <li>We are all familiar with Avon SSS for the tub, and this spray bottle is a great way to use our old favorite after showers.</li>
      <li>I did not find it pleasant at all, reminds me some kind of pine toilet air freshener.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s made a HUGE difference for my spouse providing him relief from the torment he had been experiencing.</li>
      <li>I have a huge problem with mosquito bites.</li>
      <li>My husband would go on one side of the house where the mosquitoes are the thickest and they won&#x27;t even light.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve seen those commercials, where people stick their arms into a glass box filled with mosquitoes.  </li>
      <li>Maybe a sort of light musk or baby powder?</li>
      <li>It has been a while since I used it, and I know it used to be fantastic for skin and to keep mosquitoes away.</li>
      <li>: Affordable, works wonders, skin feels smooth after washing off&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
      <li>Mom used to use this on us to repel insects years ago, but it is not all that effective for my gf who mosquitos are very attracted to.</li>
      <li>and I have been bite free</li>
      <li>So Soft for my dog because I heard it does a good job of keeping</li>
      <li>LOL I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true or not, but I use it just the same</li>
      <li>After the oils start to be absorbed, watch out!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for my dry heels...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad you sell this special product, that not only smells so nicely</li>
      <li>The light scent is just the right  for the light oil.</li>
      <li>Avon Skin so Soft is a good skin conditioner with a great hidden benefit.  </li>
      <li>This is the original skin so soft, the kind from your childhood days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use this for my horse. She has very few bites and smells great. Bonus is I can use it too.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff that Avon came up with! It helps keep the mosquitos away from me and my puppy! It is also good for her coat! :-)</li>
    <li> Great product for smooth skin and it is also a great product for keeping mosquitos away! A great seller to work with... I will order from her again!</li>
    <li> I have a huge problem with mosquito bites. I get bitten from the end of spring until mid-fall, several bites every day. I do not live in the woods. I live in a house in the city. But, somehow, mosquitoes find me and feed on me. They can&#x27;t get enough of me. Last summer I was getting bitten so much, and the bites were welting so badly, that I had to sleep fully clothed, with my pants tucked into my socks and socks on my hands, to keep from getting eaten alive at night. All night I could hear the mosquitoes buzzing in my ears, trying to find a way to get me. I&#x27;d get up in the morning, and the second I removed any clothing, I&#x27;d get a bite. Or four. So, I was DESPERATE to find relief this summer, to not have to go through that again. I didn&#x27;t want to have to wear a chemically deet spray inside my house, but I would have if it had come to that. Instead, I found reviews of this product stating that it works for keeping mosquitoes off. Even though there were hundreds of people saying it worked, I was skeptical, especially after reading about studies that showed it didn&#x27;t work. But I was desperate. So, I bought this product. And IT CHANGED MY LIFE. I haven&#x27;t gotten a single mosquito bite while wearing it. The mosquitoes are still around, they just don&#x27;t bite me. I know they&#x27;re around because the only bites I have gotten have happened when I am coming out of the shower, just having washed off the bath oil, and there is a mosquito waiting for me, looking for an opportunity to get a bite. But as soon as I put the oil on again, I&#x27;m safe. I know this sounds weird, but it&#x27;s absolutely true. Mosquitoes stalk me, they lie in wait for me, but with this product they do not bite me. Ever. This has been 100% effective for me.</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly and was exactly what we ordered.  We use it on our son for mosquitoes in South Florida. So far it works great.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for repelling against flea, i use it when i got a rash and the redness goes away!</li>
    <li> After hearing about the qualities of repelling bugs and tired of being bitten by mosquitoes, I finally remembered to try this.  I really battle with mosquitoes and this stuff worked! I would rather smell like SSS, than smell like so many of the other repellant creams and sprays. I have tried skintastic, organic creams, herbal creams, OFF!, DEET, and others. Recently, I put on SSS before sitting in a park area and watched as the mosquitoes flew all around and bothered other people, but did not bite me at all! It seemed amazing because I usually walk away with more than 15 bites.  I am impressed and will re-stock for future summers and warm weather trips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad you sell this special product, that not only smells so nicely but it is a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; Insect repellant.</li>
    <li> I tried using Skin So Soft to repel mosquitos years ago, and the scent always gave me a headache.  It definately repels mosquitos, and even keeps the cat from rubbing against my legs, but for anyone who is sensitive to strong scents the trade-off may not be worth it.  I thought I may have &amp;#34;outgrown&amp;#34; the sensitivity, but I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Recently moved to Saint Simons Island Georgia, beautiful but unless you are on the beach at the waters edge you are surrounded by clouds of tiny mosquitoes and tiny biting flies. Everyone here carries DEET products (in their cars, purses, backpacks etc) but I hate harsh chemicals, and I have memories of a DEET bug spray that had leaked in the bottom of my canoe eating -almost melting- my hard plastic camera case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have exclusively used Skin So Soft for the past ten plus years, (especially diligent in using after the cases of West Nile started popping up), mostly in and around Vancouver, Penticton and Whistler Canada, and it has always worked well for us. So when we realized what we were facing here in Georgia I ordered six bottles of Skin So Soft. Before it arrived, I would probably get between 3 and 8 bites an outing, my kids the same but my husband would literally receive hundreds of bites. Since the Skin So Soft arrived the kids and I have been bite free and it&#x27;s made a HUGE difference for my spouse providing him relief from the torment he had been experiencing. To give you an idea, before going to coach our boys at football he sprayed his legs and arms liberally with the Skin So Soft. When he arrived home I asked him if he had been around a campfire because it looked like his legs were covered in ash, almost like all his leg hair had been burned but when we looked closer it turned out to be thousands of tiny dead flies that I assume met their end in the oil from the Skin So Soft when they landed and tried to bite. Visible proof of this product at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, feels so good on my skin, and makes my skin sooo smooth..</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I was being attacked by fleas and had red itchy spots all over my body. Before using it, I could see fleas jumping on my leg and when I started using this after taking showers, I barely saw any flea bites on me. I recently just got Fleabusters to get rid of the fleas in the whole apartment but Avon kept me safe before the treatment! I am buying more now, just in case I ever see any fleas again.</li>
    <li> Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Makes skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;Repels mosquitos.&lt;br /&gt;What more could you want?&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff so much, I&#x27;m thinking about selling it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the oils in this spray/scent were good for combating fleas, since I had tons and tons of flea bites all over my body and didn&#x27;t want anymore!  But I don&#x27;t know if it actually helped but what did happen is that this oil (any body oil) makes me itch and the scent of Avon Skin So Soft is really overpowering!  Even I&#x27;D stay away from myself!</li>
    <li> It is frustrating to have to work so hard to get a small, misdirected mist of the oil.  The oil itself has a nice feel to it (not greasy) and a subtle pleasant fragrance.  But I won&#x27;t buy this again because of the mister.  I&#x27;m forced to open and pour which defeats the whole reason I bought this.  Avon usually does a better job than this.</li>
    <li> My dog is very sensitive to fleas and flea bites. This is a lifesaver. Not only does it repel the fleas when he is outside but it soothes his skin. He smells good too.</li>
    <li> avon skin so soft repels mosquitos very well.  i have been using this product for 25 years and even used it exclusively when i went to the okeefenooche swamp.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for supplying such a great product!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST THING for camping or outdoor activities. DEET makes me feel dizzy--I hate chemical repellants!! I am very sensitive to chemicals and the natural Citronella oil in this is pleasant-smelling and a pleasure to use. I don&#x27;t use many Avon products, but this one is always in my car and my outdoor pack. And it works. I use it liberally and re-apply if I go into the water. I might get one or two bites, but nothing major. And it beats using OFF, which stinks like crazy and you probably would still get one or two bites anyway.     It&#x27;s a good skin-softener, too. And it doubles as a tanning oil (without SPF, of course) if you are trying to get tan naturally.</li>
    <li> I tried this product recently at the beach because I was outside at night and was getting nailed by mosquitoes.  I am one of those people that is outside for an hour and comes in with at least 7 new bites.  Anyway, it seemed to do a pretty good job them and I only probably got 1.  I decided to buy it for myself and took it to a crab feast - boy, was I wrong.  I got eaten alive still, but was also super oily.  This probably works better for those that only get a few bites a summer, but if you get them often like me, I&#x27;d stick with deet products over this.  Also, for some reason mine was not shipped with the spray nozzle so it was SUPER messy.  Overall the product seems to have other uses so hopefully it will be good for those.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a classic.  I dilute it and spray it on my dogs before they go out.  It is an added layer of protection beyond the K9 Advantix and it makes them smell nice too.  It&#x27;s also great for my dry heels...It doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies, which is a very good thing.  And, did I mention that it smells good?</li>
    <li> A lovely product with a long standing reputation for quality. IT LIVES UP TO WHAT IT SAYS AND KEEPS THE MOSQUITOES OFF TOO!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but the bugs just hate this stuff and it really does make your skin soft while smelling nice.</li>
    <li> I have used Skin so Soft for years.  I stock up with 3 bottles or so and they last a long time.  In the winter it is great to keep the itchy skin away!</li>
    <li> This is a small bottle but when you mix 5 parts water with one part skin-so-soft it really goes a long way.  After shaking up the mix I spray a small amount it into my palm and pat my hand together then I rub them down my dog&#x27;s legs and body.  With this small amount his coat does not get greasy but it does get rid of the flies.  I have a weimer and their fur is very short and he has almost no hair on his stomach.  The treatment lasts about 6 days unless he gets wet, then you have to reapply.  This product has brought much releif and my vet was the person who told me to research it on the net.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good for stopping those nasty little bugs that arrive at dusk in Florida.  Once you get used to the oily feel you realise that next day your skins feels lovely too.</li>
    <li> If you wear a scent outdoors in Texas, you will undoubtedly attract mosquitos.  But this product actually works to detract them!  It smells fresh, woodsy, and clean and makes your skin feel soft.  So whenever I attend an outdoor event or plan to spend much of the day outdoors, I spray some of this on and get a 2-for-1 bonus.  It works as well as Off but you don&#x27;t have to smell like a chemical plant.  And it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 18 years and just love it!!</li>
    <li> I use this for mosquito repellent in the summer months.  It does a great job and smells nice too.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a 40+ year old man.   I get this mainly because the normal skin so soft works well against bugs.  I don&#x27;t like chemical bug repellent even the one that skin so soft puts out.  The normal one does great and I am real happy with it.  It smells great.  Happy camper.  Dave</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has used this product for a long time. It makes her skin very soft and helps hold the moisture in too. Knowing this, I decided to try it and it works great on my \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; areas and keeps them soft as well. Also great lube for an electric shaver and keeps the skin from getting chapped. Now, if they would make it in a man&#x27;s fragrance that would be even better!!!</li>
    <li> Not quite as efficient and preventing mosquito bites as the toxic stuff, but works pretty good if you saturate yourself completely.  And it leaves your skin so soft!</li>
    <li> It does not work well for mosquitoes, at least not the mosquitoes you&#x27;ll see in Michigan!  What it DOES work well for is deer flies.  (The ones with checkered wings that bite you)  I won&#x27;t say it is a miracle cure - it does seem to wear off fast.  However, it is the only thing I have found that helps.  I have personally watched as frantic people tried OFF and Skintastic to no avail.  As soon as I offered them some Skin So Soft, the flies left them alone.  If you are planning a trip to Lake Michigan, I would make SURE to have a bottle of this stuff with you.</li>
    <li> I use that as repellent from fleas. I think it works. I have it spray up to my knee and I got flea bites at my knee area. I should be the safest flea repellent around.</li>
    <li> Avon Skin So Soft smells soft and sweet.  It&#x27;s great for summer and can help warn off mosquitoes for me. The container is pretty and it fits well displayed on the powder room&#x27;s sink.</li>
    <li> I love this!  My two kids fight over using this at bedtime. It&#x27;s scent is relaxing to fall asleep to</li>
    <li> love love love.  reminds me of my mother&#x27;s baths when I was a child.  Her baths were deep and hot and oily.  I always thought &amp;#34;when I grow up I&#x27;m going to have baths like that!!&amp;#34;  My time has come.</li>
    <li> I live in Costa Rica now and bought this as a bug repellent. (In that regard, I haven&#x27;t tested it against bug sprays. I usually use a combination of both so can&#x27;t be a judge on that subject.) I like this for my arms and legs before I get dressed as opposed to a more expensive oil that I use on my face. I like the smell, too. Not too flowery - just a fresh, clean scent.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this. I am plagued with dry skin, especially in the winter, when it&#x27;s cold and dry and the air just sucks all the moisture out of your skin. So I saw this and read the reviews and bought it and now everyone in my house uses it and WE LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just take a shower or bath and when you step out, spritz this all over and rub it in a bit. It smells great, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky if you rub it in (even half-hearted swipes cause it to absorb well and not leave a greasy residue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only warning I&#x27;d give is that if you&#x27;re spritzing it on in the tub, please make sure you have those adhesive stickies or mats at the bottom of the tub to keep you from slipping. If this gets on the soles of your feet, you WILL slip on the floor of the bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great and I&#x27;m so happy I tried it out.</li>
    <li> I really like the Avon Skin so Soft oil for repelling bugs.  The scent is nice but not overwhelming. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a time-proven product by Avon that I&#x27;ve used off and on for years. It stays on the skin to&lt;br /&gt;help keep it moisturized. I have thyroid issues and I&#x27;m always searching for the next good product to help keep my skin soft. Further, it still has that &amp;#34;urban-legend attached to it: that it acts as a bug repellent. LOL I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true or not, but I use it just the same</li>
    <li> I tried this on myself when going to Hawaii for the mosquitoes, and it worked okay in Hawaii. I just felt very oily and shiny. I sprayed it on again because I heard it repels fleas, and it totally worked! I think my friends thought I smelled a bit strong, but I was just so happy that the cat fleas stopped biting me. Recently, I sprayed it again on myself and my two year old son to repel the Portland summertime mosquitoes. And to my disappointment, it didn&#x27;t work. We both got bit at least three times before dusk.</li>
    <li> The spray bottle is a little bit easier to use when it comes to spraying not only yourself and others in order to keep bugs away like sand gnats and mosquitoes.  It helps in spraying my dogs and puppies to keep fleas off as well.  I feel it is very safe to use on my litter of puppies since most products on the markets say you can&#x27;t use them until a puppy is 3-6 months sometimes.  I really like it not only for these reasons as it does soak into the skin of the dogs and puppies and gives an extra softness to them.  On the negative part, just don&#x27;t let your dog or puppy go play in the yard for a little while until it soaks in otherwise they will come back looking dirty.  I&#x27;ve used it on my Maltese, and her hair is so silky soft, less knots, easier to comb, and she loves to be groomed as I&#x27;m not pulling out tangles.  It just makes it so much easier.  It truly meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> smells so good feels amazing. very pleased. recieved right on time. no complaints. feels wonderful would reccommend to anyone who has skin issues</li>
    <li> Perfect mosquito repellent and good product overall. I like avon products but the skin so soft line is my fav.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Just spray and lightly rub it on post-shower (still damp but not dripping), then air dry.  My skin stays &amp;#34;so soft&amp;#34; and smelling amazing.  It was packaged well for shipment too, which was a concern of mine when ordering online.</li>
    <li> Love this product -- skin so soft from amazon. Everyone I know who uses it is hooked. It is on the tub shower constantly.</li>
    <li> Was in Africa and needed something moist i could spray on my skin, under my clothes as a mosquito repellant.  It appeared to work and at least my clothes stayed smelling nice as oppose to some chemical.</li>
    <li> We love skin so soft and the bugs absolutely HATE it. we have a pond in our backyard and never go outside in the spring, summer and fall without some of this on</li>
    <li> Skin so Soft has so so many uses, You need to look it up on the computer, plus it makes your skin feel great.</li>
    <li> This has so many uses from moisturizing the skin after a bath, during bath or wearing outdoors to keep the insects, even ticks, away.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because my neighbor&#x60;s fleas attacked us when her cats were taken away. I am not sure how well it works against fleas because on the day it arrived we did a Raid spraying and it was effective. But my daughter got hives from this oil even though I diluted it.&lt;br /&gt;About the scent. Based on the reviews I was expecting a nice, fresh scent. I did not find it pleasant at all, reminds me some kind of pine toilet air freshener. But one thing for sure you can smell it all day long on your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought wrong product, I thought it is for bug spray.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like the fragrant, will keep it for other uses.</li>
    <li> I bought Avon Skin So Soft for my dog because I heard it does a good job of keeping flies away from him. The flies are still there.</li>
    <li> Mom used to use this on us to repel insects years ago, but it is not all that effective for my gf who mosquitos are very attracted to.</li>
    <li> Avon Skin so Soft is a good skin conditioner with a great hidden benefit.  It is good for daily wear inside and outside, a very light fragrance that is unobtrusive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Used in dry humid weather and it kept me bug and misquito free, not bad smelling. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, useful for sand flies but you have to remember to apply in your ankles and feet too, otherwise you will be bite were no oil. The only complaint is that is very oily and make your skin greasy.</li>
    <li> We live pretty much in the woods in Michigan so we get a lot of unwanted creatures. Skin So Soft works fantastic against mosquitoes from biting. It&#x27;s great! We have used it for years. And this year, after 20 years, was the worst amount of mosquitoes that we have ever encountered. My husband would go on one side of the house where the mosquitoes are the thickest and they won&#x27;t even light. We use the SSS Bath Oil Pump. And it smells heavenly! Thanks AVON!</li>
    <li> We are all familiar with Avon SSS for the tub, and this spray bottle is a great way to use our old favorite after showers.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft and love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;Great moisturizer after a shower&lt;br /&gt;Price isn&#x27;t bad .. Need a larger size..Runs out to fast.</li>
    <li> Nice, light oil, and I appreciate the spray-on bottle.  I&#x27;ve been using Avon products all my life, and the price on this was certainly excellent.</li>
    <li> This is the original skin so soft, the kind from your childhood days. I currently spray it on all over after a shower to lock in moisture. This oil dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, it moisturizes everything wonderfully but I do need an extra thick cream on my belly right now because I&#x27;m pregnant. I would say this is great unless you have some very rough spots.</li>
    <li> I live in a swamp with mosquitoes as large as elephants (well pretty big)...This works very well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  I don&#x27;t like the smell but I like getting eaten alive even less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Will probably transfer to another bottle--just buy the large bottle and purchase spray bottle elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This bath/shower oil spray works really well to keep your skin smooth and smelling great. I use this after I take a shower. First I dry off, and then I spray some on the dampest part of my towel, and smooth it on where i need a little moisture (mostly legs and arms). The scent is light, fresh, and the only other way I can describe it is \\&quot;woodland\\&quot; like the description. With that, I mean it&#x27;s not sugary, girly, floral, etc like perfumes. Maybe a sort of light musk or baby powder? What I really love about this is that the scent lasts 24 hours, so your skin smells fresh all day; it&#x27;s wonderful! Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue, it soaks right in and makes you soft.</li>
    <li> Use it for myself and also use it on my dog between baths. Keeps his skin from drying out and smells good.</li>
    <li> I used Skin So Soft for a long. When I moved I wasn&#x27;t aware of anyone selling in our little town.  I went 8 to 10 years not using it.  One of my new neighbors sells Avon.  The first thing I ordered was Skin So Soft.  I was so excited because when I ran out it would be so easy to get a new bottle.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  The formula has been changed!  It&#x27;s all watered down!  The formula has been the same for decades.  What happened?  I&#x27;ve always applied it after a shower while my skin was still wet.  I didn&#x27;t need to apply lotion.  Now it does nothing.  It feels like I&#x27;m just applying water and scent to my wet body.  I have to use lotion.  What&#x27;s the use in using it?  I&#x27;ve had a 16 oz bottle for about 6 months and it is half full.  Can&#x27;t we  have the old formula back?  If you want to keep the current one, couldn&#x27;t you call Skin So Soft Lite and make the old formula too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
    <li> this Avon Skin so Soft Bath Oil Spray Bottle 5oz is one of the best purchases i have ever made</li>
    <li> You DO really have to want to smell like this stuff...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it personally. I spray it on just out of the shower...then bugs don&#x27;t like me and my skin gets really soft.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I&#x27;ve been using Skin So Soft for over 20 years now and it&#x27;s the only thing that keep bugs off for hours and hours and hours. After living in the hot and very humid state of NC it&#x27;s now definitely a must have on my summer body care list.</li>
    <li> I know others love this product but I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent which makes me not want to put it on and therefore it cannot be very effective for me.  Just saying.</li>
    <li> Originally bought to take care of an ant problem but found it is an amazingly good skin oil - works where others don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It is so funny to read the reviews proclaiming this as an effective mosquito repellent. Because it isn&#x27;t.  It has been tested by multiple independent labs, including Consumer Reports, and their findings do show that it does repel mosquitoes ... for about 10 minutes.  This is due to the oils it coats your skin with.  After the oils start to be absorbed, watch out!  Mosquito Heaven!  You&#x27;ve seen those commercials, where people stick their arms into a glass box filled with mosquitoes.  Well, if you do that 15 minutes after apply Skin So Soft, they will land on your arm in droves.  It has absolutely no effect at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the label.  Do you see anything on it claiming to be a repellent?  No, you won&#x27;t.  Do you know why?  Because if they made that claim, Avon would be charged with fraud.  You could coat your skin with cooking oil, that might even work a bit longer as a repellent, as it wouldn&#x27;t be absorbed as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a skin softener, it&#x27;s a decent product.  Smells nice.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping excellent service. I loved SSS as a child I had no idea about the \\&quot;bug repellent benefit\\&quot; lol ordered for a trip to SC late this summer.</li>
    <li> I always buy skin so soft for my Dogs&#x27; fleas!! It really kills them on contact. It does have to be applied every day!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the convenience of spraying instead of rubbing.  It makes you smell so fresh like babies smell when you bathe them.  It lasts all day and your skin is so soft.  I am going to reorder this.</li>
    <li> I got this because I&#x27;ve seen reviews that this repels fleas. I spray this on me after my shower and before I go to bed. I am still getting bitten. Perhaps I have some crazy mutant fleas? On the other hand, I did actually spray it on a flea and it seemed to kill it. So, I&#x27;m not sure what I am doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance, you either love it or hate it. It has an earthy fragrance to it. Think sandalwood and patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> I spray this on after every shower and it keeps my skin soft all day, even in the winter months.  I have been using it for years and it even repells mosquitos!  The price is good on amazon and you don&#x27;t have to wait for an avon rep to deliver them!</li>
    <li> I live in South Texas where mosquitoes are rampant. This oil really works and isn&#x27;t strong-smelling. I have re-ordered it twice already because I was so happy with it.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews, I purchased skin so soft in attempt to keep mosquitos and no-see-ums from biting me.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Affordable, works wonders, skin feels smooth after washing off&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Leaves skin feeling greasy</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I was a little kid. It has been a while since I used it, and I know it used to be fantastic for skin and to keep mosquitoes away. It also used to smell good. Whatever has been done to this product, UNDO it! It smells horrid now and I have serious doubts if it is going to do anything at all for bugs. Considering the price for such a small bottle, I am extremely disappointed and will never purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this more for the moisturizing effects than the scent or mosquito repelling effects. The scent is soooo overpowering. It worked well as a moisturizer but I will not be able to use it on a daily basis because of the scent.</li>
    <li> I tried to use it on my dogs.  The smell was horrible.  Couldn&#x27;t leave it on to see if it helped with fleas.</li>
    <li> Keeps the Mosquitos away!  I love that I don&#x27;t have to try to chase down an Avon lady and feel pressures to buy more or find myself being stalked every few weeks to buy something.</li>
    <li> Great product! Keeps bugs off. I use before I work in the yard. It also removes tacky, sticky stuff from price tags,tar from the car, hard to remove stuff from chrome and adhesive from your body!</li>
    <li> I really like having the spray bottle like this.  You can just spray it on in the shower and rinse off.  Skin stays soft and no more dry arms and legs!</li>
    <li> I love this product for softening and hydrating my skin. The light scent is just the right  for the light oil.</li>
    <li> The ONLY product that I use when I work in my vegetable garden.  If it works for the military in the African and South American bush areas it should - and does - work in the garden</li>
    <li> This item was received&lt;br /&gt; Within a reasonable time and am glad to get it.  It really helps to repel insects.</li>
    <li> For an oil base it&#x27;s ok. I use it about once a week since I don&#x27;t like lotion. I really forget to use it.</li>
</ol>
