### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>You can get a superbly aggressive shave with this razor, yet still avoid hacking your face off .</li>
      <li>treated with respect and if you let the weight of the razor do the work for you and not apply pressure, you will get excellent results.</li>
      <li>but the Muhle is the best.  </li>
      <li>Very, very nice razor!!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect razor for me.</li>
      <li>I have had my R41 for a week now an I am really impressed with it.</li>

      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best if you have 20/20 vision or shave wearing corrective lenses.</li>

      <li>The finish is excellent and covers even the underside of the head.</li>

      <li>Just take your time with it and find the angle that works best for your stubble.</li>
      <li>I like best about this razor</li>
      <li>The R41, however, doesn&#x27;t clog, gets almost a perfect shave on one downward pass, and is perfectly weighted.</li>

      <li>no question it gives the best shave ever.</li>

      <li>my opinion, the R41 is not a beast, but a great razor which takes a bit of practice and more respect than some others, but in the end it gives a great shave.</li>
      <li>That was a good shave</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d say for good reason.</li>
      <li>I would sometimes throw my Slant in the mix for good measure</li>

      <li>Razor is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Just keep that handle/angle in check and the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep it for when I need a fast shave v. a perfect one...</li>
      <li>Nice balance and weight, but</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall the quality is nice.  </li>
      <li>Liked the results but still wanted something closer.</li>
      <li>Yet I don&#x27;t get as an effective a shave with the milder razors.</li>
      <li>It kind of takes the \\&quot;safety\\&quot; out of \\&quot;safety</li>
      <li>as many experienced shavers feel it works better with a heavier handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this will give you really nice shave with minimum of cuts, just don&#x27;t rush and take care when shaving.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for a smooth, pleasant shave, you can stick with the &amp;#34;89&amp;#34</li>
      <li>so it was very easy to nik myself.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, this is a beautiful razor with a fit and finish of a fine sports car.  </li>
      <li>As far as the shaves go it has given me the best shaves I have ever given myself.</li>
      <li>First, this is a beautifully made razor.</li>
      <li>First of all, it is a beautiful razor.</li>
      <li>I also have a Merkur 180 and Feather DE and this by far gave me the best shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Razor itself feels great in hand, it is very solid and well build, quality in every inch of this beautiful razor, just by holding it in hand</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the Muhle R89 is a fine shaver (good for beginners), I think this one is better.</li>
      <li>Great weighted attractive design, rugged, affordable, will last a lifetime.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is beautifully constructed, reasonably priced and a pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>The chroming is high quality, but not as good as the Edwin Jagger (which is exceptional).  </li>
      <li>Yes, it is much more aggressive and you do feel the blades more, but I wouldn&#x27;t be scared of giving this razor a try.</li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>Okay...</li>
      <li>My favorite is Derby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make sure to invest in pre-shave oil and test out a variety of razor blades.</li>
      <li>The most aggressive razor I have ever come across.</li>
      <li>I still love this razor.</li>
      <li>If it works for you, you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
      <li>Practice and eventual skill matter more than anything else.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using safety razors for more than three years now</li>
      <li>okay like a eleven hours.  </li>
      <li>Smoothest shave ever; would give 5 stars if the handle were a bit heftier, giving better balance.</li>
      <li>Not matter the handle, the Muhle R41 razor is my favorite razor for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can see how that slickness might be an issue if your shave technique requires more handle usage.&lt;br /&gt;Appearance and build quality are top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Works better than I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something more aggressive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I shave my face every day and my head every other day so needless to say...shaving matters to me.  I started with the Muhle R106 combined with Feather blades and Proraso cream.  That was a good shave but it took 3-4 passes.  I switched to the R41 with an Ikon bulldog handle while keeping with Feather blades and Proraso cream two months ago.  Now I take 2 passes and it&#x27;s closer than anything I have experienced. The Ikon handle is key as it balances the head, improves control (important for head shavers especially), and improves grip (also key for shower shavers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this is a beautiful razor with a fit and finish of a fine sports car.  And like a fine sports car, when tuned and driven well, it will reward you with a pure pleasure. The first pass on your face is a bit shocking since you feel the blade more directly than any other razor.  You will hear and feel your beard scream.  The uneasiness turns to pure joy when you touch your face and its smoother than you thought possible. Like that fine sports car, it will scare you and exhilarate at the same time but you&#x27;ll go back for more.  You will appreciate the skill and effort required to use this razor and the art of the shave.  Yes, you will have some nicks; yes, you will feel the blade slice across your skin and beard; and yes, you&#x27;ll make a mistake or two.  It will make you a better shaver and reward you with an unimaginably close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor will challenge everything you know and do: you need the right technique, the right lather, and the right touch.  When these elements are in harmony its shaving bliss.  The bottom line is that this is a spectacular razor for anyone seeking shaving nirvana and is willing to challenge themselves and take risk - truly a man&#x27;s razor in a world full of toys.</li>
    <li> This razor is high quality, unlike Merkur products.  It&#x27;s beautiful, solid and very aggressive; a little too aggressive for my everyday razor.  Still, I use it when I want an extra smooth shave.  But you can&#x27;t shave unconsciously with it, you need to pay attention.</li>
    <li> After trying out Parker 99R for a month I decided to push my luck with Muhle R 41. Definitely aggressive but does the job beautifully. Effortless &amp; satisfying shave. Everyone who is tired of multi razor cartridges &amp; have begun DE shaving must have this one.</li>
    <li> So, I started by DE journey with the  Muhle R89 and after some time decided to try out the \\&quot;beast\\&quot; as some on the web refer to it. In my opinion both the R89 and the R41 are great razors. The R41 is simply a more efficient machine in whisker removal. It will remove more whisker closer to the skin in each pass due to the razor head design difference. The result is less work to achieve that BSS the we all strive for. I do agree with many that those new to DE should pass on this guy until you become proficient in DE shaving. There is a lot of blade exposure here and a higher possibility for nicks (as opposed to say the R89).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the R41 is not a beast, but a great razor which takes a bit of practice and more respect than some others, but in the end it gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> Received as a Christmas gift a few months after acquiring wet shaving as a new hobby. My first razor was the Merkur 34C; after getting my techniques down I decided I was ready for the Muhle R41. I think it is a great aggressive razor which I took for granted on my first shave with it and quickly learned to properly use it. Coupled with feather blades I have achieved some of the closest cleanest shaves with fewer passes, when compared to the 34C. Overall great razor, I notice some complain about the handle, but for me it is similar to the 34C which I like so I have no true point of comparison (especially being a novice in the wet shaving world).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to someone as their first razor unless they are patient. For me this razor is an improvement over the 34C, more so after I  acclimated to the feel of the open combs on my skin which at first seemed like torture. It has become my go-to razor...for now of course :)</li>
    <li> Update:  NOTE: This review is of the 2010 model, NOT the 2011 \\&quot;tooth comb\\&quot; model now available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M&amp;uuml;hle got just about everything right in this razor. It offers all the advantages of an open-comb razor, but somehow with an amazing degree of comfort. The thick handle is great for gripping, and the handle pattern helps even when wet.  The highly polished chrome glides smoothly on your skin, and wipes clean when you are done. The quality of the plating and finish are immediately apparent at first glance. If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade to a quality open-comb razor, you can&#x27;t go wrong with M&amp;uuml;hle R41.</li>
    <li> Perfect shaves in 3 passes, I can often get great shaves 2 passes. I also use this for head shaving in 2 passes and I&#x27;m nearly done with just a little cleanup in tricky spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an aggressive razor that llows a wide range of angles 25-40 degrees and the blade feedback makes shaving really easy once you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a DE razor and plan shaving your head this is the one to get. The blade feedback makes it very easy to feel your way around the back of your head and avoid razor burn or nicks.</li>
    <li> First, this is a beautifully made razor. The quality of the head is much nicer than say a Merkur 34c in terms of finish. That is why it got two stars rather than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is famously aggressive, but in this case, in a bad way. What I mean by that is that it feels harsh and uncomfortable with possibly no benefit resulting from that comfort downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally a designer would achieve a more \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; razor with a larger blade gap, which would allow an advanced user more control (more like a straight edge). Instead of simply having more blade gap, the aggressive feel comes from a steeper blade angle that is not for everyone. Because this razor is aggressive due to the angle rather than due to more of a blade gap, it seems to like sharper blades. I had more luck with Feather blades in this than I did in my other razors.</li>
    <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;d use it every day if I could But when I shave with it I don&#x27;t have enough stubble to shave 24 hours later. I have a thin beard. I still love this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this safety razor not knowing how different an open comb versus closed comb would be. I learned very quickly on the first and second shaves that I was using far too much pressure, and after a day or two of intense razor burn I finally got it through my thick head that open comb razors are designed to be LIGHTLY pulled across the skin (even more lightly than closed combs). Once I discovered this and started shaving properly, I absolutely loved how it handled. I don&#x27;t think I could go back to using a closed comb, as my facial hair is extremely coarse and thick, and this thing shaves magnificently, providing a closer shave than I thought even possible. And I feel like the &amp;*)@#$! man afterwards.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Gives an effortless close shave every time.  I absolutely recommend this razor.  CONS: the handle is a little light, leaving the whole razor a bit top-heavy and lacking perfect balance.  Not a butterfly-opening razor, so it takes a bit more effort and dexterity to change the blade, but totally worth the extra effort: but it doesn&#x27;t work loose unexpectedly.  Smoothest shave ever; would give 5 stars if the handle were a bit heftier, giving better balance.</li>
    <li> I have only used this razor three times, but it&#x27;s enough for me to write a glowing review of this product. I started wet shaving three years ago with a Merkur classic 33C, a popular closed-comb razor that I immediately loved. I have thick, dark beard hair and the Merkur took 3-4 passes to get super-smooth. I decided a while back that my next safety razor would be more aggressive and an open comb. I paid about $55 for this razor on Amazon. This was one of the best prices at the time, though I have read reviews that cited cheaper prices on other sites in the past. I also read reviews that said $65 was a fine price, so I wasn&#x27;t too scared by what I got it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the razor has delivered the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Instead of 3-4 passes, I can get baby smooth with 2. The feel of the blade is much more aggressive. I can really feel it on my skin. Somehow, though, I have yet to receive a cut. With my old Merkur I would typically get a few bleeders each time I shaved unless I was VERY slow and careful. But a slow and careful 4 passes takes too long and so more often than not I had some blood that quickly went away. Not so with the R41, however. Maybe it&#x27;s because I can feel the R41&#x27;s blade and therefore control it better. Maybe it&#x27;s because the razor just fits my face or technique better than the Merkur. Either way, I love this razor and don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever need another. Aside from the amazing performance, the R41 is a gorgeous instrument. The finish is excellent and covers even the underside of the head. I think it looks more elegant than the Merkur 33C. The handle is also about 1/2&amp;#34; longer and a bit thicker, making for a heavier tool. I really can&#x27;t praise this razor enough. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor specifically because of its agressive reputation and the fact that people keep comparing it to a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been an avid SE user for nearly a decade now but have always had to revert back to disposables whenever I travel as I don&#x27;t want to haul a strop around with me, and I wouldn&#x27;t  trust the airlines with one of my precious and expensive straights.&lt;br /&gt; Packing a nice, quality double edge safety razor would allow me to take the luxury shave experience on the road,  but previous attempts with other DE&#x27;s were disappointing.  They were not very close and tended to clog up since I often go a week or more between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems solved with this puppy!  Just finished an awesome shave.  My first test drive with the R41.  Took an eight day growth off my face with very little effort.  And the open comb and generous blade exposure meant minimal clogging.  It was a one pass shave.  I didn&#x27;t feel (literally) the need for a second pass.  I may have a couple smiling edge straight razors that give a closer shave overall, but the R41 really does surpass most any other shaving instrument in terms of closeness.&lt;br /&gt;It was a bloodless and irritation free shave as well.  Just be smart and respect the blade as you should all blades and it&#x27;ll respect you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think  it has a decent weight to it.  Some apparently find it a bit on the light side but personal preferences are what they are: personal.  Additionally, some have complained that the handle is a little slick.  I found I tend to choke up on the razor, grasping it just below the head, so handle texture was irrelevant; but I&#x27;ll admit that when  disassembling the razor post-shave, the handle was slippery and difficult to turn.  I can see how that slickness might be an issue if your shave technique requires more handle usage.&lt;br /&gt;Appearance and build quality are top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid of this thing.  It&#x27;s not a monster like it&#x27;s reputation suggests.  It&#x27;s a razor designed and built to do one thing- shave your face- and it does its job brilliantly.on suggests.  It&#x27;s a razor designed and built to do one thing- shave your face- and it does its job brilliantly.</li>
    <li> Great weighted attractive design, rugged, affordable, will last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For daily use, holds safety razors in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this razor. On the one hand it does really give a super close shave. But it is not a very comfortable shave. I really feel the blade against my skin, because this is an extremely aggressive razor. So it is an uncomfortable shave. And while I&#x27;ve used it a few times, I seem to get at least one minor cut each time, a problem I have very infrequently with my other razors. I prefer to use the Merkur slant blade razor. Also very close, but  smooth and comfortable in the shaving. I also like the Phoenix Symmetry open comb. It is moderately aggressive, a close shaver, but much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a classic, cadillac of a razor, look no further!!! This razor not only looks and feels great but will reward you with amazing shaves for the rest of your life...I have a collection of DE razors and love them all..but really this razor is all you really need and the beauty of it is it works well with any razor blade due to the open comb design. LOVE the heaviness of the razor as well...just buy it...you&#x27;ll love it...it shaves just as close as a straight razor...if not better!!! I seriously don&#x27;t understand why anyone would use a straight razor when you have the R41 available. It feels like a straight razor with the blade against your face. so you&#x27;ll still need to be very careful, but overall , it&#x27;s a much safer, more pleasant shave. Seriously, you won&#x27;t get a closer shave with a straight razor...</li>
    <li> The wetshaving journey has taken me from DE&#x27;s to Straights and back to a mix depending on mood and available time. The R41, I believe,  delivers results almost on par with a Straight.  I keep a beard half the year, and want the quickest smoothest results when I trim in the neck area. I have thick whiskers and follicles on my neck that stick out a bit and are easily bumped and irritated, coupled with growth in random patterns. The fewer passes the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about this razor is the sound. It gives good feedback when you listen. Not like a singing straight, but the proper angle and light touch will resonate a bit to indicate it is smoothly cutting hairs in short passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as someone&#x27;s first razor, but believe one with some experience will like the results this gives.</li>
    <li> This is a fine razor. I have and shave with numerous DE razors and this one, with a little practice, gives me the closest shave by far and normally with only a single pass which I cannot say for any of my other razors. In fact I shaved with it this morning at 7:00. I only did one pass and my cheeks are still smooth at 9:00 pm. This razor is probably the closest thing to a straight razor shave available in a DE. However, it did not start this way. In fact I really did not like this razor at first. I used it twice, nearly cut my face off and put it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for reference I have a very thick coarse beard and find that with many less agressive razors I have to do 3 and sometimes 4 passes to get a BBS. I had read what a great shave this razor could give so i decided to give it one more chance after making one modification. I purchased a heavier handle. I put an Ikon Bulldog handle on it and it is now my go to razor. Before changing the handle I felt the razor was too light and not well balanced so it was very easy to nik myself. With the new handle this is the only razor I have used in about a month or so. I use to rotate between my Edwin Jagger de89lbl and my Merkur Progress set to 4. I would sometimes throw my Slant in the mix for good measure but now I just use this one razor. I love it!</li>
    <li> I do not usually post a review, but this time I could not just stay away from saying how great this razor is. I am a new start in wet shaving and I switched purely because I got sick of all the irritation I was getting after shaving with cartridge type razors. So I switched, and while trying to find safety razor good for me I have tried a few and all I tried were nice but they had something wrong with them. So I found this on Amazon and thought to give it a go, and it was just what I was looking for! It is very aggressive razor and for the beginner it may be very tricky to shave with, but trust me, if you are careful and follow simple rules of shaving with safety razor (don&#x27;t push on razor when shaving, prepare your face well for shaving and etc.) this will give you really nice shave with minimum of cuts, just don&#x27;t rush and take care when shaving. It takes me 2 passes to shave 10 days growth, ordinary 2-3 days growth I shave with only 1 pass and it leaves me with clean ans smooth skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor itself feels great in hand, it is very solid and well build, quality in every inch of this beautiful razor, just by holding it in hand you feel that you paid money for really quality product. My only concern is handle, as I have got big hands, it&#x27;s standard 3,5&amp;#34; handle feels a bit small for me, but this is minor problem which can be sorted by buying longer handle if I will not get used to R41&#x27;s short handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, if you are thinking of buying it, go for it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have the 2011 R41 and first and foremost I must say this thing is not for the first timer to DE shaving. As I have posted in an online shaving fourm this razor is a rule changer. I don&#x27;t know how other open combs are but this one is certainly aggressive, with a HEAVY emphasis on agressive. I belive it when I read it&#x27;s one step away from a SE. I have never heard the whiskers being mauled as loud! As far as quality it&#x27;s the usual high standard you should expect from Muhle. Which come to the one draw back, the light handle. I prefer a heavier handle and most who love this razor have put a heavier one on. You may not. As far as the shaves go it has given me the best shaves I have ever given myself. I have found that I get a much closer shave that lasts longer, and have much less irritation and fewer nicks. But, you have to pay close attention when using this razor more so than other closed bar DE&#x27;s because it can bite, and bite hard. And, it will teach you how to master blade angle and let you know if your lather is under par. If you&#x27;ve read this far and still interested in the r41, good, that means you&#x27;ve got a pair :) Over all this is one great razor when paired with a better handle and the blade that works for you.</li>
    <li> Began wet shaving a few months ago with a Merkur 34C and feather blades. Liked the results but still wanted something closer. I like to feel no stubble in any direction (yes, I go against the grain......sorry). The scary reviews of this razor are not unfounded. This is an aggressive razor and will immediately show you flaws in your skills/techniques but reward you with a COMPLETELY smooth face if you are light on the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somthing this razor shocked me about was the sound of the blade cutting the hair. It is quite loud and a bit freaky until you get used to it. The handle is a bit light and I can see why some get an aftermarket one to balance it out but I did not. I like the way it sits in my hand. The three piece design is nice but you have to be careful changing blades because sometimes the blade wedges into the top plate on the threads when it bends. A flick to the side or some running water frees it up easily. Not an issue......just beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the R41 if you want an &amp;#34;ambitious&amp;#34; shave and want to up your game.</li>
    <li> What a razor! I own 3 different ones: this, an edwin jagger de89, and a Merkur Futur. The R41 is by far my favorite. Extremely close shave, and I was able to go against the grain for the first time with a DE razor. So close. It is easier to nick yourself with an open comb razor, so take your time, be careful, and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a superb shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy now.</li>
    <li> This is a VERY AGGRESSIVE razor, so make sure you&#x27;re using a blade you love. I like how this is a step down from shaving with a straight edge razor. I use this razor five days a week and it does the job, sometimes too well and I knick myself on my upper lip or get razor burn from being too aggressive. Make sure to invest in pre-shave oil and test out a variety of razor blades. My favorite is Derby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle sucks and is too light, but almost any handle will work, so i subbed in a merkur long handle 23C handle for the stock muhle handle. I like the weight and length. However I&#x27;m considering an ikon handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the open-comb version, which is very aggressive and works well while requiring almost no pressure. Although I suspect I would have been just as happy if not happier with a closed comb version. Still the variation is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I master using this little shiny devil I will probably graduate to straight razor shaving.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail yesterday from Luxury Barber and all I can say is wow! First of all, it is a beautiful razor. Beautifully chromed and flawless. Though not as heavy as some, this razor is well-balanced. I put in a Crystal blade and gave it a test drive. I only had to do a two pass shave and my face is as smooth as glass! I was a little apprehensive at first but, if you take your time and use proper technique you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a wonderful shave. You can really hear the whiskers being cut but, I got none of the tugging some others have reported. Just a great shave without nicks or irritation. I love it.</li>
    <li> Recently got into traditional wet shaving because of a friend. Beautiful chrome finish, nice weight to it, and depending on blade you use it shaves like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen and heard everywhere that this isn&#x27;t recommended as someone&#x27;s first razor but from my experience I beg to differ. I do highly recommend that beginners be careful with their technique with this razor since more of the blade is exposed making this less forgiving than a closed comb (which is the main reason why it isn&#x27;t recommended as I read and have been told).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Love this razor and recommend it to any newbie or experienced wet shaver. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> This razor is of the highest quality and gave me a close shave with only 2 passes. I purchased it before it went up in price. Now after the price increase, I would recommend a Merkur or Edwin Jagger instead.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Edwin Jagger DE89lbl (which is an absolutely beautiful razor), but I decided to take the leap to the R41. I&#x27;ve only shaved with it once so far, and I&#x27;m sold. Not a single cut. My face is very smooth and not only that, but the aftershave splash I used barely even stung. I couldn&#x27;t believe that the combination of all three was even possible. With my DE89 I would have slight nicks here and there (especially at first), and if I wanted a close shave, the aftershave would kill. That was not my experience with the R41.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake about it, as soon as you put the R41 to your face you feel you&#x27;re dealing with practically a straight razor, it is feels noticeably aggressive on the skin, as in practically the only thing touching your face is the razor blade. It&#x27;s like someone took the safety off my closed comb razor. BUT, it&#x27;s precisely that aggression which gave me such a great shave without pain. Certain areas of my face, I didn&#x27;t even have to go against the grain to get it BBS. And sensitive and troublesome areas for me usually to go against the grain, I needed very little pressure for this razor to work. I will say this, you need to keep the handle of the R41 closer to your face, almost scraping in a way. This wasn&#x27;t a problem for me, since that&#x27;s the angle I take normally. But when I use my closed comb razors (DE89 and a Gillette)I sometimes lift the handle away from my face to steepen the angle to get it closer. You don&#x27;t need to do that with the R41. And if you do, it can cut you up in a hurry. For me, this wasn&#x27;t a problem, but if you&#x27;re coming over from say the DE89 and are noticing a lot of cuts, you may have to try a different angle, with the handle closer to your face, to see the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this razor IF you have some experience with closed comb DE safety razors. You could try it as a beginner, but coming over from a cartridge to this is a big jump and it may freak you out; DE razors are already no joke, and this razor is beyond that. If you ordered this and are new to DE shaving, use it on only your sideburn area for a while to get used to it, and finish those shaves with your cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The R41 is as beautiful as the stunning Edwin Jagger, and it&#x27;s just different. With the open comb, it&#x27;s a completely different beast. For me at least, I had to learn how to use the Edwin Jagger, because some areas required more pressure to get really close. This razor, on the other hand, will do wonders even with little to no pressure and even on with the grain passes. If you did two passes, even both with the grain, you&#x27;d still have a great shave. A little goes a very long way with the R41, and for me, that made it easier to use, not more scary. I enjoy owning both of this and a closed comb. Don&#x27;t be scared away, this was a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out I just had beginner&#x27;s luck with the R41 and I have bled to death several times since my first review. No, I&#x27;m just kidding, I&#x27;ve used the R41 almost 30 times and it&#x27;s actually the most amazing razor I own.  I have not used any other razor since I start using the R41, it is my razor. I absolutely love it. My shave today took me all of 15 minutes, 3 passes, no problem. All fear is completely gone now. Just keep that handle/angle in check and the results are amazing. If you&#x27;re interested, stop worrying about the horror stories and buy it. A week or two and you&#x27;ll be comfortable. Join the R41 club with complete confidence.o joke, and this razor is beyond that.

    <li> I have been shaving with DE razors for about 2 plus years.  The Muhle R41 is now my number one razor. I have 4 others all very good but the Muhle is the best.  I would highly recommend this razor.  I had a BBS shave with just 2 passes with no nicks.  I would not buy this razor is a first razor a lot of blade exposure for first timers could lead to accidents.  The quality of the razor is fantastic.  Shave on and be a man and put down the multi-blade cartridge garbage they sell you on TV.</li>
    <li> As has been stated in other reviews the Muhle R41 in either the standard or Grande is not for beginners. You must get your technique for shaving with a DE razor down pat before you should venture into shaving with the R41.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If treated with respect and if you let the weight of the razor do the work for you and not apply pressure, you will get excellent results. Disrespect the R41 and it will retaliate with nick, cuts and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor may not be as forgiving as, say, the excellent EJ89, but with a deft hand it should give most shavers superior results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the most aggressive razors I&#x27;ve tried in my admittedly limited experience. Yet I don&#x27;t get as an effective a shave with the milder razors. The Muhle also gives me a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Grande version. Which is the longer and fatter handle. It works well with it. That said, I have a Bulldog handle that is shorter and heavier that I prefer. Not matter the handle, the Muhle R41 razor is my favorite razor for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> I have had my R41 for a week now an I am really impressed with it. I get a really close shave with only two passes and I can feel the blade slicing through my beard. Now that being said, this is definitely not a razor for a beginer or someone wanting to try wet shaving for the first time. With the open comb design, the guard is really open and a lot of the blade is exposed. You have to have a very light touch and good form or you will end up with some heavy nicks. Honestly, I may have graduated to it a bit early but my technique is rapidly improving and I am really enjoying this razor. The Derby blade is okay but I have a heavier beard so a Crystal or the like might work better for me. If you want a close shave, don&#x27;t be afraid of this razor, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor that demands a skilled and attentive hand. If you aren&#x27;t a skilled shaver, it will teach you. I recommend this razor, but I also recommend you approach it with respect, or you&#x27;re likely to end up redecorating your bathroom in red.</li>
    <li> This razor gave me one of the closest and smoothest shaves I have ever experienced.  I have other razors that give a close smooth shave, but none better than this R41.  I used the Muhle blade that came with the razor with no issues whatsoever.  It is a beautifully crafted razor and a good stablemate for the Muhle R89 Grande.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving.  I got into the hobby after watching Youtube videos a couple months ago.  I purchased an EJ DE89, Merkur 34c and a Parker HD along with this razor.  My main concern is that I can shave my upper lip as closely as possible without blood.  The afore mentioned razors, I needed to shave against the grain while this razor allowed me to obtain an equally close shave with across the grain in two direction, toward the center and away from the center.  This greatly allowed me to avoid nicks as many wet shavers know, results often time from against the grain shaving.</li>
    <li> A tiger in a stainless steel form. You need to tame it and it would love you for life! The most aggressive razor I have ever come across. My Merkur Futur would definitely be my everyday razor. The R41 would be used for my &#x27;Royal Shaves&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Very aggressive fantastic razor.  Nice balance and weight, but the handle is not very long.</li>
    <li> This gave me the same shave like a straight razor this is one of my first top razor ever.</li>
    <li> extremely aggressive, but can be mastered with practice.  Once learned, it gives a very close shave with low irritation and burn.  Probably not for very sensitive skin, and can be fussy about brand of blade (especially for first shave with new blade).  If it works for you, you&#x27;ll love it.  But it isn&#x27;t for everyone.  Practice and eventual skill matter more than anything else.  And...don&#x27;t use it if you have the hiccups...just say no.</li>
    <li> Way back in the ought and 60s, I learned to shave with a razor much like this one. BUT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best if you have 20/20 vision or shave wearing corrective lenses. However I strongly recommend that you also buy styptic pencils from Amazon when ordering it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old man with a tough white beard.  This razor is quite simply the best.  It shaved me clean in just one pass.  No other razor has ever done that.  No nicks, no weepers, no razor burn, just the best shave yet.  I know this razor has a reputation for being bloodthirsty, but not by my experience.  It&#x27;s probably not for the novice, but for the experienced shaver this is the best razor made.  Period.</li>
    <li> A little over priced when compared to an Edwin Jagger razor. I had to return my first one because it had some tiny chroming flaws - not that big a deal but considering what they are charging, I expect a flawless product (my Edwin Jagger was, and the replacement Muhle was as well).  This is supposed to be a more aggressive razor but I found it to not be close enough that I can get away with less passes.  That being the case, the final shave isn&#x27;t much closer than the Edwin Jagger but the Edwin Jagger is much safer to use.  I found that I still have to go against the grain with this Muhle (even though there are written instructions saying not to).  It does appear to expose more blade as it seems easier to nick yourself with this (but not excessively).  So far no razor burns or irritation. Some people have mentioned that the handle is too light but I don&#x27;t see any issues with it (it seems well balanced).  Overall, there is good heft to the product and a quality feel.  The chroming is high quality, but not as good as the Edwin Jagger (which is exceptional).  I plan to continue to use Muhle over the EJ for now.</li>
    <li> Razor is amazing.  Not going to lie, when I received this and removed it from box I was a little worried about using it.  Second safety razor I have purchased, first being a Merkur 34C, and this just looked aggressive from the get go.  Put a Derby blade in it, and when I took it for a spin I noticed right off it is as aggressive as it looks.  If you treat it well and respect it, then your shave will be amazing and smooth.  This will be a razor I will definitely keep around for a long time to come. And, considering how well made it is I am sure it will be performing flawlessly for even longer.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the construction of the product and is not solid the handle is hollow and is aluminum not metal Muhle R41 is a high price for the construction bye.</li>
    <li> I can get a very decent shave with only two passes. It&#x27;s a closer shave than I can get with three passes using my other razors, a Weber PH and an Edwin Jagger DE89. Three passes and I get an simply amazing shave. I did remove the handle and replace it with a heavier Weber Classic stainless steel handle as many experienced shavers feel it works better with a heavier handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not be the best choice as as first safety razor for someone inexperienced with DE razors. You have to prep your face correctly and use light pressure or you may find the razor will cut you. The Muhle R41 has the reputation as the most aggressive safety razor on the market but I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;the Beast&amp;#34; as some do. I&#x27;ve been using a DE safety razor for over a year. I now find that I actually enjoy shaving and look forward to it, which is a big change.</li>
    <li> Coming from a long-handled Merkur razor, this thing is bad to the bone. Yes, it is much more aggressive and you do feel the blades more, but I wouldn&#x27;t be scared of giving this razor a try. Just take your time with it and find the angle that works best for your stubble. Easy does it with the pressure, just let the blades do the work and you&#x27;ll be baby behind smooth in no time.</li>
    <li> Great razor, very close shave</li>
    <li> This is a beast! You can definitely fill the blade on your skin. Used it for the first time tonight, went slow and easy and made three passes with no cuts or nicks and the shave is insanely close. Only mistake I made is trying a new brush and new shave soap that im not familiar with at the same time. This razor requires a thick, slick lather or it will chew up your face with razor burn. Worst burn i have ever had! But thats my fault not the razors. Look forward to my next shave with my old brush and soap and a little more time with this razor and I will be getting the closest shave possible. WITH OUT the razor burn. Outstanding razor!</li>
    <li> I can see how this could be nicknamed \\&quot;the beast\\&quot; in the world of DE safety razors. I&#x27;ve been using as Merkur 34hd which is fairly mild.  I started with Merkur blades then progressed to Feather blades to get a closer shave.  By closer I mean less time and passes to get the really smooth (in all directions) shave.  I have a dense but fine beard and it was taking too may passes with the Merkur.  That razor has very little blade exposure - way too gentle.  I&#x27;ll keep it for when I need a fast shave v. a perfect one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...because I found that the r41 requires attention.  No cavalier attitude with this one allowed.  No multiple fast short passes over problem areas with this one, no, you want full lubrication/buffer for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You immediately feel the actual blade against your skin unlike mild razors like the 34. The Merkur allows many different angles and pressures but the R41 requires basically no pressure and a narrow angle range. The first shave I had a few &#x27;weepers&#x27; but no cuts or trauma. The second was better as I got used to the feel but a little razor burn feeling after.  No redness or trauma but a definite light burn feeling.  A little moisturizer and time later and all fine.  Great shave, one pass with the grain and one cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the very thin Feather edge might be a little &#x27;skippy&#x27; for this level of un-suspended blade exposure.  Not sure yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall after 5 shaves I&#x27;m happy with this. I like having the opportunity for a close shave with the requirement of care and technique.  That&#x27;s why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the open comb format that allows lots of cream to the blade v. the solid bar type razors that tend to wipe off the cream before the blade gets to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I like the weight of the handle.  People complain it is too light - to the point where you&#x27;d think it was defective or something.  I don&#x27;t get that.  It is well balanced and I don&#x27;t even notice the handle. But I&#x27;m used to the super short 34 handle anyway so I really &#x27;choke up&#x27; on the R41.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway that&#x27;s my review.  Great shave, possible to get a very close shave with technique in minimal passes, nice quality and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the R41 head is available separately (~$22) elsewhere if you already have a 3-piece razor handle you love.on the R41.    Anyway that&#x27;s my review.  Great shave, possible to get a very close shave with technique in minimal passes, nice quality and finish.    Note that the R41 head is available separately (~$22) elsewhere if you already have a 3-piece razor handle you love.</li>
    <li> Do not get this razor if you are just starting out with a safety razor.  Get the R89 or Edwin Jagger DE89 instead.  The &amp;#34;89&amp;#34; razors are much easier to use and are much more forgiving.  A beginner would most likely find this a very frustrating and challenging razor to use, and may well abandon the whole DE razor thing entirely as a result, which would be a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The R41 is a great razor and has many admirers.  But it&#x27;s not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get the R89/DE89, you can then buy the R41 head separately (as I did) to experiment with a much more aggressive razor.  If you&#x27;re just looking for a smooth, pleasant shave, you can stick with the &amp;#34;89&amp;#34; razors.</li>
    <li> I decided to get the 2013 Muhle R41 despite it&#x27;s reputation of being very aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;My reasoning was that a barber uses the same strait razor regardless of the customer&#x27;s beard.&lt;br /&gt;My leap of faith was that with proper technique, the amount of exposed blade and size of blade gap shouldn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure some of you are laughing at this but it still makes sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the first shave made me think I had made a grave error, no major cuts but lots of weapers.&lt;br /&gt;I concluded this was due to my lazy technique,&lt;br /&gt;the Muhle R89 my previous razor is so forgiving one can get away with nearly anything.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my study of proper technique and shaved again the next day with far better results.&lt;br /&gt;I just made sure I keep the very shallow angle and head pressure light as a feather.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gotten better ever since and the R41 is now my daily razor no nicks or weapers.&lt;br /&gt;Very close shaves with two passes WTG and a mix of XTG/ATG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great razor but probably not for a total beginner.</li>
    <li> I got this razor after months of using old gillettes, my neck would be baby smooth at the expence of major blood and irritation. The first time I tried this razor I was terrified because of all the scary reviews of blood loss. I used a light touch and took my time with a 2 pass result that left my face and neck baby smooth with no irritation. The razor is aggressive but can easily be tamed with a light touch. Of course if you are carless and use a lot of pressure I bet you could cut yourself. I love this shave so much that Im selling all of my vintage razors. Thanks Muhle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for over 40 years, mixing straight edge and many d/e razors; this R41 does the job of both, and I think that this is &#x27;the one&#x27;. You can get a superbly aggressive shave with this razor, yet still avoid hacking your face off . It is beautifully constructed, reasonably priced and a pleasure to use. The best!</li>
    <li> I would consider myself a novice shaving with this type of razor. Just as long as you let the blade to the work you will be just fine. Very close shave and on my first time I only got one nick due to carelessness. Never the less just as long as you pay close attention and not try to rush things this razor will give you the best shave you have ever gotten. I used the Derby razor it came with. I also have a Merkur 180 and Feather DE and this by far gave me the best shave. It might not be a fair comparison since this is an open comb but regardless, this is the razor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the best combination on this razor I like to use it with the Astra razors! I can do 3 passes without any irritation and BA shave.</li>
    <li> This is my third razor, after a Merkur Classic, and my daily, a 1961 Gillette Slim adjustable.  The Muhle is completely different from either of these.  The Merkur is easy to use, but a much milder shave, you could use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette is whatever you want it to be; you simply set the adjustment accordingly.  Having said that, I don&#x27;t think the Gillette is capable of the aggressiveness of the Muhle.  Further, the head of the Gillette is a lot thicker, making shaving under the nose a much harder job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur is a much milder razor bit it&#x27;s also much harder to clean as it&#x27;s a closed comb razor and the blade doesn&#x27;t have near the gap of the Muhle even before considering the open comb.  Further, the Merkur is nearly impossible to cut yourself with.  The classic is very forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Muhle has in the vernacular, maybe the perfect name... (Mule) Nothing gets the job done quite so efficiently, or dangerously, save for a straight razor.  The open comb is solid across, but gapped immensely so rinsing is easy and fast; about the same rate as the shaving.  I understand now what other users call noise...  You feel every individual hair getting sheared right at skin level.  As to the light handle; I&#x27;ve heard loads of complaints, but I think this is a design feature.  When shaving with this razor, one mustn&#x27;t apply ANY excess pressure lest the razor go skin deep.  This razor requires the lightest of touches, but is truly a two pass and you are done razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would advise it to anyone skilled in shaving DE; I would not advise this razor to the inexperienced.  But it is awesome!  Fit and finish are better than what Merkur offers; on par with the Gillettes of old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME, but...  Take care lest you pay the blood sacrifice.</li>
    <li> I had read all of the reviews of this razor before buying. I knew what I was getting into and I am not sorry for one minute. This razor gives me the best shave ever. The key for me was slowing down the strokes; keeping the strokes small and also listening to the razor against your face to assure that the angle is cutting beard and not tissue. I can do all three passes. I have had no nicks, cuts or anything that drew blood. No question this razor is aggressive but also no question it gives the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> This razor was the first safety razor that I&#x27;ve owned. I converted from cartridges recently after getting sick of having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow 7 hours after my morning shave. I initially tried a supposedly very mild Weishi razor, but I found it to be almost to mild. The R41, however, doesn&#x27;t clog, gets almost a perfect shave on one downward pass, and is perfectly weighted. The three piece loading system is also a huge plus. In the end, this razor will cut as close as a straight razor, but without the negatives of using one. I would recommend this to anyone if a mild, closed comb, razor just simply wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
    <li> may be the most controversial razor available....and while I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best beginner razor...you shouldn&#x27;t be intimidated by it...this razor when used with the right technique provides the closest, longest lasting shave I get...but if not used correctly it will bite you!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Works better than I thought it would. Combo this with some Feather blades and it&#x27;s the perfect razor for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll probably catch some flak for this mediocre score, but just hear me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using safety razors for more than three years now and I love them. The shaves are so completely different in all the most wonderful ways and I could never go back to a cartridge. It takes some getting used to, but once you make it through the learning curve, you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this thing? No thanks. It kind of takes the \\&quot;safety\\&quot; out of \\&quot;safety razor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can get a great shave with patience and practice and proper technique, no doubt. A single pass with the grain is closer than you&#x27;ll get with a lot of other razors. So why the two stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just plain uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my brother-in-law put it, it&#x27;s almost like holding a razor blade between your thumb and forefinger, then hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this razor on loan from a friend and gave this thing four solid shaves. I got one that was close to comfortable. Again, I think the quality of the shave is fantastic, but there&#x27;s a lot of care that goes into using this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re the kind of guy that likes the idea of shaving with a safety razor, but you still have to be at work at a reasonable hour, this might not be the razor for you. You&#x27;ll have to exercise extra care when shaving with this, and if that sucks the fun out of using old-timey shaving gear for you, then move on. Use something you know and are comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, there&#x27;s a loyal following for this razor and I&#x27;d say for good reason. If you&#x27;re not afraid to take the time to really get to know this razor, dedicate a couple of weekends to it. But you definitely don&#x27;t want to give this a whirl when the clock is ticking during the work week. After you get the hang of it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great, but I&#x27;m just not willing to invest that much time. I&#x27;ll take any of my vintage Gillettes any day of the week.</li>
    <li> This razor is commonly referred to as &amp;#34;The Beast&amp;#34;.  With it&#x27;s open comb design, the blade definitely sticks out farther.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Merkur 180 for many years.  Lately, I go two or three days without shaving.  I was looking for something more aggressive.  This definitely fits the bill.  Same 3 piece design as the Merkur.  I use Feather blades and it shaves so close that I want to try a straight edge razor because it feels like a straight blade right up against my face.  With this razor, I found using shorter strokes works better than the somewhat longer full strokes using the Merkur.  I only gave it 4 starts because the handle gets slippery when wet.  After my first shave, I swapped handles with my Merkur and it fits.  I prefer a shorter handle with a heavier head, but the Merkur has a longer handle which balances the razor well.  If I had known this, I would have only purchased the Muhle replacement head and used my old handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a razor for an experienced DE safety shaver.  Don&#x27;t buy this as your first DE razor.  I know people that have a sensitive face and can&#x27;t shave every day.  Don&#x27;t buy this if that is your case.  If you want to quickly shave and get out the door, either don&#x27;t buy this razor or give yourself a week or so to get used to how it handles.  I take a bit more time on my first pass and I typically don&#x27;t have to make a second pass.  I also use a Taylor of Old style shaving cream and I put a hot towel on my face for around 30 seconds before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the quality is nice.  The blades lock into place in the head so you don&#x27;t have to worry about blade movement.  The finish is a shiny chrome.  It comes with one Derby blade.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> 1/Any mid-priced or above metal double-edge razor will be  better-built than any plastic one, &amp; the Muhle&#x27;s among the best of  bunch, it will last -generations-, if you keep it clean, dry, &amp; not dropped too often,  thus it&#x27;s \\&quot;green\\&quot;. 2/Replacing blades is far less expensive than plastic multi-blade cartridges, &amp; far \\&quot;greener\\&quot;.  3/The Muhle has enough heft, &amp; the right balance, to \\&quot;shave by itself\\&quot;: That pressure you use with a Schick or Gillette multi-blade?, DON&#x27;T: Just lightly hold the razor where you want it, &amp; lightly move it where you want it to go.  You&#x27;ll hear the sound of hairs being shaved in a way you never have before. NOTE: if you want a slightly longer handle , 107mm instead of 95mm, look for the R41G. UPDATE: I reviewed this after my first shave. My second issue was how long a shave would last. It&#x27;s now June 13th. I purposely avoided shaving until now, to see how much growth came in, compared to a \\&quot;Gillette Fushion\\&quot; shave. My test shows me that  this razor allows at least an extra day of not shaving, probably even two days for many guys.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple math, just look at all of five star ratings this razor has and BUY THIS RAZOR!!! I made the switch to DE shaving over a year ago and this by far is my favorite. This was my fourth razor I&#x27;ve owned (including a butterfly opening generic, a Gillette vintage and Edwin Jagger de89bl) and this is most aggressive razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  As far as the complaints about bloodbath nightmare shaves that these reviewers have posted... let&#x27;s just say... well... I&#x27;ll just leave it alone.  Okay... I&#x27;ll just say that out of all of the reviews on this razor alone, out of all of the shaving forums, DE shaving websites, YouTube videos dedicated solely to DE shaving.... and you&#x27;re still shocked when this razor cuts you?  ...uh enough said.  I&#x27;ll admit that if you don&#x27;t have a practiced hand this razor does bite but that&#x27;s not the razors fault.  It&#x27;s the fault of people like me who aren&#x27;t sane enough to stop after six or eight really bad nicks... and sixteen stitches... Just kidding... it was only ten ...and a lot of gauze.&lt;br /&gt;  Seriously, it can&#x27;t be said he enough, there&#x27;s a learning curve to DE shaving.  Just put the time in, figure out all the correct shaving techniques, skin preparations etc, etc. and get the right tools... which is coincidentally the Muhle R41.  As far as switching to heavier handles, using aggressive Feather blades vs mild blades just figure out what works for you.  Personally I found the manufacturers handle to be fine and had no problem with not getting the right amount of pressure (which by the way should be little to none anyway). I use Feather blades and shave on average of three to four times a week.  Even a rush out the door two or three passes shave with this razor will give you some of the best shaves you&#x27;ve ever had. If you have the time for a slower paced, shave every wisker under a microscope shave you&#x27;ll really see where this razor shines... you&#x27;ll be baby butt smooth ...for like twenty-four hours....  okay like a eleven hours.  In conclusion. BUY THIS RAZOR!!!!  You absolutely won&#x27;t regret it.lusion. BUY THIS RAZOR!!!!  You absolutely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Aggressive but awesome. I love this razor and as long as you respect it it gives the closest shave going and does not cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for about 4 months now and I decided to step up my game with this 2013 version muhle r41. First time using yesterday I did a 2 pass wtg and xtg passes and nearly BBS everywhere with one tiny weeper on upper lip. I used an angle that placed the handle more toward the floor than the traditional 30degree angle.  This cut well but was a little tuggy.  Adjusted to more of a traditional angle today and much better.  Also I used Astra SP yesterday and Gillette platinum today.  Prefer the Gillette in this razor. No real irritation or raw feeling with either blade. Love it</li>
    <li> Obi-Wan: &amp;#34;Your father&#x27;s lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon... for a more civilized age.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Do not b afraid!!  If u like aggressive razors and like to feel the blade on the skin then this is for you.  The result is a very close shave with less passes.  I like Gillette GSB razors in the R41 and Permasharps.  Use LIGHT pressure!!!</li>
    <li> I started with a weishi, then bought a Concord.  I was about to give up on getting a close shave without the multipass razorburn untill I bought this little Jewell.  I use this daily with feather blades &amp; get a bbs shave in 3 passes.  I have a thick, course fast growing beard.</li>
    <li> I have a Feather SS straight razor, 2 regular str8s, and the Muhle R89. All are great razors, have different personalities, and shave differently. That&#x27;s why many wet shavers use a number of different razors in rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Muhle R89 is a fine shaver (good for beginners), I think this one is better. I like the fact that it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;aggressive.&amp;#34; And it is indeed a more aggressive -- you can really feel the blade against your skin -- but I did not find it scary in the least. The first time I used it I was able to go with the grain, across the grain, and against the grain with zero cuts, nicks, or weepers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does offer a very close, smooth shave -- nearly as good as my straights -- but I did not find it overly-aggressive at all like you read again and again in some of the other reviews. I was shaking in my boots after reading comments like &amp;#34;almost cut my face off.&amp;#34; Really. I have a very angular thin face and had no problems getting a close shave everywhere on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is one great razor and you will not be sorry if you add it to your rotation too.</li>
    <li> Very, very nice razor!! Excellent build quality and shaves very close! Maybe the finest razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and I own several!!</li>
