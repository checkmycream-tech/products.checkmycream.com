      <li>chewable ones taste simular to vitamin c tablet, soft gels are smelly and will give you burps now</li>
      <li>This vitamin is specifically for those with malabsorption and developed for cystic fibrosis.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I pop these things like candy, seriously I can&#x27;t remember being hooked on a substance as strongly as I am with these. I go through a couple of bottles a week. My doc said my blood levels are nearing toxic levels and soon my organs may begin to fail. I always thought vitamins were good for you? How can you take too many vitamins? I just take a mouthful after every meal and I&#x27;m good. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> best vitamins ever. even my nails and hair have improved. these were originally prescribed by my oncologist</li>
    <li> as expected. good service</li>
    <li> Pros: I ordered the vitamins.  They arrived almost instantly.  They are indeed the vitamins that I ordered.  I swallow them effortlessly every morning with my breakfast.  Cons: I have yet to develop super-powers.  Aging has not reversed.  I still catch colds.  My IQ has not increased.  They do not taste like caviar, ice cream, or dark chocolate.  They do not have hallucinogenic effects.</li>
    <li> ADEKs - a necessity for us and one of the only products of it&#x27;s kind. Glad they make this product because we need it!</li>
    <li> Can also find more reasonabl vitamins called Multivitamins w/ A,B,D,E, and K Plus Zinc ( they&#x27;ve actually replaced the ADEKs) on SourceCf.com for much cheaper $21.00. I got a sample from my CF clinic, then called to price them. They are much better than theold school chewables.</li>
    <li> So much easier for my daughter to take, prefers it to the chewable, not so flavorful tablets.</li>
    <li> I have low ADEK blood levels due to malabsorbtion issues. This supplement was able to raise my levels somewhat, and that has been difficult to do. It is expensive, but worth it in the big picture I suppose.</li>
    <li> I did not like the product as well as the chewables.  the softgels leave an aftertaste and does not seem to absorb as fast or as well.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for my daughter. She has a problem absorbing nutrition from food and this vitamin works great replacing those vitamins she cannot get from foods or other viatamins.</li>
    <li> My husband cannot take oil-based vitamins and these Aquadeks gels are perfect for him.</li>
    <li> This vitamin is specifically for those with malabsorption and developed for cystic fibrosis.  It is fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K made to be water solubilized and therefore able to be better absorbed by those with pancreatic insuffiency.  It is a great product. It was delivered in a timely manner, packaged well and is well priced.</li>
    <li> Excellent product , I recommend 100%</li>
    <li> I have had gastric by pass surgery and have had problems with excessive brusing and bleeding since the surgery.  Other vitimins have not helped the problem.  One month taking Aquadeks and the problem has greatly improved. Very satisfied with the product and will continue ordering it monthly.  The cost is the best I have found on line.  Very difficult to find in the area.</li>
    <li> Very happy that I can obtain this vitamin through Amazon.  Sometimes it is difficult to get.  I&#x27;ve been taking this product since my gastric bypass in 2005.  Would hate to not have it..very easy to take.    Easy to order on Amazon &amp; prompt delivery.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Earlier than expected as discribed totally satisfied</li>
    <li> My Dr .had me get this.  I feel good</li>
    <li> If you have had a gastric surgery and have to take ADEK, its so much better than the bariatric chewables. I really struggled with them. They made me gag and were like sand paper going down. These softgels are exactly that... soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely essential for CF care!  I am so glad these are available through Amazon!</li>
    <li> because of my medical condition,aquadeks really helps.  I am very glad that I could still get this product.  I hope it will be available when I  need more.</li>
    <li> All was good. I&#x27;d like to actually  buy in bulk so it will be cheaper. My ins should cover this in my eyes. I have cystic  fibrosis and doctor wrote a script but ins won&#x27;t pay. So if anyone could get back to me n sell in bulk so it&#x27;s cheaper that would be great</li>
    <li> They are fabulous for anyone having had bariatric surgery. Thank You for making them available.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Easy to swallow. I didn&#x27;t notice an aftertaste as some had mentioned.</li>
    <li> My daughter has cystic fibrosis and doesn&#x27;t really like to take her vitamins.  I tried these and she is taking them without issue.  She said they do have a bit of an aftertaste - but not as bad as other brands.  Glad I tried them.</li>
    <li> Excellent and fast as always</li>
    <li> great price received quick</li>
    <li> I used to take the chewable tablets and found them extremely hard to swallow (whether I chewed them or not). They were rough and tasted like I was eating chalk. I hated taking them so much I just stop taking them all together (against the wishes of my doctor). Later down the road I was given a sample of the aquADEK&#x27;s when they came out and found them very easy to take (especially on a regular basis). I hope they never discontinue this product because I will never go back to the chewables.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i want ! Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have alagilles syndrome and have been on adek vitamins my whole life(26) yrs and have not had time to refill. My dad found these on amazon and ive been ordering since. Have tried both.chewable and gel.pill. chewable ones taste simular to vitamin c tablet, soft gels are smelly and will give you burps now and then but there is no negative feedback i have, awesome vitamins!</li>
    <li> This is a great product but think the price is a little too high. I know that is a very specific multivitamin but think you can do brtter from 5 to 10 dollars less</li>
    <li> Seems to be working great..</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product, but they are too expensive. For those who have CF and have to have them, that&#x27;s really a burden...</li>
