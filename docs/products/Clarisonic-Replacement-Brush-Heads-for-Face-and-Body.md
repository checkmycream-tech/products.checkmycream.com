      <li>I am feeling immediate calm to my skin and less tightness and overworking that</li>
      <li>It came quickly, in just a few days.</li>
      <li>It is a major part of my cleansing routine.</li>

    <li> I am sold on the Clarisonic skin cleaning product. My skin just continues to look better and better. I bought a replacement brush for my 17 y/o daughter, so we would each have our own. It came quickly, in just a few days. I will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I first tried a brush for normal skin but found this brush for sensitives skin much better for me at age 60 having sensitive skin .I look forward to washing my face these days!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t leave home without my Clarisonic. Bought one for my hubby to have his own too. We prefer the sensitive skin brush heads!</li>
    <li> I received this product within a couple of days. It was packaged nicely and fits perfect &amp; works great on my clarisonic. Very pleased!</li>

    <li> I bought my Clarisonic system a few months ago and have been using religiously and very happy with the results.  HOWEVER, my skin care practitioners have all been noticing that I may be exfoliating too hard.  I just purchased the sensitive skin care brush and I am immediately happy with it.  It&#x27;s sort of like changing from a firm to hard toothbrush to a soft/senstive line.  I am feeling immediate calm to my skin and less tightness and overworking that I think my skin got from the standard brush head.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clarisonic Pro and it came with the Sensitive Skin brush.  I works for me,therefore, I reordered two of same replacement brushes at a very good price.  The process was easy and fast.  As for the Clarisonic Pro, I really like it..only wish I knew about it sooner.  I&#x27;ve only been using it since November and I feel that my skin has improved.  It prepares my skin to absorb the serum and moisturizer much better. I love that I can take in the shower, too.</li>
    <li> Not the real product. Came in authentic boxes but must have been refurbished with different bristles -- do not buy.</li>
    <li> Have ordered the brush head before.  The Clarisonic brush is great.  It is a major part of my cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> This is nothing special, Just a brush head. I prefer the acne one but I decided to try this one but I think this one does just an ok job.</li>
    <li> I used the brush for normal skin the first time I   used the clairsonic system, and my cheeks were quite   red the next morning.    I now use this one for sensitive skin and it is gentle  enough to deeply clean while not leaving me looking chapped.</li>

    <li> These brush heads are great and the price is very good for two compared with other companies selling the same product.  I will reorder from here again when needed.</li>
    <li> The first 2 brushes I ordered had no problems. This brush frayed and twisted immediately, so I don&#x27;t know if it was just defective, or something? It came in an original Box, but who knows? Amazon gave me a full refund without question.  I&#x27;m just worried about ordering more Clarisonic Brushes from Amazon, but I think I will still give it another chance to be sure.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped quickly, my only concern was that it was not in any type of packaging.  It made it hard to believe it was brand new....</li>
