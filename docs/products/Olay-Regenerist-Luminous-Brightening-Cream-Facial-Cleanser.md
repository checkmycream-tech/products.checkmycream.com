<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use the whole luminous line. Has made such a difference in my face. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Not as great as I wanted it to be, however, everyone is different and it might work wonders for someone else.</li>
    <li> After only a few weeks there was a very noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I only use Oil of Olay skin care products</li>
    <li> I love this product. I wear make up a lot during the week and this really cleans my skin.  It literally brightens my face.  It is very gentle.</li>
    <li> Great scent, cleans, not too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;Have roscea and this works fine</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It left my skin feeling like new and didn&#x27;t dry my skin one bit. I would highly recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> Using as directed it has made a world of difference in my skin.  A little goes along way, so the price was right.</li>
    <li> my face is much clearer since I started using it 6 days ago,.. it says that it takes up to four weeks to see the difference,I&#x27;m already seeing the difference in my face and neck.Olay do have the best products and prices too!!!..I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Thanks olay for making this product just perfect for my skin! Im just a week of using it, my skin glows and received many compliments! You maks my day.</li>
    <li> wonderful cleaner. Don&#x27;t pay millions for facial products, Olay is out of this world.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this cream as much as I originally thought I would but is still a good cleanser for oily skin.</li>
    <li> After a couple of weeks (evening use, only), my skin is softer &amp; brighter.  Wishing this was a subscribe &amp; save item, but would recommend.</li>
    <li> This really works it make your skin clear and radiant. My face looks flawless I got a lot of compliments on how young I look and I am 39 years old.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this line introduced I was very excited as I had felt it was taking the place of the old Definity line. I used to use The pore redefining scrub from the Definity line and LOVED it. It seemed like it was the only face wash that finally kept me free of break outs and left me with a nice soft face. This cream however cannot compare. It is too abrasive for my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; afterward. . probably because it&#x27;s so rough I try to not wash it around much. Since I already have broken capillaries on my face, I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using this face wash. I have since changed to a glycolic face wash for exfoliation in place of scrubbing beads.</li>
    <li> doesnt work it have your face feeling soft but you will not see not skin brighting AT ALL I WILL NOT BE Buying This again !!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, I did not see a visible difference.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m a fan of Olay products I hated this one; after just one week of use my face broke out with acne. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in years! Now I am trying to find another product for damage control. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about this product. I thought it would just be another cleanser, but it did live out to it&#x27;s name and use. I have used this product for over a year now and I love how fresh and radiant it looks. It cleanses and removes left over make up instantly. I use this in the evening as part of my nightly routine and when I wake up in the morning I feel so refreshed. Totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me at all very disappointed in the product.  I am a fan of Olay products,  but this one did not work for me.</li>
    <li> As with the eye cream, I think there may be a bleaching agent in this. I wiped my hands on my black t-shirt and it took some of the color out. So I only use this once a week....just in case</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working, my dark spots are fading and I only started using it at the beginning of August.  I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Would not buy again, did not see any results.</li>
    <li> This cleans my face well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea.  However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any brightening or luminosity.</li>
    <li> I was unaware that this had micro-beads. Can&#x27;t use it on my face.  Would like to return it but don&#x27;t know if I can!!!</li>
    <li> Did not like this product at all, left my face feeling oily. Won&#x27;t be buying this again .</li>
    <li> I have serious discolaration on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products. Nothing has helped. Figured I&#x27;d try one more. Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. It&#x27;s been almost 2 months.</li>
    <li> I only use Olay products and this was one of my favorites. It cleans nicely and has a nice subtle smell to it.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about two weeks and am satisfied with the results. Makes my skin feel nice and is not drying at all. I have sensitive skin which is prone to break outs but I have never had issues with Olay. Using this along with the Luminous moisturizer and love them both. I also use prescription Retin-a and have not had any bad results combining these products with Retin-a in moderation. Highly recommend this and a great price.</li>
