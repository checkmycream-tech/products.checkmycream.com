<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> bought this one to replace an older model that broke, so far works really well.</li>
    <li> Shaves smooth  easy to clean  light in the hand.  I would give it 5 stars but it does not have a warning light to let you know how much battery is left.</li>
    <li> It cuts pretty good and close for an electric shaver. Better than my past electric models.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s charge has lasted a few shaves now and still going strong. So, I gave it the fourth star.&lt;br /&gt;it don&#x27;t beat a straight razor for smoothness. Had it about a month now.</li>
    <li> it is best for shaving your head. i like it as slick bald as i can get it and this cuts closer than a blade with no nicks, no shaving cream. not as good on the face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for over 30 years.  I was convinced to try a Braun shaver - expensive with great ratings.  A disaster.  The Norelco is quiet, simple and best of all gives a great shave.  This is a great shaver at a great price.</li>
    <li> I had this shaver for a couple years, and then it caught on fire while I was using it. No kidding. Smoke started coming out of the top of it while I was shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it never really shaved that well to begin with.</li>
    <li> Super product.  Works great on my legs (female).  Do not spend more than you have to buying a shaver for women.</li>
    <li> I waited a few months to write a review on this because I had heard about the battery life going down after a few months of use, however, this report of the battery life I found was completely false. I&#x27;ve had this unit since March and the battery still lasts as long as the day I received it, I recently went on a 3 week business trip for work and forgot the charger cord and it lasted the whole trip on one full charge. The only complaint I have is that the pop up trimmer isn&#x27;t positioned on the unit so that you can be precise but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the rest the unit has to offer. I personally believe it gives a closer shave than my old 4 blade razor. Excellent shaver for the price. Can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> My husband is home bound so this is great for him.  He shaves every day and I like the fact that it can be rinsed in hot water.</li>
    <li> Works great and price is reasonable. Am replacing an old one that lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why pay big bucks for razors that provide almost not additional performance.</li>
    <li> This is a birthday gift for my husband. He likes it so much. The only concern I have it this model does have a stand for the shaver; it would be much nicer if the shaver can stand on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I am actually a barber and i need to buy one of these a little more often than the average person that uses it for personal use. I only stay with the NORELCO brand tho. I like their products and they always last. This one from the gate gives a really smooth shave. I have been using it for 2 months straight, 5 days a week on people and the blades are still sharp. If it lasts me a year or two for my job, then it can last like up to 5 years for personal use. Definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> Dissappointing from previous Norelco shavers owned. Very slow charge, simply acceptable performance. Go for the upper mid-level price shavers.</li>
    <li> Very good for travels. Could be easier to clean inside, but does a very good job. I recommend.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the reason I won&#x27;t ever buy a shaver from Philips Norelco.  This is the second one I bought. When I bought this one I thought Philips would have improved the shaver. The problem: you will need, good luck, the instructions,  a magnifying glass, and a close-up shot of the shaver heads, once you open the top and the heads and entire assembly falls out. And if you don&#x27;t have those items, good luck trying to reassemble the shaver head.  Philips could easily have made an easy to re-assemble shaver. The assembly in this one is plastic junk.    Do not buy this shaver.</li>
    <li> An excellent shaver.  Cuts close with minimum passes, a trimmer that is easy to use, and easy to clean under warm running water.  Comfortable and secure in the hand.  About two weeks between charges.  Cordless, but if the battery dies during a shave, can be used corded.  Nice compact charger, selects right voltage automatically, so great for international travel. So much better than the Remington MS2-390 I ditched after just a few months.  I would definitely recommend this rotary Norelco over the foil Remington.    A couple of minor niggles; first, no carry case - so I&#x27;ll be using that from my old Norelco that served me well for about eight years; and charge time on this new one is about eight hours - but only 40 mins on the old Norelco - is this really progress?!  Include a case and faster charge and I&#x27;d give it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a blade for over forty years, and since retirement I now don&#x27;t shave everyday. (Just me and my teenage son here.)  Some years back I tried a budget foil shaver that torn half my face off, and later a budget rotary that was not much better.  I decided to read some reviews on some expensive rotary shavers (not that I intended to spend $200+ for one) and found that all the bells and whistles on the latest models (from reviews) were more of a hassle than help.  I then started looking at reviews on some moderately priced units and came across one review on the 7310 that said: \\&quot;Norelco had it right years ago and then ruined it\\&quot;.  I gave it a try and it has only been a month but so far I have been very happy with the shave.  It is quiet, and shaves me as close as a blade.  I have to go over my neck a couple of times (whiskers grow sideways) but I had to do that with a blade.  My 17yr. old son tried it and now I will probably have to buy him one, and he has been using those fancy and expensive 5 blade Gillette razors.  I only write a review if an item is really bad or pretty good.  This item is pretty good and I would have given it 5 stars except after about 10 days it stopped halfway.  I recharged it and it is humming again, but there should be a red warning light, although I kinda knew it was ready for a charge.  I would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I shaved with this for the first time yesterday. I had about 3 days worth of whiskers and it easily cut them. My prior razor was also a Norelco and I owned it for at least 3 years. It never gave me any problems at all. I am very happy with how this one is made. The pop up head is a nice feature and makes cleaning it easy. I also like having a push button to turn it on instead of sliding a switch. I am glad that I did not opt to buy anything more expensive because I don&#x27;t see how I&#x27;d be any more pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the shaver for those who would rather not use a standard razor. It gets really close and you don&#x27;t have press very hard to get a nice shave. Only press lightly. The motor does the rest. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips Norelco 7310 last summer and have purposely held off writing a review until I had had a chance to see the battery capacity and use it over a reasonable period. It lives up to its promises! I am very surprised by the comments of other reviewers that the battery capacity is not up to expectation. I have used the shaver every day over the course of months and have had to charge it only 5 times (almost a month per charge). The speed of the motor does seem unexpectedly slower than earlier examples of the type, but it does not affect the shave. Directions say that it can be washed under a stream of tap water to clean it and I have. That has seemed to cause no problem with the device. I have used it without problem both at home and on a sailboat (for weeks) in a salt-air environment. The shaver provides a quick close shave with little if any irritation. I hate to pass out 5-star ratings without solid justification, but this thing earns 5-stars. At the price point it is hard to beat this shaver.</li>
    <li> I got this a month ago, i let my skin get used to the razor before i reviewed it. Now i must say that the blades are VERY fragile when you open the top it can snap off instantly but you can snap it back on. Also this razor is very underpowered. What i mean by that is i have a 7 year old remington razor and the blades still work faster and i get a closer shave with it. This Philips Norelco i am only going to use as a back up because i cant see my self useing this razor daily.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the third Norelco model I&#x27;ve had in 15 years... and without question the best and closest shaving of all!  From the side grip ridges (surrounding the head) that give an additionally secure feel to the handling... to the wash-out feature that affords easiest clean-up the 7310 is topnotch at a reasonable price! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> (Barbara&#x27;s other half)  I had an older Norelco shaver that I&#x27;m sure was at least 10 years old. I had to push in on the power button to get full speed out of it and I know the blades were shot. It took me a long time to get a poor shave. I considered replacing the blades, but with the power button problem, I decided to spring.  What the heck, it&#x27;s only $40, where the other rotary shavers are much more.  I can now get a decent shave in 1 1/2 minutes. I charged it when I first got it about a month ago and haven&#x27;t recharged it yet. Great product for the price so far.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful razor and well worth the value. My only complaints would be that it is not extremely close and also is not as powerful when not plugged in. Otherwise, it is recommended.</li>
    <li> Got it as a Christmas gift, arrived in a timely manner. My honey loves it, and looks as though I paid more than it&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> This shaver cuts almost as close as a wet shave.  I&#x27;m amazed at the power of the battery.  Since the initial charge, I  have had at least 5 shaves and it still doesn&#x27;t need a recharge yet.   Amazon&#x27;s shipping is also a plus.</li>
    <li> I have had many many electric razors from the expensive to the cheaper disposable head ones with the same results, DISAPPOINTMENT! But with this Philips Norelco I was pleasantly surprised. I bought it for a travel shaver when water &amp; my blades wouldn&#x27;t make sense but after using it for the 1st time I really found that I finally had a good razor that I could use all the time, toss the blades! It is really light weight &amp; comfortably conforms to even my ole scared up tough bearded face. I get a close shave , even those pesky hairs on my neck and by my ears!! what A DELIGHT THANKS norelco......</li>
    <li> I needed to replace the shaver heads on my corded Norelco.  I discovered that I could buy this new razor for about the same price as replacement heads on the old unit.  Also, the new razor has the added convenience of being cordless.  The new razor produces a similar shave as my old razor when the blades are new.  Also, like the previous razor, the smoothness improves after a few shaves as the blades settle in.  There are probably better razors out there but for this price....</li>
    <li> I received the shaver as scheduled, in manufacturer&#x27;s packaging. I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for about 30 years, with complete satisfaction. The washable feature is very nice----just rinse it under the faucet. A full charge of the battery lasts me about 10 days. The price was 10 dollars less than CVS for the same unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a seasoned and avid Norelco electric razor fan for over 25 years (still own an old 5601X which I loaned to my son), must express genuine overall disappointment in this new model.  I&#x27;ve owned it for about 6 months now, and here are my impressions.  On the positive side, the 7310XL is light-weight and the rinsable feature is a practical plus; however, the negatives far outweigh the pros.  Unless I lucked out with one with an defective battery, my experience has been that after just a couple of uses (avg. 5-10 min. ea.), the razor starts to quickly lose power &amp; requires a recharge.  The quality of the shave itself is inferior to my previous Norelco&#x27;s, including the 5601X.  While it is quieter in operation, it invariably fails to provide a consistently smooth shave, leaving a scattering of hairs even after several passes.  I agree with other reviewers that it tends to be more abrasive on the skin, certainly in comparison to the 5601X and Braun models I&#x27;ve owned.  The plastic head cover is sturdy, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that it fails to cover the entire head assembly.  This model also doesn&#x27;t come with a travel/storage case.  It is moderately priced, but considering the Norelco reputation for excellent shavers, I only rate it as fair.  Oh, the trimmer is lame, failing to provide a close trim and inevitably tipping down when encountering any shape resistance.</li>
    <li> You can spend a lot more for an electric razor, but why should you?  This is my second Norelco shaver, and since my first, the technology has gotten better to provide an even closer shave! The new \\&quot;flip top\\&quot; design and the ability to rinse it under running water makes cleaning a breeze.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is OK; if it is all you can afford it is way better than a razor but not nearly as nice as the slightly more expensive norelcos. I accidently bought this lower end one without looking at the razor face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage son several months ago as a birthday gift.  He did not like to take the time to shave with cream and a razor and really wanted an electric one.  I bought this one based upon price and recommendations from some of his friends.  It turned out to be the perfect selection for him.  Sorry I can not list specifics on controls or usage, but it has been perfect for my 16 year old son that sometimes goes a little too long between shaves!</li>
    <li> I have used several Norelco shavers in the past and have always been impressed by their coverage, speed, comfort, ease of use and maintenance.  I have used both rotary and foil shavers and I have discovered that rotary usually does a better job overal to help me maintain my profile.    I&#x27;m a clean-cut guy who does not have a lot of facial hair to begin with so I don&#x27;t need an heavy duty shaver to suit my needs.  I own the Braun M90 (for traveling) and the Norelco 7310XL - both \\&quot;budget\\&quot; shavers at similar price range (under $50).  This is my 3rd Norelco that I have owned and the cheapest one I have ever used.  Overall, I am very happy with its performance and if I had a choice, I would always use the Norelco 7310XL over Braun M90.  I only use the Braun M90 as a backup if I ever run out of battery on the Norelco and its flat profile makes it one of the best travel shavers.  However, the Norelco 7310XL definitely provides better coverage, closer, faster shave and is more comfortable to use.      My first impression of Norelco 7310XL is that it is much lighter than the more expensive Norelco&#x27;s that I have owned.  I believe the main difference is in the motor inside as other shaving-specific mechanism are very similar to the higher end models.  The motor on this one is definitely weaker.  More motor power provides a faster and more comfortable shaving experience.  However, if you&#x27;re like me who shave once or twice daily, the 7310XL should be quite suitable as you&#x27;re not doing heavy duty shaving on a daily basis.  I also like the fact that you can clean the inside with water.      The battery life is superb.  Obviously it depends on how much hair you have but for me, one full charge which takes about 8 hours to charge should last you about one month.  From my personal experience, the battery actually lasts longer than the more expensive Norelco&#x27;s probably because it has a smaller motor.  There&#x27;s no battery level indicator but it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for most people - when the battery is dead, just plug it into the wall and continue.  Overall, you will get a lot of mileage out of the Norelco 7310XL for light to moderate daily grooming.  Moreover, even if it happens to die after some time, you won&#x27;t feel sorry for your wallet or anger towards the manufacturer.  If you&#x27;re looking at dollar per shave, then you&#x27;ll probably find this to be one of the best deals around.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my step-father who prefers an electric razor to the standard razor. He is so pleased with this product. It fits the requirements he had for me in that it needed to be cordless and rechargeable, water submersible and portable. He takes it with him in the car and carries it in his briefcase. Thank you for an excellent product!![[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> For the price of this product compared to others of similar nature; it out-performs and is extremely reliable. This is one of very few electric razors that are both reliable and effective for daily use.  Providing a close shave at a cheap price, I have yet to find a better deal. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shaver as a gift for my husband. He is a huge fan of Norelco products. This like all of the past Norelco products we have purchased are a great value for the quality and money spent.   Karen  [...]</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my dad for Christmas and he loves it.  He says it gives him a very smooth shave and it is much better than his old razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because I couldn&#x27;t afford the other ones on the shelf costing hundred of dollars. I will compliment the battery life, it seems to last a very long time, which is good since it takes a very long time to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that I feel this can&#x27;t be called a shaving system, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as much as RIP THE HAIRS OUT OF MY FACE. It is a very painful experience, but at least I don&#x27;t need coffee in the morning anymore. I do need to wake up earlier however because it takes me about half an hour to shave with this torture device. The rest of my family has a bitter-sweet opinion on my relationship with the Norelco 7310XL, on the one hand, they don&#x27;t have to set their alarms, much like a rooster, my screams of agony awake them everyday just before sunrise. On the other hand they my wife has assumed more than once that I was being brutally attacked by an intruder in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am saving money to purchase one that might be slightly less painful.</li>
    <li> My husband had used disposable razors for a long time because the pricey electric ones didn&#x27;t do the job he expected. He decided it was time to save some money and try an electric razor again. Based on the reviews and price I ordered this one although I was skeptical of the quality because of the price. He received it and loves it. He said it was the best shaver he&#x27;s ever had. Thank you Norelco for providing a good quality shaver at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> It is cheap and really good. I loved it, I can wash it after i shave, very easy to clean. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I asked for this for Christmas after trying two different kinds of electric razors with straight heads. One was a men&#x27;s brand and the other for women. (I hate shaving while balancing on the edge of a tub when I&#x27;m just going to put jeans on.) I found they were next to useless: they couldn&#x27;t get close enough to pass the eye test and they often left my skin feeling raw because of the prongs meant to &#x27;lift&#x27; hair. Surprisingly, this does work fairly well on my legs. Shaves considerably closer than the straight-head electric razors did. You simply have to move it in tight circles over your legs. I didn&#x27;t have any irritation on my calves after using it, and no red marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, there were problems. When I used it under my arms, I experienced my very first razor burn. And it was awful. For those women out there who might be considering using this, I don&#x27;t recommend this for behind the knee, anywhere there is longish or thick hair, or anywhere with thin/sensitive skin. Rule of thumb: If you ever get red bumps in an area when you shave, even if it&#x27;s a few isolated clusters, don&#x27;t use this razor there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, all said, this did what I wanted it for, even though it&#x27;s an off-label use. I certainly don&#x27;t blame it for the problems above. I also like that the head flips open to let you clean out the hair (if it&#x27;s been a while since your last shave and you use this, be sure to flip it open repeatedly while you shave). It&#x27;s nifty for a quick, dry shave when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor. I&#x27;ve always been weary of buying one because I heard they don&#x27;t give close enough shaves (which I prefer). I usually shave every 2 days, so getting a close shave is really important to me.    PROS:  - Very easy to clean  - Great battery life (rarely needs charging)  - Does a decent job at neck area  - Hasn&#x27;t cut me yet    CONS-  - Doesn&#x27;t give a close shave!  - Have to shave once a day  - The mustache/sideburn trimmer is pretty weak  - Have to go over areas several times    Overall, this product is decent. If you don&#x27;t get facial hair quickly, then I would guess this would be perfect for you. I think my next electric razor will probably be a foil razor instead of this one (rotary).</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband. Overall he likes it especially for the price. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bells and whistles, just pretty basic. So if you are looking for an inexpensive decent and pretty nice looking razor...this is a good pick.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s pretty good.  And so far, I would recommend it.  It&#x27;s very convenient and a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for my husband.  He likes the clean shave it gives and feels that it is easier to clean than previous razor.  Definitely a good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Good: light weight; nice and close shave; can clean the heads by running it under the tap; and beard trimmer.    I have not had it long enough to really know how durable the plastic parts will be, but I am sure they are replaceable.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very good razor for the price.  I have used it for about 3 months with no problems.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement for my Remington that would no longer hold a charge. I decided to try a Philips Norelco, as I had never owned one. I have been using it for several weeks and am still on the first charge, which is much longer than the specifications say to expect. That is a nice plus, since I was expecting to have to charge it weekly. It is more underpowered than other cordless shavers I have owned, but it gets the job done. The pop-up trimmer is really well designed. Other shavers pop up the trimmer by pushing up, which often happens accidentally during shaving. This one is spring loaded and needs to be unlatched with a downward motion, which means no accidental pop ups. Well done, design team. I love that it is rinseable in water. Cleaning is now a breeze. As an extra perk, the high contrast color scheme looks very sharp.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet this is a great buy for the price! I don&#x27;t know how much better those $160 razors can be but this thing does the job and than some especially since it has the trimmer attachment which is amazing and at this point i cannot live without, goes hand in hand after shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all those looking to make a switch from a regular blade to electric be warned!!! Since this was my first switch I knew that normal skin adjustment time is around 2-3 weeks continual use, unfortunately with this model (and maybe thats why the more expensive razors are pricey because of the blade quality) but this particular model took me around a month in change to actually reap the benefits of a close shave. The first day I used this it my neck (i have sensitive skin) look like I broke out in massive hives, lasted about 2hrs ... i almost gave up after that but i stuck it out and respectively have grown to love the thing! I now shave on the way to work and in less than 5 mins come out with a great shave, which saves me time and the best part, no irritation anymore which is why i switched to begin with, that pays for itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the fact that you can wash this thing in the sink by flipping open the cover is amazing! So easy to clean, great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in closing -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Great shave after initial getting used to (skin)&lt;br /&gt;-No more shaving cream needed, get a shave in less than 5mins -&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer works where the shaver stops (almost barber quality, can be used all over body)&lt;br /&gt;-Self sharpening blades good for a year&lt;br /&gt;-Easy cleaning (pop head open, wash in sink, air dry, good to go)&lt;br /&gt;-Rechargeable battery, works while charging as well, battery lasts forever! Charging indicator on power button -&lt;br /&gt;-Feels great in hand,&lt;br /&gt;-Price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Can take up to a month for skin to get used to electric razor, (do not switch back, stick it out, very important)&lt;br /&gt;-Can pull longer whiskers out like a tweezer, which may get annoying to those with longer stubble&lt;br /&gt;-Unit doesn&#x27;t like being in cold temps, will freeze for awhile until battery warms up (left in my car one night)&lt;br /&gt;-May need multiple passes at times for thicker hair ...d temps, will freeze for awhile until battery warms up (left in my car one night)  -May need multiple passes at times for thicker hair ...</li>
    <li> For the price, this is  good buy. Its light weight and cordless operation make it great for travelling. I get a good close shave over most areas.  The only problem is my lower neck where it irritates the skin. This is a problem area for me with most electric shavers so I don&#x27;t make too much of it. My last shaver could not handle it at all. A few swipes with a blade doesn&#x27;t bother me. However, if you have sensitive or loose skin on your throat area, you may not be happy with this item.</li>
    <li> I just bought this electric shaver because my old one didn&#x27;t seem to shave very close. This new one is great! Now I get a MUCH closer shave. It has a good design for cleaning too. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco electric shavers for many years.  This is a great cheap shave will all the features I was looking for - pop up trimmer, cordless operation and under faucet cleaning.  Charge lasts a long time.  It has a light, somewhat cheap feel to the device but it shaves really well and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Tengo aproximadamente 5 meses con esta maquina y me ha ido muy bien.. Al principio irrita la piel y es realmente incomoda, no se alarmen es normal. Entre la segunda y tercera semana cuando la piel se \\&quot;acostumbra\\&quot; por decirlo de alguna manera, es excelente!! Afeitada al ras tal cual una hojilla desechable. Al terminar el rasurado, se lava de manera sencilla con el chorro del lavamanos y listo! Adios a las afeitadoras! Recomiendo utilizarla conectada directo a la corriente para un mayor desempe&amp;ntilde;o. Recomendada 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have about 5 months with this machine and I have done very well .. At first irritates the skin and is really uncomfortable, do not be alarmed it is normal. Between the second and third weeks when the skin is \\&quot;used\\&quot; to put it in some way, is excellent! Shave a razor as it is disposable. When finished shaving, washes easily with the spray the sink and go! Farewell to razors! I recommend using it directly connected to the flow for increased performance. 100% Recommended</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.  Good value for the cost.  While you can wash it with water, I perfer to knock the shavings off and I would give the rating a 5 star, but it is way to easy for the shaver head to fall off.  Kinda flimsly.  Overal, it shaves great.</li>
    <li> While not as good as a fine 3 or 4 blade razor with shaving cream,  this electric razor gives a pretty good close shave and holds a charge for short trips and multiple uses without the recharge.</li>
    <li> did not try it my self, but im sure it works great. its cordless and looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought this for my dad for 35 bucks, so the price was great. heard good reviews about it, and the brand is reputable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great buy!</li>
    <li> Good razor for the price.  However, there is no indication that the battery needs charging BEFORE it goes completely dead.</li>
    <li> I like it. This shaver gives me a good shave, is light weight, easy to clean and works from battery via 120V AC charger, (something I was looking for since our home uses Solar Energy). The trimmer flips out to easily trim longer hairs around my beard and the rotary blades shave my neck and upper cheeks well.    Very good value for the price, recommended!</li>
    <li> I have hated electric shavers forever. They never worked well for me. I recently had a medical treatment that required me to use an electric shaver becasue of my tender skin. This worked very well and you rinse it under the tap to keep it clean! While I am back to the razor, I still use this when I need a quick, close shave! Get it!</li>
    <li> My old shaver&#x27;s blades had become dull and did not shave. I considered replacing the blades but that was as expensive as buying this shaver.    This shaver finishes the job in a couple of minutes. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> In my household Norelco is synonymous with perfect working razor. This one does not disappoint. Especially like the ability to run under the tap to clean it...College boys aren&#x27;t always good at really cleaning their razors--ask me how I know--.</li>
    <li> This is my second electric shaver and it does a fairly decent job.  The only draw back is knowing when to shave.  I found that I can&#x27;t shave with it on back to back days because it irritates my skin. If I wait too long though it takes to long to shave and doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job.  This could be a personal thing, but my brother purchased one as well and faces a similar problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive, cordless, water proof, electric shaver this is a solid buy.</li>
    <li> I have used many electric shavers in the past and most were Norelco rotary shavers. This particular model is the worst of all of them. Its shave is barely adequate. I needed to go over the same area dozens and dozens of times to get a decent shave. Replacing the blade head didn&#x27;t help. Even at this relatively low price, this shaver is not worth it. I recommend passing on it.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for!  I would recommend paying more than $40 for a cordless electric shaver if you want it to be good quality.</li>
    <li> This is an affordable model that delivers satisfactory performance. I have used it for about three weeks and I am satisfied with its performance</li>
    <li> This electric shaver works fantastic!  I tried it right out of the delivery box tonight without charging.  It shaved great.  Smooth skin, quiet, comfortable to hold, seems to get into hard to reach places on my face.  I am very impressed with this product. I was concerned that the top of the box is labeled 7310 that the wrong item might have been shipped, but on the back of the razor it&#x27;s labeled as 7310XL.  Based on short term experience, I really like this razor.</li>
    <li> Works very well and am enjoying my shaves lately!  I&#x27;ve been a Norelco man for the last 15 years and this one does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for almost three months and am very pleased with the resaults. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who wants a clean comfortable feeling on their skin.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington product before this one which was noisy. This product is quiet and does the job well. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My dad likes it. It is a good product and is easy to use. I think it is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about 2 and 1/2 years now, and I decided I had to give it some credit here on Amazon. Being in the military, I can tell you that I&#x27;ve shaved EVERY day with this, yes 365 days a year. That&#x27;s about 900-1000 shaves, I&#x27;ve never changed the blades, never had to replace anything on it. I can use it by charging it fully and using it for a week, or by charging it 5-10 minutes before I use it daily. And no, I&#x27;m not 19 and just shaving peach fuzz, I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s now. I rinse it out once a week and dump out the hair after every use. There&#x27;s really nothing else to it. I&#x27;m tempted to order another one in case they stop making it, but really I don&#x27;t see mine breaking any time soon. This shaver also runs very quiet, which was a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and pick this thing up. Heck I&#x27;m going to say that if you use razors, switch to electric and get away from those over priced blades.</li>
    <li> Nice design. Easy to use and clean. Battery life is good. I don&#x27;t need to charge it even for a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 weeks. It&#x27;s much quieter than my last one, which was a remington that was about 10 years old. The battery in it was gone and wouldn&#x27;t stay charged. This new Norelco, I charged for about 10 or 12 hours the first time before I ever used it, and that charge lasted 10 days. I&#x27;ve used electric razors for years and I had no facial skin soreness or rash break in time with this one. If this is your first electric razor you can expect a 2 week break in for your face to get used to it. The Norelco only takes 2 or 3 minutes to shave, if done daily, and a much closer shave with this new one than my old one.</li>
    <li> Shaver is very quiet, removes beard close to the skin, is easily cleaned, and the trimmer does well on sideburns.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for forty years and had just given up on them and purchased a cheap Chinese micro screen razor when I saw the Norelco 7310XL at Amazon. The 7310XL was back down to a reasonable price and the razor is fantastic. Does not have condition of charge indicator but UNLIKE most of the newer, pricier Norelco&#x27;s that I have owned with such a feature, the 7310XL operates with the cord, which allows the completion of a shave before recharging.</li>
    <li> I bought one a few days ago, it arrived yesterday. I tried this morning, it works very well. a good product.</li>
    <li> It is a good shaver with low price.  Shaving is easy with this shaver and also less time consuming  Treamer is also very good.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little more power out of this bad boy, but it&#x27;s rather wimpy. It gets the job done, but slowly. My skin is still having some trouble adjusting to electric razor, but I think it&#x27;s getting better now. No solid complaints. Just an decently average product.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!!!!! It feels amazing on my face and the results are extremely smooth. If you have acne too don&#x27;t worry because this razor is so soft on your skin that it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin at all like most other razors do. Also very sleek and stylish design!</li>
    <li> This shaver is not your regular Norelco. This \\&quot;made in China gem\\&quot; is a far cry from the normal Norelco shavers made in Holland. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this unit. Find the Norelco made in Holland and you&#x27;ve got the real thing and a good shave.</li>
    <li> While the received razor was acceptable, it was advertised as an 7310XL model, but a 7310 was shipped which is a cheaper model.</li>
    <li> my husband likes it a lot. it is a little rough on his sensitive neck. easy to use, pack and nice for a quick clean shave!</li>
    <li> great product exactly as advertised....and fast shipment and with on hand rebate easy to print it was an awesome buy</li>
    <li> Last Christmas I got a present,  It&#x27;s effect on me&#x27;s been pleasant.  Stopping hair from unruly growing,  and females from staring and showing  disgust and shock at uneven stubble,  contra, takes at smooth faces may double.  The Norelco 7310XL did well for my face,  Saving me from dispair and disgrace.  Looming on my second shelf  a paragon of hygenic wealth:  All from a single charge.   Last Christmas.  Its life could not be larger.  And now I ask my bathroom mirror:  Where have I put the charger?</li>
    <li> Got this shaver at Target for twenty bucks, plus a ten dollar mail in rebate coming. My old Norelco 7800 shaver can&#x27;t hold a charge anymore so I figured for ten bucks, this 7310 can&#x27;t be that bad. Lo and behold, it&#x27;s better than I thought. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and I&#x27;m impressed with the closeness of shave that it provides. I like the feel of the shaver and the black color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, sometimes it will pull on my chin hairs. But overall I like it and would recommend it. I&#x27;m not sure if I would have paid the thirty bucks that Amazon is charging (after coupon.) But for ten bucks, and even twenty, it&#x27;s worth it. I am actually tempted to say that it probably provides as good of a shave as the two hundred dollar shavers. But seeing how I&#x27;ve never owned a \\&quot;blinged out\\&quot; shaver, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m just being ignorant.</li>
    <li> I got the Philips Norelco 7310 to replace an electric razor I have had for several years that needed insanely expensive blade replacements, and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  It has a smooth, close shave that is considerably better than the one I was using.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best shaver, but to get a better shave would expect to pay at least two the three times as much for it.  It has great battery life and charges pretty fast.  It is also very easy to clean especially compared to other razors I have used.  Overall it gets the job done well and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good electric razor without spending a fortune this is a very good option.</li>
    <li> I have been using Philips razors for over 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;After my luggage got lost lost month I had to purchase ( again) a new electrical razor.&lt;br /&gt;No wonder that I chose a Philips again, for they are always great shavers.&lt;br /&gt;1 charge 4/5 hours and I am good for a week, (twice a day shaver).&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the trimmer, it does not take as much off as my last shaver.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Great shaving system for hardly any money.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  He had been using a nice non-electric for some time.  He was very pleased with his new gift.  He said he got a close shave with very little effort.  Guess I did okay.</li>
    <li> I thought the \\&quot;lift &amp; cut\\&quot; description was a sales gimmick until I tried it. Then I SAW the new technology of the heads when I cleaned them. Much advancement over my old Norelco. As a machinist I marvel at the tiny and amazing new details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I only need to shave once in 2 days, so it does \\&quot;lift &amp; cut\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I bought four differnt products from Philips with different rebate for each product. Two from Amazon, and two from Walmart. The rebates are $5, $10, $10, and $30. I only received $5 rebate total. So, I called Philips rebate center, and was told that they can only give me one rebate of all products (the $5). This was not specified in their rebate form. Otherwise, I would not buy most of them at fairly high prices.</li>
    <li> I bought this products last year. Philips has a good fame on shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;I have been used their products for years. never met a problem, however, this time it  turns out an awful experience. it did not work one month after I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Philips failed to honor a $10 rebate that I correctly submitted, so don&#x27;t purchase with any expectation that rebate offers from this manufacturer can be trusted. The product itself works quite well as a shaver and holds a charge for a long time, while the pop-up side-burn trimmer is flimsy and ineffective.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent razor, especially for the price.  I appreciate that it holds a charge for the entire week, even with daily use.  I just charge is once a week, and it only takes about an hour and it&#x27;s ready to go for another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close shave, easy to use and fairly quiet, as far as electric razors go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very little experience with electrical razors and probably couldn&#x27;t give an objective review, so I won&#x27;t even try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do reaally like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months already. Looks nice and was very affordable! cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver as an addition in lieu of purchasing replacement blades for my 7140xl. Only $6.00 more for the entire shaver.   Really enjoy the norelco shavers and find them to produce smooth results without worrying about razor blade cuts and bleeding. The fact I have options on cleaning my shavers both wet/and or dry adds to not making shaving a chore.</li>
    <li> This shaver works pretty good and is worth the money. I bought it to shave my head with and it does a good job.  It does not shave as close as a safety razor and does take more time to get a close shave but it does get pretty close.  The charge will last me several shaves.  I&#x27;ve read the review that said this model does not hold a charge well but I have not experienced a problem with that.  I&#x27;ve tried to use it on my face but it irritates my skin too much and I get razor bumps. I still prefer to use a safety razor on my face.</li>
    <li> Provides a close, comfortable shave, while being ultra quiet at the same time. Definitely the best value for the money for an electric razor. Obviously it cannot beat out my straight razor, but I do not know of an electronic that can. Very good if you are short on time and are in need of a quick shave.</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips Norelco 7310 to replace my beloved Braun electric. I was a devoted Braun user- I previously had 3 Braun units. The 7310 outperforms them and is extremely quiet compared to the Braun(s). It gives a good close shave, no irritation, holds a charge for a very long time (about a week of shaves minimum), is lightweight and easy to hold. Best of all, cost about 1/4 of what my Braun(s) did. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor daily for about a month now. The first thing you will notice is how quiet it is, followed by the great shave it provides and finally how easy it is to clean up by just running it under hot water. While charging takes about 8 hours, it stays charged for a long, long time. Since the initial charge, I&#x27;ve only had to charge it twice. I was using a Braun Series 1 1-150 razor (see my review) and liked it. But I found that over time, it did not shave very well under my chin and on my neck, and it took a lot of time to fully do the job correctly. Not so with the Norelco! As with all electric razors, I recommend that you use a pre-electric shave lotion (I like Afta Pre-Shave) to make the shave easier and cause less razor burn.</li>
    <li> It works ok initially.. However, the items in the head is too easy to be un-assembled and it is hard to assemble it back nicely..</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed Norelco rotary razors for many years and have always found them comfortable.  This model is no exception.  It doesn&#x27;t have the fancy count-down digital timer, but I bought it as a travel shaver, since I have a very fancy model Norelco I use at home and thought travel might prematurely destroy it.  At this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I just purchased new heads for my fancier model from Philips for almost the same price as the 7310, which has those same exact heads in it.  (As in, \\&quot;give away the handle and charge for the blades\\&quot;!)  One charge will last for the longest trip, so you can travel light and leave the somewhat bulky charge cord at home.  Next time I need set of heads (or a travel razor), this will be the way to go.  I&#x27;ve tried knock-off rotary razors as my traveler and they don&#x27;t stack up to the 7310.</li>
    <li> I have had my shaver for 9 months now and consider it a great bargain for the money. It shaves close and smooth and maintains it&#x27;s charge for for 10 days to 2 weeks. It is comfortable to grip and easy to clean. Just rinse it out with water.  I doubt that a shaver costing a lot more could be any more reliable or do a better job of shaving.  It would be a handier if the charger cord was a little longer.</li>
    <li> Yes...That is what I said when I got my new shaver.  It looks fantastic and I hope it lasts longer than my other shavers did.</li>
    <li> I had a similar model that lasted several years and this one is even better. It is quieter, holds a charge longer, and cuts closer.  For almost the price of replacement rotary blades you get a new shaver.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001EU20EE Norelco 7310XL Reflex Plus Cord/Cordless Electric Shaver]]  Was a Norelco fan with higher cost units.  Then went to a razor.  The cost of blades and disposables got me back to this 7310.  It works great, confortable shave, no nicks.  Seems to me the blades turn slower than my previous Norelco.  Takes alittle longer to get the job done.  Enjoy the ability to wash the unit in water.  Better for me than using a brush to clean out the cut hairs.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good shave, a little underpowered but still does the job and the battery lasts a long time - the shave is better than my Braun which cost me about 3 times the money. The Braun has a much better side burn trimmer though - the 7310 trimmer is not a sturdy nor does it work as well. Given how good this shaver is - I am anxious to try how their top of the line models work.  Bought this shaver based on some of the reviews at this site. I was in the market  since I had lost my Braun shaver - (which I have since found). Now the Braun sits in the drawer and I use the 7310.</li>
    <li> Quiet, great shave, much better than my old Norelco 6613. The trimmer system is better in the 6613. For all the other, this is much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco rotary razors since I started shaving and have purchased a few cordless models, with the previous ones still usable as corded models (i.e. the reason for purchasing the new model: the previous model&#x27;s battery no longer held a charge).  The 7310 is so much lighter and quieter than my previous model (I think it was in the 5xxx series?), and its shave quality is better, too -- in all respects, a significant improvement.    If you&#x27;ve never used a rotary shaver, you may want to use this type of razor on a regular basis (i.e. don&#x27;t let your facial hair get too long, as the razor will feel like it&#x27;s pulling the hair) and with a light touch.  If you have, you should enjoy this model&#x27;s capabilities!</li>
    <li> I received this product in brand new condition and very quickly. My boyfriend loves it and uses it everyday!</li>
    <li> Fantastic price, shaves as close as a razor even on your neck.  The sound is a little unnerving...sounds like it hasn&#x27;t taken a charge because its so quiet.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the worst shaver i have ever bought WOW! They should name this thing a Norelco Razor Burn and Skin Destroyer.  The motor is sooo weak it doesnt cut and the blades are not sharp! DONT BUY ONE!</li>
    <li> This electric razor replace a very old Norelco, and I found it to be far superior to the old one.   The price was fair and on the low end for a quality product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers since I got fuzzy 40 years ago.  This one is the best.  It is amazingly light and quiet.  It shaves well.  I&#x27;ve needed to charge the batteries 3 times in 4 months.  You can use it while charging the batteries. Best of all, to clean it you pop it open and stick it under the faucet.  Dont waste your money on the high priced gadgets,  This one is the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s old shaver. He loves it, so silent and shaves perfectly at the first try. He gets a really close shave, love the smooth face again! Shaves almost as close as a razor but without the burn, cuts and bumps. Don&#x27;t waste money on expensive shavers, this is a great product!  Cons: No travel case (you can use any case for it really...)</li>
    <li> This shaver is a piece of junk.  we ordered it around Christmas.  it worked fine for a month, then fell apart.  There was no way of putting it back together again.  Cheap materials, cheap execution, etc.  We just threw it away.  Will never buy a Norelco again.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco user for years and years and when the heads for my old razor cost more than a new razor I purchased this razor. I got what I paid for, it is light weight, the blade speed is not real fast thus you have to be careful with a 3 day beard it will pull before it cuts. For the price it is OK.</li>
    <li> I picked this up because it fit my budget and I figured I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy. Now I wish I&#x27;d spent $80 on a better, more powerful model and will probably end up doing so in the next few weeks.    The 7310 is really lightweight and quiet, but only because it&#x27;s made of plastic and spins its blades at low speeds. Even at a full charge, this shaver pulls my whiskers after only two days of growth. Eventually I do get the smooth Norelco shave I&#x27;m used to, but it takes longer than normal due to the unit&#x27;s low power.    Buy this only if you&#x27;re fine with taking extra time to get every hair. A better model will shave in a fraction of the time and won&#x27;t pull your whiskers.</li>
    <li> This new shaver performs as well as my last Norelco, perhaps a little quicker. While it doesn&#x27;t have any bells and whistles, it does a good job. I don&#x27;t care for the cost of replacement blades, so I will replace the whole shaver when the blades become dull.I like the triple head shavers better than the screen type I have used before. Overall a great performer for the price</li>
    <li> Solid built. I shave everyday, the battery can last at least a week on one charge. Be aware that the shaver can not be charged during the usage. It can give you a very close shave if you use it properly.</li>
    <li> HAD MY FIRST NORELCO SHAVER FOR 8 YEARS AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT. THE NEW NORELCO 7310XL IS FANTASTIC!  I CAN&#x27;T BELEIVE HOW SMOOTH AND QUITE IT IS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade user my entire life.  I thought I&#x27;d try this model electric shaver because of it&#x27;s cost and it&#x27;s listed ratings.  While it does an OK job, I still need to touch up under my chin with a blade razor to get everything.  I&#x27;ll still use my blade razor daily, but will use this for quickie jobs.</li>
    <li> I have been using the 7310 men&#x27;s shaver for about 3 weeks. So far so good. Have not develope any bumps. Goood value up to this point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of electric razors over the years (including Norelco) and this, by far, is the best I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s quiet and gets the job done fast.  However, because it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor, I&#x27;m not giving it five stars.  As long as there is metal between the blades and your face, I don&#x27;t think any electric razor will ever shave as close as a regular razor.  At least with this Norelco you won&#x27;t have to worry about any nicks and you will get a pretty good shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. It is compact and easy to use. I would highly recommend it for anyone, especially someone who is shaving for the first time.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington Norelco 7310XL electric shaver for my 15-year old son for Christmas!  He hates to shave and I thought this might give him some incentive.  He absolutely loves it!  If I were able, I would have purchased two in case Remington discontinues this particular shaver.</li>
    <li> Been using an older Norelco triple-header for years and wanted to replace the blades.  When I found this unit for nearly the same price as replacement heads for my older unit I bought this one.  What a difference!  I have been struggling for years getting a smooth close shave on my neck without irritation and this Norelco 7310XL does the job.  What a difference!  I last shaved 15 hours ago and my neck has less stubble now than I usually had immediately after using my old shaver.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this razor for the price! Gives you a close shave and is very easy to clean up. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The razor is all it was advertised to be and perhaps more, based on my prior experience with Norelco electric razors.  Obviously, I must like the brand or I wouldn&#x27;t have returned.    As to this particular razor, the first thing to report is that it is VERY quiet.  One could easily use it while a partner continues to sleep nearby.  Second, it shaves me quickly and thoroughly.  Third, the first charge lasted through approximately 5 shaves, and when it gave out, the device quit completely (no gradual slow down like my battery powered toothbrush).  When it stops, you simply plug in the charger to finish that shave.  Finally, it cleans up easily.    The only negative I have encountered, and this is minor, is the flashing green light when it has finished recharging.  The first time I charged it, this happenend at about 2AM, and it was somewhat disconcerting to see the bathroom flashing green.    I am very well pleased with the device.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for many years. I looked for a reasonably priced, competent shaver. This is one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves and trims well. It holds a charge long enough to be useful. It runs fine when plugged in, the plug is even small and light.  I have only used it a few months so can&#x27;t comment on long term battery or other durability. It is easily cleaned, allowing use of water. It light weight with nice balance and feel when in use. Simple to use, there are no cutting height or other adjustments but, because it is a basic shaver, others may be do some jobs better such as: extremely long/tough beards; special skin; or shaving exceptionally close. I don&#x27;t need any of these so it is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not fancy or loaded with &#x27;stuff&#x27;. It just does its job. All in all a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/2012: I still use, and rinse, this shaver daily. The battery has held up well...recharge required maybe every 2 weeks or so, and again, it works when just plugged in.  I will probably buy another like it when I need to.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 7310XL isn&#x27;t just the best \\&quot;budget\\&quot; shaver, it&#x27;s as good if not better than any shaver you can buy for 10 times the money! I&#x27;ve tried them all, and I love its simple reliability and high quality. It reminds me of those indestructible old Norelco shavers that your dad used for 40 years, only much lighter and quieter. Why pay more for contrived gimmicks? At $29, it is a STEAL! Charges quickly, too. Just one little nit: It&#x27;s plastic protective cap clasps on just above the release button that opens the razor head compartment, so remove the cap from the TOP to avoid unintentionally pressing that button and having the compartment open and the hair fall out!</li>
    <li> It works but not as good as a electric remington Under powered Blades seem slow when rotating I wont buy another on..</li>
    <li> I get a closer shave with a razor... This product is alright but it leaves irritation after applying trying to get all the hair..</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors off and on for many years but always regretted the hassle of cleaning them. Now this has all changed with the Norelco 7310XL.  Just as easy as the ad promised, you flip open the head cover and rinse the head under running water. Presto, a CLEAN APPARATUS.  The shave is close and effortless.  What a difference!</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this shaver. The only complaint I have is it takes a bit long (8 hourse) to fully charge.</li>
    <li> I have been using a similar one for the past 14 months. Retains charge for a longer time than other more expensive shavers.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I lost the charger a long time ago... at least half a year ago! I was expecting the shaver to die soon. However, it&#x27;s still working properly! What a surprise! I have to give a 5-star review just because of this.</li>
    <li> Being just 23 years old (yes you can roll your eyes now), I have only used two shavers in my life.  Both of these have been electric razors made by Norelco.    I used my previous Norelco for 4 years before it stopped holding a charge.  It really didn&#x27;t effect me since I always kept it plugged in when I used it.  After seeing this razer at such a good price I decided it was finally time for me to step up.  I like the rotary design better since it seems to give me less ingrown hairs and gives me less irritation.    This product comes in the annoying safety-plastic packaging.  After finally getting it open I found the razor, with a cap on the rotary part, the power cord, a pamphlet, and a cleaning brush.  The razor has a very attractive design versus my last Norelco - which wasn&#x27;t as visually appealing.    The Noreleco 7310XL is much quieter than the version I previously had.  It was able to shave VERY close. I was impressed with how close of a shave it did as such a price. Yes I would have to go over spots more than one time, but that really is to be expected with any shaving system.  The razor did not irritate my skin either. After initially charging it, I have found that I rarely will have to charge this product.  You can also easily clean the razor with just water.  Thank goodness.  Just make sure you dry it properly else it will smell terrible.    Here is something important  You MUST have the product be partially charged in order to actually use the Razor.  Even when it is plugged into the wall.    For the price, this product is extremely well worth it.  When you find yourself needing a new razor blade, or if you can no longer hold a charge, you might just want to buy yourself a new razor instead.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good razor, holds a long charge. It is extremely quiet motor, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing the job but the stubble goes away. I use shaving cream to shave, it works better for me than pre-electric shave and then rinse the heads under the water. Of course don&#x27;t try this using the cord only cordless.     The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I don&#x27;t feel it cuts as close as my old Norelco (cool-skin 6710). I used it the same way until the battery died and there wasn&#x27;t a local service center. I didn&#x27;t like the charger on the 6710 but I understand why they did it this way for safety.</li>
    <li> This shaver was bought as a gift to my grandpa. It looks great on the outside, and I believe it works good too!</li>
    <li> FROM SUSIE Q&#x27;S HUSBAND - I have wet shaved for many years and owned a couple of electric shavers which never cane close to a regular razor. When my Wife bought me the Philips Norelco 7310 for a gift, I was sceptical but from the very first use,I coild not beleive the shave it gave me. Even now six months down the line I still catch myself rubbing my face in disbeleif of the smooth shave it gives.  I am also amazed how long it lasts from charge to recharge, I shave at least once a day and the charge lasts at least a month.  What a great gift and what a great shaver.</li>
    <li> One of the best things I have ever purchased. Requires a little more time when shaving in the neck area.</li>
    <li> After one year of use this appliance is still running and working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully water washable and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost a week of use without recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You look always like one day shaved!!!</li>
    <li> We purchased this shaver for my father who now resides in a nursing home.  He claims it does all he needs and it is easy to use.  No more razor cuts for him.  The quiet use and nice styling are a real plus.  A good price for a middle of the road shaver system.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, shaves close like a blade. This is the first time I use an electric shaver (I&#x27;m 66 years old). I got tired of my face being cut by those blades in the past and with this one you can shave your face while is dry, you may get some irritation but once your face gets used to it you&#x27;ll feel great, it&#x27;s washable under the tap and the charge lasts at least for a week (if it runs out you may make a quick charge and finish your task). What else can you ask for this little money?</li>
    <li> Horrible razor. Pulls and you have to go over 10x&#x27;s for it to be a reasonable shave.</li>
    <li> good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> The shaver was very inexpensive and I use it to get the longer hairs that my screened Wahl shaver would sometime miss, plus I always traveled with the Norelco.  The motor is slower then my previous Norelco and weaker but it does the job, just a little slower.  The case is much more fragile feeling then my previous Norelco and the transformer for charging the unit is on the cord and not inside the unit. I cannot complain about this unit for the low price that I paid? I only hope that it lasts me 10 or more years like my more expensive, previous Norelco shaver did?</li>
    <li> One must set their expectations before purchasing this razor.  As someone who has been shaving for over 30 years, and who is used to the close shave that a blade provides on course facial hair, this razor definitely does not meet my needs.  I purchased this however for my 16 year-old son who is not yet donning any substantial growth.  An awesome first razor for him.  Suits his needs perfectly.  Seems to hold a charge pretty well also. Easy to clean.  Cant comment on the life of the blades yet, but I can say that when they need replacing, I&#x27;ll be going for a new razor since replacement blades cost the same as the entire setup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good razor for the price.     Pro&#x27;s  -washable head  -price  -battery life  -doesn&#x27;t hurt or tug  -usable right out of the box (if plugged in)    Con&#x27;s  -takes several strokes to clean off all hairs  -isn&#x27;t very powerful  -kinda spotty and leaves a few patches</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor at a local store and used it for a little over 3 months. Even up until the last shave it still ripped my neck to shreds every time I shaved. Plus it never even cut that close. It did reasonably well on my face though with no irritation, just the neck. After using it for a few months one day one of the razors somehow caught a hold of the metal screen and stuck the blades outside. Luckily I was able to pull it away from my face before the blades ripped it off. 2 of the rotors still worked so I kept on using it until I had time to go get a new razor. The next day another rotor violently exploded inside sending pieces of plastic and a spring flying. Would not recommend to anyone, even someone on a budget.</li>
    <li> A few weeks before I bought this Norelco, I had bought one for myself and I loved it so much that I bought this one for a friend.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve had some really expensive ones.  Smooth, quiet and gives an incredibly close shave.</li>
    <li> This was my 5th Norelco shaver and also the cheapest.  It lived up to its price, unfortunately.  It is slow and is fine if you want a shaver to use occasionally or to leave in car when a touch up is needed.  The battery went dead during its first 90 days and could not be charged.  After an extensive conversation with Norelco customer service, a replacement was mailed and the bad one returned.  I have gone back to my 8845XL as my every day shaver.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 7310XL is the best electric razor I have had. Just purchased it a month ago and it not only gives me a close, smooth shave, but I shaved with it daily for 18 days on one charge. I am now on day 12 of the first recharge. My previous Norelco only gave me 4-5 days on each charge which is the reason I decided to replace it.  I chose the new model based on reading numerous reviews like this one.  Definitely recommend it.  Ron</li>
    <li> Even though I know I shouldn&#x27;t expect much from a shaver this cheap, the reviews made me think it would be pretty good. It is not. The 5+ yeas old Remington shaver I had before still works better than this Norelco. It is OK for the face but very bad with the neck hairs. Leaves my throat area feeling all torn up. Maybe save up and get something a little nicer.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002B4ORB6 7310XL]]      Had bought a Braun foil razor about a year ago.  I was impressed at how well built it was, but could never get a good shave with it.  I bought the 7310XL in July 2010 and absolutely love it.  Got a close shave the first time I used it.  And, I now shave in five minutes versus the 20 minutes with the Braun.</li>
    <li> I used foil type shavers for the last 35 years.  Remmington and Braun.  They always seemed to miss hairs on my neck which would require using a blade about once a week.    So I bought this rotary shaver and I am very happy.  Cuts fast, smooth and close. And it doesn&#x27;t make a difference if I skip shaving for a day or two.    I keep an extra shaver in my travel pack. On a week long trip I had to go back to the foil shaver.  At the end of the week I threw out the Braun and bought another Norelco.</li>
    <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is how quiet this shaver is, compared with earlier designs. If you detest loud noises early in the morning, you&#x27;ll be thrilled with this one! Like all electric shavers it takes a lot longer to get a good close shave than using a razor, and as with all electric models, it really doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;shave as close as a blade.\\&quot; If a close shave look is preferred, you&#x27;ll need to use it a few times a day to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; your appearance. But it&#x27;s definitely a step up from older models: there&#x27;s a different sensation in the cutting action (it feels like it is shaving closer) and the blinking lights when the battery is fully charged lets you know when to unplug it. If you&#x27;re choosing between refurbishing an older model with new parts, and buying new, seriously consider ordering this one, and recycling the old one.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for about 3-4 weeks. The shave is close and takes much less time that with my previous Norelco shaver. I am completely satisfied and recommend this inexpensive shaver to anyone looking for a new one.</li>
    <li> Used one of these for years, until my wife messed it up.  Love my new one as much as ever.</li>
    <li> I was disapointed in the razor. It is nowhere near the quality that Norelco used to be. It works alright, just not too impressed withit. I had been using a Braun until it died. Wish I had bought another one.</li>
    <li> I normally shave with razor blades, I have tried the cheap ones and the more awesome spaceship looking ones. All of them irritate my face, years ago I had bought an electric shaver and that also had my face on fire, especially in the neck area. It cost me about $70 and I thought it sucked. After so long using regular blades I figured I try again an electric shaver. I found this one and I read all the great reviews, I thought to myself \\&quot;yeah right\\&quot;. Well I can tell you that my face said THANK YOU!!. I have been shaving with this Norelco for a little over a week and I can tell you that my face does not get irritated, it gives me the best closest shave ever, and I can&#x27;t wait to shave again.     Remember the neck area I mentioned. Well this thing shaves that area with easy and comfort. I know you must be saying \\&quot;yeah right\\&quot;. Try it you will be saying the same thing. Awesome Price, Awesome shave. I will post a before and after picture so you guys can check it out.</li>
    <li> These shavers, Norelco, are far superior to the other brands I have used. This one in particular is excellent! The thing was charged out of box and lasted for days of shaving. Then, I recharged and have been running it for a couple of weeks. The feeling is so much better than the Remington or other cheaper brands. These don&#x27;t noticeably pull my hair when I am shaving. Passing it over my face is more like a massage than shaving. The other brands honestly were just annoyingly painful. Not the kind of pain that makes you have to stop, just the kind that gets on your nerves enough that you eventually stop wanting to use your electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the washable head thing too. That is not something I had on my former shavers. This is a good one and at a price less than the Remington that I purchased about six months prior to buying this one. The Remington was a waste of money, whereas this razor was (in comparison) an excellent deal!</li>
    <li> Great value for your money. works great and washes off easily.  Pros - Good shave, wrinsable, sheek design.  Cons - Charger is a little bulky. came without a case.</li>
    <li> This razor is very nice. Before receiving this razor I had been the owner of a very poor electric razor, and so would always use disposable razors. However, when I received this electric razor, I was presently surprised to see that it shaved very very smoothly. I was impressed with how much more compact it was than my old razor, and it has a nice look to it as well. All in all, this razor is a very good buy.</li>
    <li> This razor really does the job. I decided to purchase this model. Rather than replace the cutters  in a more expensive one I had. Am glad that I changed.</li>
    <li> I needed to get a razor quick when my old one stopped charging. I got this razor mostly on price. It gives a nice, close shave (more so since my old razor&#x27;s blades were getting a bit dull). Also, I really like the rinse to clean option. I read the reviews that this razor doesn&#x27;t have a battery status indicator (how full is the battery now?), but didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need it. Still don&#x27;t think I _need_ it, but my next razor _will_ have a battery status indicator. Will probably give this one to my son. He&#x27;s entering high school and will need one of his own soon.</li>
    <li> Norelco has never let me down and they continue to make good quality shavers.  This product shaves very close and is easy to care for.  The shaving head lasts for a year and I use it daily.  I recently tried a Braun shaver costing 6 times more, a gift from my wife.  I was very disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for someone in a nursing home.  He found it easy to handle and easy to understand (two very important issues for a disabled person).  This is the second of this type of razor we have purchased for him, both just perfect for him.</li>
    <li> Battery life last forever.  Just make sure that you use up all charge before you recharge it.  I heard it is not good to keep recharging a recharged battery or for that matter to leave it charging for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;Nice close shave with pivoting head and it is detachable which allows you to wash it.  May need to use a few drops of special shaver oil to the heads to extend head life.&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet and powerful and does what I need it to do even when I go for several days before shaving.  Now lets see how long it lasts.  I had a much older model Phillips that lasted forever.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a shaver like the Norelco 4821XL, but it doesn&#x27;t come up to the expectations.  I wish they still made the Norelco 4821XL. I would buy that in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> Had this for a few years now, works great, don&#x27;t leave it charging. Let it power out, then use the cord for that shave and charge it up. My last Philips shaver lasted 5 years using this technique.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old 900-series Philips razor. First thing I noticed was the weight. My old 900 was heavy and it was a \\&quot;tank\\&quot;. If the Ni-CD battery didn&#x27;t die I would still have it today. Searched around and the 7310 had good reviews and was cheap. I don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistle of the highend shaver. Just need a quick clean shave. I don&#x27;t have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair. So quick, clean and portable were my requirements.    The 7310 was much lighter and felt \\&quot;plastic\\&quot;. It should travel better than my old one. Should shave off at least a pound from my carry-on. As for the shave. Just as good (if not better) as my old 900. Doubt it will last 10+ years my 900 did. If I get 5 to 7 years from it I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this electric shaver.   Clean up is a simple rinse!  He has always used Norelco  shaver but this is his favorite one.</li>
    <li> This is my first three-head rotary shaver and my first Norelco brand electric razor. I noticed my face did take a few weeks to adjust to this new brand; previously, I was a user of a Braun system. I was tired of contanstly buying new foils for my single-head shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I always make sure to use Lectric Shave beforehand, as it gives me a closer, smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is easy to wash and cleanup is a breeze. The razor&#x27;s negatives have been mentioned before. The popup trimmer is useless, and I&#x27;m disappointed there isn&#x27;t some sort of remaining charge indicator. It&#x27;s annoying when the shaver just turns off without any warning.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the greatest electric razor, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be. However, this is a great deal for the price. I&#x27;ve paid far more for comparable electric razors.</li>
    <li> i have used philips shaver for many years.and the last one was broken a few days ago.so i made the purchase.the shaver is easy to use and it brings me good feeling.</li>
    <li> the first few shaves i got with this rotary shaver were magic. after a couple more uses major patches of hair were still intact. the fact that there&#x27;s no actual view of how long the battery life is means that it can go out whilst shaving. you&#x27;re better off with a manual razor.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver a year a go and it has been amazing. The first 30 days your skin needs to get used to a electric razor (says so in manual). Close shave and the blades last longer than expected i had mine for 8 months no problem. and 40$ for a replacement blades every 8 months is way cheaper than disposable. One thing is, i haven&#x27;t been totally happy with how long it keeps a charge; it doesn&#x27;t  last the 10 days they advertise (even when it was new.</li>
    <li> Norelco Razor is fine.  Have used them for the past few years.    This particular product could have been bought for a few dollars less from many stores including Macy&#x27;s, CVS, and the like.   So much for bargains.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my b/f as a christmas present. He really likes it. He can charge it and take it with him wherever he goes. I touched his skin after shaving, and it&#x27;s actually smoother than when he uses the razor. So far so good. No problems yet.</li>
    <li> At this price, I was expecting a cheapy Ni-Cad battery but was pleasantly surprised that it has a lithium ion battery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is much quieter than the Braun I replaced it with. It&#x27;s also easier to clean since I can just rinse it under the tap! The shave is better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver, especially at this price and would not hesitate to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers in the past but they wouldn&#x27;t cut as close as a blade until I upgraded to this one. With the old one I&#x27;d have to shave every day but with the Lift and Cut technology I can skip a day and still look clean. I recommend using the Aramis Electric Shave solution. It&#x27;s got no perfume and helps the shaver work even better. This shaver is very easy to clean. Just pop the top and run under hot water. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this electric razor. It&#x27;s easy to clean, holds a charge for what seems like ever, and gives me a great shave. And of course it came quickly and was at a very reasonable price. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to receive this fine looking product in mid-December and used it for five weeks, following all of the daily maintenance recommendations.  I got great shaves until at the end, while I  was opeening it for daily cleaning,the razor assembly came apart.  Norelco was unable to help me to re-assemble the cutters, etc. Sorry to say that I think that it is poorly designed.  I&#x27;ve had to throw it out![[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> Norelco used to be pretty good, then came out with junk electric shavers, now it&#x27;s nice to see that finally they are pretty good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves pretty well and fairly quickly.  I am relieved not to be nearly as tempted to pay extra and use manual razors as I was with the previous Norelco electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing extremely special though.  It&#x27;s not spectacular.  Just a simple shaver that manages to do its job fairly well.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this Shaver.  I have an electric Trimmer that works better for shaving than this model - - Then I&#x27;ll just have to finish the job with a razor blade. Seriously when I turn this shaver on ... I keep wondering if it&#x27;s fully charged. Surely a good shaver is sharper and the blade wheels move MUCH faster - - to cut through hairs (as opposed to ripping them out of your face one at a time). Every time I use it I have a red rash by the neck line. I&#x27;m constantly wondering if there is something I&#x27;m doing wrong .. For example... Did I forget to remove some key piece of packing material that restricts blade circulation? Did I charge it according to the specs - - no I think it&#x27;s just a piece of garbage and I&#x27;ll probably never use it again (hence save your $37 - - or whatever it costs!) and move on to other models - - even if they cost twice the $.  Lesson learned!</li>
    <li> It was finally time to replace my 5-year-old shaver (blades for the discontinued model are now more than this shaver cost!) so I compared features and decided on this one. I unpacked it and plugged it in, as per the manual, to get a full charge in the battery. A few hours later, I was satisfied to see the two LEDs flashing to tell me the battery was fully charged; that happiness faded a bit when I unplugged the shaver and both lights went out. It would be a lot more helpful to have these lights stay on to let me know the state of the battery (both on &#x3D; full charge, one on &#x3D; getting low, one flashing &#x3D; very low)! This really only leaves you with two choices...recharge the battery when it isn&#x27;t very low (and this will tend to reduce the efficiency of the battery over time) or take a chance that your battery will die mid-shave and you&#x27;ll have to finish your shave with the cord plugged in (this may not seem like a huge deal, but not everyone has an outlet right next to the mirror in the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is amazing. Even the first shave was close and smooth with a minimum of \\&quot;neck bumps\\&quot; that you get so often from a new shaver. The reflex action heads are great compared to my old shaver&#x27;s floating heads. These really keep the shaving heads aligned to your face, even under the chin. My old razor was horrible under my chin since only one head at a time was touching my skin because of all the different curves...so getting that area done took close to half my total shaving time. With this shaver, the heads seem to stay engaged with my beard all the way around so I can actually use the circular motion you&#x27;re supposed to with a rotary shaver and get a good, close shave under my chin and along my jaw line with many fewer strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the great shave, there are other reasons to like this shaver. It is really quiet...compared to my old Remington, this is like a car engine next to a big diesel truck. The washable design is another big plus for me...much better than relying on the little brush to get the heads clean. The design is very comfortable in my hand and doesn&#x27;t require me to keep switching how I grip the shaver as I move from one part of my face to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable on the face and in the hand&lt;br /&gt;Quiet&lt;br /&gt;Seems to hold a good charge&lt;br /&gt;Can be cleaned under running water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No battery-level lights (but even this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for most of us since we can use it corded if the battery dies mid-shave)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is very much worth the price and I recommend it.elying on the little brush to get the heads clean. The design is very comfortable in my hand and doesn&#x27;t require me to keep switching how I grip the shaver as I move from one part of my face to another.    Pros:  Very close shave  Comfortable on the face and in the hand  Quiet  Seems to hold a good charge  Can be cleaned under running water    Cons:  No battery-level lights (but even this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for most of us since we can use it corded if the battery dies mid-shave)    I think this is very much worth the price and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth one I have used. I have used this product for over 15 years and think it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This shaver is one of the best I have ever used, literally there are no flaws. It kept a charge for weeks, 3 or 4. It is extremely quiet running and delivers a close shave, I am finished shaving in a few minutes. For the price this shaver is a steal, comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I thought that the product for the price does well. I think the next time I purchase an electric shaver I going to get one that has more features and is a better built unit. Like I said for the price this one does the job it suppose to do. In general I&#x27;m pleased, but will get a better one next time.</li>
    <li> After years of using a Braun electric shaver, I tried a Norelco 7310, after my son switched. It is much smoother and incredibly fast. I can shave in less than half the time!</li>
    <li> It shaves great.  I wish it came with a travel bag.  In the past I always bought Norelco razors and they had a bag.  Oh well, it still works great.  I just hate when I open my briefcase to find the shaver opened inside my case</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several electric razors of several different brands ranging from $20 to $80, and the Norelco 7310 is my favorite.  When you turn it on it actually sounds underpowered because it&#x27;s much quieter than my previous razors, but it does a surprisingly good job.  In fact I think it gives me a closer shave than any of my other electric razors, particularly on my neck, which is a difficult area.  The battery also lasts through several shaves, the trimmer works well, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and easy to recharge.    It&#x27;s a great electric razor for the price.</li>
    <li> This razor cuts really well.  It was half the price of my previous Norelco, and it works just as well or better.  The fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with a storage case  seems to be the only negative, but it&#x27;s a small one...  I just use the case from my  previous razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver and it works wonders. If you&#x27;re careless and you just start swiping at random angles you can still cut yourself though. Also, make sure you keep shaving while your hair is short. Once it gets too long, it hurts to shave with this. I also love that there&#x27;s a flip thing on the other side that I can use to shape my sideburns.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this shaver I was concerned because of several low ratings some reviewers gave it at the time here on Amazon. It is now several years since I bought this product and it has worked perfectly since the day I bought it. I even bought a spare one at the time, but it likely will be some while before I need to open the box from my second one bought to replace the first, &amp;#34;just in case.&amp;#34; It works fine and does what a shaver is supposed to do. It is not too noisy. To me it is rather quiet. I&#x27;ve owned many shavers over a period of fifty years, so when I tell you this one is good, it is!</li>
    <li> The product came just as what I&#x27;d expected. I have had two Philips&#x27; Norelco models before and have been happy with their product.</li>
    <li> First time I buy one of these Shaving System and I love it!!! It shaves so close to your skin with no razor cuts or anything like that!! :)    The only issue I have is it doesn&#x27;t shave very well close to your neck, but I think after I clean it up quickly and shave again, it cuts well...  Just got to learn those tricks...  But for the price of the product IT IS SOOOO WORTH THE MONEY! :)</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 7310 shaver is a basic electric shaver at an attractive price that won&#x27;t hurt your wallet.     Pluses (+)    * Low cost  * Easy to use  * Very easy to clean, just rinse under faucet  * Provides a reasonable shave in a decent amount of time    Minuses (-)    * Neck hair shaving is tedious as it takes multitudes of passes to get down to skin    Overall, I would have to say that the Philips Norelco 7310 is a great buy and a great bargain.  If you are looking for an electric shaver for the moments that whipping out the shaving cream takes too much time, then this is a great deal you should definitely look into.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaver and it is great overall.  The only problem i have with this product is that it irritates my skin sometimes but nothing dramatic.  I still would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a good electric shaver.  The price wasn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
    <li> I had a Quadra Action Norelco (It cost me about 100 bones when I purchased it new) that took the HQ6 blades.  I owned it 5-6 years until I dropped it and broke the head assembly.  I loved that razor so much that I actually tried to by a new Head Assembly for it but they quit making them for the series I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did reviews for two weeks on razors, not to mention called Norelco customer service 3 times to ask questions.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to make this easy for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco model has HQ8 blades in it.  Some with HQ8 blades cost a hundred bones, others 30 bones.&lt;br /&gt;This does what any \\&quot;high cost\\&quot; shaver does with the same blades in it.  Why?  Because it&#x27;s the same blades!  (the main key to \\&quot;shaving\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others might have a cooler colors, fancier looking lights, or a stand, battery meter, that don&#x27;t give you a better shave, but just have added features for the pretty package wow factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myself I use my Razor to SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Razor shaves just as close if not closer than my Quadra Norelco that had the HQ6 Blades in it (The blades in this are suppsed to be a steap up, but I see little difference)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Lie, I talked to 3 people at Norelco.  And I asked them about the other \\&quot;higher priced Norelcos\\&quot; razors, vs this razor. (even inquired about the arcitec)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them told me that the only difference was the added features (lights, bells &amp; whistles, faster charge time), but the shave will be just as close in this one than any others they sell.  (One rep even told me that the arcitec was one of there most returned razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it for what it&#x27;s worth.  But for the extremely low cost on this bad boy with the High End Blades but after doing research, talking to Norelco reps I think this truly is a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this shaver, charge it up and enjoy.</li>
    <li> I was using a Braun shaver for two years before purchasing the Philips Norelco 7310XL shaver.  I am so pleased that I did. Cleaning the Norelco is much easier then the Braun.  My new Norelco deserves a five star rating compared to a Braun. I&#x27;ll never go back to using a Braun. I&#x27;m sold on the Norelco for life.</li>
    <li> One word..GREAT!!! i love the fact that you can wash the blades after you are done using it. Seller was prompt, hassle free. Product is easy to maintain. Thanks</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product. Light weight, sharp and smooth cut, long lasting battery. I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the purchased. Great performance, the battery lasts for a week (I do not need to travel with the charger), the blades do a great job and it is not noisy. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> At the bargain price of about $25.00 that I spent, there is little if anything negative to say about this Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It uses exactly the same blades that are found in the more expensive models of the Norelco line and thus provides the same quality, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to clean the shaver after each use by simply opening up the shaving head and rinsing under water is a great convenience and time saving feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the external appearance/design of the shaver itself and some additional capabilities don&#x27;t matter to you, then why spend more money ($100.00 +) to get essentially the same shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my face and my pocketbook are extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a bargain at the price. If you are just looking for a good shaver at a relatively low price, do consider this one. I&#x27;ve had several Norelco shavers and, while being cheaper than all the others, this one does everything I need it to do.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever bought, and I really like it. I&#x27;d always shaved the old fashioned way with dissposable razors and shaving cream, but I wanted to try something new because it takes me a long time to shave and I almost always cut myself. The shaver is liteweight, comfortable to hold, the battery holds a charge for almost two weeks, and it shaves pretty close. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a traditional razor. But on the plus side it doesn&#x27;t cut your face, and the hairs gona grow back anyway so who cares! My job requires me to be \\&quot;flexible\\&quot; which means (my hours change every week) so one day I may not get off work until 10 at night and then I may have to be back at 8 in the morning, so its convenient (takes 2 to 3 minutes for me to shave). The 7310XL makes shaving quick and easy instead of a pain in the butt like it used to be, and before I used an electric, my skin would always break out after I shaved. But since I started using this shaver my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as bad as it used to. The 7310XL is fast, easy to use, and easy to clean. So if your sick of cutting your face and your not real picky about how close the shave is I recommend you buy it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is my all-time favorite shaver. I have used many brands over the years, but this one does the job&lt;br /&gt;perfectly. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shaver is worth what you pay but it does have its flaws. I just figured that all the electric shavers seemed to have the same problems so why not get the cheapest. I think I made the right decision because this shaver does a decent job and its very convenient which is why I wanted to go electric.    It does seem to have trouble around on the neck and around the jaw line so you can end up taking quite a while shaving if you want to get it perfect. Also you have to get into the habit of shaving daily so if you don&#x27;t like doing that you might want so get something else. The shaver can pluck hairs that are longer than a cm in length which is rather unpleasant. Stubble though it handles just find and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation despite this being my first electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I never remembered a time when shaving was a pleasant experience. I still have adult acne and a razor blade always give me nicks, cuts, &amp; the occasional razor burns. I especially hate it when I have acne since I sometimes cut them. Yes, I have been careful, I also take a hot shower or wash my face with hot water and put shaving cream before shaving. Plus it&#x27;s really hard to see where your small acne are with the shaving cream hence the occasional cut. I hated shaving &amp; only shave 2x/week which means I have a couple of days wherein I have a day old beard/mustache. So I was looking to switch to an electric razor. I was a bit apprehensive when I bought this since I thought that it could never replace a good razor shave. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and I could say what a difference! I don&#x27;t dread shaving as much as I did before and I can shave as many times as I can without the nicks, burns, cuts, and pain! No more preparations, not even a shaving cream, and it glides easily over my face AND over my acne without cutting them. I&#x27;ve only charged my unit once when I received it and it&#x27;s been over a month now and it hasn&#x27;t needed a charge yet. My only regret is why I didn&#x27;t get this sooner.</li>
    <li> No shaver of any kind is perfect, but this is better than my last Philips Norelco (the cheaper corded model).  Of course, shaving with new blades always makes a big difference.  With a $10.00 discount \\&quot;coupon,\\&quot; the price I paid was almost as cheap as new cutters.  This is the first Norelco I&#x27;ve had with the \\&quot;wash-off\\&quot; feature; I hope it will lessen the need to take the head apart to get out the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; build-up, that hurts my face, and hurts shaving efficiency.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco shaving system works great.  It is very easy to clean and cuts the beard close, leaving no burn.</li>
    <li> This unit is very easy to use and gives a fairly close shave. The cost was remarkable. I find that it has been a good investment thus far.</li>
    <li> After I first started shaving regularly, I seen much irritation using a gilette fusion blade. My face would show imperfections every single time and I didn&#x27;t even get a close shave. After using this product, I don&#x27;t see any irritation and I can get a closer shave too! I love it.</li>
    <li> The Norelco electric razors get better every year. This model is the best I have used, have been a longtime electric razor user.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m touching my bald head as I type this. Granted, the cutters are new but after 24 hours my head is still noticeably smooth. It did a darn good job. I also like fact that the shaver head is slightly rubbery which makes \\&quot;cleaning by tapping it against the sink\\&quot; feel less damaging to the shaver and the sink. Sadly, the amount you pay for a shaver has nothing to do with the quality of the shave. Get this one and spend your money on a dinner date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned many electric shavers, most of them Norelco. For example, I also have a 7810XL. What I really like about the 7310 is compared to other designs, I don&#x27;t accidentally press the head release button while the back of my head which is a huge problem with the 7810XL. There&#x27;s no way to foresee this detail just by looking at the two models which are more or less identical.</li>
    <li> This is a gift to my dad. He haven&#x27;t tried this one yet. But the last one I got him last year was quite good.</li>
    <li> I had my first one of these for about three years.  The battery is getting tired and I haven&#x27;t changed the head since I&#x27;ve owned it. Time to refresh and its dirt cheap just to get a new one.  Previously used a high end Braun.  This cheap little guy feels more civilized and comfortable, actually provides a better shave especially if I have an extra days growth, and doesn&#x27;t go through shaving heads nearly as fast. On the negative side the trimmer is not nearly as good as Braun&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor a few weeks ago. So far, I am very impressed with it.  No, it doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles, but it gets the job done. I always get razor burn on my neck. Have for years (since I started shaving).  I tried using electrics and straight razors or a combination of both to no avail.  With this razor, used daily, my razor burn has gone almost completely away!  This razor is also VERY quiet.</li>
    <li> Today I saw the Philips Norelco 7310XL in a nearby store at a cost of 700 RMB (almost 110 USD). I had no idea this kind of razor cost that kind of money in China. It makes me appreciate the gift even more. My father surprised me by purchasing this razor for me after I made the mistake of buying an electric razor that does not have dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third Norelco razor and fourth electric razor. It&#x27;s quiet, lightweight, and has no vibration unlike the Panasonic ES-SA40-K shaver I own. It is fully washable, has a corded option if your charge runs out, and possesses a pop-up trimmer to groom mustaches and sideburns. Additionally, there is a battery full light and LED power indicator. Should the razor stop functioning within two years, the warranty comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the shaving heads automatically adjust to the shape of your face and neck, the razor does take a little time to get that smooth face my wife desires. You are not going to get the closest shave with this product, but this razor isn&#x27;t the best that money can buy. It&#x27;s a nice electric razor with a lot of options. For optimum performance, I recommend using the razor with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I always wanted a Philips electric shaver since long. This is my first electric rotary shaver.  7310 series is the one of the best you can get in that range of price.  Rechargeable, Cordless/Corded, Washable, affordable + Trimmer - what else would you ask for?    Users, do read the instruction manual for usage and give this a try.  Use for 3 weeks as suggested and then decide if the razor suits you.  Generally 1st time users MAY not have the best experience, but as you use it more n more, you would find it easier.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Amazon for my husband as price was substantially lower than retail stores. His response to this item: Very nice shaver...better than ever with the new improved flexible heads. Much cleaner shave!</li>
    <li> This razor purchased from Amazon.com    Inferior compared to all other Phillips shavers. For a good razor go the next phillips up. For a very few more dollars you get a great shaver and a great buy    Both available at Amazon,com</li>
    <li> For the few bucks this razor costs, you can&#x27;t beat it. And in my opinion, why shell out a ton of money for a razor when you can get one that works perfectly at this price point. But that&#x27;s just my opinion! :)</li>
    <li> The overall rate of this shaving system is good, but the speed of the blade is a bit slow. If it can be faster, it would be better.</li>
    <li> I personally like it much. It has all the functions fit in your needs, and my friend also bought one after me.</li>
    <li> Why buy replacement heads for your razor when you can get a completely new razor, that shaves pretty darn good, and is cheap!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a solution to shaving with disposable razors.  I wanted something faster and cleaner.  I don&#x27;t grow very thick facial and wanted something so I could rock the clean shaven look everyday.  This allows me that.  With shaving cream and the razor it took longer.  With the Philips Norelco 7310XL I shave first thing in the morning everyday.  I&#x27;ve found that it works best to shave before doing anything else on dry skin.  I&#x27;ve had very little irritation, and while the shave isn&#x27;t as close as a disposable razor it&#x27;s close enough.  Like I said, I look clean shaven everyday, and that is what I was going for.  The charge of the battery lasts much longer than I expected (remember I have little facial hair).  Overall, I am very pleased.  I plan on sticking with electric razors going forward.</li>
    <li> Good product. Bought it as a gift for my dad. He likes it a lot and I like the price.</li>
    <li> I had the same type of older Norelco electric razor.   It worked really well and lasted about 15 years, but the battery finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.   This new one is mostly plastic, and the motor isn&#x27;t as strong so the blades don&#x27;t rotate as fast.      It&#x27;s a shame Norelco quality has declined.   It works okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy one just for the name.   You can probably find a razor that works as well for less money.</li>
    <li> Replace an old electric 30 year old Norelco and liked the rotating heads vs the foil type.  Must say it does just as well as using a blade.  Amazed how quite it is!  Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The first Norelco shaver that I owned was a gift. It was ordered from Amazon. I used it for quite some time until it needed new cutters.  I liked it so much that instead of ordering new cutters I ordered a new one from Amazon just like the one that was given to me.</li>
    <li> Good shaver. Need to change the heads around every few months. Overall a good priced quality reliable mens razor. Better than hand shaving every day. Combine with a once a week hand shaving to get a good system. Holds the charge for a good long time. Then when it dies just plug it in when you are at work and you are good.</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well... shaved nine times before recharging the battery. The waterproof housing makes for easy cleanup by rinsing with runnning water. This is a quality product for the price, not to mention the close shave.</li>
    <li> Shaver is good buy for the money. However it is not as robust as previous owned models. Very lightweight. Shaver does not hold charge as long as pevious models.The shaver does however afford a close comfortable shave. Overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> I had to switch from the iPhone of razors, the Gillette Fusion (powered) because I&#x27;m on an anticoagulant. With the Norelco, in 4 months I haven&#x27;t even gotten close to a scratch. It&#x27;s easy to clean and stays charged \\&quot;forever\\&quot;. The price was very reasonable. If you shave every day, it does a great job, but after 3-4 days, it takes a little effort to get a smooth shave. It&#x27;s a little loud and doesn&#x27;t sound hi tech, but these are only very minor \\&quot;cons\\&quot;. I haven&#x27;t used another electric, so I can&#x27;t compare it, but given the price and quality, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an electric shaver with good quality and price as a gift to my son.  A few months later, I ordered another one for my husband, since he was using my son&#x27;s shaver.  They are both satisfied with the product. However, I should mention that neither of them has a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> I bought an expensive shaver just one year ago and wasn&#x27;t pleased. Now I replaced it with Philips Norelco 7310. The motor is less powerful and it takes more passes to get a clean shave. However the shaver is light weight and a delight to hold. Also much easier to clean. No frills - I miss knowing how much battery time is left and then it takes longer to recharge. Even if this shaver only lasts me one year that will be more cost-effective than the more expensive models and since the final test is quality of shave - this gives just as good a result. A great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband. The shaver arrived in a timely fashion and holds charge for several shaves, which is a good thing.  However the shave is not as close as he would like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used foil shavers since I started shaving like 10 years ago so this is my first rotary one.  It works great and leaves my face very smooth.  I just got it a few weeks ago so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up in the long run but so far so good.  Great price considering how expensive some can be too.</li>
    <li> I bought this when my previous, more expensive Norelco shaver (the \\&quot;James Bond\\&quot; model) finally gave up the ghost after several years of shaving.  By comparison, this one is flimsier, no \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; (like the numeric display the other one had to tell you how many minutes of battery life you had remaining), the battery life between charges is shorter, ... it&#x27;s a pretty basic unit.  On the bright side, having used it for several months now, it shaves about as well as the more expensive unit. And that is really what I bought it for.  Bottom line, if you want the same Norelco shave as their more expensive razors without the associated price tag, this model is worth buying.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband to use while traveling. He likes it so much he is using it all the time. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> This shaver is good buy. Had it over a month now and very pleased with it. Delivery great, it is good to buy it online instead of going round the stores. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It shaves slightly closer than my previous Norelco 5801.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s relatively cheap.  My 5801 cost $63.00 ten years ago.  And, it&#x27;s much cheaper than the Braun and Panasonic I considered.  Braun probably shaves closer, but the price difference is not worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s even quieter than my 5801.  Far quieter than Remington shavers I&#x27;ve heard, and likely much quieter than Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge initially lasted 9 days, but improved to 14--the same as my previous 5801.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It looks cheap and feels cheap.  Part of this judgment is likely because it feels significantly lighter than my Norelco 5801.  However, when I weighed both, the 7310 weighed 6.3 ounces, and the 5801 weighed 6.9 ounces.  Half of this minor weight difference is because the 7310 has an external transformer, while the 5801 has a built-in transformer.  I prefer the built in transformer and the simple, coiled cord with the 5801&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hinged, not easily removable head is annoying.  The 5801 was so much easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, I would get a 7310 again.  But, why keep changing something that works well and looks fine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 5801 lasted ten years.  We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.</li>
    <li> Great deal on this product for Cyber Monday and a fantastic product indeed. Very comfortable and love the fact it&#x27;s washable. I travel a lot so this is the perfect accessory. I don&#x27;t think will ultimately replace my \\&quot;old school\\&quot; razor but it definitely is giving it a run for it&#x27;s money! Cordless is a great plus. Buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Norelco shaving system all of my aduly shaving life. Each time I replace a dated model, I am as pleased with the new as I was with the old. My wife once found me a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; on another brand, It lasted less than 30 days and then became a charitable donation. It will always be Norelco for me.</li>
    <li> One thing I&#x27;ve noticed about these shavers is it&#x27;s not worth replacing the blades since they usually cost almost the same as the original shaver.  I had the older version of this and found this out the hard way so this time I just bought this one and all is well.  I expect this to last another couple of years like the old one did.      If you&#x27;re new to electric shavers, they DO take a few weeks to get used to but once you do, you never go back to the razor except for sideburns and what not.  I&#x27;d give this 5 stars but the side-burns or other precision work still needs working on.</li>
    <li> No whistles and bells, provides a great close shave. Has trimmer. Takes 8 hours to charge then you use it till it stops. Plug in the cord and finish the shave. Indicator lights will flash when fully charge. Don&#x27;t recharge the battery until it has stop working or you will shorten the battery life.</li>
    <li> I ONLY USE IT ONCE EVERY 2 DAYS AND ALRESDY BROKE ON ME AFTER 3 MONTHS, NOT A GREAT BUY!  MY SUGGESTION IS NOT TO GET IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Good solid razor. I can&#x27;t wait for 2 days between shaving, like I did with my last one, but it does a good job.</li>
    <li> I had my previous Norelco for 9 years, and never had any problems whatsoever. Decided it was time for a new one! This new one runs much quieter, even plugged in......sometimes I wonder if its supposed to be so quiet....but it does the job, easy to hold, very easy to clean.....hope it lasts 9 years as well!</li>
    <li> Looks cheap, feels cheap, sounds cheap but guess what?  It actually does a very good job.  I got tired of paying $100+ for razors about 10 years ago.  I just buy a new one when the blades go dull.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on Amazon. I use it every day. It is very easy to use and gives a clean shave.</li>
    <li> In short, price goes well with its performance. It does the job, close shave, just not very close like most of us wants to. Doesnt do any good on my neck, not recommended for delicate skin people, NOT AT ALL. I bought this and a safety razor, the comparison result would go like -10 stars to this electric shaver and +20 to the merkur safety razor. This is like a rambo electric machete to shave your face, but once again, its worth the cheap price.  Cons:  - Takes too long and have to shave several times over the same area to get a decent and even shave.  - Not good for delicate skin.  - Wierd whiring sound.  - No battery level indicator.  - Even after pouring water over the heads, theres some small chunks of hair remaining and it will spill water while it dries out.  - Irritation ftw!.  Pros:  - Price.  - No soap or gel needed.</li>
    <li> Easy cleanup with tap water, very convenient.  Provides comfortable shave with very little friction.  Holds charge for a long time.  Excellent value for the price.  Highly recommend.  One inconvenience is that the shaver does not indicate when the battery needs recharging.  The shaver just dies, so you have to plug it in to finish the shave.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor for the price but you&#x27;ll need a friggin&#x27; chainsaw to get through the packaging. The entire thing is wrapped in hard plastic with no way in except brute force. Took a star off for that.</li>
    <li> To begin, I take a blood thinner and avoid using a blade to minimize nicks and bleeding. Over the years I&#x27;ve used many electric razors and prefer the Norelco design. So when it came time to replace my old and ailing shaver, I looked at the mind boggling choices on the market today with their dazzling array of features. I no longer travel much, so fast charging wasn&#x27;t an option I needed. And I wasn&#x27;t interested in digital readouts of battery charge, etc. After reading all the reviews, I chose the model 730XL; it had the same cutting mechanism as the high priced models, but without the bells and whistles. How does it work? For me, the best Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s very quiet and cuts my medium light beard as well as a blade, in my opinion. (I do use a skin lubricant: Williams Lectric Shave. Besides absorbing moisture on the skin, it coats with a light lubricant. Also, my wife likes the scent!) I also like the idea of cleaning the head by rinsing with water after a shave. The trimmer also cuts closer than the old Norelco. My only negative comment is that the spider that holds in the shaving heads seems flimsy and prone to breaking. time will tell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for an extremely low price and am impressed by the quality of the shave so far. I cant comment on longevity since its only been a few days.</li>
    <li> It is a special shaver, I love it because my face is no longer irritated, very good. is true. a very nice EXPERIENCE.if you buy as you will not regret I never</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect the shave you get from a razor. Its more like a rusty razor. A rusty razor that doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Hi, this is 3rd. Philips shaver I bough. I was compair many many of electric shaver many brandname.Finally Philips took the first place with no question.This Great shaver is worth every penny spent. Don&#x27;t need to go top of the line for same result shaving. This class good enough for best satified and pay less. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last 30 days and it&#x27;s been good. Help to make a smooth shave no irritation post shaving. I am able to reach all part of my neck with the flexible head.. retains charge.. usually i charge once in a week and i shave everyday...</li>
    <li> It does give a close shave, but the way the thing works is it rips out your hair by grabbing it up in a metal circle thing and then it twirls it super fast therefore ripping it out of you&#x27;re skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurts like a b****, but took my entire beard off and leaves a nice clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only get this if you are on a budget and don&#x27;t mind a &gt;little&amp;lt; pain.</li>
    <li> In December 2011, I purchased this shaver on sale at Target for $27.99. For the money this is a very good shaver. It does appear under powered but it does the job of providing a close shave in two minutes but not a comfortable one. However if you use some shave talcum powder or even regular powder the shave is much smoother. At this time I have used the shaver for 10 days but had previously used a Norelco so my face should not need to make an adjustment as recommended by Norelco. This shaver is difficult to clean because when opened the 3 rotor posts are in a recessed well that makes it difficult to clean out the whiskers. I often read  that an electric shaver does not shave as close as a wet shave with a safety razor and that is true. But is there any electric razor that shaves as close as a safety razor. Of course the term \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; has many different interpretations and how close of a shave do us men need? When I bought these razor I was skeptical of it&#x27;s performance based on the price but I know I can return the shaver to Norelco withing in 45 days for a full refund. I have bought more expensive electric razors from Remington, Panasonic and Braun but at 3 times price but not 3 times the performance. My goal was to buy an electric shaver that is inexpensive, gives a good shave and I don&#x27;t have to spend $30 plus for replacement blades. When the shaver heads to need to be replaced I can toss the shaver and buy another Christmas special that may offer improved features.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in December for the purpose of using it occasionally to spruce up in the afternoon or evening when I have to go out in public for special occasions, (which doesn&#x27;t happen very often). Using a blade razor twice in one day tends to be brutal, especially if you have sensitive skin.  I have had a few electric shavers, but have found that they take too long to do the job.  I still prefer a triple blade razor because it&#x27;s so much faster.  Having read some of the reviews, I wouldn&#x27;t even try to shave with this electric shaver if I let my beard grow two or more days, because it would probably not get the job done.  However, it has been great for touch up.  The thing I like best about it is that it is the quietest shaver I&#x27;ve had so far, probably because the motor runs rather slowly.  The motor is probably not as powerful as some on the market, but this is a trade off for its quiet operation. I am losing my hearing, so the quiet motor is, to me, the best feature of this shaver.  For occasional use, it does fine, but beyond that, I can&#x27;t say.  The low price is the reason I bought it in the first place.  As the old saying goes - you get what you pay for - probably applies here.  If you need a quiet electric shaver and want it for occasional use, this might be the one for you.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son for his birthday.  He would give it 5 stars. close shave, great trimmer. Good Value</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors all my life and I&#x27;ve used this one for a few days and so far it&#x27;s the best once I&#x27;ve used.  Here are the best features I&#x27;ve noticed so far.    1.  QUIET!  It&#x27;s so quiet that I can shave while my wife sleeps nearby.   2.  Like most, this unit has an extending blade to trim side burns etc.    3.  You can charge and shave at the same time.    4.  It&#x27;s waterproof so it&#x27;s easier to clean up.  5.  Price / Value.  I paid $35 at a local big box retailer.  Just a side note, like all units, the cost of the replacement foils are insane.  The entire unit cost $35 while the replacement foil cost $37!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for a pretty adequate electric shaver. I purchased this as a back up to a previous purchase of the same item (at the same cost). It is cheaper to buy this whole shaver than to get new shaver blades for my old Norelco. Does a very adequate job of shaving off m daily whiskers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie but it will cause a little neck irritation but not more then shaving with a manual razor. I would recommend this razor if you on a budget.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! Cuts close as a blade and is easily the best razor I have ever owned. Is very quiet and holds a charge for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I had doubts about this product because of the low price.  If it didn&#x27;t work well I thouight that I would return it since I bought it with a credit card.  Well, what a surprise.  It is great.  So quiet that I thought something was wrong.  It gives a very fast. close shave. Lasts a long time before necessary to charge.  Amazon price was best.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! I have used Norelco Triple-Head shavers since 1971 at age 16. This is my 5th shaver in all that time. They last for years, give a close shave and are very durable. 2 of my last 4 shavers were replaced not because they needed to be, but simply because I had received a new one as a gift or I&#x27;d probably still be using them. They last and last. The one major mistake most guys make with electric shavers is pressing them too hard against the face as they use them; this results in irritation and they give up and go back to old-fashioned razor blades. Just press it lightly against the face so the heads can float freely and do the job they were designed to do, and you&#x27;ll quickly fall in love with how quickly you can shave in the morning without having the mess of shaving cream or gels to deal with!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t charge it after the 4 uses as recommended. I keep using it. I also use standard disinfectant/lube to clean the blades (highly recommended for any razor). I have long hair so in order to use a shaving system I have to put it back in order to shave. If you let your hair face hair grow than the edger comes in real handy. It will get your hair back to a length that the regular razor can use.  Its my first attempt at real electric razors. I&#x27;ve had one before but didn&#x27;t use it because it left me stubbly. Everyone says you need to use a razor a few times to break it in. So I tried that and it seems to work, but you have to continually shave every day, or two days or it&#x27;ll take two pass through&#x27;s next time to get yourself smooth.  Overall, I approve.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s wonderful! Even better than the 7110x that the person originally wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought two Philips Norelco in December, one this and another 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, and payed like three times more for that SensoTouch 2d. I have never used electric shavers before so to compare these two: although 7310 is cheaper, it is better, more convenient, shaves better. It is far from the perfect and not for close shaving but for price it is good.</li>
    <li> I have used 3 different Norelco electric shavers and this is a bottom line shaver. After going on a trip, I lost my previous Norelco and had to get a replacement. I figure getting this as a value shaver. You really do get what you pay for. The entire construction seems flimsy and plastic-ie. At least, my previous shaver had some metal parts and had some real weight to it. Anyhow, the shaving head speeds seem to be slower than usual, but for me, it gets the job done. The trimmer is comparable with my previous one. Finally, the water cleaning function is nice. I would recommend this as a backup or travel shaver and just spend more for a top of the line shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric rotary razors for many years now. My previous Norelco Spectra 8865XL was not cheap, but worked quite well until recently when it needed battery replacement. That&#x27;s a nuisance with these Norelco razors (and maybe with other brands) since you have to solder the leads onto the battery. After some Amazon review research I decided to try this 7310XL though at its relatively low price I wasn&#x27;t too hopeful. It arrived quickly in good shape (usual Amazon service) and when I use it right (the instructions with it are fine, and nothing unusual) it does an amazingly good job. The claim that it gets at the hairs even below skin level may be correct: next morning there&#x27;s much shorter hairs to shave than with previous razors, including my previous Norelco; if in a real rush I might even be able to skip it! Its also very light and relatively quiet.</li>
    <li> Long ago, I used to shave manually with Shick razors and did not like it. They would leave red marks on my skin with an uncomfortable feeling and would always cut myself in the process. Some time later, I upgraded to a Remington electric razor. The same situation happened due to my sensative skin but no cuts. Plus, my shave would not always get the facial hair around my face. I finally broke down and ordered this electric razor. Reading reviews first, I was skeptical buyimg it (but finally did). I&#x27;ve used it for almost three months and am very pleased with the resaults. Every time I shave, I don&#x27;t have red marks on my skin and this razor gets the job done. Plus, clean up is fairly easy with little hassle. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who wants a clean comfortable feeling on their skin.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor and the cleaning function is absolutely the best. I would recommend this shaver to anyone who would ask.</li>
    <li> not as good as my old norelco, but this will do for the price, not as close shave as I like. battery life is good, haven&#x27;t charged after 10 use.  easy to clean, just run it under water.</li>
    <li> This shaver goes a long time on a charge. It shaves pretty close but it is sometimes difficult to get the whiskers just under my nose.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, I was expecting the shaver to be \\&quot;ok.\\&quot; Frankly, I am surprised at how well it shaves and how quiet it is compared to other shavers. I have been using Braun foil shavers for a while, which remind me a bit of jet engines winding up. The 7301XL, in contrast, seems so slow and quiet that I thought there was a problem when I first fired it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun shavers require one to push pretty firmly with repeated strokes to get a close shave. The 7310XL, in contrast, shaves close with hardly any pressure at all, a welcome difference. I think it shaves closer. Norelco&#x27;s system has trumped Braun, in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head easily hinges open for cleaning, and one quick rinse under the faucet does the job. They do suggest you leave it unhinged and open to dry, which is awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no reservations about this shaver. For such a reasonable price, it performs well.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I am trying an electric razor and it causes a lot of burns. I tried it 3 times and then decided it was enough and switched over to Mach3. I will stick onto to Mach3.</li>
    <li> After fifteen shaves, I finally had to recharge.  Shaves much better than my old fixed-head Norelco.  Occasionally pulls hair--not good.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for many years, mostly Norelco triple headers, and always the least expensive available (sometimes refurbished), and have always been satisfied. They shave well and last for a reasonably long time, and when the shaving heads/blades get dull, I just get another one because the replacements cost as much as I paid for the razor.  A couple of years ago I tried a refurb Remington non-triple header because of the price, and within a few weeks the metal? coating started to come off the head and scrape me during the shave.  Thinking that all triple headers were pretty much alike, I got a new, more expensive Remington triple header at a department store, but it has a very flawed design.  The heads kept falling out, and were hard to get back in, and it was kind of hard to clean.  Finally one of them wouldn&#x27;t stay in at all, so I used it with two heads for a while, and then another one fell out while using it away from home, and I never found it. Even with all three heads working, it just didn&#x27;t shave very close.    Hoping that they weren&#x27;t really all alike, I ordered this Norelco from Amazon.  I found it by clicking the \\&quot;used\\&quot; link, but it arrived sealed in original packaging, with just a little dent in the outer box.  After using it for a couple of weeks now, I am completely happy with it.  It is a totally different, solid design, and is also much easier to clean.  It is fairly quiet, and shaves quickly and well.  I&#x27;ve never used an expensive shaver, for comparison, but if this one lasts like my previous Norelcos did, I can&#x27;t imagine ever paying more, or ever, ever going back to Remington.</li>
    <li> My husband usually hates to shave but now does not mind at all.  He gets a smooth shave in a fraction of the time and has had no issue with irritation.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 7310 is fast, quite and has an excellent build quality. The display is amazing with good colors and contrast. Battery life is exceptionally good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco triple header razors since about 1975. Each one continues to surprise me; perhaps it&#x27;s because when new, it really does shave as close as most blade shaves. It&#x27;s hard to determine when the shave deteriorates; it happens so slow, that it takes years to notice that my blade shaves are becoming better, or rather that the Norelco is slowly getting duller. Of course, by that time, the shaver is obsolete and blades for it become hard or impossible to find, which makes a new Norelco seem like a better investment. But none of the razors ever really died, they just got replaced by a new one. As I work in a hospital, I bring the old ones to give to patients who are on blood thinners and can&#x27;t use blades, so none of them ever go to waste even if they don&#x27;t give a perfect close shave anymore. So, this time I&#x27;m going to be prepared; I&#x27;m ordering extra blades as I buy the razor. Of course, if the razor dies, I&#x27;m screwed with obsolete blades, but then again I guess I can always sell them to someone else on ebay if that does occur. Now more on the review. This razor seems a little different than my previous Norelcos; it doesn&#x27;t seem to be spinning as fast. Never the less, I&#x27;m getting a very close shave in a very short time, with no razor burn (and I have very sensitive skin). One thing I have to mention is like anything else, you have to develop the technique over time to get the best results with this razor, but I think that applies to everything in life. Just to back up my review, I&#x27;m going to buy three of these to give as presents for Christmas this year. They&#x27;re that good. Now I have to search for a cigarette lighter adapter for it for the car when I go camping.</li>
    <li> great! handy shaveing tools</li>
    <li> You might as well spend 80 bucks and get a decent razor. This thing doesn&#x27;t shave very well at all. I have to continually go over the same spots and it leaves my skin super dry.</li>
    <li> I already had the same razor for my own use . One day my son was at the house and decided that he needed a shave, He raved about it,so I bought this one for him.</li>
    <li> I was going to return to foil type electric shavers since mu last couple of rotary shavers were disappointing. Generally I found foil shavers shaved close in fewer passes but the foil wore out and cracked eventually.  I tried this shaver due to price and was happily surprised.  It shaves much closer than any other rotary shaver.  I expect this be as durable as other rotary shavers.  The battery lasts forever, more than a week of shaves.  I&#x27;d recommend this shaver for the performance alone.  The fact it&#x27;s one of the least expensive shavers is a big bonus.</li>
    <li> I am not about to spend money on those really high dollar shavers. This one is replacing my two old 7240XL&#x27;s I have had for ever it seems. I think this 7310XL shaves better then the older ones when they were new. I am pleased! Chris W.</li>
    <li> This is a frustrating shaver. It IS a close shave, but it doesn&#x27;t do well with anything past the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. If you skip a day of shaving, you&#x27;ll probably need to use the trimmer first. And that&#x27;s where the design flaw is; the trimmer is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous models had a sliding activating mechanism that would lock the trimmer into place, preventing it from moving while you used it. This model relies on a spring mechanism to keep the trimmer engaged, making it extremely flimsy. Any pressure in the wrong direction and the trimmer folds back down. This makes trimming the hair on your neck almost impossible, and if you shower before you shave and have any residual moisture on your face, the trimmer can&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I am (at best) satisfied with the shave, this razor almost requires a separate trimmer to be of any value if you don&#x27;t plan on shaving every day religiously.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband over a year ago. He shaves daily and has commented that he loves the close shave that this gives. He has sensitive skin and previous shavers have ripped his face up pretty good, but this hasn&#x27;t. Prior to this, I had purchased him a foil strip style shaver that broke after a year. He prefers the closeness of the rotary shaver over the strip. This is the first shaver he&#x27;s had that he doesn&#x27;t constantly complain about. It gets five stars from me because it still works,  I don&#x27;t have to deal with scratchies from his face, AND because I don&#x27;t have to listen to him complaining.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice device. And it&#x27;s very smooth to use. Especially the battery, it can last very long. Since I got it, I shaved for two or three weeks now, but I still haven&#x27;t charged once. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I was told that I will get a $10 mail in rebate. I mailed all the needed documents to Philips, but still no rebate is mailed to me.</li>
    <li> I replaced a more expensive Norelco (the battery would no longer charge) after reading the reviews here and I&#x27;m so happy I did. It&#x27;s inexpensive, it feels lighter but does the job perfectly. And if it dies a lot less painful to replace. Someone said it shaves their neck hairs better, I agree. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> The workmanship seems not very good. There is also a little plastic odor which made me uncomfortable. However, it&#x27;s cheep, and it works smoothly and well. I recommend this to the guys who is not willing to spent more money on it just like me.</li>
    <li> I have owned three Norelco Electric Shavers and I purchased the 7310XL and paid less than the others. The 7310XL gives me the closest shave of all the electric shavers I have purchased. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Norelco razor for personal use, and have been very happy thus far.  Much easier to clean than old models. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet!!  Comfortable to hold and gives a very smooth shave.  Yippee!</li>
    <li> Bought this inexpensive cordless shaver for my husband because I was tired of spending $40 every year for a new blade and screen for his Braun - which I paid 4 times the cost of this shaver!  Also, the Braun requires this special cleaning fluid, that was another expense.  Decided to get this little shaver because I could buy one every year and still come out ahead of the several year old Braun&#x27;s continuing maintenance costs.  Anyway, my husband loves this shaver.  He says it is so quiet and shaves quickly and nice and close.  He says he just rinses the shaver off after each use.  If it at least lasts a year I am ahead of the game and will now try to get him to toss the old Braun.</li>
    <li> This Norelco 7310XL does an excellent job of sharpley cutting away the face hair. And it cost me only about $35, a far cry from the many Norelcos that are touted and can cost approximately $200. This Norelco is excellent in its simplicity. It does not have those many sophisticated automated lighted controls--it simply does the shaving well. When you open the razor up, it gives you the impression of being made with basic materials. It does not have the luxurious display to indicate to you that the charge is about to expire. You mostly have to estimate on your own that the device requires recharging. Yet, this Norelco does a much better job at trimming the beard than many much more expensive Norelcos that I have used. Also, your chin will feel a bit of irritation wnen you first use this razor; but after a couple of weeks, that feeling of chin irritation will be gone. The razor is also easy to clean and disassemble. All in all you get an inexpensive basic razor that performs excellently. No frills, but the job gets done! And it seems that the razor is durable enough to last for a long time. I bought the razor, based on the good reviews. The reviews are so many, and the price of the razor has noticeably gone up! A testimony to the high and rising demand!</li>
    <li> Why not? for less than the cost of replacement blades, it works just fine. Be sure to keep the cord though as there is no warning when the battery dies.</li>
    <li> I purchased a similar shaver approximately thirty years ago. Enjoyed it for all those years. The new one I recently purchased is the same basic shaver with some wonderful up grades. Purchase one you will love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered it because it can get rebate back. However, it does not qualify rebate as they described before, although the product is not bad.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave, I find the battery will last a few&lt;br /&gt;weeks with out a recharge, well priced good product for the money.</li>
    <li> Let me say I received a Norelco shaver for Christmas back in 2000 and THAT one was very good.  I&#x27;d give it 4 out of 5 stars because it was reliable, stayed charged for over 6 weeks, and worked like a charm until the blades got worn out and I had to get another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 7310 model however, is really terrible.  It barely stays charged for 1 freaking hour, I kid you not.  In fact there was one occasion when I had JUST charged it and after I was done shaving, guess what?  It needed recharged already!  I was like \\&quot;WHAT???\\&quot;  If you need to recharge it *every* time you use it, something is seriously wrong.  I only used it for 5 minutes that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore the blades got incredibly dull in under a year.  Trust me you do NOT want to shave with dull blades- the hair will actually be pulled from your face and it&#x27;s quite painful.  What happens is that your hair actually gets wrapped around the blades when they become dull enough.  Terrible design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire thing feels much weaker, smaller and junkier than the previous model I received in 2000.  I give up and just use regular razors now.  It&#x27;s easier that way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a shaver that drew blood, but this one does. I&#x27;m afraid to use it now because it either causes severe irritation or outright cutting of the skin. Back to my Fusion blades for me. You get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
    <li> it works decent and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It cleans very easy as well, a big plus in my book. The only complaint is it does leave some stubble in a few areas I have to get with a normal razor.</li>
    <li> When I bought this item because I did not think that I justify qirda cheap and had a rating of 4 stars.  6 months and has been working perfectly and I use a shaving 15 charging enough and certainly deserves 5 stars</li>
    <li> Be very careful with promotion for Philips products...they will reject mail-in rebate offers simply because you buy it at a discounted price from Amazon. I have confirmed with a Philips CS supervisor that they are authorized to do exactly that.</li>
    <li> I think you should read other reviews. My shaver just arrived and I&#x27;ve used it once. I just wanted yo say I used it dry and was very impressed. I felt nothing and the shave was good. It makes me wonder what a $200 shaver offers. Maybe longevity, I don&#x27;t know yet. If I get 2 years out of this shaver I&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
    <li> Bought 12/2/12 with promise of a $10 rebate.  Like the others here, NORELCO STIFFED US ON THE REBATE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that is the way they treat customers, count me in for a Panasonic razor next round.  Thanks for nothing Norelco.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco 6053X lasted a long time but got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge more than a couple of days. I really felt that I got my moneys worth from it so decided to look at the newer models. I only need to charge this one once a month. It sounds a lot different than others I have owned (kinda like it&#x27;s running slow). But I love it. Gives me a closer shave and charge lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box, followed instructions and charged for a full 8 hours and unit could barely power up.  Cannot recommend because of this.  UPDATE:  Received the replacement and it turns out it is just as bad!  This is the worst electric shaver I have ever used!!  Does not run fast enough to safely shave. Will return and get a refund.</li>
    <li> well let me say its good so far after 20 days of use, its smooth and shave easely, not very cheap but worth the price</li>
    <li> I replaced a non-battery (plug-in) Remington electric shaver with this one, as it was beginning to chip my face a bit and the little flip-up beard trimmer thing didn&#x27;t work anymore.    After receiving the item, I immediately tried it out (it came charged).  It ran a bit slower than my plug-in, but the shave was closer.  It took a while, but I&#x27;m happy with the way it felt (it didn&#x27;t hurt at all).    One star off because it seems like it&#x27;s just a tad underpowered, though that may just be from the way it sounds.    The flip-up trimmer worked nicely on my sideburns, though.</li>
    <li> Tried all types of electric razors including Braun.  Not one would shave close enough for me.  Even though this razor is under $50.00, it is the closest shave that I have experienced other than straight razor.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as a straight razor does.  It is a little loud, but, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m shaving during an Opera Event.  Perfect, I highly recommend this electric razor.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Norelco put out a really good product with this shaver. Your face gets a really smooth shave. I&#x27;m very happy. A great product that wasn&#x27;t expensive.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> it took a lots of time to shave with it .&lt;br /&gt;philips electric shaver sure looks cool but the blades make it hard to use .&lt;br /&gt;i would rather buy one straight blade shaver than three blades .&lt;br /&gt;Oh the big thing battery SUCKS ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;never full charged , have to charge the day before u use it .</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this model appeared in so many stores. With the rebate, the cost is too low to believe considering its quality.</li>
    <li> I purchase one of these shavers every 2 years. It&#x27;s less expensive to purchase the whole shaver than a new head. I use this as a back up when I want to shave but I&#x27;m not going to work or have a date. It&#x27;s also good for a touch up in the evening. I have owned many electric shavers of all the leading brands. They are all the same regarding the shave they deliver. It does an OK job but not like a blade. The trimmer works fine.I feel the best feature is being able to clean it under hot water without taking it apart. I use it around 2-3 times per week. It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> I had a Philips with 2 shaving heads and after 12 years of almost daily use it needed replacing. The 2 headed model worked for me but I discovered that the only one they still make with 2 heads runs on batteries so I decided to go for the 3-headed 7310 based mainly on the reviews here.    One reason I choose electric shavers is because when I wet-shave in the morning the evening stubble is really like sandpaper and I get complaints from my significant other when we become cuddly. An electric shaver uses a different cutting style so the after-eight stubble is acceptable and I don&#x27;t get sent out for an evening shave.    Well I have been trying this shaver for a while and I can only repeat the many positive comments here: great shave, quiet, quick etcetera    And I live in Holland, the home-base of Philips and the best price here for the 7310 is 59 euro&#x27;s, that is about 88 usd so my advice to my US based shaving friends would be at your price levels not to buy just one but to get a spare or two as well!</li>
    <li> I read some reviews here and purchased this razor, I feel it shaves as well as my more expensive   Norelco which was not up to the challenge of a puppy cutting teeth, good price free shipping no tax.</li>
    <li> It was little disappointing to see and use the shaver. I have used it for more than couple of weeks now I feel it is effective only when you have not shaved for less than three days. If you grow more hair, then this is going to be painful to shave. I also found it is quite difficult for cleaning.</li>
    <li> When reading a razor review you should know about the beard of the reviewer! After a close shave, it takes me 36 hours to grow a \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot;. I never much liked electric razors, but always wanted to. So, I have tried several over the years (I am 60 - so a lot of years and razors). This is the FIRST RAZOR I HAVE ACTUALLY LIKED (and I like it a lot). It gives a nice comfortable close shave and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The battery in my Panasonic ES8152 finally died after buying it here in 2005. It didn&#x27;t hold a charge well compared to the Norelco 7310XL.  I might have gotten to shave 2-3 times at best in 2 weeks time before it would need another charge.  I&#x27;ve already shaved several times with this shaver and haven&#x27;t yet needed to charge it.  My old Panasonic was loud, but this is quiet.  My old Panasonic gave a nice close shave, while this shaver is somewhat decent.  I would NOT say it \\&quot;lifts and cuts\\&quot;, though the motor speed is so slow I need to shave at least twice a week or else the hairs will pull. My old Panasonic would start pulling after a week of no shaving, but still not as bad.  Not enough notification of power with this new shaver, while my old Panasonic had probably 5 levels of charge (though it became less accurate over the years).  If it would have been enough to just replace the battery of my Panasonic, I would have, but the circuit is toast too.  For the money (gotten on sale), this shaver is acceptable (for now).</li>
    <li> Have been using this a few weeks now and love it.  I have very sensitive skin and seem to always cut my face with a razor no matter what kind I use or how gentle I am.  This shaver is not loud (my travel one is very loud), it&#x27;s super easy to clean and the charge holds for 2-3 weeks.  Even if I had to replace this shaver once a year it is so worth it.  Oh, and it&#x27;s very light as well.  Highly recommended.  Be sure to use an aftershave or lotion when finished.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver, so I don&#x27;t have much of a frame of reference. I use it mostly as a head shaver, occasionally for beard. The closeness of beard shave is better than I expected from an electric. As a head shaver it&#x27;s great! Cleaning is clumsy. When you tap the head to clear it, it often falls off from the body of the shaver. It is also not unusual for the retaining rings holding the cutters to pop, requiring re-assembly. For $100 I would give it 3 stars, but for less than $50, a strong ****!</li>
    <li> I have tried at least 3 different electric shavers and this one is by far the best! It Cuts the closest and the seams to have more power then other shavers I have tried. You can even hear that it is cutting more hair then other two shavers I have. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  These razors will perform very well if directions are followed.  Follow battery charging instructions to the letter and you will be happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two Norelco Triple-header shavers prior to this purchase. I&#x27;ve always liked them, but there was always one feature I wished they had had. Now this shaver does: a rinse-able head that stays attached to the razor, and allows cleaning under running water. Perfect! Now I have, for me, the perfect cordless shaver. I&#x27;d also like to say that the razor gave me a perfect, and comfortable shave the very first time, in spite of the three week wait disclaimer. I have to admit I have a relatively light beard, but none the less it was a fast, close, comfortable shave. I am very, very pleased, and I think for the price this is a great shaver. I can&#x27;t address charging times, or number of shaves per charge as the shaver is too new to me, but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Good enough for the price, i.e., not up to the quality of higher price electric razors</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an ancient Norelco electric - plug in the wall type - before batteries type - which had razors that&#x27;d never been replaced in ten years&#x27; use. You would have thought I&#x27;d be overjoyed? I was when i found out the volume level of the motors in more modern devices is about 1/3rd that of the old ones. That&#x27;s where the happiness ended. I was dubious about why you&#x27;d want a battery - I mean - the hell? Why make a device that will intentionally become 100% worthless within a few years instead of lasting perhaps as many as 20 if I wanted it to? Old electric shavers with ancient blades still work pretty good to my standard...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow the deal breaker that made me stop using this sucker within 2 months and switch back? The mechanism to open it up and empty out the shavings inside is so idiotically designed that every time I would travel no matter how careful I was it would get popped open in my vanity bag and leak hair EVERYWHERE. Like putting a hair toothbrush in your mouth? Old shaver never did anything of the sort, and old shaver would never leak even if full of hair. I&#x27;m not used to this new age of emptying the hair constantly, I used to do it monthly or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;New&amp;#34; technology, a huge step backwards.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my dad &amp; he loves the shaver.  It works extremely well &amp; needs charging about once a week.  Highly recommend this product.  Amazon shipped on time &amp; it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my fiance, for Christmas, and he loved it.  This is a really good product, however, according to my fiance, it does not shave the \\&quot;hard to reach places\\&quot; (between the neck and the jawline) as well as it claims.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a great shaver.  Would definitely recommend it to people looking for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Got it for Christmas, Works better than more expensive razors I&#x27;ve had in the past. Best value. I&#x27;ve followed the charging instructions and use it 1-2 times a week, only had to charge it 3 times in the last 7 months. The trick is charge till full, and don&#x27;t charge till dead. This is the best practice for all rechargeable batteries/devices. For 30 bucks I think its an absolute steal.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a deal in walmart with very reasonable price.But this is NOT good as I thought. It is very irritating when you use at neck region. Like said in the instructions I used it for 3 weeks to see the results.Its still the same so I returned it. I would not recommend this to a friend. Thanks</li>
    <li> Electric razor is cheap, good, much better than 20 year old Norelco it replaced. It gives a close shave, rarely needs to be recharged.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver, bought another brand earlier this year &amp; absolutely hated it. The old one was hard to clean &amp; put back together, this model is much easier to clean &amp; even shaves closer than the fancy one I got rid of.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m comparing the 7310XL to my old 7110X.  The 7310 has more blades in its cutting head than the 7110.  So in short, I find I get a better shave.    But a better shave isn&#x27;t everything.  The blade guards on the 7110 seem to be of heavier, more refined construction than the 7310.  So my old razor gave a more comfortable shave.  I often found, however, that by the weekend I was ready for a razor shave.  That may still be the case with the 7310 (new blades aways give a better shave that old ones); I guess I&#x27;ll find that out later.    One important note for travellers: Norelco no longer packages a case with the 7310.  I guess that helps hold down costs, but it still means no case.  If you have an old razor (like the 7110) the physical dimensions of the two razors are identical, so the 7110 case will work perfectly for the 7310.    Lastly, my first razor was defective.  For the very first time I needed to return something to Amazon.  I went on line and printed the prepaid return label.  On the day I mailed the defective razor, I found the replacement at my doorstep.  Brava, Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have had in a long time.  I usually only buy Norelco for the consistent quality of cut.  For some reason this one cuts better than the expensive ones.  I am throwing out all of my old razors and buying two more.  One for my son and one for a backup.</li>
    <li> This is my first try at an electric shaver and I am definitely satisfied. The shave is not as close as a razor but the convenience is great. For my minimal facial hair this shaver does very well, i had to figure out the tricks to using it but after two weeks i&#x27;ve definitely got it down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this shaver.  It shaves fairly close.  It holds a charge well.  Mostly, I like that you can rinse it with water and not worry about ruining it.</li>
    <li> My razor was a norelco which was getting shorter life from a battery charge. It also needed to have new heads. The cost of new heads and a new battery makes it a no brainer for the difference jst dictates that the new razor is the thing to do. Amazon shipment was prompt and completely satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I got this item for $17.97. If you are everyday shaver (unlike me) this is the right product for you. It shaves fast and without pain. Charge drains sooner than what it advertised for.</li>
    <li> The razor gives a close shave, is comfortable, quiet, lightweight, and I like the fact that I can clean it out by rinsing it in water. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re buying a headache, as it is a pain to clean.</li>
    <li> I charged the razor and then unplugged it to see how long the charge would last.  It lasted over a week without a charge and it cut really well.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be. Have to do a couple of passes on my face.</li>
    <li> I was always skeptical about electric razors, since i have been using the traditional Gillete brand and fusion line and I always was just okay with it, wasn&#x27;t too happy since it became a routine of wet face, shaving cream and cut myself. I dont get much facial hair anyways, so I never bothered to go above and beyond the traditional razor.  However, once the sales hit this black friday, I was excited to see a Norelco for such an awesome price, so I figured I give it a try since i got gift cards and man, let me tell you I love this thing and from the trusted brand of electric razors too! Now i was a bit let down since the first couple of weeks it didnt cut as close or I was getting used to it. The instructions said it should take about 2 1/2 weeks to get used to it and I have loved it ever since. Its much more convienent and it eliminates the hassle for the shaving cream, so that saves some money there and the more you get used to it, you can shave in less than 3 mins. with a clear freash face. I highly recommend it, and I might upgrade the model in about 3-5 years depending on how long it lasts and judging by other reviews, this will last.</li>
    <li> My review is a mistake, please delete it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it Nov 2011. It&#x27;s now June 2012, but I have not received any news about the rebate which attracted me to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Phillips Norelco no longer produces this model shaver.  You are likely to find it on sale because it is discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I had mine for two months, then in the middle of a shave, it simply stopped working.  I can tell it wants to -- the heads attempt to turn -- but the razor simply wasn&#x27;t getting enough power to keep them turning.  (For the record, it shaved decently well for me when it was working.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My call to Phillips Norelco customer support was handled very effectively.  They agreed to replace it with a PT720, a model currently in production as of this writing, as long as I sent back the defective 7310XL and charger upon receipt, which I will.  (NOTE:  Check reviews of the PT720 -- One review says it doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer.  The 7310XL does.  So that is a difference, but I don&#x27;t use the trimmer much anyway &amp; so it wasn&#x27;t important to me.)</li>
    <li> I bought this philips norelco about a year ago.  Still working great.  Absoutely no compliants about this item.  i would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Feels good in hand. Quiet with long time battery. Would recommend friends to buy it.    Hope it can be cheaper as it is only a shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver does everything it&#x27;s advertised to be. Shaves comfortably and close. Best shaver I&#x27;ve used. Would     recommend this.Like the water rinsability for cleaning this shaver. Pros: Shaves quickly, close and comfortably.     Cons:none.</li>
    <li> awesome deal, better than anything I have every bought at any store, the shave is close like a razor and efficient, would highly recommend...</li>
    <li> Actually quite light weight.  Charges and functions just fine. Shaves without too much pulling BUT not quite as good as my old Norelco that uses Series 7 (Lift and Cut) heads. The older Norelco has both slots and holes in the head design.  This one has slots only.  Bought this one because didn&#x27;t want to pay nearly the same price for new heads on my old shaver. Even tried sharpening old heads .... FORGET IT; unless your&#x27;re into being plucked like a chicken.  Anyway, this 7310XL is a reasonably decent shaver for the price.  Yet must disclose I finally ended up buying replacement heads for the old Quadra which I like better because it&#x27;s a smoother shave.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Very quiet and smooth on the face. So far, so good</li>
    <li> Nice razor for the price,close shave,real quiet.Would be nice if it had a charge indicator.Does not come with a travel pouch which I think is awful cheap of Norelco</li>
    <li> good product! good price! I will recommand my friends to buy it and I will buy them more to send to other counrties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am still waiting for the rebate I have submitted two months ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a razor and foam most of my life and was skeptical about an electric razor.  It lives up to it&#x27;s close shave claims.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving, Nair barely works, waxing is too messy, and I was unimpressed with a women&#x27;s foil shaver I tried a number of years ago. I looked all over for information about women using men&#x27;s shavers, and was largely unsuccessful. But I decided to give this shaver a shot, mostly because of the low cost and decent rating.  This shaver turned out to be an excellent decision. Pros and cons are as follows:  PRO:  1. Can be used while plugged in, so there are no worries about the battery dying while shaving a large area.  2. Does not have to be used in the shower, which allows one to save the cost of heating water, and also allows one to get into a more comfortable position while shaving difficult areas.  3. Very close shave. I was not impressed the first time, after shaving 3 weeks (!) worth of hair off my legs. Subsequent shaves were as close and smooth as if I used a razor.  4. Not noisy. It doesn&#x27;t sound like I&#x27;m using a cheap vibrator while I shave my legs!   5. Significantly cheaper than regularly purchasing overpriced razors.  CON:  1. Takes a little bit longer than using a regular razor - maybe an extra 10 minutes. I don&#x27;t mind, though, as I can shave anytime, rather than just when I&#x27;m already taking a shower.  2. Misses little hairs here and there. It&#x27;s not like a razor, and it does require going over certain areas a couple of times to get all the hair.  I also shave my arms, and for some odd reason, this does not perform nearly as well on arms as it does on legs. But shaving my arms is not as big a hassle in the shower, so it&#x27;s not an issue that affects my opinion of this product.</li>
    <li> That is a really cool shaver. I bought this as a gift to sent my father, he really like it.&lt;br /&gt;Compare with the previous one, my father got more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I found the norelco shaver to be quite useful when you just didn&#x27;t want to get out the shaving cream and razor, the electric shaver does what its suppose to do but I guess I am spoiled and expected a closer shave as in a razor, maybe it takes time to get use to an electric shaver and then I may get a handle on it better as I get use to it, but its a good product and I would tell my friends this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace an older Braun.  After reading many reviews I thought the Norelco 7310 would be close to what a razor could deliver.  It doesn&#x27;t.  If a razor would be 100% close shave this comes in at about 75% for me.  It gets me by but when I want a close shave I still use a razor.</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco I have had. It is also the cheapest and the best performing Of all of them.</li>
    <li> I had one before but lost when I traveled oversea. It&#x27;s very light weighted to carry. The battery can last for 1 week at least. Very good for business travelers.</li>
    <li> It does the job and priced right! If you are looking for a nice shaver that does not cost too much money. This is the one!</li>
    <li> First, it works well. Quick and clean. The head is somewhat flexible. So it fits the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it&#x27;s washable. Easy to make it clean. Nothing to complain. Just great.&lt;br /&gt;The charger works for 110-240 volts. So you can take it to Europe.&lt;br /&gt;And good price. I just dumped my old philips.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t know is how long the battery will last. It comes with some juice so I have not charged it yet.</li>
    <li> After using a cheaper Norelco 6000 series shaver for the last five years, I am so glad I upgraded to this model! It is much lighter and quieter, but most importantly, it gives me the closest shave since my old Advantage shaver broke -- no more shaving the same area multiple times. Rinsing with hot water is so much better than trying to clean with a brush. The only thing it lacks is a travel or carrying case.</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these before returning to manual razors. It can potentially save you some money if you use Mach-3 replacement heads,  but this thing wears like no tomorrow if you need to shave every-day like I do. It&#x27;s good as a temporary thing, or introduction to electric razors, but don&#x27;t expect to have it for more than 3 months without the blades getting rather dull. It doesn&#x27;t shave very close, either often leaving trace stubbles which can annoy someone who gets a neck-beard and is required to wear a tie.</li>
    <li> I used this razor once. It did not shave well, leaving patches here and there on my face, but it did scratch up my face and leave with me a neck rash that lasted for 3 days.  It was such a painful experience that I immediately packed it up and shipped it back.  I just hope Amazon gives me a full refund for this awful razor.</li>
    <li> I have had the Norelco 7310XL for a few weeks now, and overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.  The shaver has good and not so good points, so let&#x27;s look at them.    Pros:    Very good shaving results on the relatively smooth, unobstructed parts of my face.  Cheeks, chin and the neck are where this shaver shines.  Just press lightly and move the shaver in a circular motion for a very close, quick and comfortable shave.    Light weight and very quiet in operation.  Much quieter than my old Braun shaver.    Good battery life.  Looks like the shaver will need a recharge no more than once per week.    The recharging cord is long enough to allow you to use this as a corded shaver while it is recharging.  That&#x27;s a real convenience if you are in a hurry and find that your shaver battery is dead.    Easy to clean.  Just pop the top open, and rinse with hot water.    Cons:    The ergonomics of the shaving head leave a lot to be desired.  The shaving head is big and bulky, and that makes it very awkward when you are trying to shave relatively small areas like your upper lip.  This is the major drawback of this Norelco (and probably all rotary-type shavers), and I still often use my old Braun foil-type shaver on my lip.    You must follow Norelco&#x27;s instructions EXACTLY when shaving tender areas, such as your neck.  Specifically, do not press the shaver too hard against your skin.  If you do, you will be rewarded with Olympic-size skin irritation.  I can personally vouch for the truth of this statement.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;    I bought this shaver when my old Braun Free Control 1775 shaver began to show signs of needing a replacement shaving head, and I found that the price of the shaving head was too close to the price of a complete new shaver.  So, I thought I would try this Norelco, which is in approximately the same price range as my Braun.  i.e.  They are both on the cheap end of their product lines.    The bottom line on this Norelco is that it does some things reallywell, like shaving my cheeks and neck.  It does these areas better and more quickly than my Braun foil-type shaver.  But, the Norelco does some things badly, like shaving my upper lip.  The Braun 1775 shaver&#x27;s head gets into tight areas much better, but shaving is slower and noisier overall with the Braun.    The real issue here is probably whether you like rotary or foil-type shavers.  Both can be very good, but only at some aspects of shaving your face.  As far at this particular Norelco goes, it seems to be a pretty good representative of the rotary type of shaver.  If you like rotary shavers, this Norelco is probably as good as any.    Whatever faults this Norelco may have seem to be common to all rotary shavers, and not because of any defect in this particular model.  So, don&#x27;t throw your money at the more expensive Norelcos, thinking that they will be better.  You won&#x27;t change the nature of the beast, you will just be getting a nicer looking beast with more bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> received razor in record time and have been using since its arrival.  it performs very well and is as advertised.</li>
    <li> Motor seems to run slow, Blades may be dull.. All I know is it feels like it&#x27;s yanking the hair rather than cutting it.  Norelco made a decent shaver in the past but this one is so bad, I would send it back itf it were worth the time.  Very Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This razor works great. A much closer shave than my last razor. My only complaint is the quality and size of the expendable trimmer on the back of it. It is small compared to others and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. So I just use my old one for the trimmer and my new one to shave.</li>
    <li> This razor is completely gutless. i charged it fully and it tore out just as much hair as it cut. i am not very happy but i guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> The 7310 XL is my 5th Norelco shaver. I really like the washable shaving heads. Taking the thing apart and cleaning it has always been a hassle as far as I am concerned. As for my dislikes---This shaver does not hold a charge very long. I am lucky to get 7 shaves on one charge. My previous Norelco would hold a charge from 20-22 shaves. It was priced the same as the 7310 XL. I noticed my new shaver was manufactured in China. Is Norelco cutting corners on the quality? Maybe I am wrong, but I think they are. My previous shavers were made of better quality materials. The 7310 XL is made of very light materials and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sturdy. I would like to have one of the more expensive Norelcos, but I can&#x27;t afford one. My biggest gripe of all is the cost involved in replacing the shaving heads. They cost almost as much as the shaver itself. Come on, Norelco. That is just plain ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  I got it mostly for my neck hair, which is very annoying to shave every day.  I haven&#x27;t used it on my face yet, as I keep a trimmed beard.  However, it does a great job on my neck.  It was uncomfortable the first time and felt irritated, but every time since then has been comfortable - which is to be expected.  It cleans easily and is a great value!</li>
    <li> Save your money. [...] bucks may be the cheapest rotary \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; shaver but it&#x27;s not even close to a blade shave. I don&#x27;t understand how people rate this thing 5 stars. They must work for Philips.     To use this shaver, you need an elec shave lubricant to roll smoothly over your skin. Material feels cheap, light and sounds underpowered. I rate it a $[...] shaver, not $[...] (on sale).     Best shave for me, Gillette twin or triple blade shaver and Cremo Creme. Anything more than a triple blade (or battery operated, vibrating blade) is overkill. And this Cremo is absolutely the best, affordable shaving cream; don&#x27;t overpay for Art of Shaving stuff.</li>
    <li> When my last Norelco was stolen from my car, I started shopping around for a replacement and found this one on sale.  Expecting it to be as good as the other ones I have bought over the years, I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for not giving it five stars is that because I keep it in my car and when it gets cold outside, the unit may fail to run until it warms up a bit.  Guess the batteries aren&#x27;t rated for cold weather...(then again, neither am I unless I bundle up...LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it gives me a close shave with no nicks or burns and just keeps on clipping between a weekly (or bi-weekly) charging.</li>
    <li> This product is inexpensive and does what it says.  The only drawback is it took my chin 1-2 weeks to get used to it.  Other products I used, which cost 5 times as much, was smoother, but I&#x27;ll toughen my skin and save the money for a week or two.</li>
    <li> I had used Norelcos since the 70&#x27;s. This is as good as any of them. Holds a charge, charges fast enough. Cuts great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it dies, I&#x27;ll just get another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need a + $100 worth of added bells and whistles, I just want to shave my face!</li>
    <li> Gives a very close shave. Hope the heads last longer than the previous Norelco. Try using a pre-shave. It is not worth it to replace the heads, so I just replaced the shaver.</li>
    <li> This is one of the elit electric razors anyone can ever buy!!! Very close shave- no cuts- awesome shaven face in the end!!!!!! can be used for 8 hours after full charge! Only drawback is cleaning once a month ;)</li>
    <li> I bought it only $18, it is so cheap and high quality.  like it very much  i will be always your customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Norelco shavers but the 7310 is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever owned. The motor speed seems very slow. Even after many passes I still don&#x27;t get a decent shave. Looking at the other reviews I&#x27;m wondering if Norelco didn&#x27;t have a problem with the production line or motor vendor. What ever the cause, the one I bought is not up to the standards we&#x27;ve come to expect from Norelco. Battery life is good.</li>
    <li> I buy a new shaver about every five years or until the battery&#x27;s quit recharging,anyway this shaver is very nice,and seems to shave closer than my last one,matter of fact,every time i buy a new shaver,they always seem to be a little better than the last,so the price was good and i bought it, i like norelco,always have,always will....good night everybody, it&#x27;s been real</li>
    <li> I love this product it is awesome it feels good, is a good brand, it&#x27;s heavy, and strong, it shaves pretty well and also it&#x27;s waterproof. and the price awesome i got it on black friday deal ;)</li>
    <li> The unit itself works great.  The shave is so clean and close.  Too bad that since i´ve replaced the blades I haven´t been able to get the same precision cut as the original blades.</li>
    <li> Shaver is great for the price but does not shave as close as some of the reviews suggest.I use it just about every day and have only charged it once in the last month.I also like after using,I just rinse with warm water and it is ready for my next shave.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Norelco 9160XL for 8 years. It was acting sluggish, so I thought I would get another XL (7310xl). I saw the good reviews and some bad reviews having to do with cuts and nicks. I decided to ignore the bad reviews.  After trying this product out for 2 weeks I had to give up. I was tired of the biting and stinging by a shaver even with pre shave. It was very slow going to shave. My older shaver is much better. I had to return instead of wasting my time. This is the first time I ever returned anything to Amazon and it cost me 6 bucks to get a refund. Well worth it. Phillips/Norelco must have really decided to lower their quality standards these past yrs.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd one of these I have bought.  The other 2 are still working great and are being used by my sons.  I bought this to replace a more expensive model that is slowly dying.  There is really no need to pay more for a shaver, as this one pretty much does everything you need and provides a very close shave.  Highly recommended and excellent price without all the unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> All I can say is this has no power so is useless for cutting wiskers.  I bought it as a gift for my husband and he hated it so I will be looking for something better.</li>
    <li> Very good machine I use daily thank you</li>
    <li> Lower speed or power leads to longer shave times and more pulling on the face.  Not a good thing.  I have used electrics since teens and am a light bearded, senior citizen now.  This Norelco and th last one have very low power I quickly noticed and even took the other one back to store.  They confided that it is what it is!    Bought this thinking I was going to hear the high speed buzz...what a disappointment. OK, maybe it is going at the same speed; but, why isn&#x27;t it shaving close and why the pulling at my face and neck like the last one?  Go to a store and try them all ,I say , to get the one right for you.  No more Norelco&#x27;s for me.  And don&#x27;t even think of it if you have a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I always wanted to buyy one shaver. Read about Wahl, Remington, etc products. I didnt choose Wahl, as reviews were like It was tooo goood but some years back, the quality is distorted now.. Remington - Everybody was cribbing about it, so my hand was away from it. Philips - People were interested in it due to its prize and features. Nobody was complaining about it ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So finally, I chose Philips Norelco 7310XL. My personal review on the product is - Shaving really becomes simple when you have an automatic shaver system like this. Device is good, light weight, easy to use. Cleaning is very simple- just wash it with water and dry it up.&lt;br /&gt;When I use it, skin becomes clean and glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives - Slights one though - Doesnt clean the skin completely though, You may have to use conventional razor on few areas. It is not good for trimming. Sometimes it grabs the skin or hair in an irritating way but I guess this must be happening in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - It is good. People say , you may return it. But who is gonna take all that pain, frankly. So I am retaining it. It looks good and sophisticated. Cuts clean, charges nice. Just few negatives but overall not bad and not extraordinarilly good too.</li>
    <li> I ordered a Norelco Model 7310/XL shaver and received an older model 7310. I requested a replacement and returned the original shaver. However, the replacement was also a 7310 so I returned THAT ONE for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my severely disabled son. He has very sensitive skin and I have been having a hard time finding something that gets pretty close and yet doesn&#x27;t make him all red.  This shaver is the best I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This is a basic shaver, not the best color, but very inexpensive when on sale.  Does a good job similar to all 73xx series that cost a lot more.    Pro:  Battery lasts at least one week to 10 days before needing a charge.  Can be washed under running water which helps with cleanup.  Quiet.  Very good price.  Con:  Color?</li>
    <li> I bought this Norelco 7310 because it was on sale for a fantastic price (paid under $20 for it) to replace an old Norelco that could not hold a charge any longer. It&#x27;s a nice shaver for being so inexpensive, but it lacks some of the features such as sensitivity or speed adjustments like my old Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> After FINALLY receiving the shaver, my husband loves it. It&#x27;s a great shaver so far.  My only complaint is that Amazon had this listed as \\&quot;In stock\\&quot; when it wasn&#x27;t, and they beat around the bush when I kept asking where it was.</li>
    <li> For context, I&#x27;m a long-time Norelco electric shaver user--like 14 years--and they&#x27;re all I really use. This one took me about 4-5 shaves before my face got used to it, which is surprising since I never need time to get used to other shavers (like when I&#x27;ve tried my dad&#x27;s or my brother&#x27;s). At first I thought I&#x27;d made a mistake in buying it because it was tad rough on my face and didn&#x27;t get very close, but now I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as most of the electric shavers I&#x27;ve used, but only by a small margin, and it gets close enough. I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at like 2pm, but I don&#x27;t mind and I still look clean enough for a professional business look. I sort of figured out how my face works best with it, like going a little slower, and it does a pretty good job. For the money, I feel like it&#x27;s a pretty good deal. Fit and finish seems solid, and I especially was sold when I found out I could plug it in and use it immediately if the battery dies, unlike my old one that left me stranded. That was one feature my new shaver had to have. About the battery: I ran the charge it came with dead, then charged it overnight for 8 hrs. I used it every morning for at least 8 days and it just died on me for the first time (I plugged in a finished up). That&#x27;s a really good battery, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this shaver. Philips Norelco 7310.  For the price it can&#x27;t be beat..  recommend  this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> I swore I&#x27;d never buy a Philips again, but here I am, using one at least once a week, after finding one over Christmas at a good price. While it works reasonably well, it has a few serious defects. The back cuts pretty well, though it can leave the skin a bit more sore than other heavy groomers. The main head, though, just can&#x27;t seem to do a good job of totally removing already-trimmed, just-washed hair; no matter how many times I go over my skin I&#x27;ll always find some hairs remaining, especially near the adam&#x27;s apple or the nostrils. Whether my hair is dry or damp, it just can&#x27;t seem to cut evenly. It does, however, do a much better job than my previous shaver, giving an extremely close shave that lasts for a couple of days (complete with some razor burn), which I would expect for the higher price... I just didn&#x27;t realize it would only go from 60 to 90% coverage, not 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is very easy to maintain, and really hardly needs any maintenance except emptying. It would be nice if it showed you a battery level or even a warning as it&#x27;s getting low when you first turn it on, but instead you just have to wait until it stops working and start charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: While the clippers in the back are still going strong, the blades on the head are soft and only seem to last 20 uses or so before starting to dull; over the next 40-50 uses it gets to the point where hardly anything is done at all, and it tends to grab instead of cut, leading to more burn and redness. I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair, maybe medium thickness, so you might get half or double depending on your hair.</li>
    <li> Amazon had a great deal on this shaver so I decided to give it a try. My first electric shaver (from many years ago) was a Norelco rotary head. I used it for many years before eventually switching to a straight blade razor to get a closer shave. I have somewhat sensitive skin so I get easily irritated if I use a straight razor every day. Hence, about 10 years ago I started using an electric shaver every other day and a regular straight razor with shaving cream on the days in between. (This eliminated the problems I was experiencing.)  I have owned and tried many different electric razors over my 30+ years of shaving and have never encountered one that shaves as close as a straight razor with shaving cream. This makes sense if you think about it because with an electric razor there is always some kind of &#x27;guard&#x27; between the blades and the skin. With a regular straight razor the blade is riding right on your skin. Anybody expecting an electric razor to shave as close as a blade is in for a disappointment -- and the Norelco 7310 is no different. Hence, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a close shave, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good of a shave I did get! My beard is not very thick (medium density), but the hairs are very coarse and tough. I&#x27;ve only been using the 7310 for a few weeks now, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been having any problems cutting through my hair.  As mentioned previously, I have somewhat sensitive skin. And the one problem I did have with the 7310 -- and something I forgot when using my previous Norelco rotary head razor -- is that it gives me razor burn on my neck. (I don&#x27;t get razor burn if I use a foil-type electric razor.) I then remembered a trick I learned with using my original Norelco: Always shave the neck are first and do not spend too much time on it.  All things considered, I am very satisfied with this razor and think it performs excellent considering the purchase price.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this shaver for about four months.  I had a Braun (foil) self-cleaning system, but got fed up with constantly buying the cartridges for it.  I read reviews on various types and brands of razors and decided to try this one.  This shaver blows my Braun away for many reasons! 1) No more buying cleaning cartridges that I had to replace appx. every 30 days @ $6 a pop (with the Philips/Norelco I simply push a tab to open the head and flush with warm tap water) 2) It is so quiet! 3) I have more space on the vanity because I no longer have that big cleaning/charging base that I had with my old shaver, now I can keep the razor in a drawer. 3) Recharging the battery is easy, once a week I plug it in to the charger and 2-3 hrs. later I&#x27;m good for another 7 days of cordless shaving. 4) For the price I paid for the Braun, I could&#x27;ve bought 3 or 4 of these (not that I would, so far it has been flawless). 5) Last, and most important, THE SHAVE IS GREAT!! I&#x27;ve been shaving for 40 plus years, tried many razors and this is by far the best.  Very comforatable, no pulling sensation, very smooth feeling on the face and neck.  I was very pleased after the first use. The shave was as close, if not closer, than a razor blade/lotion combo. Will not go back to anything else!!</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver on December 26 and worked really well until February 20 or so - when it would no longer charge and did not even work plugged in.     Pretty good,huh.    I knew when it arrived, it was cheap and probably reflects the price. But, really, a safety razor could last almost this long.    Needless to say, disappointed.    I remember with nostalgia the old ones that were heavy, made of metal, and lasted for years - probably made by union employees in New Jersey instead of slave labor in China ...........but those days are gone.    Oh that&#x27;s right - we don&#x27;t have unions anymore. Ah, who needs em anyway.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my husband January, 2011.  I believed the Norelco name was good enough to not bother to check it out further.  Boy was I mistaken.  This razor has absolutely NO power even when used plugged in.  Husband does not have a thick beard but he has to go over and over the same area so much EVERY TIME that he ends up with bad razor burn.  We will be returning this product to the store and will NOT purchase another Norelco.</li>
    <li> Awesome just received this product yesterday, charged it up and used it today, it&#x27;s quiet enough and it&#x27;s a newer style than I have been using for the past 4 years ( a norelco reflex plus). Instead of buying replacement blades I upgraded to a sportier style and am looking forward to using this for years to come. Thanks Norelco and keep up the good work</li>
    <li> I have another Norelco for home &amp; this one replaced an older travel shaver that had given up the ghost.  It is just what I wanted. Price was right; sale and delivery were quick and efficient.    Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it all she&#x27;s got Captain!!! This is a nice starter razor, but it needs more power!!! It gives a nice clean shave(seems to work better wet), but it takes forever!!! I would recommend buying the more elite model and wish I had.   PROS: cleans up easily, lightweight, works with or without cord, shaves wet or dry  CONS: sluggish not enough power, takes forever to get a clean shave    Recommend for someones first electric shaver, but suggest that you go to a better Norelco model!!!</li>
    <li> While this razor works well for 1-2 days worth of stubble, forget about it if you&#x27;re on day 3 or more... the lack of power in this unit makes it only pull and pull, instead of spin and slice. Ouch!</li>
    <li> Yeah this is probably the best electric shaver under $50. I had an old Norelco that looks just like this one, and this is waaaay better. Not nearly as good as some of the Panasonic/Braun shavers that have the cleaning dock, but this is still way faster than shaving with a razor. College special.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th electric shaver that I have owned and the 2nd rotary type.  I have owned the top of the line shaver from Panasonic, as well as mid-range units from Braun and Remington.      The same thing has happened every time in the past.  I give it two to three months and then I am back to a disposable razor that can shave closer, with less hassle, and less irritation.  The number one reason each time for going back to a disposable was how the electric shaver failed to handle my neck hair.  None of them seemed to be able to the job no matter what and then the hassle on the units I had that had an expensive cleaning unit made it a pain to use.    Well I got the bug again to try an electric razor one more time and ended up purchasing this unit.  And now after having it for a while I have to say that this is the best electric shaver that I have had.  First and foremost it can handle my neck.  It can&#x27;t get it all in one pass, but the others couldn&#x27;t do it no matter how many times I tried!  Second, being able to just rinse the head under the sink is wonderful.  No more cleaning systems that are bulky and expensive with the continual cost of the cleaning solution.  Third, is that it is a surprisingly close shave. I kind of expected a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by noon with a rotary shaver, but that isn&#x27;t the case here.  It is very close to a shave with a razor, NO KIDDING!    It isn&#x27;t the perfect electric razor, but it is more than worth the price.  There are only two things that stick out with me that could have been done better and both are related to charging.  First, it takes 8 hours to charge the unit from being almost dead, with no quick charge capabilities.  You can get around it by just using it plugged in when you are in the middle of the charge.  Second, is that there is no battery level indicator.  It would be nice to have some sort of idea of how much of a charge you have left.    In my book, these are just two minor issues that aren&#x27;t that important to me, but keepme from giving it 5 stars.  I have and will continue to recommend this unit to friends.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THIS FOR OVER A MONTH &amp; USE IT EVERY DAY....ITS THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER HAD......THIS PHILLIPS/NORELCO ELECTRIC RAZOR IS THE BEST.</li>
    <li> I write this review for all men who are considering an electric razor but have not yet purchased one due to confusing and contradictory on line reviews.    First the basics:  Purchased from Amazon.  As usual, excellent customer service.  The razor comes in a blister pack that should include a warning label about how opening the package will result in severe finger cuts and massive blood loss.    I have a light beard.  I don&#x27;t get a 5:00 shadow; mine is like a 2:30 shadow. I use electric razors 98% of the time, choosing a disposable only when I am too lazy to shave and I end up with a 5 day growth that is more easily tamed with a disposable.    The Norelco 7310 is very different from the old rotary it replaces.  The 7310 is feather light due to extensive use of plastics and it makes much less noise.  No coiled cord; the recharging cable (like a cell phone charger) may be used to shave off AC if the battery has run down.  After one week of use I am still using the razor off of the initial charge.    My old Norelco could not do a good job on some \\&quot;immature hairs\\&quot; on my neck.  After use, I usually used a straight razor to dispose of this growth.  The 7310, much to my surprise, does a perfect job on the beard and the neck.  I would say that my morning shave now takes less than two minutes.    Hints:  I always use Williams Lectric shave prior to shaving and I have to stretch my skin slightly to help the razor glide over the beard.  The first two times I used the 7310 I felt some slight irritation on my neck after shaving. By the third day the irritation was gone. The manual states it takes some time for your face to adjust to the razor.  They are correct.    The 7310 comes with a two year warrantee. I suspect the unit will not last as long as my old one, but that seems to be true of all products today.      For the price, this was an excellent purchase.  I can&#x27;t see how spending more money would get me a better shave.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Very close and comfortable shave  Excellent sideburn trimmer  Good battery life  Charge completed flashing LED&#x27;s  Price is right if . . .    Cons:  No battery status indication, none expected  Tacky colors    I&#x27;ve been shaving for over forty years, mostly electric and mostly Norelco. For 3-months I had a Remington R450, see my review, huge dissapointment. Every couple of years Norelco tries to come up with a new gimmick to get us to purchase the latest and greatest. Thing is that Norelco got it right 30-years ago. The cutters and combs in the 7310 are the essence of that technology and if you can spin the cutters you&#x27;ll have a close shave. All the other Whistles &amp; Bells are just fluff.    Norelco claims 10 days of cordless shaving on a 8-hour charge. The charge full indicator started flashing at 2-hours, done. I went 9-days and wondered how much longer, on the tenth day the motor started slowing down and it quit halfway through the eleventh day. By stretching the battery after the first charge/discharge I was able to get 12-days, well actually 11.9-days, could have used another minute of shaving. I stretch a NiCd by running the battery dead with the cutters flipped open for the lowest motor load. Pretty impressive for a single AA NiCd battery.    People claim this is a good/great budget shaver. Nonsense, this is a excellent cordless shaver that can be had at a budget price. I got mine from the big W for thirty-one to my PO Box. It came in the full retail blister pack. By the time I got it to my house, 8500-feet, I thought it was going to explode. I saw at least two retailers have it for a bit less on Black Friday. Makes you wonder what the models that cost 4-5 times as much have to offer?    So why is it ugly? Well of course beauty is in the eye of the beholder and this old eye doesn&#x27;t do black and white on a shaver, all black . . sure, all white . . probably not, all silver like my deceased 7865XL&#x27;s . . YES!!! I still gave the 7310 5-stars, I don&#x27;t see the colors while shaving. BTW, I do like the white power switch.    If you look at the photos I posted, you&#x27;ll see that the 7310 consists of a small waterproof power module encased in four cosmetic shells. It&#x27;s these shells that allow Norelco to play the silly color games at no additional cost. The sides even have rubber bonded to the shell. Turns out I shave with my thumb between the power switch and head and my fingers over the trimmer, so I don&#x27;t even feel the \\&quot;slip proof\\&quot; rubber. Where are your fingers?    So if the feature set meets your needs, don&#x27;t hesitate to get the 7310, it will deliver a comfortable close shave. As to the colors, only you can decide.</li>
    <li> I should first say that for this price, what you get is a quite decent shaver. I am a big fan of the 7310 so far. It is more precise and comfortable than the 6xxx series.It is sold as 7320 in Europe to my knowledge as just \\&quot;Philips\\&quot; no Norelco, same exact features. CVS now has it for cheaper price, including 5ECB.   Good things:  1. price  2. comfortable  3. efficient  Things to improve:  1. It seems to work only after you charge it up. That means it takes 9 hours for a fully charge.  2. a little noisy when working  3. t doesn&#x27;t shave the philtrum (nose-lip area) well  By the way, it&#x27;s 100-240V, so in any country you can use it.</li>
    <li> Razor is very light.  It projects an image of cheap!  I replaced an older Norelco that was heavier and of more substance.  Cord is not coiled and it is stiff.  Hard to store.</li>
    <li> What has impressed me most so far is that this shaver has a very long charge time and sharp blades.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver after my 15 yr old Norelco gave up the ghost.  This new one has performed well thus far.  It is lighter (more plastic)  and the charge doesn&#x27;t hold as long as the old one, but I am satisfied and recommend it to anyone needing a good electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as a Christmas present for my boyfriend who has been using a terrible electric razor for some time now. I did some pretty good research (I thought!) on various different razors in my price range, and I thought this Philips would be a great gift. Unfortunately, after just two uses my boyfriend kindly told me that he was giving up because the shave was patchy and often very painful and left his face feeling very raw. He&#x27;s never had this problem with previous razors, and since I don&#x27;t have a beard, I&#x27;m going to defer to his judgment and say that this is not a very good product. I&#x27;m returning it now and am in the market once again for a quality razor at a good price.</li>
    <li> Target stores in Miami FL sold this unit for $27.00 Last December (09)[[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> AFTER OWNING SEVERAL NORELCO ELECTRIC SHAVERS OVER THE PAST YEARS SOME COSTING $100( I AM 80 YEARS OLD ) I SAW THIS RAZOR ADVERTISED ALMOST AT A PRICE WOULD HAVE COST ME TO BUY NEW HEADS SO I SAID TO MYSELF WHY NOT TRY THIS.  GOT THE RAZOR AND IT HAS JUST ABOUT ALL FEATURES OF $100 ONE AND SHAVES ME JUST AS GOOD AND THE BATTERY STAYS CHARGED LONGER THAN THE $100 ONE, AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH IT IN EVERY WAY.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new shaver and it&#x27;s a breeze to clean under a running faucet.</li>
    <li> I paid $17 for this razor, so I can&#x27;t complain about much.  I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco razors over the past 35yrs, and they all were much higher (and more costly) models.  This less expensive model is built much cheaper (plastic everywhere), but it actually shaves like its big brothers.  It seems to me that in just the short that period I&#x27;ve owned it (2mths or so) that it has already dulled a bit.  I find myself going over and over the same area repeatedly to \\&quot;complete\\&quot; my shave.  But yes, it works...and I use it every day, currently.</li>
    <li> This shaving system is great for short bristle and for sensitive skin. Very good price and quality for that price. Men love it!</li>
    <li> The battery in my Panasonic shaver would not keep a charge any longer.  I had to toss it while I was in Nicaragua, but fortunately I had ordered this one before I left for my trip.  It took about a week and a half to receive this using Amazon&#x27;s free shipping.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like a rotary since all I have ever used is the Panasonic/Braun type shavers with the single foil all of the way across the top.  The verdict?  This shaver works great for me.  It gives me a very close shave and it is quiet with lots of torque.  I believe the quietness is because of the load speed of the blades, but it still provides plenty of torque to cut those tough hairs without pulling them.  This was a very good deal and I only give it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of battery status meter letting you know how much battery life you have left.</li>
    <li> The Norelco shaver lives up to it&#x27;s advertising.  Close shaves and comfortable.  One caution...when you disasseble the blades for cleaning...take extra care reinserting to make sure they are seated properly.</li>
    <li> I want to thank everyone who gave this shaver such a good review. I&#x27;m a woman who needs to shave my handicaped brother every day and I don&#x27;t know too much about shavers.  My parents always used   Remington Shavers to shave my brother so after my parents passed away I kept buying Remington shavers.  I did not like them too much but didn&#x27;t think anything else was better.  No matter how many times I went over the same section under his chin the hair did not come off.  When I decided to buy a new shaver I read the reviews on this Norelco and when I read that it shaved the chin hairs I bought it right away.  It&#x27;s great - everything I hoped for.  When I buy another shaver I&#x27;ll look for the same model or a similar one if this one is no longer available.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the shave I get, although it doesn&#x27;t last as long as shaving with a Gillette Fusion Power (five blades) and shaving cream.  However, it is so much less hassle with the Phillips Norelco.  I haven&#x27;t had to charge the battery a second time and I&#x27;ve used it every day for about 3 weeks.  Ergo, it&#x27;s got great battery life.[[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> Works good! I only wish that the head did not have to be replaced so often, at half the price of the whole razor.</li>
    <li> Strictly from a shaving performance point of view, this model performs as well as much more expensive Norelco shavers. I also own a Norelco 8175XL that costs 3 times as much and uses the blades advertised as having \\&quot;50% more shaving area.\\&quot;  This shaves as fast, close, and comfortable as the more expensive shavers.  If you&#x27;ve owned older Norelco shavers, you&#x27;ll be pleased by advances such as a quiet motor, lithium ion (LiOn) batteries instead of nickel cadmium (NiCad), and the ability to clean the shaver by running it under the faucet.  What it lacks is some indicator that the battery is running low.  Some reviewers have commented on the fact that it takes 10 hours to recharge, whereas more expensive Norelco&#x27;s rechage in 1 hour.  I actually prefer the slower charge.  The fast charge razors state that you should unplug the charger as soon as the charge is complete.  I find it much more convenient to plug it in either overnight or when I go to sleep, then to remember to unplug it in an hour.  Overall, a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought it during last Christmas sale for $26 and extremely happy (for a price paid).   I still use disposable Gillettes but only when I really need a cleanest shave and have time for that. Otherwise I use this one. True, it can leave some hair, especially on neck, but it&#x27;s very convenient on the go, and I like to travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for about a year now, and it&#x27;s fantastic.     As an Army man, I shave twice a day, keep my razor in my vehicle, and charge it once a week. The only time it scared me was leaving in the car when it was below freezing. If it&#x27;s very cold, the razor just needs to be warmed-up before it will start.     As a dark-haired fair-skinned man in the Army, this razor&#x27;s never let me down.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco for many years and no disappointment.  This particular one meets my needs along with a good value.</li>
    <li> Bought the product 4 month ago and to have the Norelco $10 Rebate promotion. After 4 month, received a postcard from Philips Fullfillment Center stating that they could not honor the rebate. It is ridiculous. Will not buy anything from this company again. Cheater.</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco razors before; but higher priced ones.  Not only does this model   7310 shave as well as the $100 one I just retired, it lasts longer on a charge. So if you need a new Norelco you won&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for over a month now.  Prior to that, I used an el-cheapo Norelco electric dating from the mid &#x27;90s.    The new one doesn&#x27;t even shave as close as my old one.  I get serious five-o&#x27;clock shadow now.  The only advantage is that that it doesn&#x27;t cause as much irritation on my chin and neck as my old one.    My hair is somewhat thicker than average so that might have something to do with it.    I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I selected this product to replace another Norelco shaver that I&#x27;ve had for a couple of decades.  While this product doesn&#x27;t have the heft of the old product (i.e. it feels like cheap plastic), it works just great.  It holds the charge for several days, and plugging it in once a week does the trick. It gives a nice shave.  The one negative is that the top pops open fairly easily in luggage or when haphazardly placed in my bathroom drawer.  This spills the shavings and can make a small mess.  That said, I am happy and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a four or five year old Norelco which was servicable but needed new blades again.  It would have cost me more to replace the blades than to buy this razor.  This razor works much better than the old one.  I really like the ability to rinse the razor out with water rather than use a small brush and it holds a charge for a long time.  I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price, chargable, washable, the charge lasts long, fairly clean shave&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Requires hogh number of shaving to give you a clean shave. It does not cut completely. Not capable to fairly cut hairs under the chin. No battery indicator.</li>
    <li> People suggest that the blades eventually get dull and need to be replaced.  They don&#x27;t.  They just get clogged with hair.  Push down on the yoke and remove all the blades.  Remember how they came out.  Use the included brush to get out all the hair that&#x27;s wound around the drives.  Takes about 20 minutes.  Like new!  No need to buy new blades!</li>
    <li> Have historically used Braun electirc razors but after reading the numerous reviews, and after 10 years of good use my Braun was packing up.    Am disappointed with the Philips and wish I&#x27;d stuck to the standard foil and cutting system employed by other manufactures. Not only is it more manouverable (I find the Philips Shaver Head a bit bulky) but it provided a better shave and little if any irrititation.    The Lift and Cut system of the Philips can be a little painful with the tugging, after a few days of growth. I never had this with the Braun. In addition, it shaves poorly in the neck area and gives quite a lot of irritation here.    UPDATE  I think that I was being a little kind to it at first, given that the instruction manual states that you should allow for a month for your skin to get used to it. The problem is, if you keep on using this product you won&#x27;t have any skin left on your neck!!! I am not sure how this product is so highly rated, the other reviewers are right. To sum up:  - extreme skin irritation especially the neck  - weak motor  - painful pulling    Do not waste your money on this product. I am now left with a product which I do not use. Avoid at all costs!!</li>
    <li> Having been using this for the past few months, I figured it was time to review the product.   I will break this down in a few areas that I find should be changed.    Cons:  &lt;-&gt;The Speed on the razor when using the battery is slower than it should be, so You have to take your time to prevent some pulling of the hair.   I usually shave every couple of days so you can see why I should be a bit faster or should have a way to speed it up for that really thick stubble that has grown.      &lt;-&gt;The weight of the shaver is really nice and fits just just right in my hand.  I have in the past been really clumsy, so the bigger the better.   I would like to see a way to check the battery level and so I don&#x27;t charge the battery to early, Since you have so many charges for each battery this would extend the life of the battery by charging when it is needed.    &lt;-&gt;The Cover for the blades should cover more.   The cover I have is just for the blades and should actually cover the entire front service including sides.  I find that occasionally taken off the cover makes the shaved hair department open up and that can get annoying when your in a hurry.    Now I know there are several cons but they are at least important in my mind.   I do however have a couple pro&#x27;s:    &lt;-&gt;The shaver gives a really close shave when I use it.      &lt;-&gt;The Sideburn cutter does a really good job when it comes to clipping the sideburns off.   I haven&#x27;t had any problem with that and it keeps me looking professional when it is needed.    &lt;-&gt;On a good battery, I have used this shaver off and on for several weeks without charging just would like to know the charge level before I charge it.    &lt;-&gt;I grew up with Norelco&#x27;s and every time I use one I know it is a good shaver.   I haven&#x27;t had any major problems with my shaver and would recommend it for the money price.        If your looking for a cheap shaver this is one of those that would suite you for the price and It is sturdy and dependable.  I would recommendthis to my family and friends without reservations.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe all these people are giving it 4-5 stars. I belive at least half of them are paid advertisers or are describing a different shaver.  I bought the 7310XL for a mere $30 and I feel like I&#x27;ve been ripped off. People who paid $50 have been DEFINITELY ripped off.    I&#x27;ll start with what&#x27;s good about this shaver: it can be washed, which is a great way to clean a shaver. But what does it matter when this thing does the worst job at shaving? The motor is the weakest I&#x27;ve ever seen. It feels like the motor in my 10-year-old philips when it runs out of juice, and it shaves like it has no power at all. I have to make multiple passes on every area until most of the hairs have been cut off. When I finish with this shaver, and my face is all red and hurting, I still have to use my razor or another, decent shaver, to finish the job as this shaver simply does not cut everything.    I would definitely send it back if the store I bought it from took returns. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m stuck with a useless shaver that has a children&#x27;s toy motor inside and I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking (and maybe raise my budget).</li>
    <li> This Norelco budget shaver is a dream compared to some other higher-priced brands my elderly husband tried.  As the directions and other reviewers stated, allow about three weeks to make the adjustment from safety razor to an electric shaver.  Also, if you alternate between safety razors and electric shavers, there probably won&#x27;t be a close shave with the electric shaver because the safety razor removes a thin layer of skin along with the facial hair.  So, I am really going work on motivating my husband to use only the electric shaver on a daily basis.  Electric shavers, regardless of brand, are not ideal for a close shave on hair growth of several days.    So, if you are stuck with a shaver that needs to be replaced or one that you have never really thought gave a descent shave, try this Norelco model.  It lacks all the bells and whistles and it is black and white, but it does what it is supposed to do if you follow the instructions and shaving tips enclosed.  It was packaged well with all parts accounted for; it arrived super fast, and the price was right!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product.  NO COMMENT.  Just buy it, you will be amazed</li>
    <li> I am pleased at the Norelco Razor, it is quiet and effecient.  Comfortable ant quick.  Would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco products for many years...you have to get used to the close shave. This shaver is the closest shaver I have purchased from Norelco. The price is right and I find it very easy to clean and store. The battery will be the only weak point, but so far I am getting 4-5 shaves on one charge. I would buy this shaver again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 generations of this model over the last 16 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each new model is 4 ways better and 3 ways worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs slower than my previous Norelco 6863XL. There&#x27;s no battery level indicator and it comes with no case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s *very* lightweight (6.2 oz.), has a lithium ion battery, washable head, and a few other improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wait for low tide, you can get it for 35 buckss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco would like you to buy new shaving heads every year for more money than the whole shaver costs on amazon. But the heads seem to hold up for many years, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelcos don&#x27;t shave quite as close as foil-headed reciprocating shavers, but they&#x27;re quiet, comfortable, and good at tackling 3 day&#x27;s growth and/or difficult parts of your face. The pop-out trimmer is quite useful.</li>
    <li> I have had many electric shavers, and most of them have been very good, but this one is very good in all the same ways, PLUS it is quiet,  Also, I was very pleasantly surprised at how long it held its charge the first time (I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to have to charge it a second time yet).  Interestingly, I had previously owned a Philips shaver with the three rotating cutters, and it was easily my least favorite of all the electric shavers I&#x27;ve had.  I guess I am now a believer.</li>
    <li> This model is not worth the low price unless you&#x27;re looking for a second unit for travel purposes for occasional use. The shaver is slower than my previous Norelco model which lasted over a dozen years. Yes, the 7310XL is quiet, but that&#x27;s because of the slower rpm. Slower rpms translates into a longer time shaving, and perhaps, a poorer cut.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good to get this product Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System.  working and worth price..fwwlpodeotmcxlsa  Make it fun!..reviews are fine,so that i bought this blade</li>
    <li> I always bought Norelco shavers, and it had been a while..maybe 9 years. This one is the best one ever. It can handle my no shaving for 3 days like it is a touchup. Quiet and quick, saves me lots of time. Cleaning with water...wow, what a great idea. I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> like a lot works very well. Would like the trimer to work better. gives a vert close shave and is very fast. Over all is a very good shaver.</li>
    <li> Everything is as described. It is a very good product. Good experience......I am Completely satisfied. I recommend this product to others.....!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor to replace a three year old Norelco I consider a disposable.  The razor is everything I expected from a Norelco at a very good price.  No hesitation with ordering this item from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I have had many electric shavers, this is one of my favorite. Good price and cuts hair nice. Even the neck hair other razors miss. Nice :)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for my first electric shaver but it didn&#x27;t turn out as good a product as advertised. It irritates my skin too easily. You&#x27;re better off getting a $15 triple blade razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for about one month, it runs pretty well so far, haven&#x27;t find any cons yet. The battery lasts for about 20 day shaving.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in 30 years but decided to give it a try.  Undecided due to the variety of choices but decided to go with this one and it turns out to be one of my better decisions.  My adult daughters no longer are embarrassed by my unshaven appearance for with this new razor I can shave quickly and completely with very little effort so now shave daily rather than once or twice a week.  Simple to use and keep clean - highly recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> I am 74 years old, over the years I&#x27;ve had many shavers but I can say without fudging that this Norelco is the best yet.  I would absolutely recommend it.  Amazon, as always, delivered on time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]    Very good product for $39.  Easy convenient usage, good battery life, pop up trimmer is a value addition.  The shaver is washable by directly holding on to water, and can be dried later.  No additional cleansing is necessary.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver has lasted my husband for over 2 years, and it is still running strong.  It gives him a close enough shave to be used every day, and require charging at the end of every week.  He cleans it after every use and has yet to replace any blades or pieces.  Take good care of it and it will take good care of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your husband wants a TRULY skin close shave, you won&#x27;t get it with this, but if he just needs to keep things tidy, it works well for quick morning touch ups for stubble.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was too quiet and wouldn&#x27;t work but it is amazingly smooth running and shaves great.  Used it for 3 weeks now and decided I should probably charge it, it was still working fine but just seams like it should be charged.. Nice buy</li>
    <li> i love it, it makes me feel so good and saves my face. go buy it man, worth the price</li>
    <li> Thsi is the best shaver, makes face look extra clean, better than shaving and all the lbeeding i get from it. definately recommend this to other people</li>
    <li> I have used 3 different Norelco electric shavers and this is a bottom line shaver.  After going on a trip, I lost my previous Norelco and had to get a replacement.  I figure getting this as a value shaver.  You really do get what you pay for.  The entire construction seems flimsy and plastic-ie.  At least, my previous shaver had some metal parts and had some real weight to it.  Anyhow, the shaving head speeds seem to be slower than usual, but for me, it gets the job done.  The trimmer is comparable with my previous one.  Finally, the water cleaning function is nice.  I would recommend this as a backup or travel shaver and just spend more for a top of the line shaver.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Norelco for my husband as he was undergoing radiation and needed a gentle way to shave his face and neck area. We were both surprised at how well this little inexpensive shaver was. It did a great job on his neck and facial hair. He commented on how well it worked on those hairs that grow in different directions. I think he will continue to use this shavor even after his treatments are over. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is my first Norelco shaver, and second electric shaver in my life--I&#x27;ve been a straight blade user I was a wee tad and decided to go electric these last few years.  My first electric shaver was a Braun and I must say, proved very reliable and provided a semi-close shave (of course, not as close as a razor), and the only reason I needed a new one is because it would not power on anymore.  As I&#x27;ve been using my new Norelco shaver for the past few months, I can only honestly say it&#x27;s been a great investment.  It definitely is provides a good shave, but one quib I have with it is that it misses hair strands on certain parts of my face that are not large enough for this to be a big issue, but are also not super small enough for me to ignore--as a result, I&#x27;ve found myself electric shaving first, then using my straight blade razor to shave off those missed pieces.  I did not have this with my prior Braun shaver, and honestly this is the only fault of this razor.  Overall:  -Battery life: Amazing..I only charged it once as I am a fast shaver, because even when it loses life, the next day it still will power on for little under a minute (just enough for me to finish a quick shave)....this extended my need to charge my shaver too often.  -Performance: Decent shave (with the exception of the quib noted in my first paragraph...misses certain hair strands on my face that require me to follow up with a straight blade razor  -Convenience: Cord is not very long, but that&#x27;s ok because I usually use it as a cordless anyway (however it can also be used corded if the battery isnt charged..i never use it this way though).  -Ease of cleaning: It is very easy to clean!  I typically just blow it out over the sink and tap the outside to knock all the remnants out throughout my week (it doesn&#x27;t clean it perfectly but im usually in a rush to work).  After 1-2 weeks I rinse it out with water cuz it can get gunked out..this takes a few minutes longer but makes it very clean.  -Overall: Itis a decent shaver for a decent price...would recommend.</li>
    <li> My Norelco shaver arrived promptly and has worked well.  It&#x27;s the third Norelco I have owned, and in this case  it was about as inexpensive to buy a new one as it would  have been to buy replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I have been afraid of electric razors for many years, because they really irritate my neck. I picked  this Norelco 7310 since it appeared to be flexible enough to cut the neck hairs without pulling.  It was priced well .After obtaining it i read that it should be used a number of times before best shave. oh no!  First couple of shaves seemed to pull a bit. Now after a week there seems to be no real pull and neck is not red and sore. Thanks</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my tired razor from 15 years ago.  It just quit cutting whiskers.  This one does a great job shaving, really liked the results from the first go.  BUT, this is a cheaply made plastic razor and I don&#x27;t expect anywhere near the life expectancy of the previous one.  And the previous razor I thought was a step down in quality from the one I had before that.    Don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a couple of years then start looking for another one.</li>
    <li> Was working fine, then one day I decided to do like the picture shows and rinse it under a tap. Almost instantly, the top falls into the sink and comes apart, I then lose 2 of the 3 little plastic pieces that sit on the blades down the drain. The replacement heads cost just as much as the freaking shaver itself!!!! Also, I don&#x27;t even know if the replacement heads will even include those tiny plastic parts...still an alright shaver, just seriously want to punch the guy who thinks you can rinse it like that directly in the middle of his face.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my husband. He loves it. It&#x27;s simple and quiet to use and feels comfortable. The only concern is that the replacement blade might be expensive.</li>
    <li> Shaved with a blade for years due to electric shaver irratation but no more. Very nice shave not as close as a blade on the neck area but no irratation also. for the price it was a steal. Been using for about 2 months. +++++++++++++++++++++++ :)</li>
    <li> Pretty good.This is the best shaver that I have used. I will buy another one for my dad. I strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This a comparatively inexpensive Norelco. I have one, and have given away three, very expensive Norelco razors. The one I kept is a Spectra model, and is the best electric I have ever owned. The 7310XL uses the same cutting head assembly as the Spectra, and it gives just as good a shave for less then a third of the price of the Spectra. I feel like I got a bargain.    I would recommend this shaver, Philips Model 7310XL, to anyone who wants a good shaver for a good price.</li>
    <li> Strong note:    If you shave every day, this razor will work reasonably well for you.     If you let it go 2 or 3 days between shaves, shave ACROSS the direction of hair growth first.  If you shave against or even with the hair it will catch and nick the skin relatively often.  Shaving 90 degrees to growth will catch much less frequently, then once you&#x27;ve removed most of the hair shave against like normal to finish.    Once you figure this out so it won&#x27;t nick you so much after a couple days between, this is a relatively good shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a coupla weeks now. A very easy-to-use excellent shaver. Will update if need be over time to see how it fares. As of now, I highly recommend it for being sturdy and simple-to-use and care for.</li>
    <li> Item performed well beyond expectations. Price was fair and item was described accurately. Shipment was prompt and reasonably priced.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My father told me it is so hard for him to find any type of shaver besides a razor as well as his friends..They are all back men and I know as different races we have different skin type so I decided to get this with my eyes closed for Fathers Day..and He asked me do I have my reciept before he even really looked at it..he went ahead and tried it and he loves it.. He has been walking around the house just using it and its sooo funny.. I am not trying to make this about race but Im glad a razor has been made to fit every mans skin type..Well worth the buy..Thanks Philips..!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of electric razors, but in the past I&#x27;ve always been frustrated by how ineffective they are against the hair on my throat.  This one, though, gave me a great close shave everywhere, including and especially on my throat.  I&#x27;ve never really cared whether an electric gave me as close of a shave as a blade, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had that actually did shave as close as a blade.  One other cool thing is that this razor is VERY quiet.  At first I thought there was something wrong with it (like it barely had enough charge to switch on), but given its performance, it&#x27;s obvious that&#x27;s the way it was meant to operate.  Also, the top flips open (but stays attached) so that you can easily run the blades under a faucet to clean them.  I&#x27;ve not tried more expensive electrics, but with how well this one works, I don&#x27;t see any need to.</li>
    <li> Battery discharges very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Not a razor (more like a trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;Hurts the skin.&lt;br /&gt;You need a twin blade razor with this razor/trimmer to complete the job.</li>
    <li> Pros: quiet motor, washable in water, close shave (eventually).&lt;br /&gt;Cons: weak motor, long shaving time (5-6 minutes), not as close a shave as twin razor, too many plastic parts, no pouch for storage, short battery life&lt;br /&gt;This could have been a good product if the motor is more powerful (like my 10 year old corded non-rechargeable Norelco shaver).  I am disappointed with the new style of Norelco shavers. I am willing to try another brand.&lt;br /&gt;10/25/2017 Update - This shaver still works with a very weak battery and short shaving time.  However, it provides a closer shave than some of the newer Norelco rechargeable shavers.  I found new Norelco&#x27;s shavers are getting worse.  I missed my old Norelco non-rechargeable corded shaver; it was powerful, consistent, and long life.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift. I shaved with it once and was very pleased with the results. However, the second time i shaved with it something must have broken under the hood. Two of the three blades stopped spinning and the third (the lower of the three heads) began acting bizarre. Instead of having the blades spinning underneath the prtoective sheath mesh on top, the entire thing begun to spin (the mesh is usuallystationarywhilethe blade beneath it spins. This allows the blade to trim hairs that poke through the mesh. However, when the mesh is also spinning, this doesn&#x27;t work and makes a terrible sound)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed because I was really excited for the shaver after the first shave, now I have to return it and am currently debating whether to take another gamble with the shaver in hopes that it won&#x27;t enchant the same issue, or to risk getting another, potentially worse shaver. Was it just a faulty product or is this shaver just not built to last ( more than one day.) disappointing, because people have very good things to say about it for it&#x27;s price point.</li>
    <li> I have owned many Norelco&#x27;s over the years.  I normally try to buy them on sale.  My wife takes my old one for her legs and I keep the new one.  Over the years, I found how important it is to keep the same blade with the same foil.  I mixed them up once and it ended up cutting the foil up and I was lucky it didn&#x27;t do me damage.  These things last years and many times it is cheaper to buy a new one than purchase a new set of cutting heads.  Someone said it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a normal razor...well duh... Regular razors destroy my skin and I end up with in grown hairs.  The only time I use a blade is when I have too long a growth to use my Norelco.  The cut is great but not so close to distroy my face.  This unit here is cordless and the blades turn a bit slow for my taste.  Maybe that is why the fire sale on this model.  For the price, the blades are worth it as a replacement for a suitable Nerelco, even if you don&#x27;t like this razor.  I would take this model over any other brand even with the slower speed.  It&#x27;s a Norelco but I would have to put it towards the bottom of all the units I have owned.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price you pay.  I use this every other day and the charge will last me about 2-3 weeks.  It may take a bit longer to get some parts of your face but it will get them if you pass over the area more than once.    You cant go wrong with the price and it is great to travel with.</li>
    <li> I paid just under $18 total. Amazon had a $10 coupon that might have been for a limited time. Theres supposedly a $10 rebate floating around out there but i suspect you cant do both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that price, its a good value. Its not going to be as good as a $80 or $150 one. (I presume, Because I would never pay that much for one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive had an old one years ago that got thrown away because the heads are more expensive than a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;That is still the case I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one,like the old, its passable for the face, not so much for the neck. I like a close shave. If i recall, I liked electric better when I was younger &amp; had less daily growth. But still got a better shave the old fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for my purpose, its going to be fine. I am going to use it as a \\&quot;pre\\&quot; shaver, that is follow up with a a wet razor. Why ?  Because I go 2-5 days between shaves and it gets painful the other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have commented, it is noticeably quieter than my old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think age &amp; beard type may matter. This thing alone might work for me in my early 20s. At almost 50, no way except for a \\&quot;preshave\\&quot;. Tears my neck up &amp; it doesnt shave well from the chin down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of others are on here complaining that their rebate didnt work. I knew that going in. When you see deals on deal sites, you&#x27;ve got to look at the fine print of the promos &amp; read past reviews. I did both and as a result didnt even waste a stamp trying to get the rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, amazon should have made it more clear the rebate wouldnt stack with the offer. It was essentially a prepaid rebate via amazon. Cant stack that with another rebate.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my elderly father, and I&#x27;m always talking up Amazon vs retail to him whenever he needs something.  So, of course I jump on the big A, and immediately ordered this model, since it&#x27;s the same one as what he&#x27;s used to....and raved about it&#x27;s price, blah, blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short,  I walk into the big Bullseye store the very next day, and see this exact same thing on sale for $20!.  I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to what I had seen to him.&lt;br /&gt;\&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, and as my title says, it&#x27;s a decent razor.  He doesn&#x27;t need any of the fancy add-on&#x27;s..and won&#x27;t spend to move up to the Braun&#x27;s, and Panasonics, so this does the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(now if I could only convince him that it shouldn&#x27;t be charging all the time to work at it&#x27;s best, but that&#x27;s a lost cause)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. It cuts closely and cleans very easily. The price has gone down over the years to a very acceptible level.</li>
    <li> I wanted a decent shaver for a cheap price and this fit the bill.  Its not the greatest shave in the world, but it does a good job and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  I certainly recommend this product especially for the budget minded.</li>
    <li> I always used a remington with the flex shield. Shield and blades always had to be replaced. Never would stay sharp and give a close shave. Sooooooooooooooo I figured I try the Norelco. I had one years ago and loved it then because of the comfort and close shave. Glad I got another Norelco--great price and the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This Norelco model 7310 far exceeded my expectations.  It shaves as close as a blade and gets even those stubborn neck and chin hair, and the pop up sideburn trimmer works great!  It lasts about 2 weeks between recharging and is so easy to brush clean or rinse under the faucet. This one does it all and is so inexpensive.  Why would anyone pay more money for any other electric shaver?</li>
    <li> I have always done a blade and cream shave however recently the task of doing it was becoming a bit tedious and even expensive. I purchased this as a subsitute of it every other day or so. Now I hardly ever use a blade. This is so quick and easy that its all I use now. However it does not get as clean of a shave as I would have liked to get everyday.</li>
    <li> when I bought this razer, it was the best one out there for the money IMO.  I bought it for $40, it was cordless, has a half an hour battery life, has 3 rotating (not stationary) heads, you can get it completely wet, works great, and it also has the Norelco name; so overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this razer and will look forward to using it for years to come!</li>
    <li> excellent product, recommend, good quality.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a month now and I just can&#x27;t find anything bad about it. It has a cheap sound about it and it doesn&#x27;t have a battery life meter but what it does do is give a nice shave. I have a ruddy face and getting a good shave is a problem. I was skeptical because of the price but to my surprise it does a great job and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. If your looking for an inexpensive razor this is it.</li>
    <li> it feels stable and ok    buy it    if     you dont expect it to shave your face itself without waking you up in the bed which i do :P    i hope there are better options  but i am not sure...    so you can buy it     it hurts my face for a while but nowadays, i am used to it     no more burning face     it is not that bad, the burning...    (my face is soo sensetive and it rocks actually hurting that little bit is a success)</li>
    <li> Not worth it.  Give you razor burn and it doesn&#x27;t give you a close enough shave.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my father in-law.  The shaver works well but replacement heads are only a few dollars less than an entire new unit.  I bought him the same model 14 months ago and when the heads got dull and fell apart from cleaning, I purchased a new shaver rather than replace the heads.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how close a shave it provided not as close under the nose as I would like but definitely close everywhere</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shaver.  Shaves close, and charging it is easy, just plug it in overnignht and you are ready to go.  Well worth the money, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using blades for the last 10 years.      But the cost of the fancy blade packs has been creeping up and up until it has become less expensive to buy an electric razor than to buy the replacement blade packs. (Amazon Gillette Manual Cartridge, Fusion, 12-Count - $29.25, this electric shaver $39.77.)  Which works out to $10 more for the first year, but I expect the Norelco to last much longer than 1 year.    I bought an inexpensive mode because I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it.      It has worked great right out of the box.  It does take a little getting used to and my skin needed to adjust the new way of shaving.  Blades still give me a little closer shave, and they glide across my face easier, BUT the convenience of just grabbing the Norelco and shaving, without the need of a sink and running water outweighs the difference.  If I&#x27;m running late, grabbing the Norleco on the way to the car and shaving on the fly is great.  It&#x27;s just quicker from start to finish.  And if you travel where the water quality, purity and safety are suspect, the Norelco offers and additional advantage in not needing bottled water to shave (to be safe).    I gave it 4 stars because it needs a battery gauge, what you see in the picture under the word charge is just that an indicator.  You plug the unit and the charge light comes on, it stays on solid green until the unit is charged and then it flashes green.  But once you unplug it you never see the indicator again until you charge it again (about weekly).  The obvious problem is that you never know the amount of charge left in the battery.  At home this isn&#x27;t a big problem as you can plug it in and shave with it while it is plugged in.  However grabbing it on the way out the door and jumping in the car is less reliable.  My solution is to charge the battery every Monday morning, so it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me yet.    Yes I can recommend this shaver, and when the time comes I might just get a little better model (based on the shaving heads used in the model).  I&#x27;m not complaining about the heads in this unit, but looking at the different replacement blades from Norelco I can see that some of the other ones have more slots for shaving.  I&#x27;m not sure it will make any difference, but I&#x27;d be willing to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 6 razors in the past (this one is #7) Most were Norelco but I&#x27;ve had 2 Remingtons and 1 top of the line, state of the art, Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This $30 razor is better than all of them.  Including the top of the line Braun which cost almost 5 times more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part, at $30 when it breaks, just buy a new one and no biggie.</li>
    <li> this was my first purchase and use of an electric razor.  i purposely bought this unit because of the Norelco name (i&#x27;ve been pleased with their beard trimmers for years), and the great price ($25).  i&#x27;ve always shaved with a razor, most consistently a Mach 3, but they always left bumps on my neck if i shaved more often than every other day.  so i thought i&#x27;d give electric razors a try, and this one seemed to be a good entry level unit without much investment if it didn&#x27;t work out.  i&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  i&#x27;ve shaved with it daily since christmas, and the red bumps and irritation are gone!  it&#x27;s cordless, which is very practical, and i&#x27;ve only charged it twice in nearly one month of use.  it&#x27;s very easy to clean since the head pops right open and it can be rinsed in the sink.  since i don&#x27;t have any experience with other electric razors, i can&#x27;t compare the shave quality to anything but a regular razor.  and since my wife hasn&#x27;t complained, it must me leaving me at least as clean shaven or more so than the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I listened to the other positive reviews. This razor is no nonsense high quality performance. Better than newer and other brands. Shaves very close, difficult neck areas handled with ease, and is quiet and easy to clean. Can&#x27;t ask for more. You can tell when it&#x27;s about to run out of charge by the weaker sound, so even if there is no indicator, I like having the \\&quot;bare bones\\&quot; model for the cost savings.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about an electric razor which you can clean in the sink after use, but I have shaved with this 3 times (on the same charge) and been able to fully clean it with hot water after each shave.  It did require an 8 hour charge after purchase before it was usable, and you cannot shave while still charging at the same time, but I found those to be minor issues.  I was able to quickly shave with minor razor burn, compared to other models that have I used in the past.  Basically, its a cheaper razor that gets the job done as advertised, and you cannot ask for much more for $32 really.</li>
    <li> Sent this to my boyfriend as a birthday gift because his old electric razor (another Philips Norelco) had finally bitten the dust after 8 long years of service. He is absolutely thrilled! Says it works great. Great investment if it lasts 8+ years like his last one did! Very well made.</li>
    <li> I have been a manual razor shaver for many years.  When my supply of disposable razors was about to run out I decided to buy an electric razor.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars because I used electric razors many years ago that would not last very long before breaking.  I tried my new electric razor today for the first time.  I think it did a pretty good job for an inexpensive electric razor.  I didn&#x27;t really like the white detailing Philips included in the design on the handle and around the heads but I can live with that.  I will continue to use it and if my opinion changes about the product then I will update my review.</li>
    <li> nice one, I recommend it.  It would be better if the seller can indicate how much time the product will take to charge.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very quiet, Shaves smooth and close and it&#x27;s easy to clean. Better than the more expensive units that self clean in a solvent solution, you just pop open the hinged head, rinse with hot running water, close it, shake water off, open it back up and let it dry. Takes about as long as it takes to read above sentence. It&#x27;s got a trimmer that works. The battery last long enough for a week of motel hopping and if it fails in the middle of a shave just plug it in and keep going. A battery charge indicator would have been nice but it&#x27;s really not essential. Since I got more than I expected for $40 I&#x27;ve got to give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a friend&#x27;s advice after my expensive Braun had been broken. The Braun was quicker but both deliver a very smooth shave with the edge to the Braun, however the slight difference is not worth seven times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Just noticed that they&#x27;re trying to sell this for $100. Really!? I paid $40.00 in 2011. I still have it and like it but no way would I pay $100. They don&#x27;t make this model anymore but if you look, you can still find good shavers for under $50.00.</li>
    <li> We got this for my husband. But I am using it more then he is. I am one of those women who does have unwanted hair on the face. I find that this shaver leaves me a very baby skin smooth for 2 days.</li>
    <li> My 89 yr old uncle who is in a nursing home was complaining how his old shaver was pulling his facial hair when he tried to shave and wanted a new shaver.  An expensive shaver was not in the budget, so I thought I would search for a inexpensive but quality shaver on Amazon, this shaver had such great reviews, so I bought it.      In two days my uncle was trying out his new shaver, believe me when I say he is very picky, however, he just loved it!!!!  We also used the shaver to trim his eyebrows, this shaver has exceeded our expectations!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 25 years.  This gives the same shave as the more expensive Norelco&#x27;s.  Rechargeable (Charge lasts about 7-10 days when I shave every day)</li>
    <li> This is my second rotary shaver.  My first was a higher priced Norelco.  Both excellent doing the job they&#x27;re designed to do. No bells and whistles, just does a great job.</li>
    <li> Decided to go with this model due to the amount of feed backs &amp; overall rating.      Im just wondering if I got the same unit as everyone else.    Total plastic product, light as a toy, with no horsepower AT ALL...    Those of you searching for your unit to just keep going...    This should be one of those $19.99 units.  Someone is still making waaaaay too much $ on this even at that rate.    I feel that in a bout 6 - 8 months from now, I will be looking for another.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a year already and I find it very good. It&#x27;s easy to clean. The battery last as long as a month or more and it is rechargable. It has a clean shave on my face all the time. I haven&#x27;t changed the blade yet and it work as good. I use it every morning. I highly recommand this low cost high value shaver.</li>
    <li> I had not purchased a new electric razor in 25 years. Does the job well. Only negative is the lack of a carrying case which I was used to from previous purchases of Norelco products. I am on a trip now,  living out of a suitcase so a carrying case for the shaver is something I miss.</li>
    <li> I have been thinking about getting an electric razor for nearly 50 years - I am now kicking myself for waiting. All the material says give it a 21 day trial. Well, fortunately, I can get away without shaving a day, so the first day i shaved, I thought yikes this is going to work - a little bit of a razor burn, I have kind of a heavy even beard. I skipped the next day, the following day the shave was better and the burn not bad, this went on for two weeks with the burn getting less each time - I love my Norelco. Just so you know with a razor I learn to shave after a shower in the Marine Corps with my face still damp never used a cream.  I would highly recommend givng this a try.</li>
    <li> At last, now I can retire my disposable&#x27;s and get a close shave! With my old razor blades,I used to dread shaving before events like birthdays, weddings etc, just because I&#x27;d almost always end up with unsightly cuts.  Must say, the before and after pics by the guy from Miami, tipped the scales! Easy to use, easy to clean and very affordable!</li>
    <li> Our family owns three of these shavers.  I use one daily and my two teenage sons each use one daily.  Their experience is limited but I have been using electric shavers for years and can honestly say this one shaves as good as any other Norelco or Braun shaver I&#x27;ve used.  And for the price - you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one of these started shaving poorly, I started to buy a set of replacement cutters - about $30.  Yikes - I bought a whole new shaver for $38! I put the old one in a drawer for spare parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you need something fancy to impress friends who frequent your bathroom, just get this cheapie - you&#x27;ll be happy.  And, if you don&#x27;t like it, give it to a teenager just starting out, he&#x27;ll be fine with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco lift and cut electric razors for many years.  When it came time to replace my old one, I picked up the 7310XL.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for several months and can say that the shave isn&#x27;t any different than my previous and much more expensive Norelco.  Note that I don&#x27;t probably a medium-think beard and don&#x27;t have curly hair.  At only a little more than the cost of replacement heads of my previous razor, thins was a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have with this unit is that there&#x27;s no battery level indicator or even an indicator to let you know that the unit needs to be charged.  You have to rely on being able to hear that motor slowing down.  A couple of times I&#x27;ve been shaving, turned it off for a few seconds during a shave and it wouldn&#x27;t turn back on because it had no charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, this is a good budget razor that provides a good shave.</li>
    <li> I was more than satisfied with the razor. It suited me better than some of the $150 razors I&#x27;ve had. Quiet and sharp as a tack You can&#x27;t go wrong with this beauty.</li>
    <li> Got this for the husband, he likes it fine.  His old norelco needed new blades and it was cheaper with the coupon to buy this one than buy new blades.</li>
    <li> Shaver is very quiet and initial shaves are close. However I am concerned about the shaver speed when the blades begin to dull, as it runs much slower than shavers I am used to.  But considering the cost with rebate, not much downside.</li>
    <li> useful things, and it is a gift for my husband, he likes it.if you sent somebody a gift, just buy it.</li>
    <li> I am 62 years of age, have always shaved with an electric, and this is the best electric razor I have ever owned. It puts my last electric, a Braun, to shame. It gives a wonderfully close shave. In addition, it is impressively quiet. Although I immediately gave it a full charge upon opening it, when I turned it on it was so quiet I thought the charge had somehow failed and that the battery must be nearly  dead. Imagine how delighted I was to discover that this electric simply runs that quietly! In contrast, running my Braun near my ears often tempted me to insert earplugs.    I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this electric razor. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Norelco&#x27;s and when my old one went phfft... I got this one.  As usual, it works great, looks good and the price (at Amazon) is right.  I saw this same razor at the local drug store  for thiry bucks more than I paid at Amazon..  Just a winner all around!!</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver to repace my existing Norelco HQ55+. I have had my previous shaver for 5+ years with no problems and it continues to work. You can&#x27;t beat 7310 for the price, it&#x27;s currently selling for less than the replacement blades on my HQ55+ which is the main reason I bought the 7310 XL. I always throw this in my suitcase when I travel which eliminates the need to carry travel size shaving cream and razors; it also saves me time when I&#x27;m running late&lt;br /&gt;in the morning and don&#x27;t have time for a full wet shave. We got one for my fiance&#x27;s father as well for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This item was a great deal. It was a gift for my grandson. Delivery was very timely and he is so happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver to trim my beard whenever I don&#x27;t shave for more than a week. Doing it with a razor is somewhat cumbersome and I thought that the electric shaver would do the trim comfortably. I was wrong! This electric shaver (and probably all others as well) tends to pull the hair. I didn&#x27;t press the shaver against the skin as instructed, but still the it pulled my hair at least 3-4 times during a shave. If a user can deal with that, it is a good buy. For me, it is back to my normal razor.</li>
    <li> very useful,fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought a vacuum cleaner instead...at least I would expect it to suck.  As of this review, this product has 837 reviews:  437 five-star, 238 four-star, 78 three-star, 40 two-star, and 44 one-star.  With ratings like that, I thought this would be a great-value and a decent razor at a good price. I did my research and I was still wrong.  My only complaint about this razor is that it does not cut well.  I have used electric razors for 20-plus years and this one is the worst I have purchased.  I had a Norelco in college and thought it did a decent job, but have been using Braun foil-type razors for the last 10 years or so (mostly because of value/performance).  This razor does such a poor job that I use a [[ASIN:B002TQ4AO0 Braun M90  Mobile Shaver, Silver, 1]] to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; what this razor misses.  I bought the M90 for a camping razor or a backup...right now it is my primary razor.  I have also owned the [[ASIN:B001FA1F8K Braun Series 1  1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] and the [[ASIN:B003YJB026 Braun Series 5-550cc Shaver System, Black and Silver]] (it was a gift).  While I am not doing a review for those particular razors, they both cut closer than this one.  I don&#x27;t have a very coarse beard and it takes me two days to get a five o&#x27;clock shadow.  The razor does not irritate my skin (probably because I have always used electric razors). I have spent 10 minutes or more trying to get a closer shave only to finish up with my M90 in 1-2 minutes.  I have shaved with this thing for 30-days and see no improvement in my face \\&quot;getting used to it\\&quot; nor in the cutting performance.  As for the other 1-star reviewers, I don&#x27;t have any issues with battery life, motor speed, hair pulling, cleaning, skin rashes, or poor quality workmanship.  If the thing would cut the hair on my face, maybe I would quibble about such things.  Since it does not cut, my recommendation is to keep looking.  Don&#x27;t trust the reviewers for this one...you&#x27;ll end up regretting that you bought this thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for about 44 dollars and I believe it was a good deal. I had a previous 50 dollar Panasonic that cut just as good, but did not have a rechargeable battery and it was also not cordless. The battery life does last about thirty minutes but if you take longer than that you might not be doing something right. Anyway, it cuts great but not as close as a blade. If you take extra time you can get it pretty close though. It wont pull your hair if you&#x27;re used to electric razors and have not noticed any thing that makes me not want to shave with it. I actually prefer to use it more than blades because it definitely saves me a lot of time and I dont have to be as careful. The side burn trimmer works good but not as good as clippers. It cleans very very easy under running water, after that you just let it dry and plug it in to charge. It lets you know when it&#x27;s fully charged and make sure to not overcharge the unit so that you get the best battery life. For the price range, it does what you may expect.</li>
    <li> After using Norelco&#x27;s for 25+ years now I would have to say: 1. this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever got from one and 2. in todays money this is the most inexpensive Norelco I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Cuts very different then my old Remington shaver, so use caution on sensitive areas. Otherwise its a very simple unit that seems to cut fairly well.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for aprox. 30 years, and no matter the price, or brand, always had some hair&#x27;s left behind ( i have thikh hair ) Not anymore!+ It held the charge for 2 months, not kidding! I only shave every other day, i charged it on dec. 8th, after buying it, and are now, for the first time, charging it again, feb. 11th 2012. WOW! Not bad for a 27$ shaver from Wallmart. This is model# 7310XL, doen&#x27;t know if the XL makes a differens on the battery? but i am very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco shaver.  I bought the first on around 2000 for $100+, the second came from Amazon in 2006.  Both succumbed to the same issue - battery age.  The NIMH battery battery pack Norelco uses is good for about 5 years, after which it pretty much stops taking charge.  Replacing it would be a snap, it is really just to AA rechargeables, if Norelco did not solder the battery pack, so if you want to keep your shaver, you either have to service it (expensive!) or learn to use soldering iron.  My solution, then and now was to replace the entire shaver.  It particularly makes sense with this one - it is cheaper than the pack of the replacement heads!&lt;br /&gt;So, the positives:  it is cheap.  Really, I paid $28 for it, and a set of HQ6 heads for my old shaver is 30.  It makes not sense at all but nevertheless that&#x27;s how Philips pricing works.  It looks and feels good, in my opinion black and white scheme makes it sleek and modern.  It shaves well, it is just as good any other Norelco shaver - if you used one before, and liked it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  The charger slot is the same as on older models.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the negatives, all minor things, really.  First of all, I really miss LCD screen of my old shaver which showed the remaining charge.  I thought I would and I do, so if this is something you find very useful this may not be a shaver for you.  Looks are cool, but a rubbery grip is an absolute magnet for hair.  The charger connection is not 100% reliable, after the first few times it lost connection from being moved during charging I learned to double-check.  There&#x27;s no travel bag.  Not really a negative, but it is 1.5 oz lighter than my old shaver and felt sounded like a cheap plastic toy a few first times, before I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end - do I regret buying it? Not for a second!  But 5 years from now, assuming I still can afford electricity, I may go for a more upscale model.</li>
    <li> Title says it all, but new seperated pivoting heads are adjustment but nice.  Great buy for name and quality!</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for 2 years.  Norelco makes shavers that are durable and easy to use.  Unfortunately, I have to shop for one that will give me a closer shave (with less work).  Even with repetive shaving of the same areas, this razor will not give a close shave.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moRYJ8ZJPTWYFB]]I bough the Philip Norelco Saving machine didnt hol the charge since the first day for more than 1 minute even tha I charged all knight.  I don&#x27;t recomended at all. Is a pice of junk.    Hopefully the seller will return my money.    Thank you</li>
    <li> this shaver may be good for little boys no good for real beard. i hate it going to get new blades for my 7775 and go with it until it don&#x27;t go no more. philips norelco 7310 xl</li>
    <li> works great, and comes with a shaver for nose and ear hair</li>
    <li> Received mine about three weeks ago. Even though the manual included recommends giving it three weeks for your skin to adjust, my skin adjusted very quickly and the unit produced excellent results from day one. The battery life is surprisingly good: a single charge lasted long enough for daily shaves of 2-3 minutes for almost two weeks. The charge-full indicator is also good: the flashing reliably lets me know when to unplug the unit. The sideburn trimmer is nothing special but works OK. Cleaning the unit is nice and easy (just hold it under a running hot tap). The quality of the shave itself is easily en par with shaving using an ordinary safety razor, if not a little better because it&#x27;s more consistent. It also copes better than a safety razor does with coarse hair e.g. on one&#x27;s neck.    Other reviewers have described feeling that the machine is pulling out their hairs rather than cutting them: this hasn&#x27;t been the case for me. It hasn&#x27;t been painful at all shaving daily. I *did* however notice what they describe if I let my beard become too long - more than, say, 2mm - before using the unit. (This happens mostly around the tip of the sideburns.) So: 1. Use the sideburn trimmer to avoid longish hairs before using the shaver proper. 2. If your beard is longer than a couple of millimetres, shave using something else first? I haven&#x27;t experimented properly to find out what&#x27;s best to do in that situation, yet.    This machine has made shaving much, much more pleasant for me, to the extent that daily shaving is now part of my routine (previously, it was too much effort). If and when this unit wears out (no sign of that yet!) I&#x27;ll be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> Good price and quanlity. Made in China..........    Easy to use. Plastic outside. I give is as a gift to my grandfather. He likes it.</li>
    <li> When shopping for a shaver to replace my 20+ year old Norelco, I only looked at Norelco. When I saw the prices for the top of the line model, I was amazed. Then I saw the 7310XL at a more reasonable price. I had some doubts about how good a shave I would get with a less expensive shaver but figured it would give me at least as good a shave as the old Norelco that I was retiring. The new 7310XL turned out to be better than I expected. It shaves much closer then the old one ever did and is so quiet, I can&#x27;t tell if its running without putting it right up to my ear. Of course part of that is becase I am 84 now and my hearing stinks. I have noticed pretty skimpily clad girls being attrackted to my smoooth skin but my dog is happy to lick my face now that it is so smooth. Buy it now at Amazon. It also holds a charge for at least a month. budgottesman.com</li>
    <li> The shaver is good, the power is just so so, and curvature is not very good, not very clean after shaving!</li>
    <li> I bought this cause I got it pretty cheap. Else I had read about electric shavers not being so good etc. I was actually quite surprised with this one. It provides very smooth shave and quite easy to use. Just used it two times and I already feel comfortable with it. Best use will be for traveling etc.    There are few drawbacks but that could be common to all electric shavers. Because of repetitious moves over the same spot, I feel a bit of more irritation, compared to regular razor. I usually shave once in a week and best use I found for this shaver was..... use it first with quick easy strokes going easy on skin and then finish off with regular razor in one pass. That way, I get least skin burn.     Overall, I am happy that I bought this, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Beware that they&#x27;ll reject your rebate just because you got a good price on it. I filled the rebate out meticulously and read all of the fine print and then then sent me a vague rejection in the mail. I called and they gave me an equally unreasonable reason why it was rejected. I&#x27;ve been buying norelco razors for 30 years, mostly out of habit. No more. Time to try panasonic.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. shaves close, easy to handle, etc.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System during thanksgiving in 2011. I was promised a mail in rebate of $20 from Philips. So I filled in the rebate form and sent it to Shawnee, KS where it was supposed to be sent. 2 months later, I received a reply that the manufacturer will not provide the mail-in rebate as it was purchased from Amazon. I have no clue why I am not getting the rebate. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Recieved shaver quickly, charges  quickly and lasts a long time.  Wasn&#x27;t a bad deal last year during the holiday season but would have been great had Norelco honored their rebate.  I submitted it correctly after purchasing it on sale and was denied because after rebate the price would have been between 5-10 dollars.  I will not purchase something Norelco again expecting to get a REBATE..beware.</li>
    <li> The shaving is great, but I did not receive my rebates as the company said. It has been3 months that I bought this products. Why I did not receive my bonus?</li>
    <li> My husband just used two times and it stop working. We tried to fixed it and exceeded the return window. Please advise what we can do to get our money back. Thanks.</li>
    <li> happy with it. nice close shave and easy to use. comfortable and easy to clean. i am happy with this purchase. glad to recommend it</li>
    <li> I got this from Amazon with a $10 coupon so it was under $30. So it is hard to rate something so cheap. If you want this for your day to day shaving, I would go elsewhere. It really is worth the $30, but not worth having for day to day.    1) It hurts. The lift and cut is painful for me. (less so after 2 or 3 days)  2) The motor is slow. The sluggishness is what makes #1 above.   3) It misses hairs sporadically. So I have like 10 random hairs that it never catches.    So it is pretty cheap in quality and cheap in price, The choice is yours.      Frank</li>
    <li> this one looks good. I tried and it workds fine though a little noise. i want to buy two for my father and borther but it seems each person can only buy one at this price.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on some half-way decent reviews and a good price at the time.  I got it and used it for the first time and was totally disappointed.  Other reviewers had said the motor was really weak and I have to concur.  You have to go over the same area time and again to even get what some would consider a close shave.  My neck which is the most sensitive part of my face saw the most damage.  It was redder than Carrot Top&#x27;s head when I was finished.  If you have even slightly sensitive skin STAY AWAY from this shaver.  Even after shaving for over five minutes with this thing I managed to miss a small area right under my chin.</li>
    <li> I got around Last weekend , in between I tried to use this Shaver 3 times, though it was written that there will be irritations in Skin when you use for the First time, which I took the Brunt...&lt;br /&gt;But even after using 2 - 3 Times, I am now in total Mess, my Face has lots of cuts throughout my chin &amp; neck Area...&lt;br /&gt;The Shaver does not does a clean shave at all. After shaving it appeared my Skin was burning and my ears where Red.&lt;br /&gt;I used an aftershave it almost made me cry, it was such a painful experience.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover , something which I can do from a Blade in 2 - 5 mins , it takes me more than 15 mins even though I do not have much of Beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a Good Shaver at all, I seriously do not recommend this Shaver at all.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not buy it.</li>
    <li> Key points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Suppressed machine sound; when shaving close to your ear- you don&#x27;t hear a traumatic whirring sound&lt;br /&gt;-Compact design with cap for use on-the-go&lt;br /&gt;-Fits contours of the face really well, the 3-D design really works&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer works; great for mustaches, trimming~, and cutting down for closer shaves&lt;br /&gt;-EASY to clean; Just pop open top, flush with water, and dry&lt;br /&gt;-Charging required 8 hours but for me it always seem to need only 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-Not easy to \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; trip the ON/OFF button, so great for travel and storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-No rashes, No pain, No Soreness, No \\&quot;Negatives\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-This is a Precision instrument: WILL shave \\&quot;stubs\\&quot;, morning growth of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;-WILL cleanly shave off anything from 2mm and smaller. Maybe more than 2mm~ will also be shaven as well.&lt;br /&gt;-After shaving, My skin felt smooth as though hair did not exist there before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this to others. Bought mines for $34 with Prime.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product for a very outstanding price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!IMPORTANT! Don&#x27;t underestimate the sound, it may be muffled but will \\&quot;MOW Down\\&quot; your beard if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd shaver from Norelco.  The first one was 6400 which lasted more than 4 years.  The second one was 9160XL which had to be replace by Norelco after about a year since I charged the battery more than the prescribed time. That cost about $160.    I must say that with the 7310XL, Norelco has finally figured it out.  This is by far the best shave I am having using an electric shaver.  Quality is better than a manual razor in that it does not cut, bruise and provides a much smoother shave.  I love this shaver.  It is tack sharp.  Almost like a blade.     Battery lasts a month for me between recharges.    Good job Norelco!</li>
    <li> Excellent performance, as all Norelco shavers.  It would help if Philips included a case, as they do for some models.  Case should have room to include the little charging transformer.  This particular model does not have a remaining charge indicator, but this is not a serious fault.  Philips produces these shavers in many models, it would help if the exact differences were illustrated in a \\&quot;compare\\&quot; type of table.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Philips before that I wasn&#x27;t happy with so I was nervous about buying one again based off the amazon rating.  But after receiving it I&#x27;m very happy.  The charge lasts for quite a while and it does a lot better of a job shaving then shavers of my past.  There are times when I need to make a couple passes or when I get some shaver burn but overall I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my son-in-law for christmas and he is just thrilled with the close shave that he gets with it,he says the close cut is almost as close as a regular blade razor.  and clean up is a breeze the only thing negitive that i found about it is:that it is cheaper to buy a new shaver than to buy a new set of cutters for it, but the razor gets a high rating.</li>
    <li> Its good for the price. It has a back end that flips up to let you shave without killing your skin</li>
    <li> It is goog for me, some one told that it is a little samll,   but my camera is also a little small, so they fit each other perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I have used Norelco shavers for many years.  They last me a ling time in spite of the fact that I drag them around with me in various trucks and cars to shave while I am driving.  This razon shaves close and is still going strong three weeks later on the original battery charge.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I bought this to replace my old nerelco, which I already had for three years and still works well. And this one is even better.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver--smooth, quiet, fast, and comfortable. And it&#x27;s inexpensive. Tried switching to a Braun foil shaver that was highly rated by Consumer Reports but came back to the Norelco. Cutters and heads last pretty long, about a year.</li>
    <li> It works very well with comfortable experience, three heads fitting face good. It is one of the lowest end product in Philips shaver, but as the same reason the price is very economic. Thus overall, I would recommend to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Price was very reasonable (sorry did not purchase a few more for gifts). the shaver does a fine job shaves close. seems to hold a decent charge. contours / hugs the face very nicely with no pulling.</li>
    <li> I was really quite surprised by how well this shaver worked. I did experience a little irritation when I first started using the shaver but the instructions forewarn you of this. Definitely one of my better buys!</li>
    <li> this is the second one for me the blades cost just as much as it so buy the new shaver. works real good use it on the face and head</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of test-runs with electrics over the years, in between boughts of regular razor use. Although none of them are as close as a razor, this one is very satisfactory. It shaves well enough for 95% of occasions. I will keep this for a year perhaps, until the rotary blades aren&#x27;t cutting as well, then probably throw it out and buy a new one of the same brand and model. It&#x27;s still cheaper than razors.</li>
    <li> Its been 3 shaves since i owned this shaver and its really good. Though this is a little slow speed but does the job very well. Once negative point it, had to use it twice/thrice for complete removal of my neck hairs and i don&#x27;t have a heavy growth of hairs as well. Have tried it with/without shave gel and both the cases it came out with flying colors.  Overall for the price i love it and it does the job very well. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews here at Amazon and am happy with my purchase.  I particularly appreciate the many reviewers who have had several other electric shavers at various price points and stressed that in terms of just the shave, this Norelco was on par with top of the line shavers that cost $100+ more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first electric shaver, so I cannot provide such comparisons.  I would, though, like to point out a few things that I didn&#x27;t see in previous reviews that might help others make a decision.  First, although this is an electric shaver and cannot possibly provide as close of a shave as the ones that use razor blades, I was impressed at just how close the shave is with the 7310XL.  As is pointed out in the instruction booklet, which I guess many people ignore, it helps if you stretch your skin with your non-shaving hand.  Also, make sure your skin is dry and be sure to shave against the grain.  Finally, don&#x27;t press too hard or it may pinch your skin (another tip of the instruction manual).  Using this four-pronged technique, I am able to get an impressively smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern was shaving around my jaw bone (I&#x27;m quite skinny so don&#x27;t have the benefit of a nice round jaw line).  While this does take longer to shave than the rest of my face combined, I was able to get a satisfactory shave here too.  Lastly, I have sensitive skin, so was worried about irritation; several reviewers mentioned that this was an issue for them.  I actually found the irritation to be mild (no worse for me than with a blade-based razor).  And, by just splashing a little warm water on my face I was able to alleviate the little itchiness that I did feel.  Note: the instructions also point out that irritation is common in the beginning and should subside within the first 21 days of exclusive use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.  Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System  very good . i like this product! my father like too . i will keep ~</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this shaver&#x27;s \\&quot;bang for the buck.\\&quot;  Great deal!  Also, so far, the battery charge is lasting more than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> good shaver for 6 months then you need new blades which cost almost as much as the whole unit.  but a close shave--sometimes too close where your skin will be irritated and breakout.  Battery is average but to be expected of this China wonder.</li>
    <li> First, I paid under eighteen bucks for this which made it less costly than replacing the cutters in my old Norelco. It cuts nice and is as good as my 15 year old Advantage though it&#x27;s a far cry from that one in quality. It feels like a toy in comparison to the Advantage because of the weight difference, and the plastic seems much thinner, but it has a power cord and that&#x27;s a real plus when the battery dies... and they all die sometime. It&#x27;s noisier but the quality of the cut is good enough for me and I like the popup trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the higher end models are worth the additional expense because the cutters all wear over time and have to be replaced. I&#x27;m pretty cheap and when it&#x27;s cheaper to replace a shaver than the cutters then that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do. I went with 4 stars because it&#x27;s very light in weight and doesn&#x27;t feel well made but does a nice job on my face without having to go over an area several times.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving. Much better than my Panasonic.  Shaving the neck is little tricky and needs little bit more work than face.</li>
    <li> For shaver, the best I have ever use is the cheapest one with 2 head, not these 3-headed shavers. I&#x27;ve used panasonic,braun and philips, the best is \\&quot;Philips Norelco HQ40/33 Shave on the Go Battery Razor\\&quot;. No matter how expensive the shaver is, they don&#x27;t shave as well as the smallest/cheapest one does. Braun series5 is totally disaster, shakes my hand numb and the last 0.5mm beard never get shaved. The panasonic one is Ok but the price even higher than the braun. This product, however, cheap and good, shaves fine, buy it when cheap, never the original price.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric for many years and decided to give this a try. It does a fair job but will never compare to a razor shave. It is fine for a quick trip I suppose but it still seems to take longer than a sharp Gillete and the good clean feel is not there. Probably this electric is as good as they come.</li>
    <li> i recived it week ago and i love it it can hit my nick easily the hair in my nick is not trouble any more but if you want to use it in the best way do this :&lt;br /&gt;1- warm up your face bring some blanket and put it in hot water then warm up your skin with it for 5-7 minutes the hair will be soft and easy to shave W/O any wounds or left overs&lt;br /&gt;2- when you finish shaving use some after shaving gel .&lt;br /&gt;this is better than shaving with razors you wont have some annoying bugs in your face if you want the best shaving shave every 3 days at morning dont shave with it everyday .</li>
    <li> it is very worth to buy it!!!!  great thanks for my friends. it is much cheaper than the price on the maket</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy about this shaver.  It does its job pretty good.  When I tried to clean it, the three blades and the holding bracket were fallen off.  Putting them back is a challenge.  Now the shaver was never the same.  Poor thing!</li>
    <li> Great product, I am very pleased with this product, The cost is great for the product, would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Remington Micro Screen, that would not hold a charge anymore. The purchase was based on positive reviews, here. It does the job well, and takes less time and effort to complete a shave, than my former shaver did. I shave everyday, so testing it on a heavier 3 day old beard, will not normally be an issue, for me. The motor does sound weak, but I get a weeks worth (or better) of shaves out of it, before it dies and needs a recharge.  Pros:  priced right, easy to clean, decent shave, and does the job. Really, all I could expect.  Cons: feels cheap, and wonder how long it will last.. but the same goes with most reasonably priced gadgets, now a days (?). No warning indicator, when it will suddenly stop working, and need a recharge... because it has a very quiet motor. Not really a big deal, because I can finish the shave with the charger plugged in.</li>
    <li> I was looking at the high end shavers, but decided not to waste the extra loot for them, when i found this one. Its relatively cheap and well constructed.Gives a very close shave but can give off razor burn, you just have to go slow and you will avoid the burn. Charges fast and stays charged for a good time. Very easy to clean, face pops open and you give it a quick rinse, also replacing the three razors are pretty easy. 4/4 for the razor burn it gives off, but can be avoided.</li>
    <li> Used this one for a month now, the irritation is gone except for the nick area, which also is badly shaved, it is great for all other parts of the face, but you need to go many times.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it! It&#x27;s cordless and the heads pivot in all directions for a close shave. He highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy shaving with the Norelco Men&#x27;s Shaver. I wish I had done this 20 years ago.  No more shave cream. Just a little pre shave and then \\&quot;buzz\\&quot;, and a few minutes later, I&#x27;m done. I just love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I switched to electric shavers. Back then I&#x27;d be hassled to shave, so I wouldn&#x27;t shave as often, but now it&#x27;s so convenient I can shave everyday without any effort. I am asian and have very little facial hair, but this does a terrific job for the price of twenty that I paid (and you&#x27;ll have a fun time getting that price again). Lasts quite a long time per charge, stays relatively sharp after some use, and overall it&#x27;s served me very well. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Not as powerful as a corded shaver but more convenient.</li>
    <li> low quality shaving machine.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great. The best point is the battery life is great and the charger is portable enough to fit in any carry bag when traveling. This is my first rotary shaver and noticed that it is a challenge to get a close shave under the nose unlike my old Brawn shaver, which was a perfect, compact shaver, but replacing the batteries left me no choice but to look for a new shaver. Of course rotaries are bulkier, but this Norelco is priced right and works great.</li>
    <li> This is similar to a Norelco I have used for years, until the battery died. It shaves very well, as I would expect. However, 1) The packaging requires cutting into three tough layers of blister pack; 2) It did not come with a travel pouch, as have my previous Norelcos; 3) The charging cord includes a transformer (converter), which makes it harder to pack.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the delivery and service provided for this product. But overall the product is really bad. I have been using it for nearly four months and every time I use it my skin burns and becomes all red. Initially I taught that it was me, but this shaver is not a good item to buy. I ungraded to a 120$ shaver and I had no issues with that.  Please use for 20 days and If you have any issues with your skin, please send it back to Philips and take a refund. Do not keep it thinking that it will work after some time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor after a bad Remington purchase.  And I had been a Remington customer for many years.  This razor does the job very nicely, and is much quieter than any Remington razor has ever been.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the \\&quot;apparently\\&quot; slow revolutions of the razor, it does a very nice job on the flat of the cheek, around the chin, and down lower on the neck with the longer hairs.  I do not regret the purchase!</li>
    <li> I got it as a gift for my brother, who is extremely happy with the product&#x27;s performance and quality. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase: great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] This is an above average electric shaver, for the price, under 29.00$ at Wally World, I have used Norelco triple head rotary shavers for over 15 years, well, I have replaced a few heads also, but for the price of this one, you don&#x27;t have to worry about head replacement, just go get a new shaver for under 29.00$ and another good thing, they are guaranteed for a full two years, now, for the closeness of the shave, they are as close as a manual razor, your face feels like a new born baby&#x27;s bottom.after you shave! So, I will give the 7310 a five star rating!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son. This is his first shaver. He has used it and likes it very well. It has been easy to use and care for. Since this was his first shaver we wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cause irritation but that would last for a while. I originally did research to try to find something affordable yet reliable.This fit my search.</li>
    <li> It actually shaves as close as a razor - be prepared with a skin conditioner in advance so you don&#x27;t get razor burn.</li>
    <li> The razor is great, waterproof and eazy to keep clean. holds a charge for days, and shaves clean and quiet.   Great product.</li>
    <li> Like some reviewers pointed out, it does takes a little work to shave well with this one. my old 20+ year old shaver does the job faster and cleaner. plus it always cut my skin, it only stop cutting me after a long time of use. on the plus side, cleaning is easy.</li>
    <li> Smooth across my entire face.  No pinching or pulling.  I do use a skin prep which aids in cutting &amp; glide.  It shaves almost as close as my blade razor but not quite.  I&#x27;m not ready to give up my Gillette just yet!</li>
    <li> The 7310 si a decent shaver. It cuts pretty close and the charge last quite a while (2 weeks or so). Not as close as a razor but no cuts either.    Update: I&#x27;ve now owned it for a couple of months. The second charge lasted over a month. The shave seems less impressive on second thought. OK but nothing outstanding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a budget shopper and a budget shaver.  This is the nicest, easiest, closest shaving, least abrasive shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  The ability to wash the blades out under running water is fantastic.  This shaver is top of the line for the low end price range.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very functional. I bought two during Thanksgiving. It&#x27;s a great deal with $10 mail-in-rebate. My husband and my father in-law love this shaver very much.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband.  He absolutely loves this thing.  Says it is quieter than any razor he has used &amp; gives him the smoothest,fastest shave he has ever had compared with other razors he has owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had more expensive shavers with more blade holes but they have smaller slots.  This one just has one row of blades on each of the 3 blade rings, but to me the whisker slots are slightly bigger and handle all face areas with ease.  I&#x27;ve tossed my much more expensive Norelco with all the bells and whistles.  I even bought this one on sale for less than replacement blades for the other one.</li>
    <li> Since high school, I have owned corded and cordless shavers from almost all the major brands.  In my humble opinion, the Norelco and Panasonic are the two best.  It comes down to whether you like a foil or a rotary head style.  Personally,I found this as great rotary dollar for dollar. I had a clipless coupon here on Amazon and there was an amazing price before the coupon.  The shaver was less than $20. On price alone, it&#x27;s a 5 star deal.  But price isn&#x27;t everything.  I like the durability, and Philips uses cheaper plastic than my shavers from the late 1990&#x27;s  early 2000&#x27;s .  The charging cord is also flimsy.    They do score major points with the ability to rinse the heads under water.    So for an entry or slightly above entry level, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  If you like more meat on the bone, go up a few models.</li>
    <li> I wanted an electric razor that would work with or without being plugged in. I&#x27;ve let it go several days on one charge and it finally quit today, but after plugging it in for a few seconds I was able to finish shaving with it plugged in. You can open the top and run it under the faucet to clean it out, which is a nice feature. The back has the sideburn/mustache trimmer which works well. Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied with everything so far.</li>
    <li> This is the least expensive  in the line for norelco.  I had a 10.00 coupon, so  the total price was just over 20.00 plus shipping.  It is great as a backup shaver. I have one of the  100.00+ units which shaves a little better but I had to admit, not much better than the 20.00 unit.  I  think it is  a great buy for a backup unit. It only has one row of the circular cutters as  the others have 2 or more? I did not look at all models.  But at this price range a nice buy for a second razor.</li>
    <li> To be frank, I like it very much. Thanks Amzon. It values out of the price. If someone else needs a shave, I&#x27;d like to introduce it. Nice tool! And it always works very well. The great thing is that it is even waterproof.</li>
    <li> I needed to buy a new electric razor after my old one was starting to die. Didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money, so this one seemed a good fit price wise and it had pretty good reviews. When I got it and after a quick charge, I turned it on and the first thing that I noticed how quiet it was. I thought this was a sign that it had a weak motor and was begining to get disappointed, but I decided to give it a try. I was totally impressed. After finishing my face was smoother than when I use a traditional razor with shaving cream. I love how quiet it is and the fact that it is cordless is a nice feature. I also love how it can be rinsed with water. For the price, this is a great buy</li>
    <li> It is a very quick delivery. Most inportantly, it is free.   It is a gift for my friend but is too big for me to pack. I doult I could unpack it and just keep the shaver. hahaha...</li>
    <li> First rechargeable shaver that has lasted an entire week on single charge. Very quick charging as well. Being able to wash it under the tap is a real convenience.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor in July 2009 for forty bucks. Good, basic electric razor. Now goes for over 90 bucks. After 6 years, mine is starting to fail (motor seems to be running slower, straining a bit). So, checked Amazon. From what I have read, quality has dropped considerably since I bought mine six years ago. Too bad. Will look elsewhere for new electric razor. Will try to find one made in USA. Don&#x27;t know if that is even possible anymore. Low quality made in China seems to be the new normal. Oh, and one more thing. What the heck is this I read about your face may take a few weeks to get used to the razor? In the forty years I&#x27;ve used Norelco rotary razors, have never heard this before. Apparently new razor irritates your face until you &amp;#34;get used to it&amp;#34;. What if you have been using similar razor for years? Do you still need a break-in period? This sounds crazy to me. And one more excuse for cheaper, lower quality product with lack of quality control.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for anything before but I feel the need to say something:  1. The shave with the trimmer was bad - not as close as other razors b/c there is a metal strip blocking the cutters so it can&#x27;t get too close. Also it feels like it was installed backwards as it collapses when you use it.  2. The rotary blades gave me a terrible shave. :Left way too much stubble on my face  3. The object itself was light and felt cheap  4. It broke after 4 months - I didn&#x27;t treat this one any different than any of the other razors I have owned (those all lasted a few years each)  I have owned Norelcos since I was 14 (I am 37) and this was the last one I will ever buy. The shave was truly bad and the entire razor felt and acted cheap.  Good luck with yours if you buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by my purchase. This razor is more than I expected. It treems very smooth. The washable feature is amazing. But outstanding is the battery. It&#x27;s been over four weeks since I&#x27;ve charged the battery and I&#x27;ve been using it daily without having to charge the battery again. Very nice !!!</li>
    <li> This shaver works as advertised.  I get a close shave daily and have had no problems at all.  The rotary design causes difficulties in getting a clean line ag youd sideburns.  The pop up trimmer attachment is almost worthless though.  It does what it&#x27;s  designed to do and that&#x27;s shave you&#x27;d beard.  I would recommend this to everyone especially at this price.</li>
    <li> After every use of this product, I feel irrtation on skin. I tried to use in on dry or wet skin, even with shaving foam/gel, I got the irritation. I&#x27;m going back to Gillete Fusion.</li>
    <li> I shave my head since I have very little hair left up there.  This is not the best for that if you have two or three days growth.  It pulls badly.  I also notice that on the back of my neck it pulls badly and afterwards my skin burns. It works OK on my beard but again, only if you don&#x27;t go much past two days growth.</li>
    <li> I just bought this razor and got it at a bargain price ($47 incl shipping).  It works great.  I only use an elec razor periodically.  I&#x27;ll grab it if I&#x27;m rushed; o&#x27;wise I&#x27;m a safety razor guy.  I&#x27;d had my other Norelco for 22 years and it wasn&#x27;t doing the job very well anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The state of the art has changed, naturally, and this 7310 is lighter, quieter, faster, and does a great job.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a safety razor but then I didn&#x27;t expect it would.  It took off a two day beard very nicely and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  One feature I wanted was an elec cord so I didn&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge if it had been sitting awhile and this razor has that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once (just got it yesterday) but for the money I think it&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
    <li> this shaver is not good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather spend more next time and get a better brand.</li>
    <li> Totally useless.. I dont understand how this product got good rating. I tried using it for 3 weeks, but i never got used to this. It still hurts while shaving with it and I have stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving system for my boyfriend.  Before this product he ONLY used a razor.  After trying the Norelco 7310, he said he will never go back to using a razor again.  This shaving system saves us lots of money on wasted razors and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my boyfriend this shaver provides a very close and comfortable shave.  He doesn&#x27;t use any shaving cream, and has never gotten any knicks from the system either.  It is also very easy to clean and could easily be rinsed with water.  He comments all the time on how much he love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving system is definitely an affordable winner!</li>
    <li> For hair removal on flat surfaces this product works great.  Personally, shaving around my neck with this product irritates my skin and leaves my neck sensitive and red for a few days.  I still haven&#x27;t had much success getting as close of a shave as I would like on my neck either.  For the rest of my face and mustache area I have had no problems with this product, close clean shave with no adverse affects.  I didn&#x27;t have too much luck with the trimmer attached on the back, because it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short and simple of it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Close shave on flat surfaces, easy to clean, much better than other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Difficulty with the neck, trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim very close&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 3 stars because it performs adequately, but could do better in specific areas (shaving the neck, trimmer extension).</li>
    <li> As always, Norelco does it again. A good quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned three Norelco&#x27;s all giving fast shaves.&lt;br /&gt;This one, however,leaves a major razor burn, even after using it for a couple of months.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting better.  A very aggressive shave.</li>
    <li> Just got the 7310XL today, after a full charge I used it for the first time and I am very impressed. Highly recommended, especially for the price! An important note: The razor shaved my neck without any irritation! Something none of my previous electric razors have been capable of yet! It was also very fast, I thought I was going to have to make much more passes over my face, but it only took a couple circular motions over every little area. It&#x27;s also very very quiet, my other electrics were LOUD. The only downside is it isn&#x27;t a super close shave, like a razor, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this, and neither should you! But it is a closer shave than my other electric razors.</li>
    <li> I have always had a heavy beard, so I was never the ideal Norelco user, even &#x27;way back when.  But after avoiding Norelco shavers for approximately 35 years, I thought to be fair, they probably deserved another chance.  My experiences with them back in the early-to-mid 1970s weren&#x27;t very good, but a lot has happened since then, and I thought they were probably much better by now, even though they still look a lot like they did.    They&#x27;re lighter, because they&#x27;re mostly plastic now, where they used to be mostly metal.  They&#x27;re a bit better designed, and a bit easier to clean.  But the same old deal-breaking problem is still there: a long, slow shave - not a good thing for sensitive skin, or a guy in a hurry - and never a very close shave.  I guess I&#x27;m hopelessly spoiled at this point, because nothing will do anymore but a nice foil screen, like Panasonic or Braun, and preferably a single cutter - not two, not three.  With them, you can put the power where you want it, not wherever it wants to go.  Faster, closer, better.    I used this shaver for less than a month, and have since bought another Braun.  And not a moment too soon.</li>
    <li> It is a fabulous product. I got it about a week after purchasing it and it works very good. It gives you a real close shave and is easy to clean and charge. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. I tried it first when i hadn&#x27;t shaved for a week and it gave a smooth shave.  Till now I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver.  very less noise and easy to clean.  though i&#x27;m finding difficulty in shaving around neck area, still i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new electric razor.  I did not know one thing about it, but bought it because he needed one and he is very well pleased with it.  That I am delighted about as I did it without him knowing it.</li>
    <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close as I would like it, but it does a good job nonetheless for the money I paid for it. The battery life has been about 10-12 days. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I timed this razor for 5 minutes on my first shave, by the time I was done, it looked and felt like a manual razor had done the job without all the bleeding that usually comes with it.  It beat out my Braun foil shaver hands-down.  This shaver is also really quiet and it seems to spin rather slowly compared to what I was used to, however it is much faster and provides a better shave so I am very happy with this purchase.  I am a Philips user for life now.</li>
    <li> After my last Shaver was broken, I need a new one. This one is cheap. The top of the shaver is not very smooth. Anyway, I think it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> This shaver is much better than I had anticipated because it gives a clean shave, and the battery lasts for about 10 or more days without recharging.  My older electric shavers do not hold a charge this long, and they are heavier.  So far, I am rather impressed with it&#x27;s performance for a relatively inexpensive shaver.</li>
    <li> I really like this auto shaver face thing a lot.  It&#x27;s very quiet and doesn&#x27;t wake up sleeping dogs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I last used an electric shaver. This one impressed me as I get a close shave comperable to the one I was getting with the Mach 3 Turbo manual razor minus the shaving cream and replacement blades.    The battery life is amazing. It took much less time than is specified for it to charge(it&#x27;s at full once the green charge light starts blinking), and I&#x27;ve been using it while watching the morning news. I don&#x27;t use it every day as every 2 or 3 is enough for how fast my facial hair grows, but I still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it in over a month of use. Maybe some people have faces that are tougher to shave or are obessive about trying to get every last bit of facial hair(I have a couple spots that I get good enough since I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth an extra 10 minutes to make them perfect.)    Cleaning is easy, though you do need to shake it to get some of the hair out of the top.    I would reccomend this one over the more expensive counterpart as that one is only getting a bit fussy, and the design doesn&#x27;t look as nice as this one.</li>
    <li> This is the second of these razors that I have bought for my husband. Nothing super fancy, does the job. He actually liked this one a little better, as it has a longer charging cord than the first one purchased several years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco fan for a very long time and have owned 3 in the past. So when it came time to buy a new one, I looked through many reviews for the SensoTouch and tried to think of when I should spend $200 on a razor. It has all the bells and whistles, but the thing that really turned me off was the elevated design, which requires you to take the head off to clean it. I really like opening it up, washing it, then leaving it on the counter to dry.    So I look at this model, and it looks quite similar to the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past, and $30 seemed like a great bargain. I&#x27;ve never tried to buy replacement blades but I heard this is a similar price, so I couldn&#x27;t really go wrong.    When I got it, it was exactly as I imagined. It doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re holding $200, but it is nice and actually quite light. It&#x27;s actually quieter than my previous model as well. It worked very well and didn&#x27;t pull painfully. It doesn&#x27;t sound as strong as my previous either but I think that&#x27;s more developing technology than loss in power, because the shave was clean.    All in all I&#x27;m extremely happy with the purchase and figure I can use this for 2-3 more years before even thinking about replacing it. For me, this is the true value of Norelco, not the 3 dimensional, power gauging, self-cleaning one. I even thought about buying another one just in case it&#x27;s not $30 in 2-3 years, but I know from experience that letting a battery go unused that long is not good.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor at a drugstore last minute because I needed a razor at work when I left the house in a rush, without time to shave. It was the cheapest one on the rack, and I figured that was good enough for the \\&quot;once in a blue moon\\&quot; need. Wow, was I ever wrong! Now I&#x27;m buying another for home, because my old -- and expensive -- electric razor is being kicked to the curb.     This was by far the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric!  (and it was whisper-quiet too so I can shave without waking the house at 6 am)    If you&#x27;re like me, and haven&#x27;t updated your electric razor in a while, it&#x27;s time, guys!</li>
    <li> This thing is great! It&#x27;s like wiping your face clean with a washcloth. A painless, close shave-even on the neck- and very easy to clean. I&#x27;m sure someone makes a more perfect and very expensive razor but you really don&#x27;t need  better than this and for the money it&#x27;s an absolute steal! If you&#x27;re tired of shaving cream and cutting yourself definitely get one of these.</li>
    <li> I was pretty confident of my choice for this Norelco and it has worked like a charm .  Pros:   - Really close shave    - Handles the neck hair pretty efficiently   - Sufficiently quiet     Cons:     - Haven&#x27;t encountered yet !</li>
    <li> I had the older model for about 15 years and decided to upgrade. This is much lighter and quieter than the old one, and the pivoting heads are a nice touch. Part of the reason it is so much ligher is that the cord is no longer just a plain A/C cord going stright to the wall, but a DC power adapter. I have concerns about how it will hold up...but we will see.</li>
    <li> Since 2 weeks I got that, it works like a charm, nothing to complain. I don&#x27;t have a super harsh beard, but anyways that shaver is giving me same results as a razor blade (Sensor Excel, I stuck on that since 20 years without anything to complain, but I wanted an electric, cordless shaver). So I&#x27;m super satisfied with the product, and hey, it&#x27;s only 26$!</li>
    <li> Got the Razor as a christmas present this Christmas.  It gives a decent shave, but I find that I only get 4-5 shaves and have to recharge the razor.  Starting with about the third shave, it begins to slow down a lot, and the shave time pretty much doubles, further discharging the battery.  It is unfortunate that the manufacturers keep downsizing the batteries to save money, because with a better battery, the shaver would be decent.</li>
    <li> I have had two other Norelco shavers and this one is the best by far.  I love the ability to clean it under flowing water--it cleans very easily and keeps shaving a close as any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. After the first charge, I shaved for almost a month on one charge and when it did quit in the middle of a shave, I used it corded and easily finished my shave with no inconvenience of having to wait for it to recharge before I could use it.  We travel a lot in and outside the country, and although a lot of electrical tools have this worldwide charging ability, it is an added plus for this shaver to be so universally chargeable.  After checking out this shaver at Walgreens where it was priced $20 higher plus tax, I ordered it off Amazon and had it charging in about five days after ordering.  In short, I love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite gifts to my family and friends.  If I want to send gift to my family, the razors are the best choice. My dad loves this brand, and amazon is good place to buy the razors.</li>
    <li> My first 7310 broke 1 month after use, and so did the second. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy this shaver. Philips has far sturdier models available.</li>
    <li> my last electric shaver was starting to lose its battery life.  I bought it 9 years ago and paid north of a hundred dollars.  This shaver does just as good a job.  the shaver feels light in your hand and does not feel as solid as more expensive ones but the shave quality is the same. By nature an electric shaver does not cut as close as a razor but much more convenient.  I keep it in my car and recharge it on the weekends.  it makes it the 5 days with no problems.  It will charge while your shaving.  I do wish it had a battery gauge.  After all said and done I am happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I had assumed Phillips is a reputable company. i am wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product with a mail in rebate on reading all the fine print plus asking an amazon rep about its validity. To our surprise Phillips rejected our rebate without proper explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have reported this to Amazon, State Attorney general and BBB.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a review of their product.&lt;br /&gt;But I would never purchase another Phillips product.&lt;br /&gt;Why would I trust them again when we have so many other alternatives?&lt;br /&gt;Zero star rating if this were a review of Phillips customer service. Two star .. overall.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t purchase their products if you come across a rebate offer. Even if there is no promo, i wouldn&#x27;t trust any company who don&#x27;t stand by their words.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy a new electric razor after I got tired of constantly getting razor burn and never getting a close shave. I read the reviews for this product and it sounded like the razor of my dreams. Sadly, it really isn&#x27;t any better than my previous razor, even with brand new blades. I still get razor burn on my upper lip and under my jaw, and I have to run it cross my face dozens of times just to get a somewhat almost close shave. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this lower is because I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve found anything better.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shaver for my husband.  He is on Warfarin (blood thinner) so this was his choice and a great one.  It only last a couple months and the heads are shot.  We find it less of a hassle to just order a new shaver every couple months.</li>
    <li> This shaver is almost useless. It doesn&#x27;t shave very good, let alone a close shave. I have to keep going over and over to try to remove some of the hair.</li>
    <li> The only thing bad about this shaver is the way you have to empty the whiskers from the shaving heads. After you push the button under the bottom head, it flips open. When you dump it out, there is a tendency to shake the unit which may eventually break the flimsy hinge.</li>
    <li> This shaver was a Christmas present. I expected it would last a year,sadly it only lasted 2 months. It was decent while it lasted, though it never was close enough on my neck hair. 2 months usage out of a 50$ shaver is unacceptable to me. The shave balm that I received with it lasted longer. This is very cheaply made product and has made me lose all my confidence in Philips Norelco. I will not be purchasing from them again, and I will also tell every person I know not to buy it either. I will buy from all of Philips Norelco competitors but no longer from Philips Norelco. I will tell everyone and even strangers how horrible Philips Norelco is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company will never get another cent out of me.</li>
    <li> This  is the worse shaver that i have ever used.I am 77 years old so you know that i have used a great many shavers. This one will not cut your hair,but pull them out.After using this shaver i can not touch my face.I would not recommned this to anybody.They give you a crapy shaver for the money,i would not take one free.</li>
    <li> Works better than my previous Norelco shaver.  Love that it is wireless and the battery lasts me forever (about 2 weeks).  Very convenient that it is waterproof, so I can just run it under hot water and leave out to dry after use.</li>
    <li> where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!&lt;br /&gt;where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!&lt;br /&gt;where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!&lt;br /&gt;where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!&lt;br /&gt;where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!where is my rebate???  cheater!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the shaving system for my husband during holidays.  The shaving system is ok but never received my $10 rebate.  I will never buy any shaving system from Philips.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Quick delivery. You could spend more for some extra features, but why bother. Once charged the battery life is great. It does a great job shaving. I would recommend this razor to anyone looking foe an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Great - does good contouring and two-three passes gets everything. Do not buy another budget shaver - this is the best.</li>
    <li> I have been trying electric shavers every 2-3 years, and every one i tried so far used irritate my skin, and I go back to using regular shaver. This is the first one its worked for me, no irritation, and pretty close shave. I am still giving a 3 star because of two reasons&lt;br /&gt;1) Manufacturer didn&#x27;t honor the rebate&lt;br /&gt;2) The shaving heads are so thin, that they kinda bent and they started spinning with the blades. It was a easy fix just to flatten them out so that blades dont jam under the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that after 4 months of use they still seems to be doing a reasonable job.</li>
    <li> Weak.  If you have wiry whiskers and more than one days growth, it&#x27;s torture when running (pulls rather than cuts) and will stall out easily.</li>
    <li> ****Please note that I decided to tighten and revise this review, as I have had this razor for several years.  I would now give it 4 stars for quality, 5 stars for value.  My initial opinion was too negative.  This shaver provides a fairly standard Norelco (i.e. 3 head rotary shaver) shave.  This is my third Norelco (well second, but I bought a third one recently), and by far the lowest priced one I&#x27;ve owned.  If you like the Norelco shave, I think this is an excellent value.  Of course, many prefer the Braun/Phillips type single head razors, but it seems there is no way to tell who will prefer which.  If you have never tried a Norelco, this would be a good model to try because of the low price.  I now have an 8345 (which is the same as the 8340 but comes with extra heads) in addition to this one.  The 8345 may be more money and newer, but they look, feel and shave fairly similarly.  8345 has more holes on the heads (can only be good I guess) but the motor sounds like it runs a lot slower.  They seem to shave about as well, but the cheaper 7310 actually seems a bit gentler on the face (maybe because the 8345 has more holes but runs slower).  The 7310 feels generally solid enough and comfortable in the hand.  Feels like all the Norelco&#x27;s do, more or less.  The pop up trimmer seems reasonably solid, and functions like all of these pop-up trimmers do.  It will shave your sideburns, but you may or may not be satisfied with it.  Nature of the beast.  The plug is also a little on the large side, which could be an issue for traveling, though not that bad really.  I dont think it came with a travel case, but I could have misplaced it.  The battery cannot be changed easily because its welded in.  At $40-50 for the razor, I suppose that is not a huge issue, but its not a plus factor either.  I think this is true of all Norelcos.  This razor does hold a charge for quite a while, its good for several shaves without a recharge.  However, there is no charge indicator at all.  There is a green light that comes on when the razor is on, and another green light when its plugged in, but nothing changes as the battery gets low that I can see.  You know it needs a charge when the motor starts to slow.  A 5 or 10 minute emmergency charge is fine, so its not a great problem.  About the only difference between this razor and the $100+ Norelco I used to own was that the expensive one had a battery charge indicator.  Maybe there was more metal and less plastic in the more expensive one, but...so what?  I have had this razor for 2 1/2 years, and use it about every other day.  Maybe the battery doesnt last as long and the heads are duller, but its nothing I notice.  I have put 0 money in it, and it still works well and compares well to my other electric razors.  Verdict:  good shaver if you like Norelco&#x27;s, and a bargain at $40-50.  Spending more money is recommended if you want a batter charge indicator, but beyond that, not clear to me what you get for your extra money.  If you like the Braun-type razors better, I dont know of any reason why this one would convert you, but I can otherwise recommend this razor pretty strongly.</li>
    <li> This is my third electric after having two mid-priced Remington shavers. Decent shave and comfortable, the trimmer on the back doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as my previous razors, and unlike the Remington&#x27;s which flip the trimmer in and out with one switch this razor pops the trimmer out with a switch then you have to push it back in. Not that that&#x27;s really a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one weird thing about it is it has two bright green LED&#x27;s on the front which are steady when it&#x27;s charging and then blink furiously once it&#x27;s charged. The majority of the time it just sits plugged in in the bathroom, so it&#x27;s usually charged and flashing away. Really it makes more sense to me to have it flash while charging then steady when it&#x27;s done. Anyway if you don&#x27;t mind waking up to go in the middle of the night and having your bathroom strobing green like a rave party then it&#x27;s a good shaver.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands-down the fastest and closest electric shaving experience I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has lost my business, and Norelco gets both my respect and gratitude for a simply outstanding product at an affordable price.  If you&#x27;re like me and seek value for money then check it out.</li>
    <li> I have used Phillips Norelco for many years. But, this particular one was really bad!!! It hasn&#x27;t worked since several months ago: its switch was out of finction (either suddenly started during midnight by itself or unable to run). Can the company contact to me??</li>
    <li> This is nothing like what they use to make about 5 or 6 years ago.  It is not a good example of their lift and cut system</li>
    <li> I replaced my old razor also a Norelco, about 15 years old with this one.  The new one is lighter, less noisily, and cuts closer.  I recharged it after I got it and it has worked for about 4 weeks, without needing a charge.  I brush out the base and rise the cutters and leave it open to dry.  My only nit pick is that it would be good to show battery condition, but this would increase the cost.    I like the rinse off head feature.  It stays clean.    I would recommend this unit..</li>
    <li> Hands down the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  This thing weighs about as much as an empty beer can, is very quiet running and consistently delivers an excellent shave.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 54, spent 20 years in the Air Force (where I shaved daily) and currently shave my medium-heavy beard four or five times a week.  I&#x27;ll bet I have owned a dozen or so electric shavers over the years with varying results, but the bottom line with all of them is..........they do not work well enough to replace my razor.  This one does. (I keep a razor handy for a that tricky spot right under my nose.  Other than that, this is all I use.)  Great product!!  Nice job Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  Amazon is by far my favorite retailer....Period  .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a week now and just can&#x27;t seem to get a close shave.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and still i need to shave twice a day and go over my face many times.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of razors but none have been as bad as this one.  Pay a litle more and get something that works.</li>
    <li> Turned my poor husband&#x27;s face into hamburger meat.  The instructions said that you skin might have to get used to using this shaver.  My question is, \\&quot;Why would you want to suffer until your skin is used to it?\\&quot; Just buy something that doesn&#x27;t irritate your face!  His previous shaver didn&#x27;t cause irritation. He quit using this thing and got something that didn&#x27;t abuse his skin.</li>
    <li> My old Phillips Norelco finally gave up after only 30 years.  I purchased the closest I could find toa replacement.  It works better than I had expected.</li>
    <li> Norelco is always a great product. I just retired my 5 year old electric shaver from them, just because I was bored with it.&lt;br /&gt;This one I purchased for my grandfather so he would stop having to use shaving gel and razor blades. He loves the shaver, he said its very easy to use and clean. It also holds a charge for a good deal of time.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect well priced razor!</li>
    <li> Amazon service was excellent; I received the item before I was expecting it.  I guess you get what you pay for. It feels cheap but somehow it does the job. The power cord is really annoying. It feels very very cheap and it doesn&#x27;t curl like the previous one I had. Things made in china are affordable but the quality is still very low.</li>
    <li> Seems to be good value and atractive price; performs well so far but I have it for only a short time; lighter and easier to use than my previous Norelco shavers, which I liked better than Braun or Schick</li>
    <li> The worst shaver I ever had. 3rd philips and always downhill. Finaly I gave up on Philips. Shaves badly, hurts and takes forever if ever gets there. I end up ordering new rotary blades for a non-philips I had and shelved this Norelco.</li>
    <li> After using a series of Braun shavers for 20 years, I decided to see how the Norelco would work out. My first reaction was that it was so light and plastic, it felt like a toy. However, after a month of use I can say this low cost alternative stacks up pretty well. I am satisfied with the performance, let&#x27;s just hope the unit lasts. It is also markedly quieter than my previous Braun. I&#x27;ve had no problem transitioning to the rotary head. Good value for the money so far...</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace one that I have had for several years  that is  the same model . I replaced it because the blades had gotten dull . When I shopped for replacement blades online I found that there as an option of replacement blades or an atachment which sharpens the existing blades . Each of these cost about half the price of a new shaver . I concluded that given the age of my shaver the best thing to do was to purchase a new shaver . I hoped that the latest model would be better in some way than the older one , which seems to be true . The trimmer of the older model seemed to not work as well as some shavers I had owned previously . The new one seems better . Also the speed, even when fully charged of the older shaver seemed to me to be a little slow even when it was new . The new shaver does seem to rotate faster. So all things considered I think this shaver works well and is priced fairly among its competitors . And I am enjoying not having to work so hard shaving  with dull blades !</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electic razor since I first started shaving regularly and my dad got me one.  I switched to non-electric when I got on my own.  I recently decided that an electric shaver would be a good Father&#x27;s Day present for my kids to get me.  I checked the ratings on Consumer Reports and this one was best bang for the buck there.  I didn&#x27;t have ANY trouble switching.  No 3 week period of rashes or ingrown hair though I am having some slight redness on parts of my neck that goes away quickly.  The sideburn trimmer works very well to shorten things up for shaving when I let it go for a few days.  This thing is GREAT.</li>
    <li> i have been through many shavers in my time.with kind of a tough beard, i usually go 6 months till my electric needs new blades.last couple have been remington&#x27;s, but this norelco is one of the best shavers i have ever had!absolutely cant beat it for the price.i almost ordered another one just to have it when this one wears out.still sharp after 4 or 5 months, and my neck hair is tough as nails.</li>
    <li> I had my last electric razor for many years, but slowly it lost its ability to serve.  My shave was not as close and the hair on my neck remained untouched.  To clean up my face I switched to a manual razor for awhile.  Father&#x27;s day changed things.  I received this Philips Norelco 7310XL as an early Father&#x27;s day gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like several things about this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It provides a close shave&lt;br /&gt;It shaves the hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;It does not hurt my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is fully washable - my last one was a pain to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;It has a two year warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the best feature is the very close shave I get with this product.  This razor is almost as good as a razor blade for providing a close shave.  I tried alternating between the razor blade and the electric razor and it is tough to tell the difference.  This electric razor is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
    <li> This shaver is better than I expected!!  I shave my head and my beard with it, use it to trim my stash also@  I would HIGHLY recommend this for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent shaver, and you&#x27;ve probably read all about it in the other reviews, so I&#x27;ll take about my one gripe:    This does not give a very close shave. You&#x27;ll have to do 2-3 run throughs to achieve the baby-smoothness a manual razor will give you the first time through. The smaller, pop-out shaver on the back of this thing is great for manscaping, but the main three-head shaver isn&#x27;t very good. I switched back to manual razors for shaving my face, especially after I saw skin under a microscope that had been shaved with manual and electric razors. The manual razors left a nice, even pattern, but the electric shavers left the skin dry and irritated, and created unevenness in the pattern of new hair growth.    That aside, this is really convenient for quick dry shaves, but I&#x27;d stick to a manual razor or go for a higher quality electric shaver if I were you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a shaving cream and razor kind of guy and I am not picky about razors.  I actually like using cheap disposable razors that are &#x27;worn&#x27; because I have sensitive skin.  I saw this for a really good price at amazon so I brought it to see if this better than a razor and I have to say that it is very good.  This Philips shaver kind of irritates my skin but for the shave, it is not bad if you are in a hurry.  Although this is probably not a big problem since all new razors and shavers irritates your skin.    The thing that irritates me about this shaver is its packaging and certainly not one of those &#x27;frustration free&#x27; packaging.  Rather it takes me about 5 minutes to open the box and hack into the blister packaging before I could take the shaver out.  Other than that, I might use this from now on.</li>
    <li> This shaver is quiet and shaves closer than any electric that I can remember (mostly braun and a few older Norelcos). Considering I was able to get this for $30 shipped it was a steal (as long as I can get a year or so out of it). It feels a little cheaper than some of the other shaves that I had but its the shave that matters.</li>
    <li> I cleans easy, close enough shave on the face if i am in a hurry but perfect for keeping my head shaved.</li>
    <li> I have always used a Mach 3 type razor. I like shaving with a blade because of the closeness of the shave... but it just takes too long. That is why I decided to try this electric razor out.  After two days of using this electric razor, I am impressed:   (1) It cuts closer than I thought it would. Someone gave me an electric razor a long time ago and I gave it away because it just didn&#x27;t cut efficiently. This razor gave me a smooth face (from a face full of thick stubble) in a matter of minutes. It takes about 60 seconds to get rid of a 5 oclock shadow.  (2)Cleaning is a breeze. Just pop it open an run it under hot water.  (3) I like the way it looks.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. It gives a close shave everytime. I&#x27;m very happy with it and would definitely reccomend it to others.</li>
    <li> Great product!    High CP value if you get it on sale ($28).    Smooth and comfort to shave with it.    recommended!!</li>
    <li> ive had all kinds of shavers, and for the money, this delivers the best value. i really recommend this product to all the men out there there. thank you.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a year.  Liked it so much, bought it for my father as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes attests hewing several comments any this product as I felt it could be a perfect alternate solution for my conventional shaving.. Well, agreeing first use and the continued use for abt 2 weeks, i found several issueslisted below    1. I have to scrub the same area 7-8 times atleast for a nice shave  2. Even still there are small patches of unshaved hair  3. Some kind of reaction on skin which produces pimples and itching feeling..    The only good thing abt this product is it&#x27;s battery power</li>
    <li> Perfect, my husband loves it. It is wonderful with this good quality! Everyone should buy one. I will buy ones for my friends.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever bought.  Went cheap because I didn&#x27;t know what I was getting my self into.  Been using this razor for a few months to shave my head and so far not a single complaint.  It gives a nice smooth shave, the battery last several shaves (the most I&#x27;ve tried is three and it still worked) between charges, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  Not a single complaint - it&#x27;s simple, functional, and reliable.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> For 28.99 Had a 10$  promo code, this shaver is doing better then expected, have owned for only 25 days and after charging for 8 hours I have not had 2 recharge yet after at least 20 shaves.I am 50 and used cheap rotary all my life and this cuts the closest of any shaver that I have owned and do not think I have ever paid over 60$ for a shaver because I am cheap. You do have to work the neck area a couple three times but shaving everyday takes maybe 2 minutes and that 5 oclock shadow is not their anymore, for the cleaning part have not used hot water on it yet just seems weird to me but I will get their eventually, I just tap tap the heads and then blow it out and its looks clean to me. I will update later.The shaver is 40$ but wait for a promo code 10$ off and you will like it even more.</li>
    <li> The power was not so good.    But in all, I like this product</li>
    <li> lasted about 2 years of hard use (traveling) before the battery died and it would not recharge. Am buying another more expensive model.</li>
    <li> I had a similarly priced razor from Remington that chewed up the skin on my neck and gave me really bad razor burn but this one is a night and day difference. It doesn&#x27;t leave any hairs behind and it&#x27;s easy on my skin.  This is a really good value.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd electric shaver and by far the worst, it feels like it pulls your hair off 1 by 1 in a painful matter, it ALWAYS leaves hairs out no matter how many times you try, it feels really weak as if its not fully charged has no power compared to my previous 2, im returning it today. I was fooled by all the positive reviews, something is off here.</li>
    <li> this works good and i am pleased with it. I got it for my son for christmas and he likes it alot  thanks  donna</li>
    <li> A cost effective model of Norelcos most effectively designed recharging shaver type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old norelco finally died after years... but I can&#x27;t spend 100$ to replace it so I picked this up for 30$ and I am impressed !&lt;br /&gt;  A very good shave, not baby faced but VERY close, comfortable to hold, it also now allows water cleaning (nice) and also has a swing out head to clean out the blades which is a really good design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To any pragmatic folks who like 80/20 (80% of function with 20% of the cost) this shaver is awesome value.  I may buy a second at this price and leave it in the closet for a few years.</li>
    <li> I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS SHAVER AND I PLAN ON RETURNING IT WITHIN THE 45 DAY TRIAL PERIOD.</li>
    <li> Had to use a number of times for my face to adjust&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate have to do rating just to purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a similar (corded, non-portable) Norelco razor which ate one of its teeth. It&#x27;s very quiet, does a decent job shaving and the run-it-under-the-faucet-to-clean feature is extremely useful. I think my previous (10-12 year-old) Norelco got clogged up, contributing to its violent end.</li>
    <li> I read the previous reviews when I was looking for an inexpensive shaver to replace my previous shaver whose battery would barely hold a charge. It sounded  like this one would do everything I needed and the price was very reasonable.  So far I have been very happy with it. The shave is good. The battery life is outstanding. The only thing I wish it had was a battery charge indicator so you know when the battery is (finally) getting low. I would definitely  purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I needed replacement heads for my 10 year old razor, but they were more expensive than buying this razor. I like this one, no charging doc, just a cord. The only issue I have with this one is it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power the other did even at full charge, it still shaves great, just seems quieter and less powerful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver almost a year ago based on all the good reviews. Now I&#x27;m looking to buy another shaver because I can&#x27;t stand this one anymore.  I&#x27;m confused by the reviews that say this thing shaves extra close. This never happened for me. I have to shave the same area over and over to get a decent shave, but by 10am I can feel the stubble and by 5pm it almost looks like I skipped shaving that day. It&#x27;s just not effective.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because most other things about it are good - quiet motor, good trimmer, good battery life. But it doesn&#x27;t do its primary duty of giving a close shave.   If you are on a tight budget and don&#x27;t mind a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, then this may work for you.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco Triple-head user for decades. When my old one finally needed replacement I decided to go w/ this one. I&#x27;m  extremely pleased w/ this shaver. Great shave &amp; great features at a very reasonable price. Would buy again &amp; recommend!</li>
    <li> I am impressed by the performance and the price point is very good for a razor of this quality. Offers quick and close shave and the battery life is good.</li>
    <li> I have an old (only in years) Norelco 4853XL that I got when I was a teenager in high school.  It has been over 10 years and that still works but I wanted to see what technology has done since then.  The 4853XL is very similar to the 7310XL with most of the same features and I usually use it plugged into the wall now since the rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t work so well and the blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7310XL is awesome.  Improved grip and design.  The blades are able to cut I would say about 10% closer than the 4853XL.  When it comes to hair, that is pretty good.  The side burn trimmer has been improved.  What I notice is that it is not as loud as the 4853XL.  Not sure if that is because the rotary blades are spinning slower or if they don&#x27;t need to spin as fast as before because of improved design.  I like how you can wash the blades even though you could on the old model by just removing the compartment and hitting it on the sink to get the hair out and then spraying water through the blades.  Not sure if the 4853XL was designed for that but it still works after over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: the 7310XL is probably the best men&#x27;s face shaver you can buy.  It is better than the more expensive ones because you aren&#x27;t getting much improvement at the higher price.  It is also definitely not one of the cheaper brands.  I was able to get it for under $30 and hopefully it last just as long as the 4853XL - which still runs great even today.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT ONE FOR MYSELF, IT WAS SO GREAT I GOT ONE FOR MY INLAW ! I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE THAT LOVES A CLOSE SHAVE!</li>
    <li> I got this on black Friday for $17. It is so cheap and works very well. The battery is good too, I used for a week not running out yet. I love it.</li>
    <li> Since I buy this things, I always told my friends, this is good to buy , for your father and you husband, low price but high quality,easy to use, this is best gift to all boy.</li>
    <li> This is certainly a very basic shaver, as its price would indicate.  I was a little taken aback by the quality, however, given Norelco&#x27;s reputation. It feels and sounds like a toy, and shaves no better than my old Norelco (more expensive) which is seven years old. It&#x27;s not bad, and certainly worth the price, but maybe...you&#x27;ll want to go a step up.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on the black Friday of 2011. It is a great deal with nice price! I will recommend it to all of my friends for sure.</li>
    <li> this is the second time I got this razor. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new one on sale than replacement heads. Works well,great for driving and shaving when late of work. The trimmer works much better than the China knock-off.</li>
    <li> A functional machine with useful features.  It cuts whiskers, which is it&#x27;s purpose.  It cuts them within microns of their tiny little follicles.  This design is an old one, and it still works.  For the money, the best value in shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought my boyfriend this razor for Christmas after reading reviews and looking at other ones.  My boyfriend has now used it several times, and really likes  it.  It shaves very smooth, and feels very nice on his skin.  I asked him to rate it overall from 1-10, and he gave it an 8.  With that, it was well worth the price, which was a lot cheaper than a lot of other razors that I looked at.  The only thing he didn&#x27;t like was that even with shaving his longer facial hair down first, it took several times over.  It seems to only be meant for pretty short facial hair.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the same for all razors, since I don&#x27;t use them.  Overall, he really likes it, and I am very happy with this purchase.  It arrived in 2 days and before Christmas, and I ordered it right before Christmas. It arrived in good condition, no problems there.  Would definitely recommend this, because it&#x27;s just as good as the more expensive razors of its caliber.</li>
    <li> Why was I still shaving the way my dad does?  Funny isn&#x27;t? But yes, 40+ years old and was still using a blade and cream, just the way my dad taught me.   I shave every other day and charge the device every other week. It works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> I must first admit that, due to the price (it was on sale here on Amazon) I had low expectations. Boy was I wrong. It shaves very close and is quieter than a more expensive shaver that I own. I definitely feel that it&#x27;s worth more than I paid for it and I would buy again,(especially if it&#x27;s on sale).&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I am well pleased and have no regrets about this purchase.</li>
    <li> excelente producto, llego en buenas condiciones, totalmente nuevo y empaquetado en caja original..! lo acabo de utilizar y el resultado es inigualable...!</li>
    <li> I gave the Norelco 7310 to my father as a gift, replacing his old worn out Norelco. The razor was delivered as promised and has performed as expected. My elderly father thinks the Norelco is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and a great price!! I have had the Phillips Norelco razor for over five years and besides changing the blades it has worked without flaw. I highly recomend! \\&quot;This fully washable shaver allows you to rinse the shaver under the tab every time after use. You can count on a comfortable and close shave every day.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Very comfortable! The period of revolution very is also long, the price is materially beneficial! The only insufficient outward appearance is ordinary!</li>
    <li> I am surprised every morning to hear (barely) this Norelco 7310XL purr as it cleanly does its job. Almost sounds like a tiny VW bug from times past and you will wonder if it is really working, but it does. (It&#x27;s not an impressive \\&quot;Binford 5000\\&quot;). Corded and very light, it is very basic. Easy to clean (says it&#x27;s washable, but I haven&#x27;t tried that). And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the same Norelco shaver for the last 15 years or so.  I don&#x27;t clean it as often as I should and am sure I have not followed the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions for maintenance very well.  That being said, the thing still works pretty well and the only reason I decided it was time for a new one was that the battery has started to go and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  I&#x27;ve had a couple other razors over time(both gifts) of the micro screen type.  On one of them the screen wore out fairly quickly and the other just didn&#x27;t shave close or efficiently enough and pulled whiskers enough to cause slight pain.  I knew that a screen shaver was not for me, and I&#x27;ve had good experience with Norelco, which lead me to this shaver.  I read many reviews on the 7310 and other similar items and settled on this one mostly due to the good reviews and cost.  At the time there was an online coupon for $10, bringing the price down to $20.  I was a bit disappointed when I powered it on (after full charge) and could barely hear the motor.  I have a thick beard so I was hoping that a new shaver would have some noise to it, and I suppose my assumption was that the louder, the more powerful.  I have to say that although the motor does sound weak, it shaves surprisingly well and close.  In fact, I normally use a combo of electric and razor - electric to go around some bumps and then a traditional razor for that extra close shave.  During the first couple weeks, the shave has been so close that I couldn&#x27;t justify breaking out the shaving cream and razor, it just wasn&#x27;t necessary.  I also like the fact that the heads are waterproof and can be cleaned under a faucet. I&#x27;ve been using the razor for two weeks and so far am very pleased.  I give it 4 stars only because I reserve 5 stars for items that completely blow me away beyond my expectations.  This item didn&#x27;t knock my socks off, but it is a great value for the money and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Norelco is a good standard name brand for Electric Razors. 40 years ago I owned an Electric shaver by Norelco. Since trying this one, (because I have usually been discouraged by them) the technology has finally advanced with this new design, new materials and new cutting technology. I recommend it but pay attention to the battery charging method. Also I recommend in the electronics section for (dry air in a spray can used to blow dust away in electrical contacts and PCB&#x27;s) to quickly clean dust away, easier to clean that way for me.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only had this razor for about a month, it seems to be a quality product. I did have to leave home for 2 1/2 weeks and forgot the charging cord. The razor was fully charged and it lasted the whole trip, something my older Norelco could not do. It was also a racehorse deal for only 29.95. I&#x27;ve seen it in stores for as much as 54.95.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product. I have always had a good experience with this type of shaver. I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> It was time to replace the blades on my aging Norelco razor.  When searching for refills, I came across the 7310 for nearly the same price as the refills.  I was a bit skeptical given the price but decided to give it a try.  This was replacing a 15 year-old Norelco and design has changed significantly.  Overall, it feels a bit cheaper to me, but shaves as well if not better than the old.  So far it is holding up just fine.  Battery life is not quite as good as my old razor, but still plenty good.  One complaint: when the battery dies, it does not fade slowly like the old razor did.  Instead, it dies fairly abruptly.  This can be a nuisance, but easily avoided by charging more frequently.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The shaver is decent and the charge time is good.  I gave a 2 star review because I got this shaver because there was a manufacture rebate that would bring down the cost. The rebate was not honor. Philips writes \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions.\\&quot; I wish either Amazon or Philips would warn that the rebate would not go through because there was an Amazon discount before check out. Boo-urns for Amazon and Philips.</li>
    <li> Good product, excelent</li>
    <li> The product was excellent and the delivery was quick.  I will definitely do business with this seller again!</li>
    <li> espectacular las rasuradas son muy buenas y no me irrita el cortador de patillas es muy silencioso y la pila dura mucho</li>
    <li> I ordered the Philips Norelco 7310 electric razor when I first got to Afghanistan. I was expecting being out here it would take a long time to ship, but it got to me surprisingly fast (about 12 days from the states, to Okinawa and finally to Afghanistan.) It came fully charged and packaging completely intact. It&#x27;s great for anyone in the military to have, especially those who spend a lot of time outside the wire where there is no running water to use a regular razor to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to talk about the razor its self.... Good quality in general. The motor is a little slow for my liking, but the heads are sharp as can be so it still cuts really smooth, really fast. The trimmers are kind of chintsy and don&#x27;t do the best job at trimming or lining up which is the reason for the 4 star instead of 5. I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the cheap plastic cover that guards the cutting heads. It never wants to stay on when I&#x27;m not using it. Fixing the problem was as simple as adding some electrical tape to give it a little tighter hold. Charge time - AWESOME for how long it can be used. You can shave every day for 3 weeks and only have to throw it on the charger for 3-4 hours and it&#x27;s back to full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would deff recommend to anyone. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it and the shave you get from it and the awesome battery life is that or better than some of the $100+ electric razors out there.</li>
    <li> Best product for the money. Bought it on Black Friday for only 10 bucks and it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have bought this shaver on Thanksgiving because price looked good with 10$ rebate. When I got it, it did not look good but I thought that for the price with rebate it is ok,&lt;br /&gt;but without rebate I would return it. So I sent rebate. After more than 4 month I received  standard card with response  that manufacture&#x27;s discounts taken  at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotion. In condition of rebate there was no such restriction, they only referred specifically to some 5$ instant rebate offer, and vaguely stating that such rebate offers are not eligible, but  there was no 5$ rebate on Amazon. I called Philips and they told me that products bought for even little discounted price anywhere (in Walmart, Target, on Amazon, any other internet or B&amp;M retailer)  are not eligible for rebate. So it looks like circulating rebate offer was ploy to entice buyer to buy product and not able to return it after long period of waiting for rebate and with cut UPC code.  It seems to be true looking at number of people hoping to get rebate  and  at complaints of not getting it in reviews.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these for my friends as Christmas gifts. One said, he did not like it. It felt rough. And the other one broke one of the blades after a couple of uses. Now, if two people told me that about a product I would stay away from it. Personally, I love Philips Norelco. I own a SensoTouch 3D and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 3 years, it works still great, and good power durability and easily to handle</li>
    <li> I have had the same Norelco cordless shaver for 25 years and loved it...I had heard all sorts of horror stories about how inexpensive shavers are junk so it was with great trepidation that I ordered a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; (&lt;$50) razor even though the reviews were good and Consumer Reports didn&#x27;t think it was awful...I have to say so far i am delighted...close shaves, long time between charges, unbelievably easy to clean...what can I say?</li>
    <li> Somewhat of a close shave without water/cream, and a slightly worse (not as close of a) shave with water. and cream. Regardless with or without this one seems to randomly PLUCK / PULL my hair out sometimes and its PAINFUL!!!  My last higher/pricier model Norelco didnt do this and worked great, but sorry i cant say the same for this model, i guess thats the difference in paying $150+ vs $70+. Worst of all this razor seems to give me &amp;#34;razor bumps&amp;#34; 5x more than my prior norelco razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver about 2 years &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with it. No problems at all, holds a charge for 2 weeks. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaving system. It gives me a close shave with out any cuts or discomfort. I  recommend this product  100%</li>
    <li> I bought this bargain razor at WM about 3 years ago.  It is still going strong.  I know I spent less that $45.00 for it and now it is twice the price??  Not such a bargain anymore.  I bought a blade sharpening kit and it worked well the first couple of times but now it is time to replace the blades.</li>
    <li> Great gift.  He liked his gift and his face feels smooth.  Good battery life.  Going on three or four years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver some time ago. It arrived well packaged with no damage. Delivery was as promised. Still very happy with my purchase. Recharges quickly and the charge lasts a long time. Cleans up easy and stays sanitary by running under hot or cold water. Couldn&#x27;t be any easier. Runs quiet and slow. However, does a good job with no nicks or rashes. I have a mustache and sideburns. The trimmer does a good job of keeping me well groomed. Buy it. you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I love this Phillips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s System because it&#x27;s bulit with a rechargeable battery and it has a battery charger to plug into the wall to charge the battery everytime it gets weak or goes dead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Norelco electric razor for 2 years and have finally decided to try and find something that can provide a close shave and not painfully pull the hairs out of my face rather than cut them. This was my first electric razor (and I&#x27;m over 60). At first I was enamored with the novelty. It did give a close shave if you spent enough time going back over your face (and grinding it in to get it close). And it was ok as long as I didn&#x27;t let my beard grow out for more then 2 days. With a 3-day growth it pulled the hairs and was quite painful. It&#x27;s gotten less effective over time and in fairness there is recommended maintenance to reposition the cutters periodically, which I haven&#x27;t done. Also has a good battery life. It was also much less expensive when I bought it 2 years ago ($39).</li>
    <li> great shave what else can I say .... replaced older norelco and I am happy wit this purchase closer to shave</li>
    <li> I received this as a replacement to a defective 7110 and was reasonably impressed with the performance after charging it overnight.  Three days later I was on my first stroke and the shaver stopped completely with no warning at all.  I waited about 30 seconds and it started back up and again ran for about 10 seconds.  The battery and motor weren&#x27;t up to the challenge of a one-day beard after only 3 uses.  That&#x27;s not good enough for me - it&#x27;s back in the box and heading back to Phillips along with the 7110.</li>
    <li> I recently replaced my Panasonic ES8097A with this model, which is about half the price of the Panasonic.  This Philips model is quieter than all linear blade razors that I&#x27;ve used.  The first charge on the battery actually lasted 23 days for me, although I&#x27;m a pretty easy shave.  The battery dies suddenly and then you can plug it in to finish a shave (with full power to it).  The shave is close enough that I no longer do a manual shave once a week and this model does a great job on my neck compared to previous linear blade systems as well.  For ~$45, this is a great deal so far.</li>
    <li> I hope it lasts as long as the Norelco shaver I had purchased in 1980!  This one is smooth as silk...and  quiet as a mouse</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy with this shaver. Said it was in some ways  better then the more expensive one.</li>
    <li> Superb product.  I have both the Philips Norelco 7310 and the 7340 - at different homes.  Both are high quality products.  I have had no issues.  Over a long period of time.  The only difference between the 7310 and the 7340 is the three  circular cutting heads.  The 7310 has straight slots for cutting while the 7340 has straight slots and tiny holes.  Some prefer the 7340 because of the tiny holes.  I actually prefer the 7310.  But for me there  is no difference in usage or outcome.&lt;br /&gt;I was a disposable razor person for decades.  Lots of money spent on all brands of disposable razors.  It seems that the disposable razors have gotten cheaper duller blades over the decades requiring the purchase of more and more disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  every persons skin is different.  Hair is different.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick facial hair.  The (any) disposable - and I tried them all - would only last at most 2 days/two shaves. Costs add up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco 7310 is a cordless shaver.  The charge stays strong for me for days.  No issues with battery or charge.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco 7310 and 7340 appear more sturdy then the newer replacement Norelco models.&lt;br /&gt;All are Made in China.  The days of Made in USA are few now.&lt;br /&gt;I have read all of the negative one star comments.  I guess some folks are not satisfied for whatever reason.&lt;br /&gt;These models 7310 and 7340 are discontinued.  But still available.  I have read that the newer models are not as good.&lt;br /&gt;Both the 7310 and the 7340 have washable heads.  Which I do frequently for my own satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;These cordless shavers are the best for my usage.  I have purchased one spare for future use.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any issues of chaffing skin or such.  Always a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Both my 7310 and my 7340 are over one year old and still operating perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Gave this shaver to my father-in-law for Father&#x27;s Day.  He was in a rehab facility at the time.  Here it is 6 months later &amp; he&#x27;s still raving about it..</li>
    <li> Fantasic electric shaver. Although, you should stick to how often they tell you to replace the shaver heads because after almost 2 years of owning the product, i just decided to replace the shaver heads and it made a world of difference!  (PS: I shave about 2-3 times a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenotes:&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and effective</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall purchasing this product If I did I don&#x27;t ever recall it coming in. It would be nice to have any tracking info. I feel stupid asking about this since it took place back in 2011 but this is the first time I have ever noticed this item on my purchase list.&lt;br /&gt;Thanx,&lt;br /&gt;JAmes</li>
    <li> Really Nice, Works perfectly. is what i was looking for in this product. Recommended 100 %, Easy to use. Excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these in 2009 and it still works great and holds a charge for months of daily shaving. Went on a trip and packed it in a bag that was left behind. So I borrowed another new shaver that simply could not shave me even after 20 passes and gave up. Grew a beard and the 7310 had no trouble shaving it off when I got home. It simply works awesome for years.</li>
    <li> Philips is Chinese for Garbage -less than 2 years using it a couple times per week it will no longer charge - changed charger cord still nothing - Philips says it is a known problem but refuses to replace or repair it because I phoned 26 months after purchase - they sold garbage, admit its garbage but refuse to stand behind their product- never ever buy Philips Garbage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 6 years, and it still works as it should, the rechargeable batteries still hold a charge (but not as well as it used to), and, surprisingly, I&#x27;m still using the original razor heads, but they are past due for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it compare to a regular (disposable) razor?  Well, when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have much time to shave, I use this electric razor; but only as long as my beard stubble is very short, if I had shaved the day before.  If my stubble is more than two days old, this razor can&#x27;t handle it.  It tends to start pulling my beard hair instead of cutting it.  OUCH!  Also, it does NOT cut as close as a blade, not close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I use a blade to shave with because I want a good close shave, and only use this electric razor for an occasional quick shave/touch-up.  In my many years of experience, no electric razor can shave a close as a blade.  That&#x27;s all there is to it.</li>
    <li> I used this for a few years longing to get something different. It&#x27;s cheap but you pay for that day after endless shaving day. Save yourself some grief and buy the expensive wet-and-dry norelco variety. You&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
    <li> been using it for many years now. gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This razor is much quieter than the Braun that I replaced. With that razor, everyone knew when I was shaving. Now no one else can even hear it. This razor also shaves much closer with little effort. It is very easy to clean. This is the perfect razor for someone who is older or with limited strength. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My favorite all time Shaver. I had one for many years and decided to get another one to leave in our new country cabin. I was tso ired of forgetting mine and having to use razor blades. This really works. Thank you Philip Norelco!</li>
    <li> Purchased a Norelco 7310 shaver to replace a worthless Remington shaver (heads kept falling out).  The shaver arrived in excellent condition, and works very well.  It delivers a closer shave 5X faster than the unlamented Remington, and is quiet.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after my Panasonic electric razor(ES7037)quit after a year and a half.  This razor shaves very close and smooth, much closer than the Panasonic.  It is also very well priced.  Glad I decided to buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace a 6 month old Architec. The architec was one of the poorest performing razors I have ever owned in over 40 years. So I bought this razor with very low expectations.  I was totally amazed by the 7310. It is so quiet the bathroom fan almost drowns it out, but the cut is AMAZING. I have had seven Norelco shavers so when I tried this unit, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I can shave in 30 seconds instead of the 7 minutes for the Architec. It is close, comfortable, no heavy pressing to get a close cut, and best of all is the price. The whole new shaver was cheaper than buying just the replacement head for the Architec. And the 7310 is EASY to clean. Flip the head, flush under running water for a few seconds, and let it dry. No static whisker cling like the Architec. I&#x27;d give it six stars if I could.  Thanks, Norelco</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son after fing replacement blades for his older Norelco had gotten to the pain in the butt, level. The 7310 wasn&#x27;t much more expensive than the razor , so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My son loves it saying it is faster and smoother than his origanal Norelco. He grows a pretty good beard in a day or two and it mows through it leaving a clean save without complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Not a top end razor but a good solid value</li>
    <li> This mens razor is light weight and easy to use. Gives a close shave and should give long service.</li>
    <li> My last two electric shavers have been from Norelco. The last one required a new blade set, and a new battery. It just isn&#x27;t economical when you can just buy a new shaver for less than that, so I settled for this Norelco 7310XL. The more expensive ones didn&#x27;t seem to have many more features that justified the extra cost. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months now, and I can&#x27;t believe that I can get this close of a shave with an electric!! It definitely surpasses my last two models in that respect. It&#x27;s also handy to be able to rinse the head with tap water, as opposed to having to buy a special razor head cleaner. With the past Norelcos that I&#x27;ve used, if the battery goes dead in the middle of a shave, I had to plug it in and wait a while before I could resume shaving. With the 7310XL, if the battery goes dead, I just plug it in and keep going. That&#x27;s a good thing because that brings me to one minor complaint. This shaver only lasts just over one week on a charge. In it&#x27;s prime, my last one went about 2-3 weeks before needing a charge. The only other complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t include a carrying pouch as the ones in the past have included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase of this fine electric razor.</li>
    <li> The only way I can keep and use this razor is to shave my neck with a blade-----I have a very soft and flabby neck and it&#x27;s easily irritated especially with the 7310-----The 7310 does a fair to good job with the rest of my face down to the jaw line----I will probably end up keeping the razor----</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be a very good razor for the price.  It holds a charge for at least two weeks with daily use.  It provides as good a shave as any electric razor I&#x27;ve owned, including so very expensive one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for convenience if I am in a rush. The shaver does a fine job, but it seems like it is in slow-motion. Even though the battery is fully charged, it sounds like it is dragging along. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it. If you want something that sounds like it is ready to take off, then spend $70~$85. This shaves close but you have to take your time with it.</li>
    <li> Product provides an extremely close &amp; comfortable shave.  Had shifted away from a rotary shaver, but now I am back forever.  A great price also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for over 15 years - some were in the $150 range, none were as inexpensive as this one, and none shaved as well as this one does.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for over a month and it&#x27;s been providing the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years with an electric.  Seems to keep a nice charge as well.    The one con I have is with the positioning of the side-burn trimmer.  My last two Norelco shavers had pop-open trimmers that stayed in place as you trimmed sideburns or trimmed beard hair before a shave.  This one has a tendency to close shut nearly every time I use the trimmer.  I suppose you could try to use it upside down, but it&#x27;s ergonomically awkward and doesn&#x27;t provide a good trim at that angle.  The trimmer is basically useless.  Put that aside and this would be a 5 star shaver all the way.  Still, for the price, it&#x27;s worth forgoing the trimmer and using a separate one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using blades for years, but figured an electric would be cheaper in the long run. I feel I miss a lot more spots with the electric and it takes longer. It IS a good backup though and does give a good, clean shave for when you&#x27;re on the run or out of blades.</li>
    <li> My husband has used Norelco shavers for years and is always pleased with the quality of the product.  The 7310 is a bit lighter in weight which he really thinks is a good thing.  Also the head pops up very easily for cleaning.</li>
    <li> This electric razor was a huge disappointment. I ordered it based on the positive reviews here, after my old, very satisfactory (obsolete) Norelco shot craps. Unfortunately, I found that this particular Norelco didn&#x27;t work for me. Right out of the box, it felt very lightweight and unsubstantial in my hand -- the first clue that it wasn&#x27;t up for the job. The trimmer is a joke compared to the one on my old Norelco and sometimes slams shut while in use. This razor requires many passes to remove hair, which is quite tedious and time consuming. And no matter how many times and in how many directions I go over a particular patch of skin -- side to side, up and down, catty-corner and rotating -- it still sometimes leaves unsightly rogue hairs. Because so many passes are required, this lame razor leaves irritated, rough and (sometimes) painfully abraded skin in its wake. Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t whack the hair as short as it should, resulting in two shaves a day rather than a single morning shave. I have a light beard. It shouldn&#x27;t be this hard to get a smooth shave. This thing is junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Have seen this razor for $66 elsewhere plus shipping. I paid $29.99 plus tax, free shipping. Close shave. Being able to rinse clean saves lots of time. Have now bought another one as gift.</li>
    <li> As I stroke my one day old stubbles, I said, man this was a great shave. No missed hairs, every hair growing in as per usual--no mess no fuss no drama. That being said, the sideburn trimmer is a bit slow so it will not effectively take off much hair in one stroke (which may be good as it offers more control in trimming). The regular shave, however, is superbly stellar. After using two different foil Braun shavers, I would say no way I can vanquish this beast in one or two passes. And yet, this shaver showed me the error of my presumptions.    Outstanding purchase, no regrets. This is a man&#x27;s shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco electric shavers for over 40 years - guess I&#x27;m stuck in a rut :&gt;).  Anyway, my former Norelco had dull blades and it was either replace the blades or the shaver, and since the price was not that much different, I chose to get this shaver.  I am pleased after about 2 months of use . . . it is lighter and quieter and shaves closer than the dull blades of the last Norelco, perhaps better than the last new blades I used.  If it is still doing great a year from now, I will be even more pleased!  It does not hold a charge as long as the last one, but I get 2 - 3 weeks with this one, about a month on the older model.    One thing to be wary of . . . when I purchased this one from Amazon, they had two with similar model numbers.  One was about twice as expensive, but I think it is the same as this one.  Don&#x27;t buy the more expensive one unless you are sure it is different and has features making it worth the money.</li>
    <li> Needed to find a replacement shaver for one that would no longer hold a charge.  Decided to stay with Norelco with rotary heads and this model seems to fill the bill - light weight, fairly quiet, and works great - both as a shaver and as a trimmer.  Now if it is long lasting (reliable) I&#x27;ll have a real winner.</li>
    <li> This is the first Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;m now wondering why. The shave it produces is perfect. Even though this is a &#x27;low end&#x27; model in the line, the product appears very well built and it operates exactly as described in the product description. An irritation-free, very close shave with all the control you need (I have significant facial hair; but keep it neat). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive shaver, this model works very well. It&#x27;s quiet, comfortable, and cuts very close. It&#x27;s also relatively easy to clean for a shaver of this type. The hinge connecting the head to the body is flimsy, but it reattaches easily, and isn&#x27;t a major issue since it doesn&#x27;t need to be cleaned every time it&#x27;s used. Overall, a good shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver offered at a low price.  The blades last for a long time so even though it seems pricey to replace, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great. That&#x27;s the best endorsement I can give it</li>
    <li> when I first used this razor I thought &amp;#34;wow, this is underpowered.&amp;#34;  I thought this because it is so quiet and has a gentle &amp;#34;munching&amp;#34; kind of action.  but it really does the job!  it feels good in your hand. it is solid even though it is plastic.  it really seems well &amp;#34;engineered&amp;#34;.  I have had a Braun and Panasonic in the past, I like this the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also a selling point for me was that the charger is just a cord.  when I travel I don&#x27;t like lugging some big charger.  I only charge it every 8 days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also the pop-up trimmer is great. it is long making it easier to use.  I even trim nose and ear hairs with it, as well as stray eyebrow hairs.</li>
    <li> Razor arrived on time and was well packaged. It gives a nice close shave but I&#x27;ve noticed some irritation on my neck so will have to wait and see if it is just from using a new razor or what. It seems to hold a charge very well but I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t glide across the skin as well as a lot of other razors I&#x27;ve owned. It also seems very under powered. Not sure I would buy again.</li>
    <li> just used several times,the head is all broken.i hate it very much,never buy next time,so angry now.bad product really.&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> A good value.  Very similar to one I replaced which probably lasted 15 years.  Good design............why should I provide four more words to be able to review a product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in Amazon. It came in on time, and looked nice. It workes well, silcent, efficiently. It is very easy to clean after every shaving. In my opinion, the handle is a little biger. After all, it is good to buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He is really enjoying and says it&#x27;s great.  He has a pretty tough beard.  This razor gets the job done.  As a middle-of-the-road-priced shaver, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I always thought you had to buy super expensive electric razors to get a good shave. But this thing is great. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it and I&#x27;ve had it a long time now!</li>
    <li> Not only do this take forever to give a bad shave, it lasted a month and began to go. Witin 6 weeks it was just. (Well it was junk in the first place).&lt;br /&gt;Poor design, cheap parts that fall out. A real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fell especially bad about Philips Norelco. I won&#x27;t trust them again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to clean this thing.  First, I rinsed it with hot water.    That didn&#x27;t work, so I tried soaking it in rubbing alcohol.  Again, that didn&#x27;t work.    Here are some pictures of the problem:   [...]</li>
    <li> my old Norelco was getting tired and the new heads cost as much as a new razor.  This razor cuts well, the heads are much easier to clean in that I can run them under the facet with out any worry.  The only down side is that there is no way to determine the level of the charge.  i just plug it in every couple of weeks and that seems to do just fine.</li>
    <li> Not power enough for my beard, I need a daily shave, not for me. Could be for an emergency.</li>
    <li> Much easier on the face than a disposible razer, the Norelco 7310 gives a wonderfully close shave. Maintenence is simple.</li>
    <li> I have had this now for two years and it still performs as brand new.  I just made a 25 day trip abroad and never had to charge it once!!  The blades perform as brand new still after this two year period.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for the same price that new heads for my old razor would cost. It is not as fancy as my old razor and takes longer to charge. But, I am well satisfied.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean/rinse.  Good, close, quick shave.  Expect up to ten shaves per charge.  Would have liked a travel case with it.  Lack of low-battery-charge indicator could leave you with a suddenly dead shaver if the charging cord isn&#x27;t handy, since one can only finish the shave with it plugged in.  Probably not a problem if you always leave it plugged in when not in use, but that is not recommended for optimum rechargeble battery life.  Just remember to pack the charging cord when you travel.  For the price, I&#x27;m well satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had previously owned an older Norelco model that I had gotten in high school.  I had it for about 10 years before I started traveling for work.  After several months of getting banged around in my luggage during business travels, it finally died and this is the replacement.  I really wasn&#x27;t looking for anything fancy...I just wanted something that would give me a decent shave.  I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard so my requirements weren&#x27;t very heavy.  So far, this thing has been a welcome improvement over my old model.  Still just as easy to use, comfortable in my hand and even gives a closer shave with less effort.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Using one from past 3 weeks. It gave me a nice shave from the first time i used it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent balance of features, design and economy.</li>
    <li> It shaves pretty closely and it&#x27;s quiet.  My only real complaint is that you can&#x27;t just leave it plugged in like you can with most rechargeable razors.  According to the instructions, leaving it plugged in will kill the battery over time.  You are supposed to wait until the battery is almost dead before you charge it again.  Sort of a pain.  My old one I just kept plugged in all of the time and took the cord out of the end when I shaved.  When I was done, I just plugged it back in to keep it charged.  You can&#x27;t keep this one charged.  Charge it, use it &#x27;til it&#x27;s dying, then charge it again.  What a pain!  (You can use it as a corded razor when it starts dying, or even every time you shave, but you have to unplug it afterwards or it will kill the charging capabilities.  I didn&#x27;t think batteries these days still developed \\&quot;memory\\&quot;, but I guess because it&#x27;s so inexpensive, it uses a cheap battery.)  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who can afford a better one.  I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this had I known that I couldn&#x27;t keep it plugged all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have a sensitive neck area, stay away from this shaver.  It will give you a lot of razor burn and unfortunately will not work in just one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, worth the price, but I would suggest using disposables for a little while longer while you save up to get a better one.</li>
    <li> Okay, I confess ... 22 years in the Marine Corps ... you better believe I know how to shave with a razor blade.  Absolutely never thought I&#x27;d like an electric razor.  And I have waited a month after buying this from Amazon before leaving this review, in case I had issues with the razor.    I absolutely love it.  Can&#x27;t believe my face endured the trauma of shaving with a blade all those years.  I actually look forward to shaving now.  Recently I had stopped shaving (with a blade) on weekends to give my face a rest.  But now I shave everyday with the Norelco - and love it.    Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Much cheaper than any other razor out there.  It works great.</li>
    <li> This is nice to knock off the stubs, but leaves my neck irritated if I use it after bumming for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Find that I get a grea, close shave.  Better than my old electric. good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past few weeks and it&#x27;s rather good. It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to hold and carry and does a decent job giving me a close shave or at least a lot better than what my old Norelco gave me. Also, it holds its charge rather well, at least for a full week or even longer.</li>
    <li> A VERY disappointing shaver.  Pulls more than cuts whiskers.  Seems perpetually dull. After the writeup, I am GREATLY disappointed.  I would not recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have very sensitive skin and I continued to get a few cuts every time I would shave with a razor.  I bought the newest and greatest razor and still had problems.  I got this for $40 and I have loved it ever since.  It took about ten days for my skin to adjust to it, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems since, other than a little razor burn every once in a while.    I work with the Air Force and I not only have to be shaven, but I can&#x27;t be showing any time of \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; in uniform.  This razor does the job.    For the price, this is the razor I would recommend.  If you have $80+ to spend, you can get a better one.  But for half the price this one is great!</li>
    <li> This unit is lightweight and feels cheaply made. It is \\&quot;head\\&quot; heavy and not balanced. The last model I had from Norelco was a 5801XL and it felt like a sturdy model. It lasted for many years.    This current model cuts well, but the blades are abrasive and especially so when shaving the moustache area (bottom of nose feels raw after shaving).    I would not buy this model again.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco user for 40 years.  My old one of 8 years was no longer giving a good shave (Yes I did replace the rotery blades and a recharge was only lasting 2 shaves), so I replaced it with this one.  I was a little aprehensive about buying it as the price was inexpensive compared to other Norelco razors.  However, it is very good...a good close shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in 2011, after the Braun shaver I had stopped working, to see if the 3-foil lift and cut system was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have  a small amount of facial hair, basically around my mouth, so it shouldn&#x27;t be hard work for any shaver. The system performed acceptably until August of 2013 when it stopped. The shaver stopped as if someone threw a switch. The charging LED indicator also stopped although it did appear to charge after 12 hrs. The shaver then ran for 1 minute before the \\&quot;switch\\&quot; was thrown again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the electronics or battery failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anything to last just two years makes me feel that I was taken advantage of.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a year now; the verdict is it does the job sufficiently but my son and I are not heavy users. I think this product works well as an entry level shaver, but do not expect to compete in both battery charge and shaving capabilities with other products that are 3x price.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor so I don&#x27;t have anything for comparison.  But I thought it did a decent job.  Not as close as my Mach 3 blade, but then I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.  One of the main reasons I chose this razor was because you can clean it under the faucet.  I did not want to have to deal with some fancy cleaning system that would take up time and counter space.  I just open the top, rinse it out, let it dry and throw it in the drawer.  Simple.</li>
    <li> I feel this one I bought recently is slow compare to the one I had before.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale for $35, and it has been well worth the price. The instructions say give it 21 days of shaving to get the full benefit of the shaving system, but I was pretty happy by day 8. The shave is closer than the Mach 3s I&#x27;ve used for years, and I this gives me almost no razor bumps under my chin/upper neck while still delivering a skin close shave - traditional razors never delivered this.The first few days of using the new shaver will be uncomfortable, but stick with it and you&#x27;ll be happy. The only caveat is I do still have to use my mach 3 to keep my sideburns the way I like, as the norelco flip out trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut as close.</li>
    <li> An excellent portable razor. Unfortunately, new blades cost as much as a new razor.</li>
    <li> extremely long battery, unbelievable.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shaver. The purchase price was a good deal. The Norelco holds up well. The heads are easy to replace.</li>
    <li> I use it every day, and had used it for several years, still is working good. I love the design and it is reliable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never spend big bucks on a shaver again.  This unit works great. Have had it now several years.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Got this as a gift for my dad and it does the job. Sturdy, safe blades, easy to clean. Doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Meets my basic needs and works better than expected for the price. Unfortunately replacement blades are too expensive as all shavers and razors.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many, at least ten Norelco shavers over the years for my husband. I am very disappointed in their product. None of the shavers have held up. I urge people to buy another brand...I&#x27;m just frustrated that they don&#x27;t live up to what Norelco used to be.</li>
    <li> I guess people have more dollars than sense. Love the inexpensive Norelco products !!! I have had this for quite a while and it is still going strong. No need to spend more money. I also have a Norelco trimmer kit that is at least 5 years old and the battery is starting to get weak. The newer trim kits are not as nice as my older kit. Norelco gets it right most of the time though.</li>
    <li> I have used this for three weeks and it is an excellent product.  Gives a close shave with no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> This razor works great. It cuts close, and the charge lasts for a long time. It is easy to use, and the charge lasts a long time. The shaver also has a pop-up trimmer in the back. It comes with a small two-sided brush for cleaning, and a plastic cover to keep dust out of the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver uses a special patented technology to cut hair closer to the skin. The process involves two blades; one pulls the hair partly out of the skin, and the other cuts it. Once it&#x27;s cut, the hair retreats back into the skin, resulting in a nice close shave. According to the manufacturer, your skin needs to adjust to the new shaving style for the shaver to work the way it&#x27;s supposed to. This could take a week or two (depending on how often you shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with many razors, the batteries are not removable; you charge it by plugging it into either a 100V or 240V AC outlet using the included adapter. Don&#x27;t charge the razor if the indoor temperature is above 95°, or the lifetime of the batteries could be reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean the shaver, the instruction manual says to turn it off and unplug it, and then open the top and rinse inside the hair chamber with hot water, as well as both sides of the heads. Leave it open to dry. If you don&#x27;t feel comfortable using water, use the included brush. The manual says to clean the pop-up trimmer after each use, using the brush (instead of water).</li>
    <li> Works OK for a quick shave. Cant beat shaving cream and  razor</li>
    <li> I have purchased three of these shavers (for me and my two teenage sons) because they work great.  Quick, clean shaves, and very easy to clean (just rinse under water).</li>
    <li> Good, economical cordless shaver. Very quiet. Lasts over 2 weeks of 5 min daily use on a charge. Overnight charge time not a problem.    There is *no*  indication the state of charge on the battery - the razor just stops.    One more note, the charging indicator seems backward in design to me. It glows constantly while charging (around 8 hours). When it is done charging then it blinks until you unplug the charger.</li>
    <li> This is really a good razor at a very good price.  It gives a very close smooth shave.  The razor is light and flexible. The battery seems to maintain a very long charge and powers the cutting heads with no detectable slowing.</li>
    <li> The systems works great, the battery last a lot. If you are looking for a good shaving machine and don&#x27;t want to spend too much this is what you need.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as a replacement for my travel razor, and ended up making it my everyday razor after I tried it.  I have somewhat sensitive skin but like the cut I get with an electric razor, and this razor provides a close, clean shave that is not irritating.    I am using it regularly and really like it.  It was a great price, and it came quickly after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Shaves the neck hair very well. The cost of buying new blades and a new battery is more than purchasing this shaver. I get an excellent shave with this shaver. Very pleased with the price and the performance.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need an expensive shaver to do the job. This shaver does just that. Gives a nice close shave for the price.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and for years used a Braun foil shaver.  I thought it worked well but then it died.  Shopped around and the prices for Braun scared me.  Decided to try a Norelco 7310XL rotary shaver although I had never used a rotary.  Absolutely incredible.  Much closer and much faster.  Strongly recommend it to \\&quot;head shavers\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband.  It is well made and gets the job done.  He is very satisified with this razor.  It shaves just as well as a manual razor. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> While this razor does take HQ8 replacement blades &amp; combs.  The included blades can be best compared to the economy ink cartridges that come with some printers.  They&#x27;re similar to the HQ55 blades, but have the HQ8 \\&quot;hub\\&quot; so they work with this razor.  The combs are very much similar to the HQ55 combs.  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in this situation, but I decided not to return the razor due to the low cost of this model.  I&#x27;ll probably just get replacement blades sooner than recommended.</li>
    <li> dry and wet shave, washable, soft shave, what more could you ask for? rechargeable battery life is sooo long, with first charge i&#x27;ve been using for 2 months to now, fast shave</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for x-mas. He just told me how much he liked it and this comes from a guy thats been using a razor for the last 60 years</li>
    <li> I loved the machine, it has a wonderful performance, it makes shaving an easy job. The price is very well suitable.&lt;br /&gt;You might feel a little uncomfortable at the beginning if you have a sensitive skin, but you will get used to it.</li>
    <li> Great razor I charged it as directed and have been using it for 3 weeks without needing to recharge yet.  Haven&#x27;t yet used it overseas. I had to dig deep into the description to find that it is multi volt.  Highly recommend it for international travelers and even for use in the US.</li>
    <li> Thought I might get my husband a nice gift but he hates it.  His old Norelco was falling apart but it still worked.  I bought the new one and it pulls and grabs hair because the rotation is to slow.  Don&#x27;t buy.  I tried it on my legs and I had to agree, it pulls and grabs the hair.</li>
    <li> One of the worst products i have ever used... its not at all as the ad says, \\&quot; the top of the shaver is to SQUARE so you cant at all get a close shave.\\&quot;.. it does cut but you have to go over and over the same areas to get a some what of a clean cut... Its also a bit to rough on the skin..</li>
    <li> I unboxed this, let it charge, and woke up the next morning ready to try it out.  When I turned it on, the first thing I noticed was that it was a lot quieter than the similar Remington that I bought this to replace.  Right then, I expected this shaver to be wimpy and too underpowered for my coarse stubble.  However, I have to give it credit--it mowed right through and left me with a nice smooth face.  So, not only was it a good buy for the price, but it turns out to be unusually quiet in comparison to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> It works 1-2 weeks on one charge before it slows down. Roughrer on my face than old corded model, but cuts closer. Transformer built into plug makes it bigger than other cordless shavers</li>
    <li> This is the second Philips Norelco shaving system that I have owned. I was pleased with the first one, and I am even more enthusiastic with the efficient shave this product produces.  Fair price, great shave, long battery life: what more can one expect?</li>
    <li> For the price this is a good razor but not at all what is needed for around the neck. Better than my last that I got for around 90$</li>
    <li> I bought this Phillips Norelco 7310 at Best Buy for $30, even less than was advertised on their web site.  Maybe it was the last one in stock and they needed the shelf space.  I have been using Norelco rotary shavers for decades, like my Father before me - as they say. I really wanted to get a different brand because it bothers me to no end that the rotary blades cost just a bit less than the whole shaver.  Can&#x27;t anyone make these three little pieces of metal for just a few bucks?  I had given up on my old Norelco a few months back, entirley due to dull blades after years of use, and been suffering with all types of disposable razor blades, high end and low and finally gave up an announced to my siblings that anyone wanting to buy me a Christmas present could buy an electric shaver, \\&quot;like the one Dad used to have.\\&quot;  Alas, my sister must not have paid attention and she got me a non-rotary.  I was going to return it but decided I would give it a chance.  What a loss! How does anyone get these shavers with these tiny holes to work?  It was not even a good on short hairs and after a few days it was returned to the store.  Then, a week of comparing reviews led me to this shaver.  I was determined no to pay upwards of a hundred dollars for a shaver.  I really lucked out on price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the review.  Four stars because I am so happy that right out of the box with a couple of days growth, it shaved really really close - like a new razor.  It is as good or better in terms of close shave as any of the other dozen or so I have had in the last three or four decades.  It took the full eight hours to charge, but it does work as a corded shaver if you forget to charge up.  It lasted around two weeks on that first charge. The one thing that seems improved is the trimmer.  I don&#x27;t use it much, but I recall my other shavers being poor at trimming anything but straight coarse hair.  This works well even for a little trim of my head hair, so thumbs up on that performance. Last point is that is was easy to clean and I also like that it is washable though I don&#x27;t wash it.  So, my basic review is that is does everything it is supposed to do and does it well and maintains a charge and is modestly priced.  Four stars, and now, why not five?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to get used to the \\&quot;heft\\&quot; of this shaver.  Why complain because it is light you ask?  Well, it feels like a cheaper plastic and that gives me concerns about how durable it is.  My old ones had a weight that felt substantial in your hand and a thick shell. For all the times I dropped it or missed when throwing it in the suitcase, I never had one of these break on me.  In recent years I have found so many products with half the weight and made with less and cheaper materials in China that I now save every receipt because so many once-substantial products now fall apart.  Maybe I&#x27;ll make an addendum to this review after a year of use. Same applies to the length of time the blades last. I am expecting no noticeable deterioration for a year. As an aside, the speed of rotation of the heads seems slower and probably quieter than past experience.  I did not notice a slower speed  having a negative impact on effectiveness in shaving and I guess it aides battery life, but it took a little getting used to. So, negatives are the \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; feel and the cost of replacement blades, both of which will take a year to decide if the value is really there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is I got a very good product for the price and think it is versatile enough to suit most men.s that is was easy to clean and I also like that it is washable though I don&#x27;t wash it.

    <li> I owned a Norelco in the past. I switched to an $80 Panasonic foil shaver because I hated replacing the $30 cutting heads on the Norelco every year. Well, I&#x27;m back. The 7310XL is so unbelievably quiet it doesn&#x27;t even seem like it&#x27;s cutting anything. The Panasonic would wake the neighbors.     I cut down my shaving time 75% from the foil shaver. I don&#x27;t shave while in the shower or scuba diving. I don&#x27;t understand the whole electric shaver in the shower thing in the first place.    My last Norelco had the pivoting head and some other fancy marketing features. Don&#x27;t waste your money, this basic model works great. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> after using a blade for 50 + years decided to switch to electric.   This razor shaves nice and close and I like the way it cleans up. Fits nice in hand also.</li>
    <li> I got this Nov 2010 on Black Friday for around 30 bucks. It works well, not as close as a shave that i imagined...but for the price i cant complain. Takes a little time getting used too, because sometimes it pinches when hair get snagged in the blades. Battery lasts forever which i like because i hate always having to recharge my electronics. Extra barber piece for sideburns is awesome. If you looking for something no so expensive and that does the job this is it.</li>
    <li> After many years my corded Norelco finally needed replacement and I decided to try this \\&quot;low end\\&quot; cordless model.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by the quality of the razor and the shave. At the end of a week&#x27;s use it still has plenty of power left, but I set it aside for a recharge every Saturday....just in case.  It is light, quiet and easy to use.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I could tell it from my more expensive Norelco blindfolded.  It shaves close enough for me and is comfortable.</li>
    <li> Looking at the more expensive, upper scale models, I was careful to read the reviews people had attached. I ran across writes of those who had used both the more expensive shavers and this model that proclaimed that they were still getting an excellent shave.    So, I ordered it from Amazon, and I am getting the best shaves I have ever had from an electric shaver. This product has earned every penny I paid for it a thousand times over. It hugs my face, and it cleans so very easily! The battery life? I charged it the evening after getting it first, and having used it without really reading about the battery. Well, then I read about trying not to limit the battery life by too greatly reducing its time off the charger. It&#x27;s now weeks later, and I have not charged it again, or gotten any lower quality shave.    I highly endorse this item!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t felt my face this smooth since i was teenager ,i have very tough beard. I couldnt even believe i was shaving i didnt feel a thing not a pull in 2 or 3 minute it was done.Its great price i really wish i would have had this when i was younger would have made things so much easier. Shaving use to feel like such a pain but i actually enjoy it now.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional little value, as many other reviewers have noted. I used to shave with safety razors, but this Norelco gets me every bit as close in less time with little hassle. Even if I have to get a new one in a year (which is not likely), you can&#x27;t beat the price of $34. I recommend a little pre electric shave (&#x27;Lectric Shave, etc.), which works very well with the Norelco because you can RINSE IT afterwards! Great Shaver!!</li>
    <li> Nice close shave with pivoting head and it is detachable which allows you to wash it.   It is quiet and powerful and does what I need it to do even when I go for several days before shaving. Now lets see how long it lasts. I had a much older model Phillips that lasted forever. Battery life last forever. Just make sure that you use up all charge before you recharge it. I heard it is not good to keep recharging a recharged battery or for that matter to leave it charging for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> I have had several electric razors in the past, but when I need a close shave I always use a blade.  The Norelco 7310XL is surprisingly quiet and does a good job at shaving, though not as close as a blade.  For my useage, I am very satisfied with the 7310.</li>
    <li> It feels like it only runs at HALF the output power. It wasn&#x27;t possible for me to shave with it.    I know it&#x27;s pretty cheap and all and that I shouldn&#x27;t expect perfection of the product, but this is ridiculous. My last shaver had immense power, was 4 years old, and worked so much better than this crap.  This one left a HUGE red rash all over my face that lasted a week before it went away. Choose any other shaver other than this. I beg you, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I purchased an Emerson shaver for $10 before the Philips Norelco.  I like the Philips MUCH better.  The Philips is quieter and provides a better shave (I have a fierce beard too).  The LED light lets you know when the shaver is charged and the charge lasts a long time (about a week).  For the price of $40, a great buy.</li>
    <li> I picked this Norelco 7310 since it appeared to be flexible enough to cut the neck hairs without pulling, especially with such a low price, i had no doubt but to add it in my cart. After i received it, i read that i have to use it quite a few times to warm up the blades. The razor did irritate my neck a little bit at the begining but as it claimed, it was great after two weeks! clean and smooth!</li>
    <li> only thing is idk if this shaves your hairs or plucks em in a way but sometimes it feels like it plucks the hair. still good product tho.</li>
    <li> lasts a very long time, good close shave.</li>
    <li> Pretty close shave for an electric.  Will burn your skin for a week or two (if you are not used to an electric), but this goes away.  In spite of some other reviews, I have found this shaver to hold a charge well (I have a very tough beard, and I even shave the back of my neck).  Expect about two weeks on a charge shaving everyday.  Also, I found the trimmer to be very effective.  My old Remington that I am replacing was self-sharpening and was still sharp after 15yrs.  I hope this one lasts as well.  I like the easy-clean rinse under the faucet feature.  All in all a very good shaver for a good price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have this very long before it broke. Other shavers of a similar price range have lasted a lot longer for me. It did the job while it lasted, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas last year.  He loves it.  He uses it every day.  It gives a nice smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate his face.  He has sensitive skin and the last one he had cause irritation.  He travels for work and it fits great in his toiletries bag. It charges quickly and works well with a converter when he is overseas.  It&#x27;s a really nice product. I would buy this unit again when he needs another, hence the 5 star.</li>
    <li> This shaver is good to use.</li>
    <li> awesome performance. Portable, it is very convenience to carry with when you go out for a long road trip. Its should have enough power to use up to 2 weeks :).</li>
    <li> Gives a nice close shave without the razor burn. really gets into all the contours of your face.</li>
    <li> good product,good price. The price was right,and the product was delivered on time. I will shop amazon agin in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor to use if you need an electric one that is pretty reliable.  It charges relatively quickly and works fairly well.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s not the easiest thing in the world to clean.  That brush they give you doesn&#x27;t work too well for it, and I find myself having to take it apart every few weeks.</li>
    <li> I alway shaved with the Gilett razor and thought I would give an electric one a try. I made a good choice in this one and have been very happy with it.  Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband as a gift since he left his old one in some where and needed a new one. This looks cheap and very light compared to his previous owned but he says that it seems work well. Also this did not come with a bag or a stand except a little brush and a travel charger cord.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver, but there&#x27;s no warning of &amp;#34;low battery.&amp;#34;  It just dies.  Recharge it and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor late in 2009, and it was until recently that I gave it to my younger siblings after he showed interest on it.  He replaced the blade and made it his own.  Last time I checked, it still worked flawlessly.  I did not replace it with the same model, I upgraded to the Norelco 1250X instead, a better product if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> I have owned many of this same line of product over my lifetime.  When my last razor bite the bullet, I did a little homework to see what may be a better product and did not find anything that I felt was better than what I had before.  Philips does make more high end shavers, but for the money, this still appears to be the best bet.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco gave up the ghost and although it wasn&#x27; perfect it was reasonable.  After searching online and reading reviews, I selected this model as being the cheapest equivalent replacement.  Most reviews indicated that there is little improvement in value by paying more for higher end Norelco shavers.    I had been warned about the external power charger for all new Norelco shavers.  It is a cheap nasty frail looking power cord with a power converter box that obscures adjacent electrical outlets.  Annoying since I have to unplug something else to recharge this.  The head unit is hinged for cleaning instead of detachable like my old unit, so it is far harder to clean the blades under running water.  The plastic if possible is even flimsier than my old Norelco.  The power switch provides less tactile feedback in operation.    The unit is quieter and cleans about the same.  The dual green LED&#x27;s are easier to see.  Cosmetically, the unit appears sleek.    I will see how long this unit lasts.  I just think that electronics in general have gotten cheap and flimsy, hence my comment about discontenting.</li>
    <li> this razor outperforms every other shaver i&#x27;ve used, including the high end braun or even the high-end norelco.  it gets those pesky neck hairs in a couple passes and provides a closer shave than any other unit i&#x27;ve tried.  I bought it originally as an extra travel razor, something cheap I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about losing, but I now use it instead of the $300 Braun, and even purchased a second as a spare and for travel.  With easy returns from Amazon, you risk little to nothing to give this shaver a try.</li>
    <li> The first impression was awful, and it got worse from there.    The plastic packaging was impossible to open without a sharp implement or blowtorch.    A blowtorch would have obliterated the cheap plastic device. It feels like a $20 razor if I&#x27;m being generous. The razor body feels cheap, the hinged head feels cheap, the pop-up trimmer feels cheap, and even the power cord is super-cheap (and awfully designed). And on top of it there&#x27;s not even a token case? Cheap.    It did okay in terms of the actual shave, but I&#x27;ll make sure my next razor is not a Norelco. This one just feels awful every time I pick it up. (My last one was a Norelco and it felt fine; it even included a sturdy cloth case with a zipper.)</li>
    <li> Never got a smooth shave from this razor. I&#x27;ve had it a year now, and definitely gonna buy another brand. I charge it and it hardly last 2 shaves. Never been happy with it.    Update: I decided to try something other than a 3-headed rotary shaver (which is all I have ever used). I went to Walgreens and bought an Emerson double edged foil wet/dry shaver. Much, much better...and it only costs $10.</li>
    <li> Bottom Line:  a super-close shave, a bargain price, and some mild skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed Review: First a loooong eight hours to charge. The instructions call for very LIGHT stokes and avoiding pressing the shaver against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using light strokes, and moving the shaver against the grain of the hair as Philips suggested provided the closest shave of my life...without the nicks, cuts and scrapes of a traditional razor. And, the side burns trimmer works well if you use several light strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips&#x27; instructions say that it takes 21 days for your skin and beard to adjust to the Philips shaver.  Presumably, at the end of that 21 day period, the \\&quot;Day One\\&quot; skin irritation is gone or reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips is easy to clean.  Pop open the head and run hot water into the hair receptacle and across the cutters for a minute. For more extensive cleaning, you must remove each of the three cutting blades...the instructions make that task appear to require an engineering degree...I&#x27;ll stick with just the hot water rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips advertises 30 minutes of shaving per charge...it appears mine is providing closer to 45 minutes on a full charge...enough for a week or so of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The store were I bought the Philips had replacement heads \\&quot;on sale\\&quot;...for the same $30 price of a new shaver.  The shaver is a bargain at $30...but $30 for the replacement head is silly.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver from Target a year ago for about thirty dollars.  It was my second Norelco shaver.  My first one was very similar but it could not get wet.  My first Norelco shaver lasted 10 years.  I had to replace the blades every two years, but after 10 years, the battery was starting to not hold charge for quite as long.  Also, this shaver costs only slightly more than buying just the replacement blades, so it is a real bargain.    In comparison to the old Norelco, the shave is just as close.  On the plus side, it is even quieter than the already quiet old unit, and being able to clean up by rinsing it under the sink is great!  In other respects it is just about the same.  Great quality at a bargain price.  I will never buy another brand.  I had tried a Braun before that cost me over a hundred dollars, and I hated it; loud and irritating to the skin.    However, for those of you using standard razors, you may or may not like this.  Electric razors aren&#x27;t for everyone.  The main thing is, you have to shave with this for two weeks before you decide whether you like it or not.  Your face needs time to adjust to the different shaving method.  The first time you use an electric razor, it will be irritating.  Now, however, I find the Norelco to be very comfortable and less irritating than any razor, including standard razors!    This shaver adjusts to the contours of your face, so I have no problem reaching all of my wiskers.  The only thing is that although this give you a pretty close shave for an electric razor, it is still not as close as you can get from a standard razor.    Pros:  1) comfortable shave  2) reaches all whiskers  3) a single charge lasts for many many shaves  4) charger can be used in other countries (great for travel)  5) quiet and quick  6) cleans up easily, very convenient  7) inexpensive  8) close shave    Cons:  1) not as close as a standard razor  2) not for everyone (some people just prefer standard razors)      (be sure to use it for 2weeks before passing judgment)</li>
    <li> Purpose of the purchase was to replace a working Norelco razor.  The prize of this razor was better than replacing the heads on the existing Phillips my husband was using. Thanks for the good prize and fast delivery Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas, but ending up giving it to him early because he had to have neck surgery. He loves this shaver, he had a Norelco Electric Razor before (he lost it on a trip) and said this one is even better than the one he lost. I paid almost $80 for the one he lost a couple of years ago and this one was alot cheaper. It gives him a close shave with no problems &amp; is easy to clean. I was worried about him using it around his incision but he has had no problems. I know the blades for some of these razors cost about what I paid for a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my friend, and he didn&#x27;t say anything about it. Sorry there is little information I can provided. I just trust Philips all the time.</li>
    <li> Very good electric razor. It takes a little bit for your face and neck to get use to using an electric if your coming off of shaving cream and a regular razor. Just get through the temporary annoyance and it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and I love that you can run the razor under the faucet to clean it.  I use a Norelco car charger with this unit, and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVES IT  I KNEW IT WOULD BE A GOOD PURCHASE AS IT IS AN NORELCO.  THANK YOU AMAZON YOU MADE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING MORE FUN  AND LESS STRESS AND THE PRICES WERE A GIFT TO ME.</li>
    <li> My husband liked the Norelco 7310XL shaver after using his father&#x27;s, so I went ahead and checked it out on Amazon.  Prices ranged from 29.99 to $90.00. I ordered the inexpensive model.    I was disappointed because the one I ordered was cheap light weight plastic and the shaver was really slow, unlike his dad&#x27;s shaver, which was made with a polycarbonate heavy duty material and you could feel the substantial weight and quality. It was likely the higher priced model.     All said and done, this cheap model gives a good clean shave. He is OK with using this daily (he&#x27;s retired), but prefers to use his straight edge when he needs to since his straight edge does the better job.</li>
    <li> I have been using norelco for more than a decade and have recently bought this razor...It is very functional and works great...Every razor has to be given time to comform to the slopes of an individual&#x27;s face. The pulling described by some is natural at first but then goes away as the razor adapts and your face adjusts to the razor function...I would recomend to anyone...:)</li>
    <li> i bought 2 of this product for my father and my father in law, they all love it very much. now it is a fun of my father to shave everyday, and my father in law just save it as his treasure. i am so glad both of my fathers love it!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews, good and bad, on this product before purchasing. All the good reviews were true. For the $20 I spent on this, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Yes, the blades seem to spin slower. I don&#x27;t know how this affects it&#x27;s performance, but it works just fine for me. I shaved without any pre-electric shave lotion once and it left my neck a little raw, not like bloody ground meat, just a little red. Exactly like every other electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. No, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade...just like every other electric razor! I haven&#x27;t charged it yet. I&#x27;ve shaved about 6 or 7 times with it from the charge it came with. I like rinsing it off in the sink. I see other guys with their $150 models in their scrubbers on the sink. Their face looks just like mine when it&#x27;s over. I&#x27;m a firm believer in you get what you pay for. Not the case here, you get more than what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I got it a few weeks ago.I got on sale and it arrived very promptly well packed. I could use it right out of the box. It gives a nice clean shave .Takes about 3-4 mins as I am obsessed with my shave.The good thing about it you can use it without being plugged in and if the battery wears off and does not hold charge as happens with many of these shavers with the passage of time,you can plug it and get a decent shave.   I have got nothing negative to say about it. It does the job and does it well. For the price I paid it is a bargain! Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Convenient for people who do not have a lot of time to lather and shave using a razor. Contours to the neck and chin nicely, but not perfect. I admit bias in the fact I slightly favor wet shaving over dry shaving. But for those looking for something worth its money. I recommend the Norelco 7310XL.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with my purchase of his new electric razor.  He has not had to charge it up since he got it 4 weeks ago.  And he seems to be happy with the performance.  His other old Norelco razor lasted for about 25 years!</li>
    <li> The razor provides high quality shaving at a fraction of the time it took with my old one (also a Norelco)!  Good job, but why do replacement heads cost so much?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product. I get a very close shave. It charges up fully in an hour or 2, and comes with the charger. A blinking green light on the charger indicates when it&#x27;s fully charged. The shaver feels comfortable in my hands.      I well recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have had this razor for a month and it shaves very well.  So far over 25 shaves and I have not had to recharge it!</li>
    <li> This shaver burns my face and does not shave close to my skin.    I have a 50+year old Remington which does a better and more comfortable job.    The return priviledge is so tight it is almost impossibe for me to  meet the requirments. Especially as the shaver was given to   me as a birthday gift by my wife.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an electric razor because of the price of razor blades. This was my first electric, so I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much. What a surprise when I tried this Norelco. It gave me a great shave and in total comfort. This was a great move from blades to electric! I&#x27;ll never have to buy expensive blade again!!</li>
    <li> Was looking into replacement blades for my older Norelco and found that for a few more dollars I could get a new shaver. I am please with my purchase and am getting a much closer shave now. No negatives.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have a single problem getting it, nor have i had any problem with the the razor since i got it!</li>
    <li> An excellent shaver, particularly for the price. I would have given it at least four stars were it not for the fact that it needs to be recharged after four or five shaves (i.e. about 20 minutes of use). Recharging time (about 8 hours) is also much longer than that of previous electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned. Based on what other reviewers say, maybe I just got a lemon. I probably won&#x27;t replace the head when the time comes to do so. Instead, I&#x27;ll probably just buy a new electric shaver with longer battery life.</li>
    <li> Had an old Norelco razor that finally crapped out and had to buy a new one.  Found this one at an amazing price and had very low expectations but figured it was worth a shot for the money.  So far, I&#x27;m impressed.  It works great, easy to clean and holds a good charge.</li>
    <li> This razor sucks, or should I say pulls the hair right out of your face. The trimmer is a piece of Sh**. I could only trim about a finger nails worth or hair at a time and only if I pulled the hair away from my face. I had a quatro that died recently. That trimmer I could trim everything with. This razor I wouldn&#x27;t trim/shave a dead dog. In short they need to figure out what went wrong with the trimmer because you cant trim with it like your supposed to.</li>
    <li> Nothing spectacular about this razor.  It is low cost and it works.  Have been using it for about a week and no issues.  Holds a charge, gets as close as any electric razor that I have had and is versatile.  Works for beard, sideburns, etc...</li>
    <li> Shaves well for about 1.5 years, it is not as good as it used to be even when I&#x27;ve bought and replaced the shaving heads.</li>
    <li> This razor works pretty well, altho it is usually necessary to shave almost every day.  It doesn&#x27;t do well on a two or more day&#x27;s growth.  But it is adequate for the price.</li>
    <li> All I can say that this thing is just too great!!!I would recommend this for people who doesn&#x27;t want to spend much on electric razor &amp; yet expect a great quality . I like this as well because it has universal voltage so if you travel this is a winner!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for 30 plus years.  This shaver is excellent &amp; very inexpensive.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and gets the job done. Shaving with this is much faster than with a regular safety razor. The hair trimmer attachment is a little difficult to use though.</li>
    <li> Pretty shaver! This is a gift for my father. He is 75 years old. This is the first time he has a electrical shaver, but it is a piece of cake for him to learn how to use this product.  The power of the battery lasts very long after each charging.  Easy to clean. It&#x27;s convenient to carry for travel, too.</li>
    <li> I had a very similar Norelco model for seven years. Its battery was pretty much toast, so I started looking for another shaver. I&#x27;m not brand-loyal but this product had good reviews and a good price so I jumped on the Norelco bandwagon again. This shaver does a pretty decent job, the exception being that the rotary end has a tough time getting all the hairs on my neck without giving me massive razorburn (my old shaver did the same thing). However, I usually just shave using the beard trimmer, so this isn&#x27;t a major concern. Your mileage may vary; my neck hairs lay pretty close to the skin so that might be the reason. Otherwise I&#x27;m satisfied with it, as the beard trimmer leaves a nice stubble after a couple sweeps. The beard trimmer is also ergonomic and not a pain to flip out and use.    Pretty good unit, try it if you don&#x27;t like foil shavers.</li>
    <li> without any problem 100 % recommended</li>
    <li> I had a medical issue,and due to radiation ,I couldn&#x27;t use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brother got me this, cheap and nothing fancy. Damn but does it work, does a wonderful job ,couldn&#x27;t think anything else could do better. Sometimes I use a razor, but most of the time it is just as easy to use this .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best to use the battery til it is totally drained (others complain about no meter,showing battery level),this makes you use it til it is drained, otherwise you would be charging it when it would not be best to !!! Once every two or three weeks ,is it really that big of an issue.Mine last about three weeks(19+days)between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW , I was 48 yrs old,this is my first electric razor(purchased Aug 2008) ,I am impressed with this, truly a great value. (10/10/12)It is still going strong with the same blades .</li>
    <li> When my more expensive Norelco finally gave out after 7 years, I came to Amazon to check out what others bought. My old Norelco&#x27;s battery would no longer hold a charge, and using it for a while longer with the cord eventually led to the motor burning out. I decided to get another Norelco, but didn&#x27;t want to spend as much. After reading the reviews for this shaver, I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s not as heavy as my old one, and it does run slower, as some have mentioned, but I find that to be a benefit. The slower speed allows the whiskers to pop up and get cut better. I get a closer shave than with my old shaver. The only negative thing that I can say at this point, after using it for several months, is that it doesn&#x27;t show the charge left like my old one, and I don&#x27;t care for the fact that I&#x27;m not sure when it&#x27;s fully charged either. These are minor points though, and so far I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor I have used in 45 years. I finally got tired of all the nicks and sores on my face from using a safety razor. The Philips Norelco 7310X shaver is gentle on my skin and gives a much closer shave than I expected. The first battery charge lasted over three weeks. I have no negative remarks to make on this remarkable shaver. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this at $30, thought it was a good deal. And only used it a handful of times after got it. It feels like pulling your hair instead of shaving it. I thought Philips always made the good products. Now I know their low end products are no better than cheap no-brand razors.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to review this until a few months of use then it kind of broke. Meaning every time we open to clean the heads, all the components inside would just fall apart. We have slowly place them back in place in order to use them, then it&#x27;s scary because you&#x27;re placing lose sharp components to your face. I don&#x27;t even want to use this any more. Before this started occurring, the only issue was that it pulls your hair a little, ouch! Now we have both problems.</li>
    <li> I also have the norelco 7340. This shaver the 7310 has a smoother screen consisting of only round holes for hairs and it exhibits less tendency to cause nicks. The 7340 has some rectangular slots to catch the longer hairs easier and the 7340 does shave quicker. However, the 7340 has a much higher chance of cutting top layers of skin (aka nicks) with the larger rectangular slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7310 is my preferred daily shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7340 is my preferred shaver after 2 or more days without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER 1 YEAR;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 year, the two shavers heads became dull and replacement cost of the head almost equals cost of complete razor and heads if on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution is to revert to the old shaver technology prior to floating heads. Many of us have had the older norelco shavers. I first watched a traveling guy who would go to towns and \\&quot;tune up\\&quot; their old norelco shavers. This consisted of light removing of hairs and a drop of oil along with the most important task of sharpening the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did he do it? Quite simply by pressing the metal screen against a hairless finger tip or palm of this hand. Now you just need to apply this to your shaver. But wait. You have a floating head which prevents the force needed to push metal against metal (screen and rotating shavers)and thus sharpen both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution: Remove the plastic that isolates the 3 heads, rinse in water, dry, apply glue of choice (I used cyanoacrylate) and then I waited 30 minutes and reinserted into shaver. This prevents the heads from moving much. Next turn on the shaver and apply finger pressure to one head at a time. After a few minutes all 3 heads are close to as sharp as new and your finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is a risk and your walk may not end as well as mine. Hope you have a good journey and good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If I were a manufacturer of shavers. Putting in floating heads to prevent sharpening while flaunting the virtues of going around facial obstacles with less chance of nicking skin is and was a brilliant idea.</li>
    <li> I have just ordered my second 7310, mostly because the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 3 or 4 days now, but it still shaves as good as ever. And the good part is that, unlike other Norelco shavers I have owned, I can plug it in and continue my shave if it dies during the process. It is slow and I think that that is part of its success in being a close shaver.  Like other models of Norelco it lifts the hair and whaches it off at the same time.  Being slow it lifts the hair higher for a closer shave.  The down side is that it will tend to pull the hair if I go too long between shaves.  I usually do a rough cut with another Norelco when I have been remiss in my shaving schedule, and finish the job with the 7310.  I love every feature it claims.</li>
    <li> The Norelco shaver works well, but can&#x27;t be used while charging like my old one did. I would not have bought this model without the low price with my credit from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver very much, but the blades that come with the original purchase are very poor in quality.  In three weeks I had to buy new blades because the old ones kept falling out during rinsing and bent easily trying to get them to stay in.  The replacement blades recommended by Norelco are almost as expensive as a new shaver, but seem to be of much better quality.</li>
    <li> I bought it on sale. The prize is very very lovely, and it is easy to use easy to clean with any reasonable function you need. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great. gives close shave and trim. Came already charged up and has not needed another charge as of 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to add to the other negative reviews.  This is my first electric shaver.  I gave it a try because I can&#x27;t afford $4 razor blades ($40 or so a month).  This thing is appalling.  Motor runs very slow.  It doesn&#x27;t cut anything.  I have to go over the same spot a number of times before I even notice any difference.  By the time I am done shaving, I have a nice face full of stubble and my neck looks like I have poison oak.  After using this razor, I am still unshaven AND injured.  Worse than useless.</li>
    <li> Great shave and no razor burn.  I have tried others, and the Norelco is still the best for me.  I used to have one and I dropped it.  I tried a Braun,  and then I was back to the norelco.</li>
    <li> My husband now has 3 Norelco razors, this one is just the ticket, does a good job and for the price......amazing!!</li>
    <li> This thing is horrible at cutting.  The blades spin way to slow to get a good cut and it takes forever just to shave.  When you do get finished shaving, it is not going to be a close shave.  If you are like me, this thing will literally cut up your neck if you are not very careful.  I was relatively new to electric shaving (I used one years ago) and I gave my skin the 4-6 week adjustment time, and it didn&#x27;t do much.  I imagine the pricier (nicer?) shavers work much better.  Anyways, I gave it 2 stars since it did what it was supposed to, shave, just not how I want my shaves to be.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver due to it&#x27;s low cost, rating by Consumer Report, reported quietness. It IS quiet and it gives a fairly close shave ( althought not as close as my last foil shaver). But i find it to be very irritating shave around the front of my neck and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of cutting the shorter hairs next to my mustache. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. It replaced an older model of the same brand. I was going to replace the cutting blades on my old razor, but for about $10 bucks more I bought this razor. Gives me a close shave. Battery life is good. To clean just rince under warm water and let dry. Good shaver I like it.</li>
    <li> Just received this shaver in decent time and as ordered so cant say alot yet. It is over packaged as a pain to cut through all the plastic preformed wrapping, but used scissors and got it done. Plugged it in to charge and only took about 4 hrs to start flashing meaning it had a full charge so it was partially charged when i got it. Tried shaving with it and seems slow but it shaved very clean and close but now feeling some burning around my chin/neck area etc as iam not used to electric shavers, as been using cheap single blade throw away razors for yrs. just hope my skin gets used to it, or I may have to retun it before my return time runs out?</li>
    <li> It is an amazing shaver. Really close shaves. Only thing to be careful is to totally dry it if you wash it with water</li>
    <li> My grandson was thrilled with the razor that he received from me for Christmas. This is his first razor and he was so excited. He could not wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Made in China, however, cheap prices and a decent quality, so my assessment is positive. Razors built a lithium battery, although the charging time is longer (8 hours), but generally there is no problem to use .</li>
    <li> shaver is small, lightweight, works well, battery seems to hold charge properly, shaver actually seems to get better the more times I use it, good product for the price, pleased as I can be for some one who does not like to shave.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service. This shaving system is simple and very easy to use.   Arrived on time without any problem. I am very happy with the service.</li>
    <li> Good product! Easy use!   It can shave my beard cleanly and quickly.  I don&#x27; know how to replace the battery when the battery is invalid.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in part because it is able to run corded if the battery is dead. My previous razor&#x27;s battery has died and it will not run with the cord plugged-in. Eventually the battery will die on this one too, so it&#x27;s nice to know it can also serve as a corded razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my old razor died, I had first tried the [[ASIN:B005HS9XSK Wahl Triple Play 23 pc Lithium Ion Powered Shaver, Trimmer, Clipper and Detailer]] but found the shaver head to be both too large and contoured poorly--it&#x27;s concave instead of convex, like the Noreclo--such that it was completely ineffective at shaving my neck and under my chin. I returned it and found this one on sale for $30 after coupon. Some reviewers have said the 7310 has a NiCad battery, whereas others noted that it had a Li-ion battery. Mine came in a box that said \\&quot;Green High Energy LI-ION\\&quot; on the bottom. This probably contributes to the shaver feeling very lightweight. Also, I noticed that while the box said \\&quot;Philips Norelco 7310\\&quot; on it, the actual shaver is a [[ASIN:B00302T2CM Norelco 7315xl]]. The model number is printed on the back of the actual shaver, plus it is black with grey accents instead of black with white accents. As far as I can tell, there is no functional difference between the 7310XL and the 7315XL, and I actually prefer the 7315XL aesthetically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor required a couple of hours&#x27; initial charging. It&#x27;s really too bad that the battery indicator flashes to indicate a fully charged battery. It&#x27;s better than no battery indicator at all, but ideally a razor would tell you when the battery is low and about to need charging. Furthermore, it would be useful if the razor would stop charging automatically once the battery is full to prevent overcharging, as this kills battery life. So far my impression of the shaver is quite good. It shaves close enough, though my face is still getting used to it. I have owned a previous Noreclo with 2 rotary heads as well as a Remington dual foil razor, and I found the foil razor to give a closer shave in fewer passes. And this razor is much larger than either of my old ones, so it takes some maneuvering to get at the neck and under-chin areas. Still, it&#x27;s actually able to get at those areas, unlike the Wahl. It&#x27;s very easy to clean, unlike my previous two electric razors. What is perhaps most impressive to me is how quiet this razor is compared to any other electric razor I&#x27;ve owned or used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a box with a power cord with the inverter built into the plug, a small brush, the owner&#x27;s manual, and a special offer for registering the product online that extends the warranty for 6 months (making it a 2.5 year warranty) as well a 15% off + free shipping coupon for the Philips Online Store. It does not, however, come with a travel case, nor does Philips make one for the 7000 series razors according to their customer service.azor to give a closer shave in fewer passes.

    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he really enjoys it. For a razor, it does it&#x27;s job. We have not had any problems with it yet!</li>
    <li> i like the color. So far it works great. Cheap price with the coupons too.  Great deal with only 17 bucks.</li>
    <li> I bought the phillips norelco shaver for my husband for christmas, and to both my husband and my amazement this has to be one of the best shavers he has ever used. It works just as good if not better than a four blade razor. It leaves his face feeling super smooth with no missed spots, plus its fast and convienet for him for before work or on the go. Love it! I highly recomend this product it is definatly worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought this in 2010, and have used it for the last 6 years (going on 7 now), and I absolutely love it. I have had zero issues. As long as you take care of this razor, it will last.</li>
    <li> This Electric Shaver is VERY quiet. It does shave close but it irritates my neck. This, however, may get better after I have used it a few times. I&#x27;m hoping so! Good shaver for the price!</li>
    <li> My old razor was a 4 year old Norelco that I&#x27;d paid almost twice as much for as this razor so I wasn&#x27;t real optimistic about what I&#x27;d get for such a low price.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for about a month now and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.  Granted it&#x27;s a little louder than my more expensive Norelco was, but for the savings it&#x27;s worth putting up with a little louder motor.  The only negative I see on this razor is that you only have about 1 minute from the time you start to notice the razors battery sounds like it&#x27;s going dead until it stops completely.  You are able to finish shaving with it plugged into a wall socket so it&#x27;s not a major deal as long as you have your charger nearby and have electricity available.  I use the razor to shave not only my face, but also my balding old head (it only gets a light workout on tomp of my head) and the battery just ran out today which means it lasted about a month.  I&#x27;m sure over time the life of the battery will slowly diminish, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good, reasonably priced razor then this is one I&#x27;d recommend.  The small noise level difference between this cheap model and the more expensive models at least for me is not anything that I&#x27;d worry about.  I highly recommend this product and am very glad that for once I went with the more reasonably priced model instead of the expensive ones.  This is one of those rare deals where you actually get more than what you pay for.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different foil shavers and this one was the first 3 head shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought. I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard at all when it does grow out mind you. I do have fairly sensitive skin and some parts of my skin would get irritated from the foil shavers but I didn&#x27;t feel it right away. With some of the Braun shavers I could shave 2 times a day, when I get up in the morning and then when I chose to go out at night, without much irritation at all. I would have to pass the shaver over and over around my neck area until it looked as if I actually shaved correctly. My neck definitely look like it had suffered an allergic reaction to the blades at this point because I could see welts in different spots and I could also feel tiny cuts around the rest of my face. This shaver was simply not for me given any of the patterns I shaved in or the time I let the beard grow out. :o(</li>
    <li> My husband actually has not tested it yet, BUT this is a HUGE improvement or addition to the straight-edge razor that he uses, but the straight-edge also has the distinct disadvantage of leaving little nicks and cuts that bleed!!! He will no longer have to be wiping off blood, and showing up somewhere with little nicks or scratches on his faced!!! The Philips Norelco is perfect for him. He can also still use the straight-edge, IF he chooses to in certain places.</li>
    <li> I can not say that it give me a better shave then my last Phillips Norelco (835RX) that was a very old model. I thought with new&lt;br /&gt; technology and everything that they have changed for the better I would have  gotten a closer shave. I personally do not think it is any better then my last shaver.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 7310 shaver has only one flaw, and it is a fatal one. Like most shavers, the battery will run out without any warning. This usually happens when you are shaving on a weekday, ready to run off to work. The flaw is that it will not operate at all until the battery is recharged,  it wont run  on a dead battery even when the power recharger cord is plugged in. So you must go to work with half of your face shaved. That is not smart design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturers product descriptions do not mention this problem. Beware.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed...  I bought this razor for my Dad&#x27;s birthday and Amazon said this was &amp;#34;Made In USA&amp;#34; but when I received it, the box said Made in China.  I regret this purchase because I saw a cheaper Norelco&#x27;s at BJ&#x27;s Made in Austria but it was a gift so I didn&#x27;t have time to send it back.  Just goes to show you online shopping is convenient but there is a lot of bad information on the web (im a web designer - lol) and sometimes nothing compares to being able to read the actual packaging!</li>
    <li> After years of use and two time heads replacement it still works great. I will continue to use it every morning until it dies.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT DO A GREAT JOB</li>
    <li> This is my Second Norelco in 7 Years.&lt;br /&gt;Great brand, great design, great quality.</li>
    <li> I have always been a Norelco fan, but they are letting their quality standards slip.</li>
    <li> Works well....very durable......holds a charge....easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This shaver is very quiet and shaves cleanly.  The battery last a long time between charges.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco products for twenty years and they never desappoint me.</li>
    <li> When I bought it, I was told that I would receive a rebate, however, I receive nothing after more than three months.</li>
    <li> Philips denied my rebate on this one a few day ago. Today I received a deny for another different one. I purchase them as gift. I don&#x27;t understand the reason they described. No any other info provided. I am pretty sure that Philips is lying. Forget its product. I don&#x27;t just this company anymore.</li>
    <li> Nothing about this razor stands out to me.  It does its job, but not exceptionally well.  It takes a lot of time and effort to get a decent shave with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know, this is my first electric razor.  For the 10+ years before I bought this I was using Gillette Mach3 razors.  I&#x27;ve been using this electric razor for about 6 months now and I plan to continue using electric because it&#x27;s more convenient, even though the shave itself is somewhat disappointing.</li>
    <li> Once my old one broke, I haven&#x27;t had one of these types of shavers for years. I usually use clippers in combination with a razor. But when I purchased this I was pleased with the close shave it gives me and it also serves as a break between razor uses. It&#x27;s more than sufficient for a close shave and the charge lasts for weeks at a time. Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> Close shave,easy to handle and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight is good for travel and charger can stay home for normal business trips.</li>
    <li> This razor is great.  It&#x27;s light in weight.  At first thought was not well made because it is light in weight. But it makes up for it much more in it&#x27;s performance.  Holds chage as portable great so far. Very easy to clean.  Very close shave.  Nearly close to a 4-5 blade manual. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Have used electric shavers for several years. I sold my expensive Braun and bought the Norelco 7310xl. What a huge difference. The Braun took forever to give me a fair shave, but the Norelco 7310xl shaved me very close in no time at all. Easy clean-up. I recommend this shaver -- inexpensive, light weight and a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> -HAD FOR OVER A YEAR-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice and lightweight, good for traveling as the battery life lasts many uses when fully charges, it does a great job at trimming and shaving closely, and the flip top trimmer comes in handy. It doesn&#x27;t do a nice close shave as you would get with a disposable razor,and I often use both to get the job done. It is also time consuming to clean as their are many components to be removed as well as small places to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all it is good for the price, just don&#x27;t expect a razor clean shave, it feels good in the hands and lightweight.</li>
    <li> Not the best, but really cheap.</li>
    <li> i have one of these. i didnt really care for it, its ok at first but it started to pull hairs &amp; leaving a bad razor burn, the back buzzer i didnt like eather, that really pulls hair. i just went with a gillette ProGlide its the best by far, dont be scared of it, its so easy to use &amp; its the best shave i ever had.</li>
    <li> This shaver business is ridiculous - each of the five companioes I&#x27;ve seen has so many different models you have to wonder why, and none I&#x27;ve seen describe the motor output or shaver head rpm&#x27;s. I bought a Norelco \\&quot;Reflex Plus\\&quot; and have to say it&#x27;s the cruddiest least effective shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. To begin with, a three foot cord is just too short, and it drops out of the shaver half the times I use it. The thing is underpowered and does NOT shave (I&#x27;m blond, and I do NOT have a thick beard). I bought it because the previous Norelco I owned since 1987 gave a really good shave and was easy to clean (the motor was more powerful). Finally, in 2011, it gave out. So I bought another Norelco. The company and its product has obviously changed because this thing has made me want to throw it numerous times. It&#x27;s a useless piece of junk. It takes three times as long to shave, and the results suck everywhere: my upper lip is rough, my chin is stubbled, my jowels have three-inch patches of uncut beard no matter how I stretch my skin, and my neck is hairy. I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised to learn they have people paid to write reviews on Amazon. Their management at some point decided to make them cheap - really cheap - \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; as in \\&quot;useless\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Husband likes the option of the electric shaver vs. razor, and this one works well; he is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I misread but I thought that this was both a cordless and a corded shaver.  Imagine my husbands disappointment the first time it ran down and he wasn&#x27;t through shaving.  Hooked up the cord and  nothing!</li>
    <li> Does what all the other shavers do for half the price.  Easy to clean, and rechargeable so no need to worry about replacing anything but the probably the blades down the road.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday, he has never used electric razors in the past, but he is very happy with how it cuts and he says it does not pull, when I touch his skin it definately feels soft!</li>
    <li> This is the exact shaver I purchased last year.  It is far less costly to buy new that replace parts on even the most expensive shaver.  All need to be replaced in a year so it is easier and more economical to throw them out and buy new. Works well and is fine for the most.</li>
    <li> Does the job, though it could be that I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin since my neck does turn red, itches and in externe cases does bleed when using this shaver. Use with baby powder</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I bought mine in 2007 and it still works perfectly fine!!! I love it!!! Good quality for nice price</li>
    <li> Use it veryday now for two years and have not had any problems. Air clean after every shave and had a good shave everytime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for 2 years now. I don&#x27;t grow too much facial hair and the Norelco still had some problems. Sometimes it would pull my hair(ouch). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to men who have thick facial hair and in that case, I didn&#x27;t feel like the electric razor was strong enough. But for the price, I guess it&#x27;s not to shabby.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in 2010, and it&#x27;s still working great (As of 2014). Does the job well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for the last two years and don&#x27;t have a single complaint. It gets&#x27; the job done when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money spent.  You have to work a little harder for that close shave...but what the heck.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast shippment. Good vendor would deal again.&lt;br /&gt;Very responsive. Filling this out is painful.  I will not do it again.</li>
    <li> This is my 6th Norelco electric razor, this Norelco 7310XL[[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System gives the best shave. It just doesn&#x27;t get any better than this, especially for the price of $29.99. You can&#x27;t even purchase replacement blades at this price. Marvin in Dublin,Ca.</li>
    <li> I first buy from amazon. The item price is very good and diliver very fast. It is a gift to my a friend . I have not hear something from him.</li>
    <li> I put this shaver inside my car and use it everyday when I go to work. The bettery life is good and one charge can last for a month. The shaving is clean and smooth. However, the cover of the shaving head is very loose. I had around same incidents of four times. The cover opened accidentally and you can imagine the mess it left in my car.</li>
    <li> Read many reviews and decied to choose this razor soley based on it&#x27;s price and the fact that it had the most reviews. I have had a beard for years because shaving was unpleasant. I have never had any razor electric or otherwise that gave a decent shave.....period!    This razor shaved even those irregular spot but the neck well without any discomfort. It is very quiet which I really could care less about but I noticed in many reviews of razors that noise was important to many people.    I guess only time will tell? Right now I have no reluctance what so ever to give it the highest rating. I am impressed!</li>
    <li> Received timely and it looks and feels good.  It isn&#x27;t a blade shave so don&#x27;t expect that.  It is a good, servicable electric.  Not much better than the average and not any worse.  I felt the other great reviews were going to produce a superior product but, alas, it&#x27;s just good. I wouldn&#x27;t return it but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Close shave and easy to use. Lights on handle let you know when battery is fully charged. Battery lasts a long time between charges. Great shave(r) for the price.</li>
    <li> Very good product, good price. Just let your face get used to it and it will shave away all the stub</li>
    <li> Bought to replace my 25-year-old Remington electric of similar design. Had never replaced the heads and suspected they were long worn dull. New Norelco is better, giving closer shaves and longer lasting battery charges. It is lighter also, but per the instruction manual, also vulnerable to less than optimal charging - the old one was regularly overcharged and this didn&#x27;t seem to matter. The &#x27;good news&#x27; is that I&#x27;ll be getting a $20 discount on replacement heads, if I ever need them. The &#x27;bad new&#x27; is that this one was Made in China, the original in the U.S.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 7319XL is an excellent electric razor.  I get a close shave each morning. Being able to clean the razor out by holding it under hot water is outstanding, this keeps the razor clean with very little effort.  I highly recommend this razor to any one that wants an excellent razor for the money! Shopping on Amazon is always great!</li>
    <li> Bought this electric razor as a replacement for an old electric from another manufacturer. Impressed with the shave, but can&#x27;t help notice how light it is and how the plastic does not seem to be as robust as I&#x27;ve seen on older electrics. Still, it works great so far and I can&#x27;t argue with the price.</li>
    <li> This is a real good shaver.  I suggest reading the directions on use of the shaver.  Believe me the directions work.  I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers before and eventually went back to conventional razors because of razor bumps and skin irritation.  The lift and cut technology caught my eye and as an Africa American male electric razors usually don&#x27;t work.  So I tried it and it worked.</li>
    <li> Pros: inexpensive, it looks cool.  Cons: anything but a close shave, the trimmer is useless, battery life is too short.  I only paid $26 for the razor and I still feel like I got ripped off. I should have spent the extra money on a Braun. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> Cut is clean and close.  I bought it as a back up razor, but found it so ideal that it became my primary razor.  Excellent price.</li>
    <li> The replaced my old electric razor that had a quirky power button and would no longer turn on.  This razor works really well and I had no issues with breaking it in or developing any type of rash.  I went to a couple of nearby stores and all the razors were 100+ dollars.  This is the perfect price and got it in a few days with Amazon prime.  I&#x27;m not sure why I bother going to the store when it&#x27;s so much easier just buy on amazon.</li>
    <li> A good convenient alternative to Gillete mach3 during a travel. It&#x27;s my first time to use electric razor and I feel slight itch after shaving.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the hubby about a month ago. Pretty good, he hasn&#x27;t had some of the issues mentioned in the reviews like the hair pulling or neck getting torn up.  Only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because it is kind of a flimsy design.  Pretty much all plastic.  And it is annoying that it doesn&#x27;t give a low charge indicator.  Overall happy with it though, seems like a good deal so far.</li>
    <li> I recently had a corded Norelco shaver, which after a year&#x27;s use, drove me nuts with the cord always falling out.So I&#x27;m trying the 7310XL and so far has been great.</li>
    <li> Made of plastic, light weight, but shaves great for the low cost. no problem throwing away when it no longer shaves clean</li>
    <li> Nothing much to say about this razor. It&#x27;s quiet, and it shaves my face faster than a disposable AFTER I&#x27;m done lathering up. My old one is still ticking after 5 years (through no fault of its own one of the heads is irreparably broken) and I fully expect this new one to last just as long or longer.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I was really angered by the amount of packaging this shaver came in.  It came in a cardboard box, and inside that was a sealed plastic clam-shell that you have to use heavy scissors to cut through, and inside of that there was more plastic and cardboard.  One would think that a large, modern company (especially a European company) would be more environmentally conscious.  The good news is that the clear plastic that non-food products come packaged in can now be recycled with your cans and bottles in many, if not most, localities.  If you buy a product that comes in a bubble glued to a piece of cardboard, you should separate the two and then recycle the plastic with your cans and bottles and the cardboard with your paper and cardboard (the economics of recycling don&#x27;t allow recyclers to pay someone to separate plastic from cardboard, so you need to do that yourself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for 40 years.  This shaver is both better and worse than their older shavers.  The actual shaving performance is much better.  I have an older plug-in Norelco shaver, and, while shaving, I have to rub my face a couple times with a hot washcloth to raise my whiskers.  I don&#x27;t have to raise my whiskers with this new shaver, meaning that I can shave my face dry and get a close shave.  In fact, the shave is so close that it leaves my skin a little sore.  (In actual practice, I still drag a hot, moist washcloth across my face to make sure all my whiskers are raised.)  This shaver is also very quiet, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as the plug-in shaver that I already own.  It doesn&#x27;t take hair off as well, and it doesn&#x27;t stand out at a far enough angle.  Also, the shaver part will sometimes pull long hairs instead of cutting them off, and that can be painful.  In my opinion, both the trimmer performance and the tendency to pull hairs is due to this being a battery-operated shaver, meaning that the cutters don&#x27;t have as much power behind them as a plug-in shaver.  Plug-in shavers have more robust performance, but they are louder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how many shaves the charge is good for because I shave every 5 days.  I get three shaves out a charge, but then I shave much longer than if I were shaving every day.  If the shaver loses it charge during a shave, you&#x27;ll have to plug it in and wait five minutes for it to charge slightly before continuing.  You then have to complete your shave with the plug in.  One good thing is that Norelco shavers now come with straight cords instead of a coiled cords.  The coiled cords were a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some concerns about the on/off button.  It is one of those soft, molded plastic buttons that deforms when you push it (instead of a normal mechanical switch).  My experience with such buttons is that the plastic eventually fatigues and cracks.  I doubt it will last as long as the rest of the shaver lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short:  great shaving performance, so-so pop-up trimmer, environmentally unfriendly packaging.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for the price, close shave and very quiet. the only drawback is there is no battery life indicator</li>
    <li> Decent electric shaver. It shaves slow and I often have to go over the same places more than twice. It shaves my face fine and doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation but my neck is another story. Maybe its just my hair type, but this shaver does a horrible job around my adam&#x27;s apple and jaw line. I keep trying to find better techniques to shave the neck area but I always end up with a rash or ingrown hair. I bought an electric shaver for the convenience but this shaver has been such a hassle that it&#x27;s made me go back to using a standard razor.  I would return it if I hadn&#x27;t kept it for so long. Oh well, at least $40 isn&#x27;t much of a loss.</li>
    <li> Very nice item; excellent packing and quick delivery.  The products is just as described in the website. I like it.</li>
    <li> My old Remington finally wore out and I needed a new shaver.  This one is great. It is easy to clean, does not pull my whiskers and recharges quickly.  You could do a lot worse than this ... and the price was very reasonable.  Win-Win</li>
    <li> it does the trick, still leaves some irritation sometimes...this is a newer version of one i had for many years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my dad for Fathers Day.  He used it every day, and has not had any problems from it.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the reviews but with thick beard all around , it doesn&#x27;t handle it very well. i stooped using it after trying a few times, it hurts if you have thick beard.</li>
    <li> Nice almost-pocket-sice shaver, cuts perfectly, long-lasting batterie, nice grip, razors are easy to clean, and a small price. What else can anyone want?</li>
    <li> I like this shaver - better than other electrics I&#x27;ve owned (by Remington and an old Norelco). The flip-out trimmer isn&#x27;t the greatest, but the shaver heads are very good. Keeps a charge for a couple weeks, which is nice (my Remington got to the point where it had to be plugged in all the time to even use).</li>
    <li> So far, this seems to be a great razor. It is very nice quality and while I do have a light beard and I don&#x27;t shave everyday, it is still running on it&#x27;s first charge.</li>
    <li> The shaver arrived in a very timely fashion, in perfect condition. This shaver has sharp blades which give a very close shave. Anyone needing a quality shaver will be quite pleased with this item!</li>
    <li> This inexpensive Norelco shaver was purchased only for use when my Braun electric razor was in need of repair.&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco  is underpowered, and takes me half agaIn as long to shave, as well as not giving me as good a shave. It is the classic case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not reccomend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Norelco is a good name and this product lives up to its reputation.  Easy to use and gives a good shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shaver but the green light stays on all the time,can&#x27;t charge the Shaver,so I gave this 3 stars,maybe mine is broken but it works ok so I&#x27;m keeping it,</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace another one I had returned to Amazon. It&#x27;s ok.  It does an okay job on my face but it struggles with the neck area.  I tried it with both short and longer stubble to see if it made a difference but it&#x27;s about the same.  Overall I am able to shave about 80% of my face and neck well as a dry shaver then I do a final clean up with a generic razor.  I know it defeats the purpose of the electric shaver but it beats pressing the shaver into my neck for razor burn.</li>
    <li> Another you get what you pay for scenario.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I do like this, but don&#x27;t expect much out of it.&lt;br /&gt;It misses a lot of hair, especially for me on the neck,&lt;br /&gt;causes some minor irritation dry or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you just need something to clean you up before a razor shave, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have had it for 4 years and it&#x27;s still cutting like a champ. The battery is incredible. Easy to charge and maintain. Will  buy again</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  Did not do clean shave job. Had to discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This is really a great product at a great price!  I&#x27;ve had for over a year, and all you need is to keep it clean and to replace the blades once a year and voila! You&#x27;ll always have a brand new shaver and a very close shave in minutes.  I previously owned a Panasonic shaver but this one does a much better job and gives you a much closer shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year and it lives up to it&#x27;s description. Cuts very fast and cleanly. I&#x27;ve had many electric razors and paid much more for several and this one does a much better job than most. Clean up is simple and it holds a charge very well (above average imo). A+ product!</li>
    <li> I really postpone shaving as long as i think it´s still not looking weird. It´s a great device if you don´t wanna lose much time doing a regular shaving. Easy to wash and keep. The trimmer in the back is also very helpful.</li>
    <li> I can get a close, comfortable shave, and I can rinse it. The battery life is superb. What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and it has a very good power saver and features are also good, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> use this daily and have no regrets,</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work on neck hairs</li>
    <li> This machine it&#x27;s one of the best (if not the best) shaver I have used in my 36 years of experience shaving with this &amp;#34;things&amp;#34;. But... It&#x27;s far, of course, from being perfect. That crown holding the blades it seems to be hold to the shaver&#x27;s budy with a piece of a paper clip. These type of shavers are the best for shaving but those crown are always a pain in the ... &amp;#34;behind&amp;#34; because they brake loose at the most lighted movement while opening to shake the hair our of it. Well, you just have to be &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; with it and it will give you years of performance.... Amen</li>
    <li> Met all my expectations. It was a gift to my grandson. He is pleased with its performance. He had requested this specific model.  It was shipped in a timely manner</li>
    <li> After 6 months of use i plugged it in and got so hot it almost caught fire...Plastic melted...Smoked and smelled awful...Never to run again...Made in China junk...</li>
    <li> A woman also reviewing shavers, got this for herself, instead of the woman&#x27;s razor. I think manufacturers make \\&quot;woosey\\&quot; shavers for women. Lord only knows why, as hair on the legs for us is one Humungous stubble fest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very quiet, and during the summer, I alternate with a hand razor for a closer shave. I do not use it under the arms, cos of the rotars. I lost the darn recharger cord, and am using my husbands Norelco, that I gave to Him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I don&#x27;t like about labeling, is I have no idea of what model it is, because it is not on the box, OR on the razor, so ordering any parts (like the one I need--the charger)is very difficult. I hope i an buy just the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to look at all my pending reviews from Amazon&#x27;s email reminder, to even see what I got.</li>
    <li> my husband used a panasonic wet and dry shaver but  could not get a close shave and it was noisey too.. this shaver does a terrific job ......close shave...very quiet.....not expensive... very happy with it</li>
    <li> i have had a few electric razors that were garbage so i gave up buying them. I decited to try it again after 15 years. This is a good razor. It gives me a great close shave and my skin does not have razor burn afterwords. It came out of the box charged. I use it about every 3 days (I hate shaving). after a couple months I have not had to charge it. Even if it needs to charge, you can still use it as it charges.</li>
    <li> This shaver is poor quality and it&#x27;s not made to last.  It started to pull hair in about 6 weeks and it will not hold a charge longer than about a minute. Buyer Beware.</li>
    <li> This Norelco shaver was shipped timely and arrived without an issue. It is a great shaver that gives a close shave. It is also very quiet. It is easy to maintain and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model Norelco that I have had for seven years.  It is not as good.  Having used both back and forth for two months I have gone back to my old one which needs to be left on the charge.  The new model is not as well made and does not  give me a good shave.</li>
    <li> totally worth the money, i bought months ago. i do not want to write any reviews before, but today i dropped on to the floor and when i picked up, i put them pieces together and it works just fine !!!!</li>
    <li> I own it now for about 2 years and it still works like a charm!  Does perfectly its job. I use it to cut all my body hair to grade&#x3D;1 (shortest) which can be set at the groomer. Below my axels I use the racer cutter which also does its job very good. It was quite cheap, much cheaper than waxing ect. and much (!!!) less painful :) you will love it - if you groom your entire body in one shot, recharge the device a day earlier to get the full power out of it, still works 2 years after I bought it, didn&#x27;t thought that on that price ;)</li>
    <li> Fairly inexpensive but it gets the job done.  Easy to use and keeps the battery for a long time. I would buy another one if I needed it.</li>
    <li> I will never-ever buy this product. The Philips company did not paid me rebate. When I contacted the customer service it found some reasons do not pay it. It wasn&#x27;t fair. Rebate was supposed to be paid, but it never happened. This is the worst purchase I ever made.</li>
    <li> Have been shaving with rotary system, mostly Norelco, for a long long time. My first double header was in my locker through basic training during the Viet Nam era. Dropped a few times had tape on the outside, lasted a good ten years. Flat and foil types just did not do the trick. Newer Norelco models just are not as durable. More bells and whistles like this model which is rechargeable with lights and washable. Decent shave but just previous model seemed better. Closer and with less irritation. Still a very good product. Newer models run faster and more silent so it is in the quality of the heads. No problem just wait two or three years. Next model is already out. Just hope the quality does not continue to deteriorate. The other two rotary brands were a Sears which worked fine and a Remington which did not.</li>
    <li> I would rank the product a 2-stars but good enough for spare.  But the rebate issue makes this purchase a bad experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to buy this for spare because of the low price/rebate.  I just received a postcard rejecting the rebate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for participating in the Norelco $10 Rebate promotion. Unfortunately we could not honor your request due to the following reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did Norelco cheat by not honoring the rebate or did the seller/Amazon post the fake rebate?</li>
    <li> This was a present for my son and he loves the new shaver. He replaced a much older one with the Norelco and says it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas and he started using it in January.  He has two or three different shavers he trades off and has in different places so he always has one available.  So this one was purchased as a spare.  So he didn&#x27;t use it every day.  He went to use it one day and the heads didn&#x27;t work.  He cleaned it out, just in case that was the problem and to no avail.  One head moves and the others do not.  I feel I should have been given (at least) a replacement for this one.  I&#x27;m quite sad about this.  I have always used Norelco products.  Now I am wondering if I should consider a different brand.</li>
    <li> The prodect does not shave good. And it causes bumps ,It just no good...i wish i could return this prodect.</li>
    <li> I care for a 90year-old man who no longer hates to shave. No more mountain man look! I can actually see his real face.</li>
    <li> Believe me. I like Norelco shavers-Except for this one. The shave is ok. It is quick and does a fairly decent job. But when the battery runs down, it just stops. And plugging it in does nothing. So you need a  backup system.  Really dumb. I would go for another model.</li>
    <li> Works well, I miss the charge level light.it is easy to maintain. Will operate with the cord when battery runs out.</li>
    <li> Picked this up on Amazon for fifteen dollars and now I see some are charging over ninety dollars!  Get real, this is a cheapo razor; it works well but dont get screwed.</li>
    <li> great product !!!!  fast shipping!!!!  thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Cheap shaver. It works fine but not as powerful as I like. Braun makes a better device. I used this one for a while but then bought a Braun.</li>
    <li> after 3 years, still works</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver for the money. The sideburn trimmer is a nice feature. Next time, though, I&#x27;ll look for one that has a &amp;#34;minutes remaining&amp;#34; gauge on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and he said it was the best gift ever. He really likes it, because contrary to razors, it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin. I read lots of reviews about this shaver and others, and different models even from Philips, and after reading them I decided for this one. And I don&#x27;t regret it. Very good shaver.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending top dollar for machines that would soon chop my face off anyway...I have a real sensitive face and these things wear out so fast most of the time no matter how much you pay I thought! So I said to me self, hey why dont you buy a cheapie this time...yeah...uses it as you may for a few months and then you just buys yourself a newbie when it starts to cut your face up....and guess what? I am still using this sucker! No kidding! This thing is really cool, Excellent Shaver! To my surprise it honestly shaves better than my old norelco which was much more expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some problems to this way of doing things-you know the go cheap approach......first YOU GET NO CASE...but that was no problem, I just used my old razors case.&lt;br /&gt; And two you get no cover for the head...and that can sometimes lead to corrosion of the blades..and the chopping of your face begins early.....but hey...all that has not made this thing cut any less and I am honestly surprised by how well it still works and this is why I write.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE QUID PRO QUO...I shave once or twice a week!!! Sometimes I can go a month if I can get away with it.  I have a sensitive face like I said..but guess what, when shaving like that you tend to wear out blades more because they tend to just sit there and gather corrosion..and then of course you have to cut down a forest on your face.....well did not happen with this shaver..of course I have to use a trimmer to cut the heavy beard out of the way first in order to get to the stubble...but hey thats a lotta stubble after two months.....I think this was an excellent deal for the money! I like that CHEAP AND GOOD! Wish I could apply that principle to other things too....like wine and women.</li>
    <li> Lighter with better battery life than previous electric razors that I have owned.  Also provides a closer shave than others as well.</li>
    <li> great buy and great product its lasted for a long time. I havent had any problems with this item at all.</li>
    <li> This was the worst idea I ever had! Ever time I tried to use It hurts. I would recommend this product to my enemies! Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> Husband really likes this razor.  Seems to give a nice, close shave and easy to clean. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a reasonably priced electric razor.</li>
    <li> I owned a Remington before this unit, and I&#x27;m more happy with this razor. It shaves close, is easy to clean with a quick rinse, the trimmer works well, and it can hold a charge for nearly 3 weeks - so you don&#x27;t have to take the charger cord on vacations!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of a singe drawback to this purchase, and I&#x27;m pretty picky.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving system.  I change the blades every 6 months. I use it to shave my head and face, veyr close shave.  Won&#x27;t let you down and the battery lasts for EVER.  make sure you clean it after every use. you can wash it!! just pop it open and rinse freely. I love it.  I bought 4 more of the same.</li>
    <li> You shave using the cord or using the rechargable battery.  The charge will last about a week and you can tell when it is running down.  It gives a good shave but not as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> Only real complaint I have is that there was no travel cover with it.  Decent razor for my use as a touch up or quick shave when going out in the evening.</li>
    <li> I use it to shave my head and face. I usually touch up with a regular blade razor and hot water. But, this is a great way to shave quickly.</li>
    <li> I had a very expensive razor before this one and hated it. didn&#x27;t shave close at all.  this philips norelco is just great and the price was certainly right. good job philips norellco</li>
    <li> Razor runs slow but it does the job.  Provide a close shave and the battery so far seems to last about 10 shaves before it needs recharging.  Overall a good buy for the price.  If you want better expect to pay much more.</li>
    <li> This product is much better than what it imagined ! Clean smooth shave, no nips and cuts and easy to clean :-)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a Christmas gift last Nov and now, April, it fell apart.  How do I get a refund?  Do not buy this item.</li>
    <li> I put 4 stars because it is worth its price and does the job but not in one swap. 1 star off because of its not 100% the best out there but cost wise its pretty good if you have a low budget. The shave is close enough to pass on my case but not as close as a blade shave of course. Hope this helps anyone who reads reviews.</li>
    <li> I needed a very quiet shaver for my husband.  He was bed bound and felt the noise level would bother others in the room.  I returned it and the credit was immediate.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for nearly 50 years now and this one gives the best shaves yet!  I like how it handles, its light weight, the lights for charging, and the water clean up.  I will continue to be a Norelco customer.  DAJ</li>
    <li> I should have known. It was too good to be true. Under $60 and MADE IN USA??? This is not the case when I received it. On the box it clearly says MADE IN CHINA. Whoever the seller is you are misleading consumers because this Norelco 7310 is NOT made in USA!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shaver, my husband likes that the battery life can last for days. But theres no where indicating battery life. So he charges after couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly easy to use and set up. However it is not as sharp as he had wanted. It required him to go over the spots many many times so in the end he wastes for time than an more expensive one. You get what you paid for!</li>
    <li> my husband used this product for a week and the head fell off, twice.  As I sit and listen to his frustration while he is taking apart the sink to get the small pieces out of the pipes I must admit that I would not recommend this razor.  this was an earlier review that I wrote about the product.  The problem was the cover for the razor was so tight that the head would come off when taking the cover off.  My husband no longer puts the cover on and he is extremely happy with the product.  I have used it on my legs and would buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> A fine piece of merchandise.  It still works well and holds a charge for a long time.  Noreico makes good merchandise.</li>
    <li> My husband had his last Norelco for over 10 years so it was nice for something new.  This works well, holds its charge and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This looks and costs the same as my old one that needed new blades. But it has no pop up trimmer. Too bad! now I have to keep the old one for tyrimer use as well as the new one to shave. Guess Norelco wanted to keep the price the same by cutting performance. MAT in Florida</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco corded razors for over 10 years. My 715RL (worked great) finally died and this one was being heavily advertised at $20 off for the Thanksgiving holiday at $29.99 so gave it  a try. It&#x27;s very quiet compared to others I&#x27;ve owned, but the 7310xl also shaves considerably slower. Also a little more complicated to clean with the tilting blades. Haven&#x27;t used one of the pricier models, so can&#x27;t comment on those. I actualy use 2 Norelcos (one in each hand) to speed up the shaving process.</li>
    <li> I think it is good, but it is a little expensive for me. ... it&#x27;s the patch of word lock</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s reliable, last for weeks without needing a charge. Sometimes it takes an effort to get a smooth shave though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come to expect for being made in China. I had 2 shavers handed down to me by my Dad that worked well for decades without ever being serviced. I buy this thing for $65 and the blades seemed to dull a few months and I&#x27;m supposed to buy new blades for $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the feeling they are trying to get rich on replacement blades. I&#x27;m looking for some other, better way of shaving and not be ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is CCC [cheap China crap]. It really is, especially when compared to the way they used to be.</li>
    <li> excellent but now higher priced</li>
    <li> Given as a Gift. Well liked once they started using it. Good Price as well.</li>
    <li> Very good product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver, close cut, easy to clean!</li>
    <li> How nice to have a shaver \\&quot;follow\\&quot; your face and neck. Norelco is really the only true triple head shaver.</li>
    <li> Very good for this price  But it looks a little big...  Anyway, I like it</li>
    <li> Broke two months after I received it.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for alittle over 1 year now, just purchased the replacement blades and hope I can get another year at least out of this thing.  I got used to it and didn&#x27;t really want to fork over the high replacement blades price but, really didn&#x27;t want to get another shaver either.  The fact that this shaver works corded and cordless helped on the decision to go for it. What good would it do to get replacement blades if the battery croaked and you had no recourse to use it?</li>
    <li> very practical to trim the hair next to ear&lt;br /&gt;good for the cost&lt;br /&gt;nice cost benefit&lt;br /&gt;it may irritate the skin&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use</li>
    <li> Great quality. I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now, and it works great. The battery life lasts for several hours. I only charge it like once a month or twice every three months or so. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these now and they work great. I especially like the fact that you can use it cordless in the shower and also rinse the heads off with water to clean them inside and out. Phillips makes great stuff and this Norelco razor is just another example. I definitely recommend this item and the seller to anyone looking.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver four years ago. It is still going strong. The shave is not as close as with a wet shave; but after an hour or two who can tell anyway? The battery life is good. I&#x27;m still on the original battery. For the money, this is a fine shaver.</li>
    <li> 3 years later im still using this, everything working perfectly as intended, bought new heads once, working good as new.&lt;br /&gt;only slight problem, i keep this in ths car, and in cold winter it won&#x27;t start unless it gets warmer. minor problem, probly isn&#x27;t designed to be used in such cold condition anyways. now its summer, super hot inside the car, and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Philips Norelco 7310 for a few weeks now and must say how much I like it so far.  Like other reviewers have said, it is lighter with a smaller power source than other similar products, but that has not bothered me.  I never let my beard get too thick before I shave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons so far why I prefer it to my old shaver: relatively fast recharge time (book says 8 hours, but that is probably to recharge it fully), at least 30 minutes shave time, a blinking LED charge indicator to show that it&#x27;s fully charged, simple razor head release button, quieter than old shaver, and the individually floating shaver heads (which allow me to closely shave those tough spots like in the jowls.)  I look forward to further usage.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. I have had this shaver for a very long time and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> this shaver is the real deal , nice and easy to use not much of a headache to clean it , it does what it suppose to be SHAVING and that&#x27;s is the important</li>
    <li> I read about a lot of electric razors when deciding which to get my son for Christmas. This one seemed to be the best for the money. My son loves that is moves to fit contours and also gives a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for close to two years and used it a few times a week the entire time.  It is still going strong and still delivers a great shave.  This is a great value in a high quality shaver.  It seems to be the tipping point between features and price.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Norelco razors I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one is very fragile. One tap in the wrong place and it&#x27;s toast.</li>
    <li> I like my new shaver because it gives me a great shave&lt;br /&gt;in very little time.  Cleaning is a breeze and it holds a charge for&lt;br /&gt;a long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair on my face and was looking for a good shaver without paying $100+ and found the Phillips Norelco 7310.  I got this shaver almost 3 years ago.  It&#x27;s still working great, with no issues.  No complaints here.  I wash it out with hot water every week, let it dry and charge it every couple of weeks (sometimes even longer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s a little loud, which is probably the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  &amp;#34;Loud&amp;#34; is a bit of a stretch, it&#x27;s not even really that loud.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver ever so please keep in mind that I cant really compare the quality of this to other electric shavers. For what it costs I think its a bit pricey. Theres nothing really special to it. It does leave a close shave, which is one of the main things it advertises. Im pleased with it but like i mentioned, I feel like its pricey, maybe there are cheaper ones out there and do the same but if u have the money and dont feel like doing some research I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> One of the best cutting shavers I have used cuts better than the more expensive shavers only paid 29.00 and it was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Very clean shave, quiet and easy to use. Pulls and irritates me occassionally but I think I just need to learn to use it right.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor before specially the modern ones. Its a good one in this price range. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> No issues at all with it, rarely use it, but never any issues at all. Overall it was a great buy. Not much more I can say then that, I am sure there are other reviews that are a bit more detailed, but again I would say, worth the price and it works great!  Update - 6 years later - Guess what it still works, and actually it still works, great! The shave heads have fallen out a long time ago so I just use it as a groomer in the shower. Serousily to think this thing is still working 6 years later is pretty crazy. Even the battery holds up very well. Now with that being said I should mention two things. One I only use it for trimming about 2-3 times a month, all in the shower. The second thing is I paid $50 dollars for this 6 years ago, to pay over $100 now is pretty crazy. With that being said I couldn&#x27;t be happier looking back on what I paid.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Norelco wet and dry electric razors for years. I think they are the best. I sometimes use shaving cream as some of the &amp;#34;electric shave lotions&amp;#34; are not good for the razor ...</li>
    <li> If youve used this type of shaver for a long time, it wont disappoint. Good price and value. If you dont want to spend over $100 for a shaver, this is your best bet.</li>
    <li> I have a relatively thick beard.  This razor does  an excellent job of giving me a clean and close shave. In fact, I now have two of them - one for travel and one for daily use at home.  Good product....</li>
    <li> Happy with it. No negative remarks. One important feature is to use it both with and without the charger.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied, but I waited a long time</li>
    <li> My brother had a Philips electric razor that was blue, and I was able to use it once. I really liked it, especially since it was easier an shaving with a blade. He purchased his from Walmart for $50. I found this razor, which was cheaper than his, yet better for $43. It works great, is water resistant, quiet, and easy to clean. I didn&#x27;t know that on the back it had a separate pop-up trimmer. That too works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy way to shave with no cuts.</li>
    <li> This razor performs very well.  I was a blade shaver for years and recently switched to this model of Norelco.  I tried other razors like a Braun and a Remington but they never gave me as close a shave as the Norelco.</li>
    <li> The product is as good as I expected. I used philips shavers 20 years ago, and then switched to Brown. Philips Norelco 7310 shaves better, mainly individual hair on my neck. I am happy I switched back again.</li>
    <li> Close shave, but not as close as a regular razor. Does its job quickly, which is a plus. Charges quickly and holds its charge well.</li>
    <li> Maybe not the best in the range, but shaves well, without irritation, for those days when one doesn&#x27;t want to wet-shave. Four years of use now, just changed the blades. Battery still very OK.</li>
    <li> Based off other reviews that I&#x27;ve read I expected a little easier shaving from this product, but it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> The clasp on the lid could be stronger, it comes open sometimes. I also wish the blades lasted a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Great razor! For the price it&#x27;s a good deal! It works really well. Only thing he said was that it doesn&#x27;t let you know it needs to be charged. He said it actually works better if you let it die completely then charge it fully it&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> Works great good price</li>
    <li> Still working well. Inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers almost forever and have had several over those years.  This is my latest model and certainly not the fanciest.  At first I was dismayed by its lightness because I looked at that as being cheapness in materials, but then I realized that I was getting just as good a shave as I ever got and the batteries are holding up very well.  I&#x27;m quite pleased - enough so as to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Í&#x27;m unlucky. I bought this 7310 shaver in Target. After used around one year, it did not work in one day. I tried to repair it. Opening the back of the case, I found that the internal components of the shaver were all rusted. The bad sealing get water goes inside of the shaver.</li>
    <li> an excellent product that i would buy again if offered for sale norelco razors are better than others great purchase</li>
    <li> gift for my son in law...he was so happy to receive it.  asked for it and was happy to get it.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this shaver which I use at work.  It shaves closely, is not too loud, contours to my face, and goes about 20 shaves between charges.  It is lightweight, has a charge indicator and a mustache trimmer which works pretty well.  It flips open for easy cleaning.  I am ordering one that is supposedly a level up.</li>
    <li> bought this on sale less than $25 dollars.  It&#x27;s comfortable for the shaving and battery can last almost 3 weeks if each shave time around 3-4 mins.  I think i will starting getting Norelco in the future if they have on sale again.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Phillips electric shaver to have on those days when just a hurry up job is needed in order to be presentable. It works just fine, great for trimming the hair line and holds a very long charge on the battery.  Great little unit for those hurry up shaves.</li>
    <li> This product works as stated.  It is light weight and comfortable to handle.  So far the charge has held well and seems to keep power to the blades.  The trimmer is okay although it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as easy to operate as other shavers I have had. So far I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s shaving  - quality is good, price is even better!! I have brought 5 for my relatives, they all love it</li>
    <li> Works fine on arrival.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco shaver for years and find them to be a very good product. The 7310 model has some great advantages over my old one.  It is much easier to clean and can be used with or without the cord.</li>
    <li> As delivered.  Have enjoyed using the product especially the ease of cleaning,  All you have to do is pop open the lid and wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives me a nice a clean shave every morning.</li>
    <li> It does not shave nearly as clean as older models I have. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Gift but son didn&#x27;t like it. Prefers razor</li>
    <li> I already had one and was very happy with it. My wife borrowed mine and was blown away with the way it performed so in self defense, I bought her one too.  Once again, Thank You Amazon.</li>
    <li> This model has been out for a while.  I like my old one so I bought a new one just like it.</li>
    <li> I mostly only use the trimmer on the back of this electric shaver, mostly because that is the only part of it that is really worth trying to use. The 3-pronged shaving mechanism is weak and takes forever to get a remotely short and even shave.</li>
    <li> This Norelco razor is a very smooth shaver.  I have tried other brands, but came back to the Norelco because the heads are much smoother and they glide across your face much easier than other brands.  It is easier to clean than older models.  The only complaint I have is that the rechargeable battery does not last very long.  To maximize its life and run time, make sure you run it completely down before recharging and then recharge for a full day.  Norelco makes more expensive razors with a longer run-time battery, but they cost much more.  Overall, this Norelco is a very good value and I recommend it to all those who use electric razors.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff i&#x27;ve been looking for .it do the job and safe .very clear face now .i don&#x27;t werried about cut my face now</li>
    <li> I have used this for the past two years, and it has worked great. My only complaints are that it does not shave as closely as a real razor, and that it is difficult yo get your neck and Adam&#x27;s Apple region without causing irritation. I end using this and a real razor. I use this on most days when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time and a real razor maybe once a week.</li>
    <li> I replaced a very old electric razor with this one a while back. It gives a pretty close shave when it comes to electric standards.</li>
    <li> this was a gift, so I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF HE WAS PLEASED OR NOT.  I&#x27;ll have to wait to hear from him</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my dad who was having difficulty shaving after his stroke leaving him with only one good hand to use. He&#x27;s left handed and his right one is the one that&#x27;s good. Shaving with his right hand left him cuts and irritation. We decided to Suprise him on Christmas with the Norelco. He&#x27;s used electric razors in the past and didn&#x27;t like the experiences he had. He used it for the first time today and loved it! It was so easy to use and left him with an amazingly close shave. So glad we decided to go with this product!</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive shaver that works fine.  It has all of the key features of the much more expensive Philips shavers.  Why would you pay more for an electric razor?</li>
    <li> item is very handy for on the go...so far so good...i am pleased and i use it often....yep yep yep</li>
    <li> This my second purchase of this great shaver. I&#x27;ll be back again in a few years. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> I have a light beard so this is perfect.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a cheap shaver with good quality, this is what you want&lt;br /&gt;it is not great  but good enough</li>
    <li> I still use a blade most of the time, but I got this mainly for the beard trimmer that flips out of the back and that part works great. When I do use the rotary blades, they get as close as a blade in most places. The only way a blade wins every time is going against the hair growth, which I don&#x27;t ever do because I live in the South and I&#x27;d need subzero temperatures to make my skin feel better after that ordeal.</li>
    <li> good and useful but it need more improvements on how to properly use it so it does not irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> VERY DURABLE i been using it for four years already. it&#x27;s still like new. For real!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little more than a year now, and it still works great. The only real downside is that the heads are very pricey. Given that they tend to last for a year, I think its a very profitable trade-off</li>
    <li> A rechargeable razor is very convient.  A razor that will not hold a charge for a shave is a frustraction.</li>
    <li> Works as it should be. I use it for more than 4 months. The battery is really a good one.  I only recharge it once.</li>
    <li> We have bought a few different ones and none have given him this close of a shave. 4 times as much money on one of the others. He claims it is similar to a straight razor and it feels real close to me too! We like it so much we ordered a second for back up. He has a very tough beard and this cuts just great!</li>
    <li> super easy to clean and gives a very close shave without any nicks or irratation.  I would def buy again.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job, I get a close shave every time---the battery has enough of a  charge to last for a week--I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son as his first shaver.  Works well without pulling, easy to clean, easy to use, and works.</li>
    <li> I bought this 4 years ago, and it still working.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised and it&#x27;s exceptionally quiet.  Just what I needed...close shave, washes clean, long battery life, good trimmer, replaceable heads.</li>
    <li> Biggest mistake I&#x27;ve made on Amazon to date.  This razor breaks easily.  After several weeks of use, one of the rotatory blades became fixed.  The next week, a second rotatory stopped rotating.  The battery life is horrible.  My shaves with the Norelco were never close, and it was very easy to leave patches of untrimmed facial hair.  I found myself going over the same area many times, and still not getting every hair.  It&#x27;s rough on your skin, and painful to use.  Cleaning is horrible beacuse all the pieces fall out very easily.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Finally !!!! After having spent major dollars over the past few years on Electric shavers...the Norelco 7310 IS IT !!! My husband has fair skin, but heavy stubble...especially under chin &amp; neck.  No more \\&quot; leaning in \\&quot; just to do a morning/ or evening shave.  Done in a snap.  The Norelco 7310 head flips openfor easy rinse/clean ! This shaver charges quickly &amp; holds a charge. After many other more expensive shavers...the 7310 is the answer to our prayers.  Would definitely reccomend to others and/or buy as gift !</li>
    <li> Husband had a Norelco for years.  It finally died.  Bought another one, really expensive this time. Would not keep a charge, was weak for shaving, could not clean it properly. Found this Norelco and this is the one to get. Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Why 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Slow to shave cleanly&lt;br /&gt;2.  The top latch release is too easy to open.  It sometimes opens while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it does a good job and is very quiet.  Charges last about 5 days and it fully charges in less than one hour.</li>
    <li> I would suggest you do not purchase this product as it did not last even six months of normal use.  I went back to a blade shave and although it takes longer, it is worth the time.</li>
    <li> I have tried senso touch and all the razors twice the cost of this one but this is the only one I have bought 3 times (one gifted, one lost) because the comfort, close, and convenience triangle is best balanced. It has a built in trimmer, battery lasts, plus it is durable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember how long I have owned this shaver.  I bought another one for my dad as a gift.  Both of us love it.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks this razor takes longer and many more strokes to get a clean shave compared to his old Norelco razor.  He does not have a heavy beard.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Product just as advertised. Great merchant</li>
    <li> Bought this for family member. Works great. Cleaning it was a pain tho.</li>
    <li> Charge holds for a long period and the recharge is easy enough. I like that the indicator clearly tells me when it&#x27;s done. It&#x27;s either blinking or not, so you don&#x27;t have to think about which color indicates charging or not.</li>
    <li> .great razor, had it 3yrs now with no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2011 and it still works just as it did when I bought it. Holds an amazing charge still and only changed the razors once. It is durable and obviously a quality shaver. Doesn&#x27;t get the closest shave or the most accurate around the neck, but it gets the job done and to clean up the sideburns you can use the flip-up straight razor. So much simpler and quicker then shaving with a regular razor and shaving cream, I LOVE it! Oh...As a side note, I didn&#x27;t pay anywhere near what it&#x27;s going for nowadays hah, guess they realized its worth and quality now!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas present for my son that HATES shaving.... Thank you, thank you...he looks sooooo much better now!&lt;br /&gt;Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave the region under his chin, down his neck as well as the rest...maybe it&#x27;ll just take time for his beard to do better.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good, but could give a closer shave</li>
    <li> purchased as gift for father, he enjoys the razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for about a month and get a good shave. It is much lighter than my old model which I had for 8 years. It sounds like it runs at a slower speed, but I do get a good clean shave. I get 7-8 shaves before I need to recharge and I like that I can rinse the heads between shaves. Not a bad deal for the price.</li>
    <li> My Husband uses this every few days for his face and loves it. It cuts really close to the skin and does not hurt in the process. When moving around the jawline it still works. Charging takes a few hours and you can get a good few uses out of it before it loses its juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this, has made my Husbands shaving so much easier and faster. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> been using it for a year and no problem so far. shaves really well, battery lasts but cant tell how much because it doesnt have a low bat indicator. that would be a cons, since you may ran out in the middle of a shave (you notice it though, because it starts to lose its power and then it shuts off)</li>
    <li> I got this as a present for my grandpa a few month a go. So far its been 3month or so and he likes it.</li>
    <li> SE LA REGALE A MI ESPOSO Y SE CONVIRTIO EN INDISPENSABLE PARA EL. SALIMOS AL EXTERIOR Y SE LA LLEVO SIN PENSARLO.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for over 2 years, and it still functions perfectly. Is it the closest shave you&#x27;ll ever have? No, but I have yet to find an electric shaver that provides that. It serves its purpose well; quick, stays sharp, holds a charge for a LONG time, and has a convenient flip-out trimmer for sideburns and whatnot. Highly reccomended!</li>
    <li> I had to give up using this product.  It was pulling hairs.  In addition, it often required that I go over the same part of my face multiple times which would cause redness and irritation.  This was my first experience with an electric razor but it will definitely be my last.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband and he didn&#x27;t care for it.  Said it didn&#x27;t cut properly.  I don&#x27;t know if he still has it or not.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve had in a long time. Does a very good job, cuts very close. There&#x27;s nothing like a decent-quality shaver.</li>
    <li> Shaves closely and comfortably after a less a than three-week breakin period. Norelco has been my shaver of choice for over 25 years; the 7310 is the best yet for shaving.  It&#x27;s been running on the initial charge for slightly over a month, but usually I only shave every other day.&lt;br /&gt;However, after about a month, the charging/charged light malfunctioned.  A call to Phillips/Norelco&#x27;s support was handled well.  After telling the rep what the problem was, he put me on hold for about two minutes, then said a  replacement with a return shipping label for returning mine would be sent to me.  An e-mail arrived almost immediately confirming this.  If I remember correctly, it will be four plus weeks before it arrives.  Hopefully, the remaining charge will last that long.  If it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll try recharging; just because the indicator doesn&#x27;t work doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t charging.&lt;br /&gt;Except for the light failing, it&#x27;s a five-star shaver so far.</li>
    <li> Got this at a great deal and has been work great for me. Not a hairy guy so I&#x27;m not a heavy dity user. But for the quick light shave it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my dad. He always had difficulty to shave on his neck but this is a cool product.</li>
    <li> I hate these kind of razors if your disabled like me u go through razors like there nothing I&#x27;m lucky to to get 6 months out of a razor however this particular razor did not  even last a month all I got out of it was 2 weeks of shaving everyday&amp; it crumbled in my hand 😡😡😡</li>
    <li> Good close shave without ripping up your skin!!</li>
    <li> Well I can&#x27;t complain unlike you all I snatched this puppy  up at a garage sell for $8!!!! NEW!!! I know lucky right? Anyway it&#x27;s much better than my 10 yr old norelco in the 3 heads shaving department, but in the beard trimming department there is something nice about having a duller trimmer. I mean my old one doesn&#x27;t pull my hairs and I can run it along my beard many times without shaving it to the skin making it easy to shape my beard. THIS one on the other hand look out if your not trying to go full skin you might end up sorry. I highly suggest using a separate beard trimmer if you get this razor. Otherwise this one works great and quiet and goes cordless of course in case you wondered about that. BTW there are NO replacement heads including even the the box might mislead some to believe it. It merely states that you can keep your razors sharp with (BUYING) the replacement heads.But Hey I used my last one for 10 years and still going good with no replacement</li>
