      <li>I LOVE this shaving cream/soap.</li>
      <li>Price and availability are excellent both online and locally for me.</li>
      <li>Love this shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Got four more</li>
      <li>My favorite shaving cream.</li>
      <li>I wanted her to be able to shave her legs without having to use a shaving puck and brush and this is the solution.</li>
      <li>Given how long a bottle lasts, that is the perfect price point.</li>
      <li>I am not a big fan of most men&#x27;s shaving cream as they don&#x27;t smell very good.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;-pump is convenient and squirts the ideal amount needed&lt;br /&gt;-due to great lather one bottle lasts at least twenty shaves</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re like me, and only use cruelty free, vegan products, this is an excellent choice.  </li>
      <li>I love how smooth the shave is on my legs.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, no burning, smooth shave, love the pump style vs a canned style.</li>
      <li>FEELS REFRESHING AND MAKES FOR A SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
      <li>I am happy to report that this shave cream has brightened up my mornings and made my legs soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It works easily into a fine lather---2 pumps on a soaked brush</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really great for a nice close shave and without all the chemicals you find in other shaving creams.</li>
      <li>All the the KMF shave creams have nice scents---but they are mild fragrances that fade fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>The recipient liked it so much, I had to see what he was talking about.  </li>
      <li>Product is great, but my last two shipments have had defective pumps.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this with my Panasonic Arc 3 (wet/dry) and the shave is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I checked out this line because my goal is to go paraben free this year.  </li>
      <li>This is a great alternative to traditional shaving cream.</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>another shaves worth of sauce out of the bottle when I unscrew the top.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Smooth comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Though I am very happy with what this stuff does for my legs, I think I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking to see if I can find a shaving cream that works for my whole body since I don&#x27;t really have enough room in my shower for each body part to have its own lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I would recommend this shave cream to anyone looking for a smooth, comfortable shave with out irritation.</li>
      <li>Recently my husband tried it and said this worked great for shaving his face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is even better if you use it with a shaving brush, but that isn&#x27;t necessary to get a good shave.  </li>
      <li>Far superior to pressurized can shave cream.</li>
      <li>I love anything mint so this stuff is right up my alley..</li>
      <li>New favorite!</li>
      <li>Works great, the bottle lasts a long time, and I&#x27;m not using pressurized metal cans (in fact, I can recycle the bottle).  </li>
      <li>Super silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>I got her the three pack of this and after about 2 weeks of putting of using a double edged safety razor she finally surprised me and came out the shower saying it was the best shave ever.</li>
      <li>All the scents are pleasant, but cool mint is a personal favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cool Mint Moisture Shave is pearly white liquid with a pleasant, minty fragrance.</li>
      <li>The mint leaves a slightly cool, tingly feeling.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff - been using it for years and it stays ready go even after storing it so buying the multi-package is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would say 6 months or more, depending on how much you use.  </li>
      <li>My Face Cool Mint Moisture Shave.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the Cool Mint, but both scents are quite mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have this on subscribe and save because I love it so much.</li>
      <li>Shave.&lt;br /&gt;For experienced wet shavers, here is one really worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it for my head and face and it is great as it doesn&#x27;t clog the razor and is not super foamy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  It takes a small amount compared to regular shave creams, literally only a few drops. I love the pump action that doesn&#x27;t need propellant so it lasts longer.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and even give it as gifts!</li>
    <li> The only shaving cream I will use.</li>
    <li> You only need a pump or two - this bottle will last you for so long - just wish it was a little more moisturizing - but it&#x27;s probably the best out there!</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face Cool Mint Moisture Shave is pearly white liquid with a pleasant, minty fragrance. It has a thinner consistency than most other shaving products but it lathers up better than you&#x27;d expect, though if you&#x27;re pale-skinned like me it can be hard to see once you&#x27;ve put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaving lotion for a couple of weeks I&#x27;ve had both good and bad experiences. The good is that it gives me the best shave ever for my legs. Normally my legs tend to be dried out and a little irritated after shaving, but using this stuff makes them silky smooth and soft. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this lotion does not do the same thing for my underarms. In fact, it gives me razor burn there, which is weird because that&#x27;s the one place I&#x27;ve never ever had razor burn before. I thought it might be due to an interaction with my deodorant, but my friend uses a different deodorant and also got razor burn when she tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I am very happy with what this stuff does for my legs, I think I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking to see if I can find a shaving cream that works for my whole body since I don&#x27;t really have enough room in my shower for each body part to have its own lotion.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I use this product for shaving. I use it for my head and face and it is great as it doesn&#x27;t clog the razor and is not super foamy. The bottle lasts quite a while and the scent is pleasant. I doubt we will switch to anything else</li>
    <li> Purchased this for the first time in FL two years ago and loved it, I was very happy to find it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so slick that once on your fingers you can&#x27;t hold a fork or a razor unless you rinse it off first.  I&#x27;ve told several people about this item and they all call me the shavemeister expert!  Once you learn your \\&quot; how to apply bones\\&quot;  you&#x27;ll want to shave everything you can catch that won&#x27;t bite.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this product for a while and it&#x27;s really great for a nice close shave and without all the chemicals you find in other shaving creams.</li>
    <li> This shave creme works well.  Both my husband and I really enjoy it.  It smells so minty and feels so nice on my skin.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have too many harsh chemicals in it.  I like this brand of products.</li>
    <li> For anyone new to \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; wet shaving, here is your first cream.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with KMF Moisture Shave.&lt;br /&gt;For experienced wet shavers, here is one really worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMF is value-priced.  It performs on par with much more expensive products, producing lots of lubricating, cushioning lather.  It is the most skin-friendly shaving product I&#x27;ve ever tried---it never stings, burns or leaves my face feeling dry or tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product works fine with or without a brush, you&#x27;re missing out if you don&#x27;t try this with a shaving brush.  It works easily into a fine lather---2 pumps on a soaked brush and you&#x27;ll get plenty of lather for 4 passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool Mint has a mild, minty fragrance that is pleasant.  All the the KMF shave creams have nice scents---but they are mild fragrances that fade fairly quickly.  Perhaps the patchouli fragrance (which I really like, too) is the boldest of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve had mixed success using shaving soaps, here&#x27;s a suggestion:  put a squirt of this on top of a puck of shaving soap and give it a go with your brush.  You will get what is called \\&quot;superlather\\&quot;, (aptly named!) and KMF excels at augmenting shaving soaps in this way.  Try it...you&#x27;ll find it very interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding product.</li>
    <li> I love anything mint so this stuff is right up my alley..All of their products are wonderful anyway, so how can you go wrong by ordering this?</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff and I typically hate scented products. The mint smell is not only refreshing but cools the skin. The shaving cream itself is very moisturizing. My favorite shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Buy the unscented version and scent it yourself.</li>
    <li> Works great, the bottle lasts a long time, and I&#x27;m not using pressurized metal cans (in fact, I can recycle the bottle).  It also helps that it smells great, feels natural and provides enough lubricant.  It is a little messier (drips) than the chemical foams of most shaving creams but it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, and only use cruelty free, vegan products, this is an excellent choice.  It works fine, smells nice, and isn&#x27;t overly expensive.</li>
    <li> I love the Kiss My Face Cool Mint Moisture Shave.  It leaves a gives me a close shave without any irritation (and I tend to have sensitive skin).  The mint leaves a slightly cool, tingly feeling.</li>
    <li> I bought this to avoid using chemicals on my body. This is absolutely the best shave cream. It is soft, moisturizing, and cooling. LOVE it. And this is a great price.</li>
    <li> love this stuff better the shaving cream.  A little bit goes a long way.  I like the smell and how i can rub on my face like i was applying lotion but its not oily.  If you are looking for a change from the regular shave cream then try this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best when it comes to shaving anything on your body. Way better than soap and now my guy friends even use on their faces and man-scaping.</li>
    <li> I used to get razor burn even with normal shaving gels/cream.  Not with this!  Pump one or two pumps into my hand, add a little water, spread on my legs, enjoy the smell, and shave away!  I have this on subscribe and save because I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I checked out this line because my goal is to go paraben free this year.  I was not expecting much but it has surpassed expectations.  I like the texture and the smell.  I am happy to report that this shave cream has brightened up my mornings and made my legs soft and smooth.  Update on 3/4/13:  I just wanted to update that I am still using this shave cream and I still love it!  I have it delivered to my house automatically so that I never run out.</li>
    <li> Super silky and smooth. I love the mint smell, but, ladies, be careful using this around your bikini area because it tingles and feels very cold! Otherwise, no burning, smooth shave, love the pump style vs a canned style.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, as it is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t foam up into useless lather.  It protects well while I use a Panasonic wet/dry shaver and has enough lubricant to allow final touch up with a standard razor afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this particular shipment was a comedy of errors - it left the distribution center late  (I was informed of that), arrived later than the \\&quot;2 Day Air\\&quot; standard, and was shown to have been delivered when it had not (it came the next morning).  There was no packing slip or other documentation.  It was 4 bottles packed in a plastic bag within a box, and one bottle leaked a bit, leaving a soapy \\&quot;slime\\&quot; in some areas.</li>
    <li> I always struggled with shaving due to my sensitive skin. This has been a life saver for me for years! I love how smooth the shave is on my legs. I also like the mint version because my skin feels so fresh after using it. They also have travel size versions of this too which is easier to pack then those mini foam cans of standard shave cream.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased a 4-pack of kiss-my-face shaving cream from Amazon. It&#x27;s a reliable product and I like the mint scent. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of most men&#x27;s shaving cream as they don&#x27;t smell very good.  They work fine, but if I have to put something on my face everyday, I want it to smell good - no not the fruity, flowery smell of women&#x27;t shave creams, just something inoffensive.  I discovered this product at the grocery store and bought a bottle out of curiosity, and liked it.  But at $8 dollars a bottle every place I looked, it was steep.  Then I found this 4 pack, which works out to about $5/bottle.  Given how long a bottle lasts, that is the perfect price point.</li>
    <li> Excellant shave cream</li>
    <li> I have had great luck using this shaving cream. I always get a smooth shave with very little friction.</li>
    <li> Smells good, lathers well for a great shave, and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I guess its the mint get In there and tingle them hairs right off yer fave.  Costs more than Gillette but the bottle never goes dry.  Hell that pump stopped pumpin a month ago and I&#x27;m still shakin yet another shaves worth of sauce out of the bottle when I unscrew the top.  Got four more and it&#x27;ll last me a life time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It helps the health of my skin</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shaving lotion and it lasts for a really long time. The minty scent helps perk me up in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I found this much easier to make shaving cream compared to using a soap.  The only problem is it dries out quicker, and it&#x27;s hard to get the extra product out of the bottom of the container once the pump can&#x27;t pick it up anymore.</li>
    <li> The product works great -- a little goes a long way, easy to apply, close shave, non-drying. My issue is with the pump. I&#x27;ve had several that don&#x27;t work at all, and those that do, seem to leave about 1/3 of the product in the bottom of the container and stop working. It&#x27;s time to re-order, and I&#x27;m thinking about trying something else.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Didn&#x27;t realize that this was the price for 4 bottles and I gave a bottle to one of my employees and he said the same thing, best shave ever.</li>
    <li> Without having tried the product myself, I bought a bottle of Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as part of a gift package.  The recipient liked it so much, I had to see what he was talking about.  That was over ten years ago, yet we&#x27;re both still hooked on Kiss My Face Moisture Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little squirt goes a long way, and leaves legs and faces feeling silky soft.  Razors just seem to perform better using this versus traditional foams or gels.  All the scents are pleasant, but cool mint is a personal favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only a few consumer goods I consider essentials, and Kiss My Face makes two of them--moisture shave and olive oil bar soap.  Both are economically priced and work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees, Men&#x27;s Shave Cream as it has become difficult to find here and was my absolute favorite. (item here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GIOV1O/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s00_i01) I was curious why it had such a low user review and decided to try this shave cream as recommended by a reviewer of the Burt&#x27;s. I do in fact find this shave cream to be far better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Smooth comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;2) Longer blade life (Gillette Fission ProGlide)&lt;br /&gt;3) Zero irritation (I&#x27;ve stopped using aftershave balm/lotion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Hard to find locally&lt;br /&gt;2) Not as close of a shave as Burt&#x27;s, but still close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would recommend this shave cream to anyone looking for a smooth, comfortable shave with out irritation.</li>
    <li> Once you get used to the texture of this product compared to aerosol shaving creams, it will become your favorite. The trick to this shaving cream is to spend several seconds lathering up in your hands before spreading it on your face or body. It is very creamy with a thick lather and you use less than stuff in an aerosol can. The mint is my favorite - so cooling and refreshing. This is a staple in my house and I buy through Subscribe &amp; Save to save a few bucks. It is always packaged tightly and arrives safely.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Been using it with a shaving brush for over a year now. I&#x27;ll never go back to foams and gels.</li>
    <li> A great smell and feel gives a great comfortable shave!</li>
    <li> I find this ten times better than aerosol lather.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shaving cream/soap. It is by far the best shaving product I have ever used. Unfortunately it has some potentially harmful ingredients (namely RETINYL ACETATE (VITAMIN A ACETATE)) and it makes me want to stop using it. I hate that products can be called natural leading you to think they are safe when you are using something that could be putting you at higher risk for cancer. It is possible that the risk is lower than other products out there so maybe that is a plus. I can only give 3 stars to something with bad ingredients though.</li>
    <li> Love it. Far superior to pressurized can shave cream.</li>
    <li> My face and my wife love this stuff. I love that it&#x27;s plastic too (no more rust stains in the shower from the metal canisters).</li>
    <li> best shaving cream in the world</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 8 years.  I find it provides a much smoother shave than gels or creams.  Even though it seems more expensive, it lasts longer than conventional shave creams/gels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. Recently my husband tried it and said this worked great for shaving his face.</li>
    <li> I have been using KMF Moisture Shave for years now with cartridge razors and applying by hand and it has always been a smooth, slick shave. There are few if any other shaving products I have used that are as slippery and allow the razor to glide across the skin as easily. Top notch stuff. Recently I went back to wet shaving with a double edge safety razor like my father taught me when I was a teenager. I now use a shave brush ( synthetic or boar both work well, I have not tried badger as I don&#x27;t own one yet ) to lather this in a bowl and it works easily and quickly to create a lather good for 4 passes ( although I never do more than three ). It also never dries out. In fact if one wets one&#x27;s face even after shaving the cream off from a certain area it gets reasonably slick again so you can do touch ups or spots you may have missed a bit. The scent of all of KMF shave products is mild but terrific. Nice, but not overpowering and the scent tends to disappear by the end of the shave so it does not interfere with an aftershave or cologne of your choice. It&#x27;s not the thickest lather of any shave product I have used, but it is the slickest, and it definitely gets the job done. Price and availability are excellent both online and locally for me. Our local grocery store ( which rhymes with Bop and Drop ;-)&lt;br /&gt;carries it for just under six bucks for the eleven ounce pump. And it can obviously be bought on Amazon as well for even cheaper if you subscribe. The ingredients list, which can be read if you click on the picture of the back of the bottle on this Amazon page shows only natural ingredients. No parabens, no animal products, and no preservatives. And the bottle is recyclable when you&#x27;re done. All in all you owe it to yourself to give a KMF shave product a try ( any scent or even unscented ). Good Luck and enjoy !</li>
    <li> PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-great for highly sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;-reputable company &amp;#34;Kiss my Face&amp;#34; is known for using quality ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-upon application produces a substantial amount of lather&lt;br /&gt;-pump is convenient and squirts the ideal amount needed&lt;br /&gt;-due to great lather one bottle lasts at least twenty shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-once bottle gets to the last few shaves it is challenging to pump out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:&lt;br /&gt;Been using this particular shave lotion, and only this shave lotion, for four years.  Nothing compares as I have skin that is highly sensitive that becomes irritated easily.  It does provide a tingle when using because it is mint but it is not overpowering and often i find it to be cooling which is nice in a warm shower while shaving one&#x27;s legs.  The lotion itself is rather rich and a large amount is not necessary. Would and do recommend this product to female and male friends of mine.</li>
    <li> I visited my brother in NYC over 10 years ago. Forgetting my shaving cream, he let me use his\\&quot;Kiss my Face\\&quot; cream. After my shave , my skin so much softer and smoother. I have been a fan ever since. I moved last year and couldnt find the product easily. Amazon saved the day. This product is the best shave cream ever!</li>
    <li> FEELS REFRESHING AND MAKES FOR A SMOOTH SHAVE. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY, ALSO SMELLS GOOD. gOOD PRICE ALSO</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this with my Panasonic Arc 3 (wet/dry) and the shave is fantastic. I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave than this. And, yes, I&#x27;m getting more kisses than ever!</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream out there!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  It takes very little to do the job, so the pump bottle lasts many months.  I would say 6 months or more, depending on how much you use.  I use it to shave my face and head.  It works better than any aerosol cream, and probably as well as any puck-style \\&quot;mug and brush\\&quot; cream that I&#x27;ve used.  And it is very inexpensive per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is even better if you use it with a shaving brush, but that isn&#x27;t necessary to get a good shave.  I&#x27;ve used the Key Lime and the Cool Mint.  I prefer the Cool Mint, but both scents are quite mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as well as expensive options, is less expensive than aerosol cans, and you only have to buy a pump bottle maybe twice per year.  And it leaves your face feeling great.  Everyone who shaves should give this a try.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to traditional shaving cream. It&#x27;s creamy, smells good and safe for your skin. New favorite!</li>
    <li> I use it with a shaving brush to give a great lather.  Gentle and refreshing with a very subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> KMF&#x27;s shaving cream is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;foam up\\&quot; when you apply it, but that is because it&#x27;s a natural product, without the chemicals in the traditional brands.  The foaming thing is a gimmick anyways, you don&#x27;t really need it.  I prefer the cool mint flavor but the other ones work just as well.</li>
    <li> This is not a lotion I bought it because it is called shaving lotion. If you are looking for shaving lotion get a different product I use Beard Lube and it is WICKED expensive so I wanted to try this well you get what you pay for. This is a shaving slime your best bet is to whip it up with a brush in to a foam, it will whip up and this way it is not horrible but not a lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving gel/cream I will every buy again. The mint smell is invigorating. It lathers without being too thick so you get a close shave without any irritation. I have to buy double the amount because my husband now uses it as well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - been using it for years and it stays ready go even after storing it so buying the multi-package is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shaving, fresh scent and soothing from the mint.</li>
    <li> The only shaving cream my husband and I use....works well for sensitive skin and the mint fragrance is refreshing.  Shaving with a cream based moisturizer is so much better than the average shaving gel--it absorbs into the skin and provides less resistance.  Plus, the product is free of all the crazy chemicals one finds in the major shaving gels.</li>
    <li> This is a great, refreshing shaving product that works great for both men and women. I shave daily in the shower, and just a small amount gives me a smooth, close shave. I find that my razors last longer, as well. I appreciate the fresh fragrance and the feeling that it leaves behind.</li>
    <li> Product arrived leaking</li>
    <li> Product is great, but my last two shipments have had defective pumps.</li>
    <li> My hubby is very picky about alot of things, including his shaving lotion. He loves this stuff because it is all natural, does not irritate his skin. He never gets bumps after shaving, it does not burn or sting.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I love this shaving cream! It&#x27;s cruelty-free and very moisturizing. Nice, refreshing smell and thick consistency. I will never use another shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I wanted my wife to get into wet shaving as I find it easier on my face and wallet. I got her the three pack of this and after about 2 weeks of putting of using a double edged safety razor she finally surprised me and came out the shower saying it was the best shave ever. I wanted her to be able to shave her legs without having to use a shaving puck and brush and this is the solution. She said the mint is a nice refreshing feeling but not overpowering in anyway and she uses two squirts from the bottle on each leg and that is more then enough. She said it lathers up very well and  she can get the lightest hint of mint when she is done shaving. The product seems rather nice and I might have try it on my face sooner or later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my wife doesn&#x27;t usually speak very highly of many products I have to give this five stars. I would recommend any woman who is moving to wet shaving to try this.</li>
