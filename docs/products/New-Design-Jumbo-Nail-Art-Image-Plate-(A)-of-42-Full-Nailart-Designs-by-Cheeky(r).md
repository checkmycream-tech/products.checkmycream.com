      <li>it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>

      <li>Good luck with that!!</li>
      <li>This is an awesome buy for those who want to start stamping.  </li>
      <li>Very good product!&lt;br /&gt;Figures obtained good and do good designs!</li>
      <li>they like to make their customers happy...</li>
      <li>A great variety of designs which lets you be as creative as you want.</li>
      <li>Do I appear satisfied or happy??</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was my first set of images and I am still very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love them - I recommend!</li>
      <li>but I have been taping a sheet of paper around the image and it kind of helps.  </li>
      <li>These worked good, still like my Konad plates better.  </li>
      <li>Nice designs</li>
      <li>Hopefully, they will improve it soon because there are some really nice designs here.</li>
      <li>But anyways love the plates, love the designs and its really nice having so many designs on one plate!  </li>
      <li>Such a great variety for a great price.</li>
      <li>etchings are not as fine or detailed as any Konad or some of the Bundle Monster plates, but they get the job done very nicely.  </li>
      <li>This plate is great there are a lot of really pretty patterns and for the price</li>
      <li>Great quality for large images and stamping.</li>
      <li>so no problems fitting the image.</li>
      <li>I decided to try out a better one, and discovered that the problem was the plates themselves..</li>
      <li>Just as most people I recommend a plastic scraper.</li>
      <li>of the most affected images are:&lt;br /&gt;· top row, image 3&lt;br</li>
      <li>the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say that I would recommend or purchase more Cheeky plates.</li>
      <li>I love this cheeky plate.</li>
      <li>Lots of interesting patterns.  </li>
      <li>I love my cheeky plates and will not ever purchase plates elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I have use this plate many times.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>They work fine for me and now even better since I got a XL Squishy Stamper.</li>
      <li>these were some of the patterns I was most excited about...</li>
      <li>They are etched nicely and the images come out nice and clear in the stamper.  </li>
      <li>plate is easy to clean</li>
      <li>, so I thought that it was because of my cheap nail stamper.</li>
      <li>Big beautiful designs, fast shipping, no complaints:)</li>
      <li>This was my first stamping plate and I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>Apply the polish, scrape the excess, pick up the image, blow on it for 1-2 seconds, and then roll it onto your clean nail with medium and even pressure.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps the patterns are too detailed, but most of them don&#x27;t really seem to work.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t quite get full coverage with one stamp.</li>
      <li>The shipping time was reasonable and I will be ordering more plates.</li>
      <li>I like them very much!</li>
      <li>The different designs are amazing.</li>
      <li>I have fun trying to figure out which design</li>
      <li>Also, worth the price.</li>
      <li>The designs are also completely different than what I ordered, and it scratches very easily.</li>
      <li>The package arrived yesterday, so I was very excited to try it out, but it was a  major letdown.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping for being free(Super Saver).  </li>
      <li>I had no problem stamping the whole width of even my thumbnail, no gaps at the sides!</li>
      <li>I sent several more emails to Cheeky.</li>
      <li>I like the images and really want these to work, so I will keep trying and hope I can find a way to make them work!</li>
      <li>I really like these!</li>
      <li>When I first got this, it was not working no matter what I did</li>
      <li>First of all I ordered everything on a Saturday and received everything by Wednesday.  </li>
      <li>So far it has not disappointed.</li>
      <li>images look ok, but several are very degraded in quality.</li>
      <li>Is this positive feedback??</li>
      <li>100% positive feedback... and</li>
      <li>Also everything was neatly packaged and the blue plastic film was easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>It arrived packaged well and the blue plastic removes from the plate easily.  </li>
      <li>The plus is the area large stamping areas and work well on thumbs and toes.</li>
      <li>but it certainly was not a deal breaker or interfere with the stamping.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like the item, but I just didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I got more than enough for my short nails but some people with longer nails might need a larger stamping tool, if there even is one available, to pick up the whole image.</li>
      <li>I tried each image multiple times, and have only been able to get 3 of the images to transfer to the stamper.  </li>
      <li>My gf bought them and said they&#x27;re decent.  </li>
      <li>they ensure high satisfaction from this product...</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re either grossly simplified or lack all the fine details... crooked, misaligned or off-center</li>
      <li>The plate comes attached to a hard plastic backing and is very easy to manipulate.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more work to clean up the plates if you&#x27;re using one of the interior images because the polish gets in other images, but really,  it&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
      <li>I have large hands and always have to fill in gaps on my thumb and middle fingernails.</li>
      <li>The images on this Cheeky plate are much larger and the plates are much cheaper than Konad.</li>
      <li>A few of the designs work, but not the highly detailed ones.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a knock on the plates by any means, but I couldn&#x27;t pick up the whole vertical image with my Konad double sided stamper.</li>
      <li>The designs are a good size, but it&#x27;s unfortunate that they don&#x27;t work as well as my Konad plates.</li>
      <li>The 2 different houndstooth patterns on the plate as pictured are not actually on the plate -- and the entire bottom row on mine looks to have been done off-kilter, the designs don&#x27;t look right at all.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s mediocre at best with a lot of images coming out patchy; something I don&#x27;t experience with any of my other stamping plates from other companies, so I know it&#x27;s not me, my polishes or my stamping technique.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t order this; get a real stamping plate that actually has deep enough designs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not had any trouble getting the polish to transfer so long as the plate and stamper are clean, the nail is oil-free, and the image is sliiiightly tacky before application.  </li>
      <li>It is hard to try to clean the plate because of that</li>
      <li>I fell in love with nail art stamping but soon found that the standard size Konad plates did not cover my nailbeds and made it very hard to stamp (especially as a beginner).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Plate is extremely difficult to clean between stamps (lots of rough lines and grooves) and most of the designs are not etched deep enough so they tend to make a big mess.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The plate was packaged very well, even with little protectors around the corners to prevent damage...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like these! The plates themselves are 8 1/4\\&quot; x 5 11/16\\&quot; mounted on a thick plastic backing that extends a bit past the edges of the plate; no sharp edges are exposed. Each stamp image is 1.5 cm wide and 2 cm tall at the bottom points (1.7 cm at center). The images transfer well with regular nail polish. I have large hands and always have to fill in gaps on my thumb and middle fingernails. I had no problem stamping the whole width of even my thumbnail, no gaps at the sides! My big toenail was close but I couldn&#x27;t quite get full coverage with one stamp. It&#x27;s a little more work to clean up the plates if you&#x27;re using one of the interior images because the polish gets in other images, but really,  it&#x27;s not a big deal.  This isn&#x27;t a knock on the plates by any means, but I couldn&#x27;t pick up the whole vertical image with my Konad double sided stamper. I got more than enough for my short nails but some people with longer nails might need a larger stamping tool, if there even is one available, to pick up the whole image.</li>
    <li> First of all I ordered everything on a Saturday and received everything by Wednesday.  Super fast shipping for being free(Super Saver).  Also everything was neatly packaged and the blue plastic film was easy to remove.  The plate is mounted on a thick sturdy plastic backing that extends past the edge so no sharp edges.  But anyways love the plates, love the designs and its really nice having so many designs on one plate!  Very big designs so no problems fitting the image. It is hard to try to clean the plate because of that but I have been taping a sheet of paper around the image and it kind of helps.  Used all Konad polish so not sure how it stamps with regular polish.  Big beautiful designs, fast shipping, no complaints:)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the images on this plate are not as crisp as they are in the image. Perhaps the patterns are too detailed, but most of them don&#x27;t really seem to work. I have another Cheeky plate and it&#x27;s pretty good. This one is not the same quality. A few of the designs work, but not the highly detailed ones. Hopefully, they will improve it soon because there are some really nice designs here.</li>
    <li> I love this cheeky plate. Lots of interesting patterns.  They are etched nicely and the images come out nice and clear in the stamper.  I have use this plate many times.</li>
    <li> The images on this plate are neat designs and the size is perfect.  It arrived packaged well and the blue plastic removes from the plate easily.  But...the images are not etched deep enough.  I cannot get them to work!  I&#x27;ve tried using different polishes (Konad and regular), I&#x27;ve tried using different stampers and scrapers.  I&#x27;ve tried scraping at different angles and scraping from different directions across the image.  I tried each image multiple times, and have only been able to get 3 of the images to transfer to the stamper.  I like the images and really want these to work, so I will keep trying and hope I can find a way to make them work!</li>
    <li> Well this is certainly one item, and company, that seems to promise a lot but fails miserably to live up to claims and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plate was packaged very well, even with little protectors around the corners to prevent damage... but once I had the wrapping and film off... what a disappointment!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some images look ok, but several are very degraded in quality. They&#x27;re either grossly simplified or lack all the fine details... crooked, misaligned or off-center... gaps where there shouldn&#x27;t be or shapes running into each other where they shouldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the most affected images are:&lt;br /&gt;· top row, image 3&lt;br /&gt;· 3rd row, image 1&lt;br /&gt;· 5th row, image 6&lt;br /&gt;· 7th row, images 2, 3, 4 and 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was choked considering these were some of the patterns I was most excited about... they&#x27;re ugly and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried stamping with it and it&#x27;s mediocre at best with a lot of images coming out patchy; something I don&#x27;t experience with any of my other stamping plates from other companies, so I know it&#x27;s not me, my polishes or my stamping technique. Basically it looks like someone couldn&#x27;t have cared less about the quality of this plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a word about their customer service... NONEXISTENT!!! After my plate was still MIA 35 business days after shipping, I emailed Cheeky to inquire about the status of my order. NO response. I sent several more emails to Cheeky. I&#x27;ve never received a response to any of them... EVER!! You have a question? An inquiry? A complaint? Want a refund? Good luck with that!! Seriously!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheeky *claims* they ensure high satisfaction from this product... they like to make their customers happy... 100% positive feedback... and a money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like it... BULLSH*T! Do I appear satisfied or happy?? Is this positive feedback?? Have I received my money back?? NOOOOOO!! All I can say is, BUYER BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> This plate is great there are a lot of really pretty patterns and for the price it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> Very good product!&lt;br /&gt;Figures obtained good and do good designs! I like them very much! Quality of five stars. You&#x27;ll love them - I recommend!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome buy for those who want to start stamping.  The plate comes attached to a hard plastic backing and is very easy to manipulate.  I like having all the images on one plate and I especially like having the French curve at the bottom of each image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The etchings are not as fine or detailed as any Konad or some of the Bundle Monster plates, but they get the job done very nicely.  I&#x27;ve found that using stamping polish with these can be overpowering since the designs are a little &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34;, so I stamp with a heavily pigmented drug store brand (or whatever is on deep discount).  I&#x27;ve not had any trouble getting the polish to transfer so long as the plate and stamper are clean, the nail is oil-free, and the image is sliiiightly tacky before application.  Speaking of, since the detailing is wider within the image, stamping with wet polish will blur the image.  Apply the polish, scrape the excess, pick up the image, blow on it for 1-2 seconds, and then roll it onto your clean nail with medium and even pressure.  Voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plate is easy to clean and I don&#x27;t have a problem keeping polish confined to the area with which I am working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first set of images and I am still very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it does come from China, so expect a wait for delivery.</li>
    <li> This was my first stamping plate and I am satisfied with the product. The only small detail i was not fond of was it was slightly bent probably was from not lying flat but it certainly was not a deal breaker or interfere with the stamping. The shipping time was reasonable and I will be ordering more plates.</li>
    <li> The different designs are amazing. I have fun trying to figure out which design I want to give a go. So far it has not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great quality for large images and stamping.</li>
    <li> Placed an order for this item on 9/20/12 and patiently waited for it to arrive from China. The package arrived yesterday, so I was very excited to try it out, but it was a  major letdown.&lt;br /&gt;Plate is extremely difficult to clean between stamps (lots of rough lines and grooves) and most of the designs are not etched deep enough so they tend to make a big mess. Very frustrating. The designs are a good size, but it&#x27;s unfortunate that they don&#x27;t work as well as my Konad plates. In fact, I ended up completing my manicure with a Konad.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return it for a refund, but since I need to mail it back to China, I may as well keep it and never use it. Not worth the time or the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say that I would recommend or purchase more Cheeky plates. I really wanted to like the item, but I just didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Nice designs but I only gave 4 stars because some didn&#x27;t print too well. But all in all I like it.</li>
    <li> These worked good, still like my Konad plates better.  The plus is the area large stamping areas and work well on thumbs and toes.</li>
    <li> I love my cheeky plates and will not ever purchase plates elsewhere. Such a great variety for a great price. I have plates A C &amp; D and love them and would recommend them to people with small natural nails or false extensions!</li>
    <li> I ordered this a while back, and now that I have finally gotten a new nail stamper, I discovered that the plates are indeed, terrible. When I first got this, it was not working no matter what I did, so I thought that it was because of my cheap nail stamper. I decided to try out a better one, and discovered that the problem was the plates themselves.. They are not etched deep enough AT ALL. The designs are also completely different than what I ordered, and it scratches very easily. Don&#x27;t order this; get a real stamping plate that actually has deep enough designs. What a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> A great variety of designs which lets you be as creative as you want. Also, worth the price. I  recommend!</li>
    <li> The 2 different houndstooth patterns on the plate as pictured are not actually on the plate -- and the entire bottom row on mine looks to have been done off-kilter, the designs don&#x27;t look right at all.</li>
    <li> My gf bought them and said they&#x27;re decent.  I don&#x27;t know anything about nails.  I&#x27;m a bad bf I guess.</li>
    <li> This plate could be my go to nail plate.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with nail art stamping but soon found that the standard size Konad plates did not cover my nailbeds and made it very hard to stamp (especially as a beginner). The images on this Cheeky plate are much larger and the plates are much cheaper than Konad. They work fine for me and now even better since I got a XL Squishy Stamper. Just as most people I recommend a plastic scraper.</li>
