<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first starting using it on my nails post gel manicure. As much as I love the gel, it always ruin my nails. However, this Argan oil completely restored my nails! I then tried it on my hair. My hair is super fine and it tangles if you look at it. So after a day of curling and hair spray, the next day I had huge rats nest knots. I massaged this oil in there and it worked the knots out great. I will say it can be a little oily for my fine thin hair so make sure you stick to your ends. However, I am overall happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I use it every night, and helped me a lot in the appearance of my face, I have greatly diminished the lines of the face and neck</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil.  I use it nearly everyday on my hair, nails or skin. It works great as a moisturizer. It has made my nails long strong and healthy and it conditions my hair leaving it smooth, soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not tried Argan Oil it is one product you must try.  I recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> If you have never used Argan Oil, you are in for a treat! It&#x27;s so amazing, it&#x27;s hard to even begin to tell you what all it&#x27;s capable of doing for you. If you have dry skin like I do, it works wonders on the places that are hard to get soft like elbows, heels and hands.  Don&#x27;t worry about it clogging your pores, because it won&#x27;t. It has rich antioxidants for anti-aging. Diminishes wrinkles, lines around the eyes and mouth, bags under eyes. - Moisturizes face to re-balance skin for even texture. It can even help with healing blemishes and acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even use it on my hair because it&#x27;s great for frizzies or to give your hair that shiny and alive look. All you have to do is put some on your hands and then run them through your hair. I have done it with wet hair and dry hair and like it better when I do it after I blow it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That way I am taming the frizzies but also giving my hair that amazing shine! It also can be used on the scalp if you have dry, itching skin on your scalp. This Argan Oil is amazing on split ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, whether I leave my hair alone and let it dry wavy and curly, the Argan Oil gives it a nice shine. Then on the other side I have blowed my hair dry so it&#x27;s straight and even used a flat iron and then the Argan Oil and it still is shiny! It is amazing for your hair, I don&#x27;t know what else to tell you abut this exceedingly awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some other ways you can use this Argan Oil and if you would like to find out more about them, check out the Amazon page where it&#x27;s sold for more suggestions and other information. If you add only one product to your line of beauty ingredients, I think that Argan Oil would be a great bonus to your daily regime.</li>
    <li> I received one 2 fl. oz. bottle of Pure Argan Beauty Oil for a review!  I absolutely love that it’s organic!  So, many moisturizers on the market today are full of harmful chemicals, so it’s a real plus that this Beauty Oil is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my hair and it feels so soft, while giving my hair a beautiful shine.  It has helped give my skin a nice healthy smooth look, while giving it some good moisturizing.  This Argan Beauty Oil is awesome and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> A little goes a very long way. Very moisturizing. Have been using it mainly as scalp and hair treatment. I was using it as face moisturizer - but oil is a higher in oleic acid and not suitable for my sensitive acne prone skin. Nice quality oil over all. Would buy again to use for hair/scalp though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been loving using Argan oil for my face - I found that it reduces lines and also is good for chasing away blemishes and boils.  I like this product very much.  The dark bottle seems to protect the oil from the light and the label design is lovely.  The oil seems to be really good quality.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pure Argan Beauty in my hair after a shower for a couple weeks now, and it is amazing.  While my hair is still wet I apply about 8 drops to my long thick hair and then brush it through.  My hair is so silky when it dries and less frizzy.  Definitely a must have product and one of the best I have tried!</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil it made my hair shiny and really soft. I use this every time I wash my hair and love how I don&#x27;t have to use that much at all in fact very little.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have pretty normal skin with a slight oilyness in the T-zone. With this skin type there is a temptation to  use products that actually over-dry the skin. Argan has been a good way to balance that. I like to use Argan right before bed, especially on my face. I  wake up with my skin feeling refreshed and revived in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling too oily and my T-zone has been just fine while it has hydrated the dryer parts of my face! You only need a few drops so one bottle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am using in the hair and face, and is working</li>
    <li> smells and feels like genuine argan oil.</li>

    <li> Pure Argan Beauty is amazingly rich in in age-defying antioxidants and Vitamin E. It&#x27;s also high in essential fatty acids: Omega 6, 9, and Linoleic Acid. I love experimenting with beauty products. I decided to make some Exfoliating Lip Scrub with Pure Argan Beauty. Argan oil can be a great moisturizer for the lips. I used 1tbs of Fine Brown Sugar, 1/4 dropper full of Pure Argan Beauty, and approximately 5 drops of Vanilla Extract. I blended all ingredients together. I lightly massaged the scrub using a circular motion to my top and bottom lip. I let it set for about one minute then I carefully wiped it off with a damp cloth. The scrub took of the dead skin on my lips and left them feeling really soft. After wiping the scrub off my lips, I applied a small amount of argan oil to my lips to top it off. This can be used multiple times a day to create a glossy look and to improve your lips natural elasticity. My lips where left very hydrated and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Pure Argan Beauty for my hair every day. I like to put a few drops of the argan oil in my conditioner. I simply apply the drops to my conditioner, rub together in my hands to get the oil warm, and apply to my hair in the shower. I let it set for approximately 5 minutes and then rinse as normal. This leaves my hair soft and shiny throughout the day. To help with frizz, I will add a small drop to the ends of my dry hair while styling. Another great way I like to use this product for my cuticles. I massage a few drops of argan oil onto my cuticles to help moisturize my cuticles and encourage nail growth.&lt;br /&gt;These are just some of the ways I like to use Pure Argan Beauty. There are numerous great uses and something for everyone. This product can fulfill all your beauty needs naturally with no harmful chemicals. Pure Argan Beauty is full of wonderful skin enhancing agents that can make you look and feel beautiful. I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this argan oil for over a month. I think it works great! I use it on my face and hair. I bought it to use on my hair but read you can use it on face too, so I did. I actually like it better for my face than hair. It does a decent job on hair too I went sulfate free about a year ago &amp; only wash my hair 2 to 3 times a week. I was having to use products for frizz still because my hair is naturally wavy &amp; thick. Now I only use shampoo conditioner &amp; this argan oil. So it&#x27;s cut back on cost &amp; works great for frizzy hair. I def recommend to try this product. The best part is it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received a product sample to review in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so honored when a company asks me to review their products.  I received the Pure Argan Beauty Oil to try!  The bottle is a generous 2 oz bottle.  I use it for just about everything beauty.  I add a few drops in my shampoo bottle for extra moisture.  I also use as a leave in conditioner.  Argan Oil can be used on skin and nails as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Argan Oil on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  He has eczema, so this oil is gentle enough for him!</li>
    <li> I love it.  The bottle is a generous size for the price.  I use it on my hair and skin and mix it in with other oils for a hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love it. Both for my face and my hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!! this oil keep your skin n hair n soft.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair. I guess I had to keep buying the bottle and that&#x27;s why I rate it four its to priceyand its a little bottle.no thanks.</li>
    <li> It is a great product</li>
    <li> Excellent for the hair and scalp</li>
    <li> I use this one my hair every few weeks.  Coat my locks in it and leave it in for an hour or two.  my hair is soft, silky and shiny.  Definitely one of the better Argan Oil products out there!</li>
    <li> I have seen a change in my dry skin from adding the Argan Oil to my lotion and using it everyday. I&#x27;m sure my skin will thank me come winter time</li>
    <li> The oil is fine and does what it is supposed to do but it does not smell good. I will not purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> Loved this product!! It has worked miracles for my skin.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for very dry skin like me.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like it....it is non greasy .....I used this for my dry hair....I just started using this, so I don&#x27;t know if it will provide the softness that I am looking for....I bought this because of the great price, and that it is 100% pure Argan oil, I saw where another brand was selling for $80.00, which I think is ridiculous......especially if I can get the same ingredients and results for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Remarkable product; I use it on my skin and hair and can see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, I purchased this to use on my dry skin and hair.  It is fantastic.  My hair is so soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with the dropper bottle.  It allows you the ability to use just the right amount of oil.</li>
    <li> I originally was using the Josie Maran argan oil, but found the price to be steep for the amount of product you get. This works just as well, if not better, for a fraction of the price and for more product. The only difference is that this one has a mild smell I&#x27;m not crazy about, but it goes away after a few mins. My only problem is that the cap is weird; it&#x27;s warped or something so if I close it tightly, it is really hard to open. I just have to leave it a bit looser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this oil on top of my maracuja oil. I have dry skin with some oil in my t-zone and this stuff makes my skin so supple, smooth, and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It does have a strange odor, but I got used to it quickly. It feels wonderful on my skin and gives me a nice glow.</li>
