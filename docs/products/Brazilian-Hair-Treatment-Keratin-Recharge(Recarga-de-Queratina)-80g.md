<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not see any difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I watched a girl in YouTube using it, and at the end of the video she said that the split ends of her hair  were gone. She was right! I used this product and the split ends are gone, and I had a lot!    ... However... I decided to skip the recommendations of this girl in youTube (who said it was neccessary to remove the product with water after 15 minutes), and follow the instructions in the box (for dry hair do not remove the product) I should had listened to her... After blow-drying my hair I noticed that, despite it felt stronger and healthy, it looked greasy and far from clean. It took me one week to make it shine and look decent again. That same week I noticed that my hair was shinning more than ever!!    I think it is important to clarify that this product wont straight your hair. This is just for moisturising and extra shine.</li>
    <li> Even though I still have not used the product, my sister did use it and says it is excellent. Product was shipped very fast and it was very well packed with bouble plastic and envelopes with no possible breakage. Highly recomend.</li>
    <li> BRAZILIAN HAIR TREATMENT KERATIN RECHARGE IS VERY NECESSARY FOR  SPLIT ENDS AND DRY-DAMAGED HAIR. KERATIN IS THE NEW HOT ITEM ON THE MARKET FOR HAIR. ITS IN ALL THE GREAT TREATMENTS AND SHAMPOOS. THIS PRODUCT ACTUALLY DOES MEND SPLIT ENDS, AND LEAVES YOUR HAIR SILKY SOFT AND MANAGEABLE. THE PRICE IS VERY REASONABLE. ITS ONE OF THE BEST LEAVE-IN TREATMENTS YOU CAN GIVE YOUR HAIR.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I used it and so did my mother.  I was so happy with the results that I posted my review of it on my Facebook page and many of my girlfriends are buying it!! It is a great product and the price is also a wonderful thing.  The hair is silky and very manageable. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an intense treatment on dry and damaged hair.  The best part? you can do it yourself! Easy application and great price! :)</li>
    <li> I have a keratin treatment, but use a small amount of this product after I shower and I believe it has extended my results. My last treatment was in mid August and today is December 26th- my treatment is in the same condition!! I have natural red hair which is thick, mid back length and slightly wavy with a constant frizz- it took a solid 30 minutes to blow dry previously. Now I can go without blow drying with zero frizz and no wave- if I happen to use the dryer I can remove water from my hair in less than five minutes. The silky feeling of my hair has me touching it frequently.</li>
    <li> This product was very inexpensive, but pretty much did nothing for my hair.  On top of that, all of the words on the package were in Spanish, and no directions in English came with it.  I had to pull the product up online and translate it.  Don&#x27;t bother with this product unless you are in to wasting your money!</li>
    <li> Smells better, feels better; can be used on wet/dry hair.    Styles well and smooths down the frizzies.    Yes, I am going to be faithful to the recarga de queratina line if they keep up the good products!     Oh yeah and the amount you get for your money and the quality - I&#x27;d give it ten stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I got a Keratin treatment in May.  I only wash my hair about once a week, so it has not yet totally faded (yay!  Because it took 8 hours and hundreds of dollars!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, and my hair looked and felt phenomenal!!  I have very thick, coarse, curly (3b/3c), dry and porous hair... This softened it up significantly, but it didn&#x27;t make it greasy.  It also stayed moisturized the next day, and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a product that keeps my hair soft for 2 days.  I don&#x27;t want them to increase the price, but I would pay more than $4 or $5  for it.  I&#x27;m very picky about my hair, and this passed the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this is not getting 5 stars is because the packaging was BEAT UP when I got it... The box looked like it had lost a fight with a mailman on it&#x27;s way to my house, and I almost didn&#x27;t use it because of that.  Then I re-read the reviews and decided to use it anyways, and I&#x27;m glad I did!!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have lots of long springlets. In this cold dry weather I was having the worst trouble with brittle ends and weak strands. I&#x27;ve read about keratin treatments and did sone research on the binding protein but I don&#x27;t want straight hair so the brazilian blowout wasn&#x27;t for me. I did this at home, applying half of the tube to the bottom four inches of damp hair and put a shower cap on. Then I did some dishes, climbed in the shower and took my time shaving my legs with the shower cap still on, then rinsed gently with cool water to close the hair cuticle. My hair is soft, moisturized, strong and shiny :) and I still have my bouncy curls! I will definitely buy again and I recommend this for curly girls everywhere</li>
    <li> Great product... I&#x27;m a big fan of Queratina and this product works really great for my hair! Plus Thank you for the Brazilian chocolate and the candies, I haven&#x27;t had those in years! Muito Obrigada!</li>
    <li> I tried other productis, but I found Queratina and using it for my hair treatment is working well.  I&#x27;m very satisfied and recommended it.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I purchased it, based on the comments &amp; ratings.&lt;br /&gt;Now Im going to get Me more, for it makes my hair&lt;br /&gt;less frizzy &amp; shiny. Be it wavy or straightened out&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to apply to damp or dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever purchased for my hair it is better the CHI. I love it and now my hair is smoother</li>
    <li> I really do not know what type of Keratin this is, but it does not help with the hair at all I think is just a cream and not keratin charged as states</li>
    <li> I was excited and looking forward to the Queratina hair cream. I thought that because it is made in Brazil it would deliver similar results to the Brazilian Blowout treatment which I had done in the past and was 100% satisfied. I was expecting similar results with this cream but on a temporary basis meaning I was hoping the results would be the same but last only until my next wash. My expectations were too high therefore I&#x27;m not happy with the product. All expectations aside, here is my report:  My hair is a 3a 3b with some extremely dry sections (specifically at the crown of my head). I applied the cream and let my hair air dry. The hair felt soft but it was still frizzy and it looked greasy with out shine. The next day I made only the front of my hair wet and blow dried it, the cream seemed to have worked well because the hair dried faster than normal and it looked shinier and bouncier then if I had blow dried it without the cream. Then I used a flat iron on the dried section - and the cream worked perfectly - the hair looked very shiny, bouncy and in place. Then, in order to put the Queratina cream to the \\&quot;humidity\\&quot; test I locked myself in the bathroom with the shower turned on at the hottest setting. The room was foggy and wet, I stayed there for a good 2-3 minutes and when I came out my hair was frizz and out of control.  Bottom line - The Queratina cream works best with heat but it does not guard against humidity. I&#x27;d recommend it only if you live in a dry place. I usually like to leave my hair to air dry, and live in an area where there is always moisture in the air therefore it does not work for me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SOOO MUCH I JUST CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT. IT LEAVES MY HAIR SHINY NOT GREASY,I HAVE SHORT HAIR AND IS JUST AMAZING HOW IT LOOKS AFTER I USE THIS PRODUCT IM SERIOUS IS REALLY GOOD..I DONT HAVE SPLIT ENDS LIKE I HAD BEFORE USING RECARGA AND I DO IRON MY HAIR A LOT CAUSE IS SHORT BUT UFF IS FRIZZY WHEN IS HUMID OUT THERE... IN OTHER WORDS \\&quot;BUY IT\\&quot; YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED...</li>
    <li> This product works really great. I was reluctant if it was effective, but it gave me silky smooth hair instantly. I blow dried it with a roller brush in my hair, then flat ironed (with an added heat protection product of course). Just be sure to know that this is not a Brazilian Keratin Treatment (BKT), but a product used on hair that has undergone the BKT to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product for me after I commented on how silky and shiny her her looked. Needless to say I had the same results. I was pleasantly surprised that the product was affordable. It arrived very quickly after my purchase and my hair was looking great within days of finding out about this great product.</li>
    <li> I used this product in order to stop going to the hair salon to get the keratin treatment done professionally because it was too expensive and it contained formaldehyde. This product is inexpensive, has no formaldehyde and it left my curly hair beautiful, soft, luminous and manageable. I highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> I just finished using this product for the first time and I must say that I am not impressed at all.  I do not have a keratin treatment on my hair and that may be the problem.  I bought it because of the wonderful reviews but it sure did not work for me at all.  I followed the very scant directions: washed hair, dried it with a towel and applied it to all the hair (excluding the scalp) then proceeded to dry it followed by the flat iron.  Not only did it not leave the hair shiny and silky but it actually feels dry and rough to the touch.  I have been using the Moroccan Oil brand of Intensive Hydrating Mask and leaving it on for 30 to 60 minutes after I wash my hair (wrapped in a towel)and it really leaves my hair very soft, shiny and silky.  I just got back from Dallas and it kept my hair in great shape, without frizzies, for over 3 days!  I will go back to using that mask and stop trying to find \\&quot;cheaper, better\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m glad some of you had great results from this as at $4.95 it seemed to be a bargain.</li>
    <li> i wont buy it anymore cause idont feel ,it have done nothing on my hair for me it didnt do its work ,but i recomend for people who like try something diferent</li>
    <li> I never received this and the company did not work with me at all. Saying its must of been a delivery error with the mail and that they will investigate. Did not fix my problem did not give my money back also never mail me another one.  I order this on my birthday on june 6 2012 and they still haven&#x27;t done anything was so sad this was one of my gift that I never received.</li>
    <li> I baught this product after reading alot about it. I have been using it 3 times a week for 3 weeks now. There are 2 ways to use this product, i used it after shower on wet hair and leave it on. Havent noticed any difference in hair texture or anything. Plus it smells awful.</li>
    <li> This product is best used when used on dry hair. When I used it on wet hair I did not have the same result but, when I used it on dry hair, I was amazed on how it help smooth out my brittle ends and I have natural hair so I am loving this product. I am about to order 2 more tubes of this stuff! And the price is awesome!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about the Brazilian treatment. I wanted to try it out. so I went ahead purchased the Brazilian treatment. it really works for my hair. before my hair was frizzy dried from coloring burn from ironing. Now my hair is soft not dried burned or frizzy. I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Looking for instructions on how to use...will come back to rate once accomplished.  I purchased because it was a suggestion when purchasing another keratin product.</li>
    <li> Eh probado los productos como brazilian queratina tratamiento para 90 dias que es por supuesto mucho mas caro y los resultados no fueron nada satisfactorios cuando pobre este tratamiento quede simplemente encantada quiero aclararles que una vez que uno se lava el cabello no queda liso, por eso que este es un tratamiento lo que si les digo que entre mas los usen mas y mas liso va quedando ,regresa por completo la salud del cabello incluso hasta crece.Simplemente este producto es maravilloso eh probado tambien el otro que es el transparente pero mi opinion es que este es mucho mejor a pesar de que mucha gente opina que el otro es mejor, definitivamente este es una maravilla yo se los recomiendo, cabe anadir que es importante que sigan las instrucciones es decir lavar el cabello, estando humedo aplicar el producto secarlo y despues planchartelo a una temperatura de 450 F. es muy facil hacerlo y como un tip usa un peine y conforme vayas poniendo el producto en tu cabello pasale un peine de dientes juntos y ve quitando al mismo tiempo el excedente no esperes hasta el final porque el producto se seca y no logras quitarle nada y los resultados son totalmente diferentes (ojo lo hice de ambas formas)y por ultimo no lo aclares cuando te hayas puesto el producto no importa si lo tienes graso o no (el mio es graso)como digo los resultados son extraordinarios haciendolo de esta forma.&lt;br /&gt;Por ultimo si es necesario que compres la recarga de queratina para el mantenimiento que recomiendan si se necesita.</li>
    <li> The price is good and the product is ok and easy to use.  For what it is I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about three months and I like the results in my hair (fine, wavy, dry/frizzy). It is not a miracle cream, and it won&#x27;t make your hair straight just for using it, but my hair feels softer. If I blow dry and or use a flat iron, it straightens it without needing any other product  and it lasts for days.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I feel very good with my product, excellente quality, delevered on time, all was better than I have been spectating.</li>
    <li> Did like that much compared with other brands</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel and look so healthy! I love this product. I would purchase it over and over again</li>
    <li> Strengthens and refreshes your keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> .waist of money and time. Destroyed my hair.is dry and has no life after using this queratina.dont believe if you read on  reviews that this wont finish with your curly hair.OMG..what a regret!i hope i can get my real hair back..i used this 10days ago and i could not get my curls back.and this did not on my hair beside this...what a junk!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have bleached hair that is in very poor condition, this product saves my hair. I used Agi Max Brazilian treatment, it did nothing to help my hair. This product works better then suffering from the fumes and the time and money of Agi max Keratin treatment. Did I mention I had to translate Agi  Max directions and spent half a day on translation alone, since it does not come with English directions.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product at any price, and I have used many expensive products. Considering the price it&#x27;s an amazing product. Just make sure you use enough.</li>
    <li> You would thing that by being pure Keratin it could be a fantastic change in your hair. The truth is that any conditioner with Keratin works as good.</li>
    <li> It didnt really straighten my hair alot and it made my hair feel super damaged after applying it kinda like a rubber band.</li>
    <li> While I like the product, the idea of charging per item even when all the items are bundled together, makes it very expensive and uncompetitive. It is not a good one. I am considering buying other products to replace this one.</li>
    <li> its okay but its not a keratin treatment ! it leaves hair soft and shiny, good for the price !</li>
    <li> I used this product after I did the 30 day Liquid Keratin treatment and it added even more shine to my hair. I would definitely recommend using after/with the Liquid Keratin.</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable and it does the job!  It like a touch up to your Keratin process. Just worked.</li>
    <li> I have beached blonde &amp; permed hair, very damaged and purchased several keratin products to prevent cutting all my hair off, used this product 3 times and my hair appears to be in better shape than before, soft, silky and no tangling as before. I was plagued by bottom layer knots near my nape, combing them out created additional breakage. Highly recommended for a price you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an actual keratin treatment before, and was expecting some sort of up-keep product. It is not that. Other than it not being what I hoped it&#x27;s exactly what the stars say. It feels like just a conditioner and has almost the same effect as one. I&#x27;ve tried soaking my hair in it and washing it out, and just putting a little in and keeping it in. Soaking it had almost no effect, and while keeping it in does make my hair softer it doesn&#x27;t seem to be fixing any damage. The creme is very sticky and still feels a little sticky after drying in the hair but looks fine. It really just feels like a conditioner. If you&#x27;re looking for some sort of easy moisture add in, this would be good for you. But I would not consider this a treatment.</li>
    <li> my hair looks good after put the queratina</li>
    <li> My hair was in realllly bad shape, I had used on over the counter product to make blow drying straighter....lost a lot of hair. Anyway , went online to buy a variety of products to try. I did not like the feel of this product and my hair felt gummy. It could be due to my condition...but I fouled other products...Paul Mitchell awapuhi treatments much better.</li>
    <li> This product works great! My hair is a curly/wave fine texture. I&#x27;ve never had the BKT done on my hair before. This product left my hair silky smooth. I had my hair rolled in curlers then blow dried, it looked fantastic &amp; felt even better. I feel like it&#x27;s made my blowout last longer too.</li>
    <li> I love this combing cream. I usually have a lot of tangles and my curly hair  can be very hard to comb. This cream makes my hair easy to comb and it also  seems to give my hair added strength.</li>
    <li> i am a proud owner of bad perm on caucasian hair. in the last 2 months, in the attempts to undo the damage, i have tried it all - mixed chicks, henna, matrix, shea butter, palm oil- whatever it takes. results are... err... moderate to say it mildly.&lt;br /&gt;that is untill i tried the Queratina. i just ordered another pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all - warning - do avoid the scalp. this stuff stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not be affraid to put this on chemically treated / destroyed hair. this stuff coats the hair, makes it soft, glossy, manageable, bouncy, just really unbelievable. my hair looks and feels like it did during pregnancy and before all the stupid things i have done to my tresses...&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and great back up to a regular conditioner. We are constantly reminded we need to vary shampoo and conditioner. Leaves hair manageable and gives a natural sheen.</li>
    <li> We have to be clear here! This product works best with healthy hair or at least halfway descent! I&#x27;m a 4C natural (Nappy) and I co-wash, use only a dime size for each quadrant and blow dry! Then I flat-iron using a Ceramic flat-iron and it gave me life. Keeps my hair silky and bone straight for days! And as far as a flat-iron goes guys please purchase a descent one before saying your hair won&#x27;t straighten! You have to have the right tools!! 💋</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe that you will find a better product for non-chemical treated African American hair. I have not had a perm in years but after I wash my hair with this and blow dry (follow the instructions carefully) my hair is straight just like hot pressing.</li>
    <li> works like a very weak hair gel; does not work like the other keratin products -- hair does not look healthier or has any sheen</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change or did anything to my hair. I have light and my hair is normally dry. Using this product thought it will help to make it more smooth but it still the same.</li>
    <li> broke my hair off so bad.....:(</li>
    <li> I love this product work 100%, I,m Owner of Beauty Shop and my costumers love it!Specially when them going to Beach or the pool.</li>
    <li> People, this product is the cure for all those who have split ends or damaged hair (like me). I just can not believe it!!!All you have to do is wash your hair as usual and add the Queratin cream on to your hair only at the ends and do not rinse. ps. There are other ways to use it.Depends of your hair type. Let me say that if you already have split ends you must cut the damaged part. Get a hair cut every 8 weeks, just a little trim!.  Queratina will work to prevent getting damaged hair. But, you have to do your part too.(avoid hot tools and when washing your hair try to use cold water if possible.)  And do not brush it roughly.  I also take Biotin pills vitamins as a daily dietary  regimen...</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. I put some of the product in my hair when it was wet. I then blow dried it and flat ironed it and it still looked EXACTLY the same as it always does....dry and brittle. It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have gray hair which I color; in recent years my hair has become somewhat like straw, like most people my age (60). Ordinary hair conditioners soften it but then it is like soft straw--not really much of an improvement. I started using Queratina about 4 months ago. I found that it works best on my hair by putting it onto my hair after I shampoo and leaving it on (I use a circle about the size of a nickel; my hair is shoulder length; if I use too much it is sticky but a smallish amount leaves it in good condition); I don&#x27;t rinse it out. It made my hair much smoother and more shiny immediately, but what is best about this stuff is my hair has gotten much better with continued use over time. My hair is not like straw any more--it is smooth and manageable. Yay queratina! My hair is not straight and I don&#x27;t want it to be straight; what it has done is repaired my \\&quot;old\\&quot; hair and made it much better in appearance and feel. Now I&#x27;ve got my husband using it and he loves it too. It also has a light, pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I just got this and tried it.  It is not a hair conditioner, it is something you leave in.  It is a gel.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a few times now.  it leaves your hair silky, shiny and clean and  smooth and healthy looking.  A tiny bit goes a long way.  if I use too much, my hair feels somewhat lank and weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy/frizzy hair and this works well.  I put some in my hair when it is wet and my hair dries wavy, not frizzy.  I can follow up w/ an iron and my hair is sleek and smooth.  I have found that the no frizz effect lasts pretty well for days -- even survives rainy days pretty well.  I would rather use a product like this than subject my hair to chemical straightening / keratin blow outs.  Plus this is v. affordable and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like the metal tube it comes in.  it is hard to control how much product comes out.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer it if it came in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of Phytolisse which costs a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it doesnt have free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG don&#x27;t look at the ingredients ....Hyfrolized Keratin,Phenyl Trimeticone,hydroxyethycellulose,Propylparaben,Methylparaben, Methylchloroisithianozolinone, Methylsothiazolimone !!!!!!!!!!  YIKES !!!!</li>
    <li> Since before i used the keratin straightener I began using this product with my chemically relaxed hair and noticed immediately that my hair was softer, sleeker and the relaxer held on longer. Now that I&#x27;ve started using the keratin straightener, I&#x27;m seeing these benefits even more with hair being straight, sleek, super-soft and full and I find myself just touching my hair all the time to feel how great it feels.</li>
    <li> this product did not take long to come and looks the same as online. it worked but not as well as the other keratin product I had before this.</li>
    <li> makes my hair shine without looking oily. Very soft feeling. Helps with taming the frizz. I have kinky curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love it i Been using this product For long time and i love the way it works in my hair</li>
    <li> Try to use this queratina to improve my hair but didn&#x27;t work as advertise, there were no immediate results or long term, I use the whole queratina, but didn&#x27;t notice any changes on my hair.</li>
    <li> Definitely getting ready to buy this product again when I run out. I&#x27;ve had it for at least 4 months now. A little goes a long way. It won&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it oily. My hair is so much less frizzy now. It&#x27;s not straight, but I have noticed it helps with that good ol&#x27; North Carolina humidity. Great value, smells amazing, hair is so much shinier and manageable, and it comes with chocolate. Delicious brazilian chocolate!! CHOCOLAAAATE. For the price, you really have nothing to lose. You&#x27;d be losing money if you DIDN&#x27;T get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re curious about the title. I have drunkenly put it on my toothbrush many times thinking it was toothpaste. I mean come on, it looks like Colgate. Just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Took a chance on this. Unlike many other &amp;#34;tossed in the back of my supply&amp;#34; products, this one worked nicely as a leave-in. IDK if you could heat-set it in just like the keratin smoother I also use 4 times a year to control frizz because I cannot read Spanish. Perhaps someone can tell me what the box says as to application procedure &amp; I&#x27;ll LOVE it. But I like the stuff for further smoothing, yes. It&#x27;s rich but not heavy/not greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I could not find any Redken protein packets anywhere.  Anyway, I put in my hair and blowdried it.  then rinsed it out.  I thought I was going to have to cut all my hair off and this saved the day.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Happy about my purchase, item was just as described and after first use made my hair feel softer. My hair was considerably dry and had lots of split ends had a fresh cut appeal to it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am extremely please with the results😀. Finally something the really works</li>
    <li> cakificacion chose this on the grounds that the product is of excellent quality and is fully satisfied with it so would recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would make my hair nice and soft...and it totally delivered~!  I have very thin hair and most leave in conditioners are just too heavy for me.  I used only a small amount, and my hair feels so soft, looks so shiny...and SMELLS GREAT....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this and will definitely buy it again~!</li>
    <li> This does nothing really. I haven&#x27;t really applied it to all my hair so it is possible it does some smoothing.  I sometimes use it to keep frizz down on the crown of my head if its humid out and that works. For the price, I could not expect more really.</li>
    <li> I used it as intended and also used a tiny bit on dry hair just before ironing. works great to protect the hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it adds an extra boost of moister and shine to my hair.  I use it after cleansing my hair and combine it with an oil that I use prior to blow-drying and it works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair tamer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother and it really worked on her. It made her hair shiny and healthy. I liked how they sent us candy from Brazil as well. I really recomend this product.</li>
    <li> makes my hair feels so soft. not thick or weighed down. I love this!</li>
    <li> always the brazilian keratin is the best ever you can found its working very good my wife like it i will pay it again</li>
    <li> It certainly tames the hair but it looks greasy and flat afterwards, I won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok work good for my baby girl hair</li>
    <li> I did use a little on the splits after wash may hair and tower dry and no grease. just smooth and shine.</li>
    <li> This product does what it promises. My hair was really damaged because of bleaching and hair dyes, this product helped my hair to look less frizzy with 3 applications (Which is awesome since my hair WAS WAY BEYOND JUST DAMAGED)... The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because this product leaves residues all over my hands, even after I wash them. But they do go away after an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT: Even though the directions say you can blow dry your hair after applying it, if your hair really needs to be repaired, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I found this product working better for me if I just let it dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the packing was perfect. They sent a small size box filled with styrofoam peanuts and the product was placed right in the center wrapped in protective plastic. They also sent 2 samples of a brazilian candy, which I thought was awesome. I&#x27;m brazilian and it&#x27;s really hard to find that exact candy where I live here in the US, so it made me feel like home for a brief moment.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product, fast shippment and very good price. I really love it!! I put it on my wet hair and then blow and after use my straigtener ....it looks radiant and all people notice!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy coarse hair and have tried countless products on my hair and find this to be pretty good.  Good quantity, good price, very good value.  Would buy again.</li>
