    <li> I have been using this for a few years. I have several shades but this is my favorite. Besides using it on my face, I use it as an eye shadow and also dust a little on my sun damaged chest and arms. It actually helps a lot to camouflage the damage/ I always thought that a department store brand would work even better so I spent money trying them but I&#x27;m finding out I been wasting money. None of them are as good. These  are actually too expensive in the stores though and have trouble finding this shade so I always get them from Amazon or Ebay.</li>
    <li> I loveee this highlighter. It is a lot like like my expensive becca shimmering perfector highlighter in rose gold but this is a hint peachier.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a highlighter, it has a bit of shimmer in it but I really love the colours and our it looks on my skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am in l-o-v-e. When I saw the \\&quot;Sunkissed Glow\\&quot; shade, I had to buy it and try it out for myself. The colors are gorgeous and have such a pretty shimmer to them. I was surprised at how pigmented this product is. I have used Physician&#x27;s Formula products in the past and have always liked them. (Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price! If you buy the same product in the store it can be $11 or more!) I love that you can customize your look and do a lot of different things with this one product. Instead of having to carry around blush, highlighter, something to contour with, etc., you can save some room in your bag and just bring this one product! This is one of my new favorite products.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> The palette was much smaller than the one you buy in stores for the same price.. But I still love this product!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t apply smoothly at all. Disappointed though I only spent $1 on it. I remember Physician&#x27;s Formula being better. . .</li>
    <li> I love this product soo much, it&#x27;s amazing how you get that glowing face after applying, I used it until it&#x27;s finished now, ging to purchase again</li>
    <li> This is a very very woderful ítem</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I have used it as an all over color and also as eyeshadow.  I really like the dewy appearance it gives to my skin.</li>
    <li> This blush and highlighter works great on most days! I use the lighter colors to highlight my inner eyes and cheekbones, and the darker shades as blush and even eyeshadow on the go. The only watch out is that it has a slightly uneven application, so make sure to spread evenly with fingers for better application~</li>
    <li> it looks so pretty on my cheeks so glowy and shinny.. I also use a tiny brush to highlight the tip of my nose, under my eyebrows, &amp; it works beautifully. I use the dark tone for contouring and sometimes as eye shadow!</li>
    <li> I use this as a hoghlighter and I love it it looks great</li>
    <li> If you like looking your best while using natural products, this is the way to go. After researching and seeing all the toxins that were added to regular cosmetics, I had to make a change. I researched and found Physician&#x27;s formula products. They work great and I am sold!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I highly recommend it! Thank you for prompt delivery!</li>
