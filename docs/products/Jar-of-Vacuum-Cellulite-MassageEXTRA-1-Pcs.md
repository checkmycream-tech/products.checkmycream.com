### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome!!</li>
      <li>although it doesnt get rid of all the cellulite it GREATLY reduces it.</li>
      <li>And for that purpose I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>Good for self message.</li>
      <li>Good to start with, it&#x27;s convenient to travel with or use anytime.</li>
      <li>So I think it was nice from them.</li>
      <li>I purchased Bellabaci, but I likeed this one better than Bellabaci since this one was softer.</li>
      <li>Cheap, easy but time consuming.</li>
      <li>Its cheap</li>
      <li>I love it that I can do it my self, right at home.</li>
      <li>Good cups, smaller than I realized</li>
      <li>Look a little funny but feel great.</li>
      <li>i saw result on the first use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to massage your body in the shower or with oil, no strength required and you see the results in the first week, can notice legs buttocks getting less sore because is breaking down the cellulite.</li>
      <li>I do it mainly for circulation since I have hypothyroidism.</li>
      <li>High recommended.</li>
      <li>I ended up ordering a more professional kit that has much stronger suction,  this items become weak to me after a while.</li>

    <li> i saw result on the first use. although it doesnt get rid of all the cellulite it GREATLY reduces it. and the price! you cant beat that price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to maneuver around your body and can leave bruises..just go get synergy treatments! It&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
    <li> Look a little funny but feel great. I&#x27;m starting to really tell a difference on the back of my thighs.</li>
    <li> Good to start with, it&#x27;s convenient to travel with or use anytime. I ended up ordering a more professional kit that has much stronger suction,  this items become weak to me after a while.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work .it Hurts really bad and makes ur veins pop out. Not worth buying. I wish I could get my money back</li>
    <li> no. no instructions. I had no idea what do withit</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t use it like everyday to make a statement on the results. It is very small to actually do something. I use it to massage every time I find it, since I am not a very organized person.

    <li> I love it that I can do it my self, right at home. It is just what I wanted!!! Awesome!!</li>
    <li> This i8s a weird little tool.  I keep it in the shower and is one of several methods I use to control the cellulite.  Its cheap so why not give it a try.</li>
    <li> Good cups, smaller than I realized</li>
    <li> Softer Version is better than hard one. I purchased Bellabaci, but I likeed this one better than Bellabaci since this one was softer.</li>
    <li> It definitely helps eliminate cellulite. I&#x27;ve used everyday since I received it. 5 minutes on every spot. In some places it is gone in others (the worst areas) are slowly looking better. I do it mainly for circulation since I have hypothyroidism. And for that purpose I&#x27;m happy with it. Cheap, easy but time consuming.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to massage your body in the shower or with oil, no strength required and you see the results in the first week, can notice legs buttocks getting less sore because is breaking down the cellulite.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the product</li>
    <li> I bought it one month ago and it&#x27;s effect is out of my expetcation. High recommended.</li>
