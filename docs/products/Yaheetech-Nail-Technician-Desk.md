    <li> I had been eyeing this table for awhile. I&#x27;m a nail polish blogger and I needed a functional and convenient place to do my nails. The price was right, and free shipping! It arrived to me in 2 days, via UPS. I set up my table in the corner of our bedroom. My Ikea helmer storage cabinet fit perfectly beside it, the helmer is maybe half an inch shorter than the manicure table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this table is there was absolutely no assembly required. I only had to take it out of the box, the storage bag, remove the foam and bubble wrap, and set it up. The table itself is sturdier and more well made then I expected. It has wheels so you can move it around, and it easily folds up to store again if you need too. It also has a small plastic drawer underneath. The fit is super tight on the sliding drawer, so it won&#x27;t slide too far and fall out the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also a wrist cushion- for doing someone else&#x27;s nails, but I decided to put that in the corner of my table to keep things from falling down where the table curves against the corner of the wall in my bedroom. It&#x27;s kinda like an extra shelf that way I have some lotions and my ottlite on it. Extremely pleased with my purchase so far. :)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet...but I give it 3.5 stars</li>
    <li> Very solid construction.</li>
    <li> Love my table good size for home use, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Just as described a bit heavy to go mobile but it can if necessary</li>
    <li> love it. Very easy for a child to fold it and open it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 90-year-old mother instead of an under-chair or under-bed table.  This is wide enough to wheel over her recliner, cleans up easily, moves out of the way easily.  The drawer is useful for glasses, pens, drinking staws, etc.  We use it for meals, to play cards, do crossword puzzles.  Very pleased with this!</li>
    <li> for price you can not ask for more, good quality, bigger then expected even knowing dimensions.</li>
    <li> I really like this table.  So far I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but it&#x27;s perfect for me.  It&#x27;s sturdy, and exactly what I needed.  I love that it comes with a bag so I can easily take it with me.  It&#x27;s on the smaller side, so to save space on top of the table, I purchased a clip light and clip fan to go on the sides .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that the Styrofoam that was used for shipping is stuck to the side of the bag (pic attached).  I understand that it was shipped that way for protection.  I&#x27;m sure it will wash off with soap and water, and I&#x27;m still giving the product 5 stars because that was minor.</li>
    <li> LOVE that it&#x27;s already assembled! The bag is great!!!</li>
    <li> price is good, folds down</li>
    <li> Love this table!  Easy to transport!. Just as described. Big enough for home salon use.</li>
    <li> Good quality, sturdy.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  My daughter is so excited - this was her gift so she can continue doing what she loves, as she goes back to school for her second career... nice nice table!</li>
    <li> My sister loves it. Its easy to take anywhere and also fits anywhere.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome mobile manicure table with a travel bag.</li>
    <li> perfect size!!!! great for the price!</li>
    <li> Easier to use when I am not able to use my big station.</li>
