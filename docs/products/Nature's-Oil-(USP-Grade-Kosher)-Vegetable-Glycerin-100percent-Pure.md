    <li> Seriously this stuff tastes amazing! I bought for mixing my own vape liquid and the flavor, vapor production, and quality are all top notch. Mixes very well with LorAnn flavorings.</li>
    <li> Awesome e-juice base!</li>
    <li> Excellent price, excellent shipping cost for such a heavy liquid.</li>
    <li> Awesome... mixed it with raw shea butter and now my natural is vibrant... absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Everything was great except for a little chip on the bottle top.</li>
    <li> This product has the consistancy of honey: thick and sticky.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll ever use it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. Nice value.</li>
    <li> I use it for vapeing, it works perfectly but has no flavor. So basically a cheap alternative to juice for vapes.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and expected. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> High quality glycerine. Great for vaping!</li>
    <li> Product exactly like it is advertised, used for vaping (perfect)</li>
    <li> I use it to make toothpaste with baking soda and cocoanut oil. works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find the recipe here:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.truthandaction.org/make-homemade-toothpaste/</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it.</li>
    <li> I got it on time.  Was supposed to be secret ingredient to huge bubble formula.  Well, the formula didn&#x27;t work as expected.  But as the recipe goes, I cannot say it wasnt one of the other ingredients either or the recipe itself.  It arrived on time and was reasonably priced so it probably wasnt the oil.</li>
    <li> Great value &amp; Product for e-cig needs</li>
    <li> I use this vg to cut other e-liquids that I have so I can put the juice in my sub ohmed RDA builds to produce super cumulas clouds! 18mg of nic is to high for sub ohmed builds for me so I choose to knock down the nic works great for me and still have plenty of flavor!</li>
    <li> Loving it, great quality and work better than expected....</li>
    <li> Worked great for my projects</li>
    <li> Great product and was delivered before the delivery date!</li>
    <li> Using this in my natural recipe for homemade dish liquid</li>
    <li> WANTED THE BEST VG ON THE PLANET AND THATS JUST WHAT I GOT. I HAD LOOKED ON LINE FOR HOURS AND THEN I FOUND NATURE&#x27;S OIL VG. BINGO END OF LOOKING THIS WAS IT. GREAT PRICE FAST SHIPPING EVERYTHING YOU COULD NEED.</li>
    <li> Good quality product and package</li>
    <li> Great product at a more than bargain price.  Will definitely buy more when my supply runs low here in the near future.</li>
    <li> This can be used to make your own Ejuice.</li>
    <li> After having trouble finding Biotene dry mouth spray several times.  I did some research and found I could make working substitute with USP Glycern and distilled water, and alittle flavoring.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as pictured and described. I used it to make natural shsnoop and it worked well. This was my first time using vegetable glycoren but I did quite a lot of research and found this one and it seems to be a great product!</li>
    <li> perfect.Its clean I can vape this stuff all day.&#x27;Completely tasteless&#x27; is a good comment in this case.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, great price! Multiple uses. Arrived promptly ! Per ounce price is awesome! Great for making e-cig vaporizer smoke as well as many house hold uses.</li>
    <li> its alright don&#x27;t use it a lot</li>
    <li> fast shipping, product was just what i needed. fair price. i will buy again</li>
    <li> great item fast shipping</li>
    <li> Product is better than I expexcted</li>
    <li> It made irritation to my skin</li>
    <li> This is a good VG.  I don&#x27;t love the bottle - a little leaky even when you keep the red stopper in it under the pour spout.  It&#x27;s also hard to see how much you have left through the dark bottle.  I&#x27;m trying the Essential Depot product this time around.</li>
    <li> Bought this for DIY e-liquid production. It&#x27;s great quality VG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at some reviews, I noticed one giving bad marks for saying it was thick. Vegetable Glycerin is supposed to be thick and syrupy. Whatever pure VG they had gotten that wasn&#x27;t thick was not real or mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the one review push you away. Good quality VG and a nice price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vape on!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet Looks good, tastes good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s VG, not much else to say. Odorless, sweat and warm when tasted. Perfect for making or cutting ejuice</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 bottles and both came in with broken tops.  Luckily, the bottle has a rubber stopper so I don&#x27;t think I lost much of the product, however, I had to put the oil in a different container so I could seal and pour properly.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair with more focus on my ends as a sealer when twisting my hair and I noticed the style lasted longer and maintained a nice healthy look. I reapplied to my ends about every two days. When I removed the twists, I noticed that my hair was much softer and easier to comb out with no breakage. I&#x27;m going to always keep a bottle. Great product!</li>
    <li> I initially got this glycerin to aid in scar removal and its done a wonderful job, i have so much left over that I&#x27;m exploring other uses. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I will be reordering again. This is excellent on my dry hair and skin. It can also be mixed with your favorite shampoo for extra moisture. It&#x27;s a little sticky at first but in a few minutes it evaporates into the skin an hair with no greasy or sticky feeling. Hair and skin left soft to touch.</li>
    <li> Not great for vaping has a terrible taste, I dont know how it functions for other purposes, which is why I gave two stars. I thought it was my flavorings but after process of elimination, I found out it was this, for instance, I bought the VG from Vitamin Shoppee, and there is no weird taste, I would recommend Vitamin Shoppe&#x27;s VG, not sure the brand but it is in a clear bottle with white label, I think the logo is purple.</li>
    <li> Used to make e liquid works great</li>
    <li> I use this in my personal body lotion.  I really like it and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great supplement for clouds chading I use it when I&#x27;m practicing out harty making huge clouds.</li>
