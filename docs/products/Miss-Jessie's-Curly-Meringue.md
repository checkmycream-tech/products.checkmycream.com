### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>for moisturizing, these products are one of the best, but the price just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>By the way, Amazon has about the best price for this product.  </li>
      <li>The best product from this line that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
      <li>Best curl-defining, frizz-reducing product I have used.</li>
      <li>thgis is definitely an awesome deal.</li>
      <li>This product is awesome.  </li>

      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>Issue number two, the smell, not so great.  </li>
      <li>This product works great.  </li>
      <li>so as for moisturizers this is great but for me to expect it to do anything like give me curls or definition, it doesn&#x27;t do that unless i do braid outs or twists outs</li>
      <li>The product itself is good.</li>
      <li>And it smells so good.</li>
      <li>For those looking for a good alternative to Kinky Curly, go with As I Am from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply or Darcy&#x27;s Botanicals.  </li>
      <li>it makes my twistouts look amazing.</li>
      <li>and i don&#x27;t have that kind of time.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, curly and smelling great!  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite curl creme.</li>
      <li>Im latinamerican, my hair has more of a wavy curl</li>
      <li>I have been through numerous products trying to find the product that&#x27;s best for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this.  </li>
      <li>Love miss Jessie&#x27;s products</li>
      <li>Love this stuff..</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you follow the steps for the style on the website or directions on the product.</li>
      <li>I have 3c, 4a corkscrew curls that are pretty well defined with a good leave in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>smells good, light wheight, It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>I use this product after I wash my hair with Wen and together these products keep my natural hair in great condition.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice at first</li>
      <li>I found you through your free sample..</li>
      <li>It is a great value when you consider the price of many of the other curly hair products.  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly which turns into naturally frizzy and this is the first thing I have tried in 20 years that makes my hair awesome!</li>
      <li>I get lots of compliments on my hair and have a people following me around trying to figure out what I&#x27;m wearing that smells so good.</li>
      <li>I have short curly hair and it keeps the curls in place and looking good all day.</li>
      <li>this is my absolute favorite styling product.</li>
      <li>Both are less expensive, work excellent and have great moisture!</li>
      <li>i did like the quick curls and the curly pudding.</li>
      <li>The first curl cream to work!</li>
      <li>The cost is high, higher than justified, so that was issue number one.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many hair curling products and I always come back to this one.</li>
      <li>(*_*)</li>
      <li>Leaves hair smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for a year straight and didn&#x27;t have any of these issues.  </li>
      <li>If you have curly hair, you know it can be a process to get ready in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I also have to agree that the smell really gets on my nerves.  </li>
      <li>but then gets really stinky.  </li>
      <li>Priced too high.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m glad i bought the sample pack because i got to try a little of everything.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and I am able to just wet my hair on the second day to sort of &amp;#34;restart&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I could spend less...but would pay more in the long run by trying different products to get the results I want.</li>
      <li>besides, i can&#x27;t really see myself paying that much money for these products and the price is a big deterrent for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe how much I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I tried a free sample of Curly Meringue and Curly Buttercreme, I didn&#x27;t care for the CB, too heavy.</li>
      <li>The product is a silky creme that blends with your hair texture and makes it feel soft and enhance the curl in your natural hair.</li>
      <li>I will keep using this product while growing my natural curls to style my hair curly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like my hair to smell of pineapple but the fruity fragrance dissipates quickly, leaving my hair soft and shinny.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my short natural hair curly for days without excessive use of the product.</li>
      <li>I tried it drying my hair with a diffuser (following the instructions) then drying it naturally</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking about ordering directly from the manufacturer again one last time just to see if its any difference.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m thinking about ordering directly from the manufacturer again one last time just to see if its any difference.  </li>
<li> at the time i was in the beginning of going natural and got hooked on a bunch of you tube videos and thought this would work for me as well as it did for some of the other women who used it.</li>
<li> It used to give me the hold I was looking for in regards to my fine 3c hair, but now it just made my hair a hard tangled mess.  </li>
<li> Your hair will be soft and then use a little bit of the product such as Meringueonly use MJ products and I am 3 C/4a type  or pudding.</li>
<li> However, I spread it out through my hands, run my fingers/hands through my hair and then dry with a diffuser.</li>
<li> I bought the product based on the reviews and mainly because it was supposed to leave my curls with a natural look unfortunately, this product was not what I expected.</li>
<li> Issue number three, left my hair feeling dry and a little crunchy, even after putting some leave over the next few days to try and soften up the crunch and rehydrate my hair.  </li>
<li> I tried Miss Jessie products too a few years back and was not impressed but came back to them when I tried the Multicural Curls which I like and later tried the jelly soft curls for no residue.</li>
<li> so for now, i&#x27;m still using the sample products, only to finish and feel like i didn&#x27;t waste my money.  </li>
<li> Did what I needed and expected.</li>
<li> but when I open the container looked like some had dried out.</li>
<li> I only use it after shampoo and conditioning and afterwards I use plain coconut oil in my hair.</li>
<li> I use sparingly but a little does go a long way.</li>
<li> If you have other options I suggest you to try any other product before buying this.</li>
<li> I would and have recommended this product to other friends with curly hair.  </li>
<li> After listening to all the hype I decided to break down and give it a try.  </li>
<li> and I was concerned that it would weigh my hair down.  </li>
<li> and you get BOGO or BOGO HALF.</li>
<li> It smells a little like candy but isn&#x27;t so strong as to be annoying.  </li>
<li> Is a waste of your money.</li>
<li> I have to say the curly meringue and the curl pudding have been officially placed on my waste of money list.  </li>
<li> It seemed like a very heavy cream</li>
<li> Not a good value</li>
<li> I havve very thick hair</li>
<li> Overall, it is too expensive for any bad batches to be floating around.  </li>
<li> The key to perfection with Miss Jessie&#x27;s products is that you have to use the baby butter cream as a base.</li>
<li> I received the package with the seal being broken.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if Miss Jessie&#x27;s changed the formula for this or if I just got a bad batch....  </li>
<li> unfortunately after buying it i then decided to cut my hair off.</li>
<li> I am not impressed with this product.  </li>
<li> To start is very expensive, I don&#x27;t like the smell of it and leaves my hair with frizz, as if I didn&#x27;t applied anything.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product.  It does everything it promises.  It gave a lot of texture and curl to the hair, even my chemically relaxed hair was curly.  I will keep using this product while growing my natural curls to style my hair curly.  I recommend this product to anyone trying to get waves or curls, because it works.  I am so glad I found this.  (*_*)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite curl creme. And it smells so good.</li>
    <li> I received the package with the seal being broken. The product itself is good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like my hair to smell of pineapple but the fruity fragrance dissipates quickly, leaving my hair soft and shinny.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my short natural hair curly for days without excessive use of the product.</li>
    <li> Love miss Jessie&#x27;s products</li>
    <li> Ive been in tradition for 8 months and read about Miss Jessie&#x27;s products a decided to try it.  The product is a silky creme that blends with your hair texture and makes it feel soft and enhance the curl in your natural hair. I so recommend Miss Jessie&#x27;s products if you want to style and manage your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product but when I open the container looked like some had dried out. It was sealed by the way.</li>
    <li> Did what I needed and expected.</li>
    <li> i bought the samples size bag that contained all of their products. at the time i was in the beginning of going natural and got hooked on a bunch of you tube videos and thought this would work for me as well as it did for some of the other women who used it. not quite so.  i&#x27;m glad i bought the sample pack because i got to try a little of everything. i did like the quick curls and the curly pudding. but after that, everything else seem to be overpriced moisturizers for my hair. it&#x27;s not the products fault or miss jessie&#x27;s, i&#x27;m still learning my hair and what it can and won&#x27;t do. so as for moisturizers this is great but for me to expect it to do anything like give me curls or definition, it doesn&#x27;t do that unless i do braid outs or twists outs and i don&#x27;t have that kind of time. besides, i can&#x27;t really see myself paying that much money for these products and the price is a big deterrent for me. so for now, i&#x27;m still using the sample products, only to finish and feel like i didn&#x27;t waste my money.  for moisturizing, these products are one of the best, but the price just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>

    <li> this is my absolute favorite styling product. it makes my twistouts look amazing. I use sparingly but a little does go a long way. thgis is definitely an awesome deal.</li>
    <li> Im latinamerican, my hair has more of a wavy curl but this product beats the frizziness and helps define the curls.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I have been through numerous products trying to find the product that&#x27;s best for my hair.  This has been the only one I&#x27;ve found that defines the curl as well as holds the moisture.  If you are considering this product stop considering and purchase it, you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
    <li> I havve very thick hair and this gives me the perfect hold</li>
    <li> The first curl cream to work! My hair is naturally curly which turns into naturally frizzy and this is the first thing I have tried in 20 years that makes my hair awesome! Thank Miss Jessie! PS I found you through your free sample..</li>
    <li> Love this stuff..unfortunately after buying it i then decided to cut my hair off. lol but i&#x27;ll still use it on my low cut.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have short curly hair and it keeps the curls in place and looking good all day. I have tried many hair curling products and I always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> smells good, light wheight, It&#x27;s worth the price. I wouldn&#x27;t put anything else in my hair. even when my hair is blowed out, it&#x27;s manageble</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive!&lt;br /&gt;But it works. I think it all depends on your hair type, what will work for you and what won&#x27;t. I tried a free sample of Curly Meringue and Curly Buttercreme, I didn&#x27;t care for the CB, too heavy. But the Curly Meringue moisturized my hair well. I only use it after shampoo and conditioning and afterwards I use plain coconut oil in my hair. I could spend less...but would pay more in the long run by trying different products to get the results I want. I only have to shampoo every two weeks with these products. I also use Rapid Recovery for a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I like it!</li>
    <li> After listening to all the hype I decided to break down and give it a try.  I have 3c, 4a corkscrew curls that are pretty well defined with a good leave in conditioner.  I have to say the curly meringue and the curl pudding have been officially placed on my waste of money list.  The cost is high, higher than justified, so that was issue number one.  Issue number two, the smell, not so great.  Issue number three, left my hair feeling dry and a little crunchy, even after putting some leave over the next few days to try and soften up the crunch and rehydrate my hair.  In the end, I was grateful I bought the stuff at Target because I returned it to the store with my receipt and got my reliable Kinky Curly leave in and curl pudding instead.  For those looking for a good alternative to Kinky Curly, go with As I Am from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply or Darcy&#x27;s Botanicals.  Both are less expensive, work excellent and have great moisture!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe how much I love this stuff.  It leaves my hair soft, curly and smelling great!  I get lots of compliments on my hair and have a people following me around trying to figure out what I&#x27;m wearing that smells so good. I use this product after I wash my hair with Wen and together these products keep my natural hair in great condition.  By the way, Amazon has about the best price for this product.  The only time you can get it cheaper is during Miss Jessie&#x27;s BOGO sale just before Christmas.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, you know it can be a process to get ready in the morning.  This stuff is great.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and I am able to just wet my hair on the second day to sort of &amp;#34;restart&amp;#34; the style.  The smell is another plus.  It smells a little like candy but isn&#x27;t so strong as to be annoying.  I would and have recommended this product to other friends with curly hair.  It is a great value when you consider the price of many of the other curly hair products.  Give it a try and I don&#x27;t think you will regret it.</li>
    <li> I tried Miss Jessie products too a few years back and was not impressed but came back to them when I tried the Multicural Curls which I like and later tried the jelly soft curls for no residue. The key to perfection with Miss Jessie&#x27;s products is that you have to use the baby butter cream as a base. Your hair will be soft and then use a little bit of the product such as Meringueonly use MJ products and I am 3 C/4a type  or pudding. Make sure that you follow the steps for the style on the website or directions on the product. The only products I have in addition is As I  Am Coconut Cowash,  Organic coconut oil, and Alikay 17 essential growth oil.  My leave in is MJ leave in Condish. My DC is alternating MJ Sweetback DC and Rapid Recovery Treatment. I would not use anything else for this.  And all time staple is MJ BABY BUTTERCREAM.  Also if you watch the MJ FB page it tells you when there is a sale and you get BOGO or BOGO HALF.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product, LOVE IT!</li>
