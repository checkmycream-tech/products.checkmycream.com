      <li>Love other products by them, this however almost leaves a shine to my skin.  </li>
      <li>Will most other lotions</li>

      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>But this one is way too oily, even when I live in the desert.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>wish I had used it when I was young.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a face moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to break out</li>
      <li>We looked high and low for it in town, but did not find it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these Elta skin care products !!! Learned about them from my dermatologist and am very happy to see them here on Amazon~</li>
    <li> Really impressed with all of EltaMD products and the lotion is no different. Feels great on the skin and lasts all day. Very moisturizing, great for dry to normal skin. Non-greasy. One of the best all over body lotions I have used and very affordable. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m coming back to buy 2 more bottles. i initially purchesed this item because my sons dr recommended it. It works wonders as he has suffered severe eczema since he was a baby. My husband got a hold of it, and now he wants a bottle for himself. My sons dr said the reason it works so well is because of the parafin wax that is in it, it helps trap the moisture and keep it in your skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is perfect!  Light and non-greasy for use anywhere on your body.  I have used it on my face and it actually works better than my expensive moisturizer.  It also does not have a heavy scent so you can still wear perfume without competing with another scent.  My dermatologist recommends the entire Elta MD line and I did not know this beforehand.  The daily sunscreen is also terrific.</li>
    <li> My children have very dry skin combined with eczema. My doctor recommended this lotion for them &amp; it is wonderful! I also had a great experience with the seller Top Ten. They were quick to correct a mistake that occurred &amp; I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> I am reveiwing EltaMD Lotion. It&#x27;s a good product. I am personally prone to breakouts, but I use this lotion on my face without any problems. A little goes a long way too. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a quality lotion. I like to use it on my face just when I get out of the shower. It preps my skin for my day or night cream. I also like it because it is unscented and was recommended by a professional who has given me facial treatments.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer, hands down. I suffer from dry skin and rosacea and this is the only moisturizer that gets rid of the dryness and does not cause any kind of irritation. My dermatologist recommended EltaMD to me and I can&#x27;t thank her enough.</li>
    <li> I ordered it on line one morning&lt;br /&gt;Less than 48 hrs I received the package&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it it felt light not greasy&lt;br /&gt;Or heavy</li>
    <li> One of the really good things I do for my skin to clean it throughly.  It is good on older skin.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had used it when I was young.  I have tried many skin cleansers and this by far beats&lt;br /&gt;the whole bunch of skin cleanser industry products.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this after using their hand and nail lotion, which I love! This not so much. It leaves me feeling greasy and doesn&#x27;t really absorb like the hand lotion. I sure would not recommend.</li>
    <li> gave me the moisture I needed for my face and hands. didn&#x27;t feel greasy. would buy again.</li>
    <li> This brand was recommended by my dermatologist.  Most of the skin conditions in my area are caused from very dry skin.  I love all of the Elta products that I have used and they seem to hold the normal moisture in so that is a great plus for me</li>
    <li> Great lotion, keeps you moisturized all day + rid my skin of all rashes that I had from previous products. Gives skin a sheen that is so pretty in summer!</li>
    <li> Recommended by physician for my elderly father to use under his compression hose. Has poor circulation and important to keep skin healthy. It&#x27;s done a remarkable job. No ulcerations</li>
    <li> I am pleased will other MD Elta products to care for my aging, dry, sensative pale skin. This product did not dissappoint, although it is a little thicker than the lotions I usually use. So far So good. still in the testing stage</li>
    <li> I was using the SPF46 day cream and love how it feel.  But this one is way too oily, even when I live in the desert.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it as body/hand lotion, but not on my face.</li>
    <li> This reasonably priced lotion has no scent, has a velvetly feel, goes on smoothly, works great on face and body, keeps skin hydrated, and, best of all.... does not leave a sticky residue on your hands.  Will most other lotions, I feel that I need to wash, or at least rinse, my hands after application.  (Review sumitted by Kelly, Chris&#x27; wife.)</li>
    <li> Love other products by them, this however almost leaves a shine to my skin.  I love Elta MD because it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all and has NO fragrance.  Big plusses, use their sunscreen religiously.  This however, I use, but it really does leave an almost dewy shine on my skin, as if it isn&#x27;t soaked in all the way.  It&#x27;s good, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My husbands dermotologist recommended this lotion and it is the best out there.  My husband has tried everything for his psoriasis and this beats them all.  I like it as a night time face cream.</li>
    <li> Elta MD Lotion is easily absorbed and makes my dry skin feel great. I use it twice a day.  Even here in Houston&#x27;s humid climate, the lotion does not make my skin feel sticky like all the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  In fact, before I started using it, I hardly ever finished using a bottle of lotion.  Now I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle of Elta MD.</li>
    <li> The only problem I had was with the top. I locked it down so that I could travel and I could not get the pump to work again.</li>
    <li> Has no smell, you can use all over including face and it really hydrates skin. EltaMD products never disappoint me.</li>
    <li> Oh, gosh, I just got this and used it. It is wonderful. It feels so good and is not greasy. This product was recommended to me by the PA at the Wound Clinic. We looked high and low for it in town, but did not find it. Thank you for offering it on Amazon. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> This works well as a moisturizer, and it has a nice satin feel to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it mostly because it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. I find that many body lotions, even though I don&#x27;t use them directly on my face, cause me to break out. (If I touch my face with lotioned hands, I experience breakouts.) This lotion does not do this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love EltaMD products and find them to be so sensitive, yet effective on the skin.</li>
    <li> was expired by several years</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry hands in the winter because it isn&#x27;t greasy. It is a nice feel, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as something like aquaphor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a face moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to break out and finally I found it.  It&#x27;s actually called a lotion on the bottle and that may scare some into not putting it on their face but trust me it works great on your face too.</li>
