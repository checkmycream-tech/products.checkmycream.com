<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love it! Curls fast and the body/curl lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Fun color too!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair takes no less than 1.5 hours to curl with regular metal curling iron.  With the titanium curling iron, it now only takes 20 minutes to curl her hair.  We love the fact that the price was so affordable and reasonable.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and leaves curls soft and shiny. I like how smoothly it passes over the hair, but I really bought it for the cute color. Handle is also small enough so you can grip and manoeuvre the iron easier. Unlike some more expensive brands, the controls on this are not on the handle (thank heavens) and they never get in the way. I have conair irons, and prefer this definately.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this iron. It heats up fast, the cord does not tangle, it is a good length and it turns like butter in your hand. No complaints here! VERY happy with my iron.    Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have always used hot tools for my hair.  The price thru amazon was terrific.  Thanks for the bargain and quality.</li>
    <li> Hot tool curling irons are the best with Amazon you get a great price as well.</li>
    <li> Hot Tools, to me, is the best curling iron of them all. I have them in 3/4&amp;#34;, 1&amp;#34; and 1&amp; 1/2&amp;#34;. They last a long time and are readily available on Amazon and Sally&#x27;s. It gets and stays &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; right away. It also does not break my hair like other curlinh irns have done in the past.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this curling iron for me.  The 1 star review is because HOUSEWARES did a bait a switch on the shipping.  The shipping was included at the time of order and paid in full.  HOUSEWARES shipped it USPS and it arrived with an additional $4.00 COD.  When contacted, they never responded.   I highly recommend that you order this sold directly by Amazon instead.  Amazon&#x27;s customer service is wonderful.    For the product itself, I would give it 3 stars.  The good - it has a very long cord that does not twist on itself.  There is a swivel end that rotates the cord as you turn it.  I love the color.  The temp setting is a dial so that you can set it to the temp that you need.  It comes with extra springs so that when one breaks you already have the replacement.  That is wonderful.  The bad - it does not have an auto shut off.  It feels a little &#x27;light&#x27;.       Overall, this is a good curling iron.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is perfect for hair that is hard to curl. If gets nice and hot without burning your hair. It was priced right and worked better than much more expensive irons I&#x27;ve had. Love the pink color and how it cut my curling time in half. The barrel is really smooth and your hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it or get tangled around it. Really nice addition to my hair styling tools.</li>
    <li> I got it for my mother as a gift, she had the Hot Tools Gold one for years and loved it.  I actually think she likes this one even better.  It had all the features that I had seen at my salon. And I did research this item before making the purchase, and it has easily lived up to the postive reviews.  Even though I don&#x27;t use this type of thing I would recomend it on her behalf.</li>
    <li> It heats up so fast, and is exactly like my old one that broke! I love it--plus it&#x27;s pink! (:</li>
    <li> Works great and looks nice too.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom to replace one she&#x27;s had for years. I picked this one because it is the same as the one she had that&#x27;s broken...and because this one is PINK. My mom LOVED IT.  Don&#x27;t ask me technical questions, I don&#x27;t use a curling iron so I don&#x27;t know. I just know Mom is well satisfied and the last one lasted forever. This company is good. I recommend this curling iron.</li>
    <li> Cute curling iron, but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to press and curl African American hair.  Stick to the gold curling irons.</li>
    <li> The only problem is I thought it was bigger seems like they sent tiny size curl so not happy about that ....</li>
    <li> I retrieved this item and it was not pink like the picture said, and also it was broken, the spring of the curling iron wasn&#x27;t working properly. This item actually appears to be used. I am very confused. Poor customer service.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, the cord swivels so there is no untangling the cord.&lt;br /&gt;It heats quickly and curls very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would like it better if it had an automatic shut-off (in case I forgot)</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned! On my 2nd. I have very curly hair and it works great to soften the curl</li>
    <li> I have a couple other sizes of this particular curling iron. I am very satisfied.  It heats fast and works well.  I used to by the soft handled ones bit the handles break down and get gooey and sticky and I would throw them away.  These handles are plastic and I am well pleased.</li>
