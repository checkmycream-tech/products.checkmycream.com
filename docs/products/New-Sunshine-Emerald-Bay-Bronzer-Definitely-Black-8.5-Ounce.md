    <li> Compared to similar lotions containing DHA that I have purchased in salons at hugely inflated prices, this lotion is by far, the best.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for tanning and for an everyday lotion to give me an extra touch more color with no staining. Love it!</li>
    <li> If you want a lotion that is inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t leave streak marks, hydrates your skin, and makes you glow minuets after tanning then THIS IS THE LOTION TO BUY!! I work at a tanning salon and this is by far the best tanning lotion! Is super inexpensive and compared to the high marked price tanning lotions is works just as well as those of not better. It&#x27;s a bronzer that hydrates your skin so your skin is moisturized. LOVE this product and won&#x27;t ever change lotion.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this lotion! I have only been tanning the last couple weeks in preparation for vacation and I am super dark already! The lotion has a very mild tropical scent that doesn&#x27;t have that gross after tan smell, it goes on super smooth, no streaking from the bronzers and the price is perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great! Tried the definitely dark before and that worked pretty well, but this is better! I recommend 100% !</li>
    <li> Finally an indoor tanning lotion that smells like tanning lotion is supposed to!  A nice light tropical pina colada like scent.  No horrible after tan odor either.  I was a little hesitant at first because it is very dark coming out of the bottle, (like chocolate pudding) but it smoothed out when on the skin, and soaks in fast.  By the end of my tanning session it is completely dry.  I&#x27;ve never had it stain clothes afterward.  Really boosted my color to!</li>
    <li> Works well in tanning bed.  Smells nice and moisturizes my skin leaving it soft and healthy looking.  Good price for a lotion of such good quality.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but it didnt get me as dark as I was hoping it would. A friend of mine uses it and she&#x27;s really dark and I was hoping it would do the same for me.</li>
    <li> Love It Leaves My Skin Perfect Great Smell Not Sticky Leaves Amazing Color And Best Price I Found So Far &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> This is a great product however I receiver a bottle that expired 1 year ago. Rather pay a little more for something that isn&#x27;t expired. It should be stated that you are purchasing expired product.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this, and will never by lotion from the tanner again.  It got her tanner than any other lotion, even in the lowest beds.  Especially for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a great bronzing lotion either for daily use or to use in the sun or tanning bed.  I love the scent (coconut) and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Just got this yesterday, it smells wonderful, light coconutty-ish scent. Creamy texture and a little goes a long way. The bronzer did not leave me with orange hands like some bronzers,  it has just enough color to make me glow. No bad OTO. This may be my &#x27;just right&#x27; Goldie Locks Lotion :) can&#x27;t wait to try their other lotions!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it contains DHA which helps you obtain a tan faster !</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! I was a little skeptical about buying something I couldn&#x27;t smell or try before I bought it but I love it. It works very well to give you a great tan and also a hint of bronzing color! And it smells amazing</li>
    <li> Smells Great, goes on smooth, not oily.  Exactly what I was looking for in a tanning product. I am happy</li>
    <li> Turns clothes colors.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is the best I&#x27;ve used in a while. Im a tanning addict. I bought this at my local tanning salon. There&#x27;s no need to go into a higher level tanning bed! I use this in a level 1 tanning bed. I go tanning 3-4 times a week. It doesn&#x27;t streak. Doesn&#x27;t make you orange. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands orange. It smells like sugary chocolate smell. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve gotten so dark! It also leaves your skin feeling really smooth. I love it! People in my high school ask me if I&#x27;ve gone on vacation! It gives you a deep brown color.! The first 2 days after using it I noticed how dark i was. Im at a golden glow.! Definally buy it! And will buy this for now on!&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this lotion is that it leaves you smelling kinda burnt. But it doesnt leave you burnt. !</li>
