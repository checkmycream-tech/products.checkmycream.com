      <li>Since I am sensitive to most scented products and can&#x27;t use them, this lets me have scented products I love!</li>
      <li>but I just wish it had a refill bottle available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past and it&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
      <li>This product was originally designed for people with Colostomies/Ileostomies.</li>
      <li>,THAT RIGHT OFF MY KITCHEN!</li>
      <li>It is also extremely effective with frequent gas also from people who have undergone bariatric surgery or who have intestinal problems as well.</li>
      <li>Eliminates orders quickly.  </li>
      <li>I add essential oils to this spray and love it!</li>
      <li>sure it is fine for spraying larger areas</li>
      <li>think i&#x27;m going to go back to the Medi-Aire, which works AMAZINGLY well...</li>
      <li>Product delivered exactly as described and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit it&#x27;s main purpose at all.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The product works ok for a short period of time but after about 15 minutes I can smell the litter box again.</li>
      <li>A friend told me that we could get this item on line as we hadn&#x27;t been able to find it locally.  </li>
      <li>Love the travel size for the long airplane flights.</li>
      <li>The spray is much less effective than the drops.</li>
      <li>I have Chrones and I have gotten very embarrassed in certain situations.</li>
      <li>This product works very well compared to others that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>It destroys odors with only 1-2 light sprays and leaves no masking perfume.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s odorless, but i really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working.  </li>
      <li>Really works learned about it at the hospital.</li>
      <li>It really does what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t eliminate odors very well.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a bathroom spray that works, this is the REALLY odor elimiator.</li>
      <li>main use is to deodorize his urine bag for his catheter and the drops</li>
      <li>It is not helpful to have odors drifting about when people are awakening from anesthesia at high risk for nausea.</li>
      <li>unlike other products, i love the fact that it is unscented and it works really well only with one splash of spray.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
      <li>The heavy scent from any kind of perfumed product can make the risk of nausea equally bad and many people also have allergies to the multiple ingredients in many room deodorizers.</li>
      <li>If you have pets or smelly areas, it will clear it up in seconds.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand the smell of air freshener sprays and I finally found an unscented spray that really works.</li>
      <li>My mother lives in an assisted living facility and I frequently purchase items for her.  </li>
      <li>Far outperforms deodorizers</li>
      <li>You end up with a nice clean smelling bathroom, instead of, well, \\&quot;bad</li>
      <li>I keep a small bottle of this in my purse; primarily for after having a cigarette; makes the smell go away completely; either in my car or on my person.  </li>
      <li>Totally awesome for home care, animal rescue, and anything you can think of with bad organic smells!</li>
      <li>After using the product I close the door and after about 15-20 minutes the odors are either gone or barely detectable.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product recently for my workplace, a busy recovery room.</li>
      <li>It takes several sprays of the m9 spray to remove the odor, but it does reduce the odor much faster than other sprays, that I have tried.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product.  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> When my late husband had a colostomy, the specialists gave us some of this spray to help with odor. I had a small amount left and started using it in the room where the cats&#x27; litterboxes are located. It does make a difference so I ordered the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> My mom bought two bottles of this. One for me and one for her. She thought it would cover up the litter box smell in my house but it doesn&#x27;t. After you spray it lasts for about 5 minutes and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Best product for eliminating odors. Love the travel size for the long airplane flights.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product when a family member was in the hospital.  After a couple of years, she had used up what was left in the bottle they had used while she was in the hospital, so I found this online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s amazing is that it doesn&#x27;t try to overpower \\&quot;bad smells\\&quot;--it just gets rid of them.  You end up with a nice clean smelling bathroom, instead of, well, \\&quot;bad smells\\&quot; and lilacs.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase the drops but decided to try the spray this time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it is fine for spraying larger areas and I have used it on my dad&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;bed liner, which works fine.&lt;br /&gt;My main use is to deodorize his urine bag for his catheter and the drops&lt;br /&gt;are concentrated, therefore last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered the M9 Odor Eliminator SPRAY instead of the M9 Odor Eliminator DROPS. The ingredient list is the same but, in a slightly different order. The drops are a vibrant blue, whereas the spray is pale blue. The spray is much less effective than the drops. It was tricky holding my ostomy bag open wide enough to use the spray and it took a lot to eliminate the odor whereas it takes very little of the Odor Eliminator Drops to do the job.</li>
    <li> We use this in the hospital where I work and for good reason. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I guess I was hoping for a miracle based on other reviews.  The product works ok for a short period of time but after about 15 minutes I can smell the litter box again. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it runs out but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It did nothing to take away the odor. I will not purchase again. So there you have it, my rating.</li>
    <li> Far outperforms deodorizers</li>
    <li> Really expected a different product based on how expensive it was. Will not recommend it to anyone. Would look into another brand</li>
    <li> Very good product, eliminates air born odor almost immediately. In a pinch you can use it in the Stoma bag.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!!</li>
    <li> Perfect odor eliminator. No cover up fragrance here!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have a small 2oz spray bottle that I use for travel. I have Chrones and I have gotten very embarrassed in certain situations. This is the little gift we can carry to eliminate the fear from the odor. Spray before you sit and after you stand. Very simple and quaint.</li>
    <li> I discovered the M9TM Odor Eliminator Spray when a hospital I visited used it in the patient rooms. It doesn&#x27;t mask odors with artificial flowery scents or chemical smells. It only takes a couple of squirts and the room smells like a window has been opened. I love using it in pet areas in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  Discovered it in UCSD Hospitals and have been using it for four years.  It destroys odors with only 1-2 light sprays and leaves no masking perfume.  It&#x27;s expensive, but a bottle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> fast shipping great product works well</li>
    <li> I add essential oils to this spray and love it! Since I am sensitive to most scented products and can&#x27;t use them, this lets me have scented products I love!</li>
    <li> My mother lives in an assisted living facility and I frequently purchase items for her.  She requested a product called M9 Odor Eliminator Spray because the bottle she has was running low.  I had never heard of the product but ordered it on Amazon.com.  She loves this product because there is no flowery coverup odor after spraying.  The product leaves absolutely no scent after using it but abolishes unwanted odors.</li>
    <li> Very good product. May not last long, but does not take a lot of spraying to do the job. Recommended and would order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Bought it for my mom who got a sample in the hospital.  Worka as advertised.  Hey</li>
    <li> Eliminates odor with perfumes, awesome!</li>
    <li> When camping and having to use a community restroom, this works great! Bad odors instantly leave.</li>
    <li> Was first introduced to this product when I was in the hospital and was so impressed with the results I immediately, after coming home, ordered my own.  (The hospital wouldn&#x27;t give me theirs!)  Without being too personal this deodorizer eliminates almost immediately the worst bathroom odors without the sickly perfume smell.  The price is right, the item arrived in excellent condition and I will continue to use m9 deodorizer and tell others what a fantastic product m9 is.</li>
    <li> Amazing how well it works. It is not a cover scent but the odor will disappear. A bit pricey but it works</li>
    <li> A friend told me that we could get this item on line as we hadn&#x27;t been able to find it locally.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t eliminate odors very well.  Not good at all for farts.</li>
    <li> This product was originally designed for people with Colostomies/Ileostomies. It is specifically designed to eliminate biological odor. It is also extremely effective with frequent gas also from people who have undergone bariatric surgery or who have intestinal problems as well. I purchased this product recently for my workplace, a busy recovery room. It is not helpful to have odors drifting about when people are awakening from anesthesia at high risk for nausea. For odor problems arising from feces, gas etc. this product is a miracle cure.  M9 eliminates biological odor without leaving heavy scents behind. The heavy scent from any kind of perfumed product can make the risk of nausea equally bad and many people also have allergies to the multiple ingredients in many room deodorizers.</li>
    <li> I was given this product from the hospital after discharge. It works so much better than scented sprays. I ordered one for each bathroom</li>
    <li> I keep a small bottle of this in my purse; primarily for after having a cigarette; makes the smell go away completely; either in my car or on my person.  Excellent all purpose freshener.</li>
    <li> This works great, used it at the hospital but I just wish it had a refill bottle available.</li>
    <li> This odor eliminator spray works great. We keep one in each bathroom. I can&#x27;t stand the smell of air freshener sprays and I finally found an unscented spray that really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and it&#x27;s great stuff! If you have pets or smelly areas, it will clear it up in seconds.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s odorless, but i really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working.  think i&#x27;m going to go back to the Medi-Aire, which works AMAZINGLY well...</li>
    <li> This product I ordered for my moms stoma bag. I used to order 1oz bottles and those are working fine. This time decided to order bigger size. Description looks identical, but it is completely different product. It doesn&#x27;t fit it&#x27;s main purpose at all.</li>
    <li> Have to use a lot but it does work.</li>
    <li> This stuff works like magic.  I saw them use it in a hospital so I tried it.  I&#x27;m very happy wih it.</li>
    <li> I learned about M9 when I was doing hospital nursing.  Totally awesome for home care, animal rescue, and anything you can think of with bad organic smells!</li>
    <li> I have found this to be quite effective at eliminating bathroom odors.  It works best by using several squirts of the product sprayed around the room.  After using the product I close the door and after about 15-20 minutes the odors are either gone or barely detectable.  Beats having flowery smelling bathroom odors that linger.  I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job at eliminating odors. It seems best effective when you spray upon the first sign of odor before the odor gets a chance to spread too much. Product delivered exactly as described and quick shipping. I recommend this product and seller. Thanks!</li>
    <li> unlike other products, i love the fact that it is unscented and it works really well only with one splash of spray.&lt;br /&gt;it last long too.&lt;br /&gt;must have product for the public bathroom or master bathrooom!</li>
    <li> Eliminates odors; no funny cosmetic smell.  Love it and recommend it for anyone who just hates a flowery sweet smell.</li>
    <li> I remember this spray being used in the rehabilitation floor in the hospital!! This stuff works EXTREMELY well for smells. After my spinal cord injury I was on the rehab floor and....well, accidents happen. They used this spray in the rooms after every bowel program, accident, or if it just needed a bit of freshening up. Took care of the smells no problem. I was honestly incredibly impressed with how well it got rid of odors due to bowel movements specifically. If you&#x27;re looking for a bathroom spray that works, this is the REALLY odor elimiator. Febreeze has no idea what the words &amp;#34;odor eliminator&amp;#34; means compares to this stuff. Take it from someone that had to poop in bed on the regular in a hospital for about two months. This stuff is the truth!</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT FOR MY DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM ,THAT RIGHT OFF MY KITCHEN!</li>
    <li> I used this for deodorizing my bath room, and I was disappointed with the results. I probably will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Discovered this product when husband hospitalized. Eliminates orders quickly.  The aerosol lasts 2-3X longer than other air fresheners I&#x27;ve tried. Hands down the best!</li>
    <li> This is the most AWESOME order eliminater I have used!</li>
    <li> great oder neutralizer</li>
    <li> This product works very well compared to others that I have tried.  I have an ostomy bag.  Emptying or changing the bag produces a strong smell.  It takes several sprays of the m9 spray to remove the odor, but it does reduce the odor much faster than other sprays, that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Arrived when it was supposed to, works very quickly. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> It really does what it is supposed to do. I already had one but I bought another one because it is very good. The only thing is for the shipping, when I opened the box some of the product had spilled out in the bag where it was wrapped so it wasted some product which is sad.</li>
    <li> Really works learned about it at the hospital.</li>
    <li> Excellent and 100% effective!</li>
    <li> Kills order without fru-fru smell. Used in many hospitals.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  They used this same thing in the.hospital.</li>
