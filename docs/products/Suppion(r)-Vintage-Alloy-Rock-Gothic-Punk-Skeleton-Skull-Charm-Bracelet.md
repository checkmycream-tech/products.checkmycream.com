<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The chain part was really tangled up. To the point I can&#x27;t get the kink out. Skeleton looks great, just can&#x27;t wear the bracelet.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured, so cute! So worth the price, I wish I had ordered 5 so I could give them as gifts!</li>
    <li> I love this bracelet. My favorite aspects include:&lt;br /&gt;- It was actually shinier than the picture made it seem. Some reviews say that this bracelet seems cheap, but I don&#x27;t agree with that at all. It&#x27;s very nice quality, especially considering the great price.&lt;br /&gt;- Much daintier and smaller than I thought - very feminine!&lt;br /&gt;- The legs and feet are jointed and are free to move! So cute!&lt;br /&gt;-  I just noticed that the eyes are shaped like hearts - adorable!!!&lt;br /&gt;- I liked it so much that I ordered one for my friend, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a little tricky to put on by myself, but I&#x27;m getting better at it.&lt;br /&gt;- Not really resizable. You can hook the clasp at a different spot on the chain to make it tighter, but it looked crooked and unbalanced when I did it.</li>
    <li> It broke within three times of wearing it .still think it&#x27;s very cute but it&#x27;s very cheaply made</li>
    <li> Took awhile to receive the bracelet and it&#x27;s not as gold looking as the picture but granddaughter really likes it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece....I got a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Another score for grandma within the skull jewelry!</li>
    <li> Came early looks just like the picture it is absolutely beautiful.. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> I really like this bracelet. However it was not smoothed out properly and keeps snagging my blouse. I have not used it since. it has potential</li>
    <li> nice for little people</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It was very cute but one of the legs fell off within the first week and is lost forever, so I don&#x27;t wear it now.</li>
    <li> This was such an adorable bracelet. I would say the only thing that is barely fit me once I got it. Just ensure that this is a rather small bracelet and does not leave much room for larger wrists but I love it.</li>

    <li> Love this! For the price this is very cute and arrived 2 weeks before the estimated arrival date. The coloring of it is a bit more &amp;#34;rustic&amp;#34; looking, giving it that vintage look. Plenty of room for adjustment for those with larger wrists. Highly recommend!</li>

    <li> SO CUTE! took a while to get, but fits perfect on my wrist, just be careful w/ it, its only a couple dollars, don&#x27;t expect titanium steel! lol for the money, yes, get it!</li>
    <li> Looks very nice and expensive. I wear it every day.</li>
    <li> I loved it but it broke after two days</li>
    <li> Really cute, but a little dull in color other then that i love it</li>
