### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Although deliciously fragrant, it has no taste.</li>
      <li>This lip butter is great!</li>
      <li>best part is that it is a screw on lid.</li>
      <li>That said, the cocoa aroma is perfect and smells like a slice of heaven.</li>
      <li>But the best part of the smell, to me, was the taste: NONE.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect &amp;#34;undercover&amp;#34; lip balm.</li>
      <li>I want to know which I like the best.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t have a problem using your finger to apply it, this is a wonderful lip</li>
      <li>and it comes in a delightful coconut version.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells delicious, but doesn&#x27;t have any flavor to match, which I found odd.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product!!!</li>
      <li>It works great and the flavor is delicious.</li>
      <li>The yummy scent makes for a great good-night</li>
      <li>The scent is very nice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, pleasant, good protection from winter weather, would recommend</li>
      <li>My lips were fairly well moisturized when I was using it.</li>
      <li>Nivea has moved ahead of the curve and provided &amp;#34;chapped lipped sufferers&amp;#34; with a superior product.</li>
      <li>I like the scent of this lip butter and it feels good on my lips.</li>
      <li>It has Shea and Cocoa butter and sweet almond oil in it, which are excellent moisturizers, and the yummy smell reminds me of a lighter Yankee Candle Christmas Cookie scent.</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I really love the Nivea Lip Butter in Cocoa Butter Kiss and think it&#x27;s a great lip moisturizer that I&#x27;m using every night and during the day when I don&#x27;t need lip color or lipstick.</li>
      <li>Nivea Lip Care Butter (in the AWESOME Cocoa Butter flavor) is about the best thing I have come across in a long time.</li>
      <li>tin is very cute and retro</li>
      <li>You will love it!</li>
      <li>and I love that one!  </li>
      <li>absolutely love the Nivea Lip Care in Cocoa Butter Kiss!</li>
      <li>I love the smell/scent of this lip butter!  </li>
      <li>you are looking for a nice lip balm that coats your lips, and stays in place for an sufficient amount of time, give this a try.  </li>
      <li>The shea butter, almond oil, castor seed oil and cocoa butter are a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>It is just nice lip</li>
      <li>Nice as a cuticle treatment as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product has a nice scent</li>
      <li>Nice scent, but that is all you get.</li>
      <li>This lip balm is very creamy, and it smells wonderful!  </li>
      <li>Also it has a very strong scent.</li>
      <li>The taste is more palatable than Carmex and there is a nice shine to it.</li>
      <li>So if you want to top Vaseline, this for sure does that, but if you are trying to top a good SPF lip product, this is not it.</li>
      <li>It had a pleasantly creamy but not slippery texture, and the smell was lovely that I enjoy putting it on.</li>
      <li>me, there was a very, very light scent, which diminished once the balm was upon my fingers and lips.</li>
      <li>It coats my lips and makes them very smooth.</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent/ flavor and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>I love, love, LOVE lip balm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>Lip smacking goodness (how much more cliche</li>
      <li>It smells like a nice, light chocolate in the container.</li>
      <li>I love how this literally drenches my lips without making them greasy and slippery.</li>
      <li>in all, I do not recommend this lip balm and was hoping for something better from Nivea.  </li>
      <li>My lips felt so much better after using this product.</li>
      <li>This was an okay selection</li>
      <li>For some this might be a plus, but for me, it&#x27;s too potent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is moisturizing, but more sitting on top of my lips.  </li>
      <li>They all love it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with it not smelling (or tasting) like anything when it&#x27;s on my lips.</li>
      <li>It stays on better than petroleum jelly and the softening effect lasts longer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is thicker than Vaseline, smells better, and has a couple nourishing elements in it.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes OK but feels a bit too greasy for my taste.</li>
      <li>love Nivea,</li>
      <li>It works ok</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve been better about saying something along the lines of &amp;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite nightly lip moisturizer that I now use instead of Aquaphor, Vaseline and even a pricey Night Lip Serum</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the original Nivea Lip Butter, and liked it quite well, so was looking forward to trying this cocoa butter</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this product four stars because it is PERFECT for rubbing on my dry cracked peeling cuticles.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t see why I would choose it over other more wonderful products on the market.  </li>
      <li>smell: is light and lovely, sort of a toasted coconut.</li>
      <li>There really is nothing that could make this product better, I love it!</li>
      <li>The little tin fits perfectly in my purse.  </li>
      <li>I love the nice, clear shine it leaves on my lips.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and is all but invisible.</li>
      <li>And, yes, I knew this when I ordered it, but it was free, and I like the sound of the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not waxy, sticky, or cheap feeling at all.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and nourishes your lips.</li>
      <li>and it goes on really smooth.</li>
      <li>Fantastic lip balm.</li>
      <li>It’s so light that don’t even feel like you have lip balm on and</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the next great product.</li>
      <li>The smell is awesome but not overwhelming in any way.</li>
      <li>The original cream has been packaged in a tin for 100 years, and continues to be produced that way</li>
      <li>It could just be a manufacturing defect, because the tin from my original lip butter never did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The original lip butter lasted longer for me than this cocoa butter version, so of the two, I would choose the original for this reason alone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it smells good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good, basic lip balm.</li>
      <li>I love the way Cocoa Butter Kiss smells and feels on my lips so much that I use it every night before bed as part of my nighttime ritual.</li>
      <li>This is a good lip product overall.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells heavenly, goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky, and soaks right in to your lips.</li>
      <li>I used my finger tip apply it to my lips, the lip balm was just the quick amount of consistency.</li>
      <li>THIS is my new favorite thing.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>My lips are very sensitive to weather changes and most petroleum jelly based lip balms</li>
      <li>All kidding aside, this &amp;#34;lip butter&amp;#34; really does smooth chapped lips.</li>
      <li>I was not crazy about the flavor.</li>
      <li>That being said, it&#x27;s worth getting a finger or two</li>
      <li>other people don’t notice that you’re wearing it which is good for a man.</li>
      <li>and I like this lip butter very much, but really wish that it wasn&#x27;t primarily made of petrolatum.</li>
      <li>It provides just the right amount of moisture my lips need.</li>
      <li>Eos container never quite close right for me</li>
      <li>Honestly, the tin is large enough that I&#x27;m able to put it straight to my lips and apply like a stick balm straight from the tin.</li>
      <li>There are other flavors available here - raspberry, blueberry, plain - but the coconut was the best.</li>
      <li>product applies very smoothly and definitely feels like butter.  </li>
      <li>The first ingredient is petrolatum (petroleum jelly), so it makes sense that it would help with the chapping.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I get really dry chapped lips that peel in the winter so I had no doubt that I wanted to try this product. The cocoa butter smell is intoxicating. When I smelled it, I automatically said Yummmmmmmmm! Then I had my husband smell it and he did the same thing. That is saying a lot because there are a lot of smells that he doesn&#x27;t care for like any perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used my finger tip apply it to my lips, the lip balm was just the quick amount of consistency. I put it right over my lipstick three hours ago and my lips are still soft and soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this product could be improved so my only suggestion is why not offer a variety pack of the lip butters. I can&#x27;t really afford to buy six of each. I want to know which I like the best. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. It moisturizes OK but feels a bit too greasy for my taste. Also it has a very strong scent. For some this might be a plus, but for me, it&#x27;s too potent. YMMV.</li>
    <li> The texture is divine. The flavor (you only notice it at first) is subtle, but lovely. One little swipe keeps your lips moisturized for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a problem using your finger to apply it, this is a wonderful lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Germany they market this under the brand name Labella and it comes in a delightful coconut version. I bought 8 of them on my last day there, because I checked and realized it wasn&#x27;t easy to find in the US. There are other flavors available here - raspberry, blueberry, plain - but the coconut was the best. I was trying to figure out how to convince my husband that we needed to go back to Europe for more lip balm, when I stumbled on this version. Lest you think I am a crazy person obsessed with lip balm, I&#x27;ll say that almost every other kind I&#x27;ve tried has ended up in the trash after being half-used. By contrast, this one has been handed out to friends and relatives up north, because I know how hard winter can be on lips. They all love it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it from Amazon or book a trip to Europe and buy the coconut version, because that&#x27;s a reasonable thing to do.</li>
    <li> First of all, The Vine stated &amp;#34;package of 6&amp;#34;, which, at times, we get. They&#x27;ve been better about saying something along the lines of &amp;#34;...Vine customers get one..&amp;#34; ~ not relevant to the review, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reviewing Cocoa Butter Kiss.  I love, love, LOVE lip balm. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of sticking my fingers in a tin. And, yes, I knew this when I ordered it, but it was free, and I like the sound of the product. That being said, it&#x27;s worth getting a finger or two a bit gooey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, there was a very, very light scent, which diminished once the balm was upon my fingers and lips. It smells like a nice, light chocolate in the container. I&#x27;m okay with it not smelling (or tasting) like anything when it&#x27;s on my lips. It is buttery smooth to apply and lasts a relatively long time, barring licking of your lips and/or eating/drinking. Reapplying would be necessary. I love the nice, clear shine it leaves on my lips. There is no waxy feeling and it leaves my lips supple and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the ingredients (taken from Amazon page description) ~ Petrolatum, Polyglyceryl-3 Disostearate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Water, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, BHT, Falvor, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Yellow 6 Lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of Petrolatum. Or Yellow 6 Lake. In my skin products. However, I might make an exception with this, because I really like this lip balm.</li>
    <li> This lip balm comes in a nice little tin. It goes on smoothly and nourishes your lips. My lips felt hydrated after applying the lip balm. I tried the Cocoa Butter Kiss flavor. I was not crazy about the flavor. It wasn&#x27;t a bad flavor just a neutral flavor, rather tasteless. I would try one of the other flavors. The tin is small and flat so it would fit easily in a pocket. My lips felt so much better after using this product. This lip butter does it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this lip butter and it feels good on my lips. But I don&#x27;t know that I would use it regularly. It doesn&#x27;t seem to improve the dryness of my lips with use, and it has no SPF protection. The tin is hard to open due to being so thin, and the price definitely is high for a product that doesn&#x27;t seem to provide much in the way of improving lip dryness issues.</li>
    <li> Fantastic lip balm. Would definitely purchase this product. There was no irritation or dryness. It worked great, especially overnight when our home gets very dry during the winter. The only issue was that it was difficult to open, but it could just be my particular container.</li>
    <li> First impression was that it tasted like chocolate&lt;br /&gt;Second impression was that it is protective, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use your index finger to apply it, like I did, and you wear contact lenses, or are in the habit of rubbing your eyes, you will find yourself with a bit of a dilemma as this stuff is hard to wash off, even with soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;One solution is to apply it with your pinky finger, or you can use a cotton swab (Q-Tip) to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, plan on washing your hands real well after getting this stuff on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pleasant, good protection from winter weather, would recommend</li>
    <li> So moisturizing! I love how this literally drenches my lips without making them greasy and slippery. It provides just the right amount of moisture my lips need. The smell is awesome but not overwhelming in any way. I love the little compact tin!</li>
    <li> This was an okay selection but I will not be getting it again.  Just don&#x27;t see why I would choose it over other more wonderful products on the market.  It was a bit greasy for my liking as well.  I did like the smell but I guess I am not really into lip butter of this sort. I prefer longer lasting products that are less messy.</li>
    <li> I have a bit of a lip balm addiction and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the next great product. The product has a nice scent but it&#x27;s not particularly long lasting or moisturizing. The tin is difficult to open and manage. I&#x27;d much rather use a tube or stick product.</li>
    <li> The smell and taste actually gagged me.  I couldn&#x27;t get past it.</li>
    <li> There are positives and negatives about this product.  On the plus side, the container is a small round disc and will fit easily into a pocket or purse.  It is also very creamy and does seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, it is almost beyond creamy to being sticky.  You can only apply it with a fingertip so you have a bit of a mess sometimes.  Also, I really don&#x27;t like the scent.  Very artificial, almost sickly sweet.  Finally, although it touts itself as &amp;#34;Cocoa Butter Kiss&amp;#34;, cocoa seed butter is about the sixth ingredient listed.  Petrolatum is the first ingredient, which is basically a mineral oil product which can actually dry out skin rather than moisturize it.  If you want to put cocoa butter on your lips, why not use a product where cocoa butter is the first ingredient?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would actually rate this about 3 and a half stars.</li>
    <li> I’m a big Carmex fan but it’s nice to occasionally use something different. The Nivea Lip Care Butter is definitely different than Carmex. It’s much lighter and creamier. It’s so light that don’t even feel like you have lip balm on and other people don’t notice that you’re wearing it which is good for a man. It’s not at all waxy and it goes on really smooth. It works great and the flavor is delicious. I like this stuff so much that it’s now sharing equal time with Carmex.</li>
    <li> 7/26/15 Update: I love the way Cocoa Butter Kiss smells and feels on my lips so much that I use it every night before bed as part of my nighttime ritual. Although I first tested this for free, I have subsequently purchased a multi-pack of the same type and my husband is now hooked too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the Nivea Lip Care in Cocoa Butter Kiss! It&#x27;s my favorite nightly lip moisturizer that I now use instead of Aquaphor, Vaseline and even a pricey Night Lip Serum I was using. It has Shea and Cocoa butter and sweet almond oil in it, which are excellent moisturizers, and the yummy smell reminds me of a lighter Yankee Candle Christmas Cookie scent. No fragrances are listed so the smell must come from those ingredients. The texture is really smooth kind of like Vaseline (first ingredient is petrolatum) but is less goopy and silkier and richer - likely from the Shea and Cocoa butter and sweet almond oil. It moisturizes really well and stays on my lips for at least a few hours.  Although deliciously fragrant, it has no taste. My only issue is I don&#x27;t know why it needs to add yellow 6 lake dye, since it adds no lip color.  I find it easy to open with the edge of my fingernail (I don&#x27;t have long nails), yet tight enough not to open in my purse.  I really love the Nivea Lip Butter in Cocoa Butter Kiss and think it&#x27;s a great lip moisturizer that I&#x27;m using every night and during the day when I don&#x27;t need lip color or lipstick. I am sensitive to fragrance but this does not bother me a bit, it seems high quality and is made in Belgium. I highly recommend it, unless you don&#x27;t like any fragrance.</li>
    <li> I generally do not use a lip balm, as I tend to apply lipstick even on a day when I stay home. However, this winter I have been fighting an upper respiratory infection that has had one result of making my lips on the dry side. So, I use this product at night to soothe dry lips and I am very pleased with the results. The product left my lips smooth and soft, had a taste which I felt was neutral, and was not greasy. The tin is rather on the small side, and I suspect it will only last for a month with more than one use daily. I did have a little difficulty opening the tin for the first time, as it is small and shallow, so there wasn&#x27;t much area to grip. I ended up using my thumbnail to get the process started, which is not ideal,so that is why 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is very creamy, and it smells wonderful!  It coats my lips and makes them very smooth. The little tin fits perfectly in my purse.  The lid seals really tight, so there isn&#x27;t a chance of it opening accidentally, and ruining other items in my purse.  I have used the [[ASIN:B00PQNJI7M Nivea Lip Butter Carded Tin, Caramel Cream Kiss, 0.59 Ounce]], and I love that one!  The Cocoa Butter lives up to the same standard as the Caramel Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a nice lip balm that coats your lips, and stays in place for an sufficient amount of time, give this a try.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> This lip butter is great! For such a small product as lip care, it&#x27;s pretty amazing how many option and varieties there are. It&#x27;s also amazing how many products are just SO bad. I consider myself rather a connoisseur of lip products, and this one is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell: is light and lovely, sort of a toasted coconut. But the best part of the smell, to me, was the taste: NONE. It had no taste. It had a pleasantly creamy but not slippery texture, and the smell was lovely that I enjoy putting it on. But it isn&#x27;t sugary to wear, it doesn&#x27;t make me want to eat it off, it doesn&#x27;t revolt me. It is just nice lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for extreme cold weather conditions, I&#x27;m not sure how well it will hold up. My lips were fairly well moisturized when I was using it. Also, it&#x27;s not terribly good (but nor is any lip butter, really as a lipstick base. It wasn&#x27;t bad over lipstick, but of course it lessened the longevity of my lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, and your mileage will vary on this, I had to deduct half a star because I really don&#x27;t like lip products that I have to put on with my finger. That said, the tin is amply sized, fairly easy to open, and didn&#x27;t grease my finger up awkwardly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really picky about lip balm and was super surprised how much I like this. it smells good enough to eat. You only need a very little bit and your lips feel light and creamy, not thick and greasy like chapstick feels.  It also leaves a little shimmer.  Where has this been all my life!</li>
    <li> In the winter, I suffer from continual chapped lips.  No matter how much product I put on them, they are still constantly dry.  I decided to give the Nivea Lip Butter a shot.  Overall, it is pretty good.  The first ingredient is petrolatum (petroleum jelly), so it makes sense that it would help with the chapping.  It doesn’t seem as greasy as just straight petroleum jelly though.  The scent is very nice.  It is your typical cocoa butter smell.  I’m not a fan of metal tins because they are hard to open and force you to stick your finger into the product.  Call me crazy, but touching my mouth all the time during cold and flu season doesn’t seem like the brightest idea.  That said, there is no way this product could be put into stick form while still remaining as creamy as it is.  At the end of the day, my lips are less chapped (although not perfect) and this is a product I will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> THIS is my new favorite thing. Period.&lt;br /&gt;It smells heavenly, goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky, and soaks right in to your lips. It really refreshes and rehydrates them without sneakily drying them back out. There really is nothing that could make this product better, I love it!</li>
    <li> Nivea Lip Butter comes in a wide tin rather than the usual narrow one. It smells yummy; the cocoa butter comes through more than the other oils. I was in need of something to help with dry lips after a crazy winter and several weeks of flu and its aftermath, and this did the trick. My lips are soft and no longer in danger of cracking. This is a petrolatum-based lip treatment, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. The shea butter, almond oil, castor seed oil and cocoa butter are a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> I love the smell/scent of this lip butter!  It smells like chocolate and is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I don&#x27;t find this to be extraordinary in any other way except the scent and the cute tin it comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a petroleum based lip product with some Almond and Shea oil in it.  I found that I have to keep reapplying it.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that there is no sun protection element.&lt;br /&gt;The tin is very cute and retro but I find it hard to open at times.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up setting next to my bed to put on at night instead of carrying it in my bag.  The yummy scent makes for a great good-night kiss.&lt;br /&gt;It is thicker than Vaseline, smells better, and has a couple nourishing elements in it.  So if you want to top Vaseline, this for sure does that, but if you are trying to top a good SPF lip product, this is not it.</li>
    <li> I got this as a lip balm to use to help moisturize dry lips. It has a nice scent/ flavor and goes on easily. I like that it comes in a nice little tin as well. It works ok but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to last for a long time and leaves a slightly greasy feeling. So not a great product just an ok one.</li>
    <li> I typically use plain old petroleum jelly on my lips. I find this Nivea Lip Care Butter to feel thicker and a bit gummy on my lips. The effectiveness is the same as petroleum jelly, but I don&#x27;t love the slightly gummy lip feel. That said, the cocoa aroma is perfect and smells like a slice of heaven. I&#x27;m giving this product four stars because it is PERFECT for rubbing on my dry cracked peeling cuticles. It stays on better than petroleum jelly and the softening effect lasts longer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good, basic lip balm. The taste is more palatable than Carmex and there is a nice shine to it. I like the cocoa butter ingredient and you can&#x27;t ever go wrong with Nivea. The price is comparable to others like the egg shaped Eos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it is a screw on lid. Eos container never quite close right for me</li>
    <li> The small metal disk that the lip balm is packaged in was a little difficult for me to get a good grip to open the container.  Maybe if my joints were better this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but for me this is too difficult.  The cold Ohio winter doesn&#x27;t help, but I tend to use more lip balm in the winter, and it should be easy to open!&lt;br /&gt;When applying the balm, it feels waxy and heavy on my lips.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is moisturizing, but more sitting on top of my lips.  I suppose it still offers a measure of protection, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do not recommend this lip balm and was hoping for something better from Nivea.  Nice scent, but that is all you get.</li>
    <li> Nivea Lip Care Butter (in the AWESOME Cocoa Butter flavor) is about the best thing I have come across in a long time. Lip smacking goodness (how much more cliche could I be?). All kidding aside, this &amp;#34;lip butter&amp;#34; really does smooth chapped lips. I have used this throughout the brutal, dry cold of this midwest winter 2015. My lips are very sensitive to weather changes and most petroleum jelly based lip balms do nothing for me. Nivea has moved ahead of the curve and provided &amp;#34;chapped lipped sufferers&amp;#34; with a superior product. This does not &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; or feel like a glazed mess on my lips. It goes on smooth and is all but invisible. You will not even know that it is there, but you will know that it is working. Non-sticky. It is the perfect &amp;#34;undercover&amp;#34; lip balm. Could not be happier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Nivea Lip Butter, and liked it quite well, so was looking forward to trying this cocoa butter version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells delicious, but doesn&#x27;t have any flavor to match, which I found odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product applies very smoothly and definitely feels like butter.  It&#x27;s not waxy, sticky, or cheap feeling at all.  However, I don&#x27;t feel like it lasts very long, and I&#x27;ve had to reapply it often.  For me, long lasting moisturization is the main goal of lip balm, I don&#x27;t like having dry lips!  The original lip butter lasted longer for me than this cocoa butter version, so of the two, I would choose the original for this reason alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin the Lip Butter comes in is not easy to open and close - the lid sticks to the main tin, and not because of something sticky, it&#x27;s the actual design.  It could just be a manufacturing defect, because the tin from my original lip butter never did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of trying to apply products this thick with my finger, because I don&#x27;t like standing there rubbing and rubbing just to get enough on my finger for suitable application. Honestly, the tin is large enough that I&#x27;m able to put it straight to my lips and apply like a stick balm straight from the tin. I&#x27;d really prefer to have this product in stick form, actually, it would be much easier to apply.</li>
    <li> On opening the little tin, the warm scent of cocoa with a caramel undertone is delightful.&lt;br /&gt;Scent, not much in the way of flavor. It feels like most other butters, slippery and even greasy if overapplied.&lt;br /&gt;Lips feel soft and supple for hours after using. Nice as a cuticle treatment as well.&lt;br /&gt;The tin itself is familiar to anyone that has used Nivea creams for a long time. The original cream has been packaged in a tin for 100 years, and continues to be produced that way today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Nivea, and I like this lip butter very much, but really wish that it wasn&#x27;t primarily made of petrolatum. I won&#x27;t go on about the controversy over petrolatum, and personally I don&#x27;t mind it as an ingredient lower in the list. However, it seems as if often the American versions wind up with more &#x27;junk&#x27; because our bar is lower here for cosmetics saftey. Famous example is OPI nail polish eliminating formaldehyde from European versions but still including it in the US until people complained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The German Nivea products seem to, in general, have safer ingredients and fewer (not free of, but fewer) preservatives are used.&lt;br /&gt;For example, the German version ingredients of this lip butter :Cera Microcristallina, Paraffinum Liquidum, Polyglyceryl-3 isostearate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Aqua, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, BHT, Aroma, CI 77891, CI 15850&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if our laws are such that we allow it, we deserve the same safer products that other global Nivea users have access to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a single uncarded tin, therefore have no comment on any information that may have been included on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The less packaging the better, so I hope the company considers selling this lip butter without the additional card and plastic.</li>
    <li> This is a good lip product overall. It has a nice cocoa scent, it is thick, yet smooth in application, and it protects my lips and keep them moisturized. My lone complaint is the packaging. Instead of using a tube or even a screw-off lid, it is in a tin that requires a bit of prying to open. Even a spot to push down and pop open would help. This would be a five star product if it was easier to access.</li>
