### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Butler is the best of the floss handles but breaks before I think it should which requires me to purchase multiples each time.</li>
      <li>Very good</li>
      <li>Very good price break purchased in bulk.</li>
      <li>Once you learn the best way to use these they work great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>My husband and I were so happy that we could find these floss holders.</li>
      <li>This is a great way to floss.  </li>
      <li>I use this product every day and they work great.</li>
      <li>My fingers don&#x27;t belong in my mouth so this tool is very handy indeed.</li>
      <li>Plus I&#x27;ll bet customers looked at it in the Dental aisle and thought, \\&quot;What in the good Googly-Moogly is THAT?</li>
      <li>The service through amazon was superior to that which I was getting from retailers and was a very enjoyable experience.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product that&#x27;s much better than disposable flossers.</li>
      <li>I love these flossers!</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>First time ordering from Amazon, they were great.</li>
      <li>But after a quick search on the good ole&#x27; internet I found it.</li>
      <li>Much more sturdy than those disposible things.</li>
      <li>But once you do the dreaded deed with the Floss Mate, I think you&#x27;ll be ok with it.  </li>
      <li>I bought a bunch because he likes these so much more than the flexible threaders.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I lost it and found this one, and bought 2 of them which is made of more brittle plastic.</li>
      <li>I have been always pleased with my purchases at Amazon</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t floss, just get one of these - it&#x27;s about as easy as brushing your teeth.</li>
      <li>I floss twice a day, its so easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier and more effective than using the floss alone.  </li>
      <li>Never having seen it in stores I figured it was no longer available.</li>
      <li>My dentist had them available for a while but has since gone to the junk you can get in the stores.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t want to start wrapping my fingers again; ergo, I&#x27;ve got to buy the reduced quality product until I find (or make) something better.</li>
      <li>Super product.  </li>
      <li>I tried this product more years ago than I can remember, but back then I knew it was a worthy investment.  </li>
      <li>It was definitely worth getting the 12 pack - for the whole family, it&#x27;s a 30 year supply!</li>
      <li>I used this product for years and find it far superior to the disposable, smaller flossing forks that are now on the market.  </li>
      <li>and you have to search a little to find a good price.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I was looking for  </li>
      <li>Just wrap any old cheap floss around the prongs and use it to scrub the sides of your teeth.  </li>
      <li>They work better than anything else we&#x27;ve found, it&#x27;s that simple.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon!    bob</li>
      <li>We finally found these on Amazon and bought a dozen of them-not because they break easily but to give some to family.  </li>
      <li>A miniature sling shot\\&quot;    Highly recommended!  </li>
      <li>A tool like this is easier to maneuver and allows you to use whatever floss you want with economy and minimal impact on the environment, as opposed to the one-use disposables that send a bit more plastic to the landfill every day.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like the downgraded quality</li>
      <li>I now have to consider these to be very short-term disposable products</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably one of the few solutions in the world that allows you to floss effectively.</li>
      <li>We used these from our dentist for a long time, but they stopped providing them (and used the cheap, throw away stuff) and we just couldn&#x27;t find a store that carried them although we looked every time and place we shopped.  </li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a great product that will last for years with proper care (Clean after each use and don&#x27;t drop it on hard flooring.  </li>
      <li>In any event, these are inexpensive, and despite their short life is a LOT better than trying to hit those back molars with floss strangling your fingertips.</li>
      <li>Use 3 wraps, go around the end while pressing together a little and while keeping tension wrap 3 more times around button.</li>
      <li>Plus, the only thing you discard is the used floss and not the whole apparatus as you would with the disposable models.  </li>
      <li>I get my teeth cleaned professionally once a year</li>
      <li>I broke my old one and got a 12 pack of these on the internet for $24.95 or $2.49 each.</li>
      <li>Much easier to use in your mouth than other flossers sold in stores.</li>
      <li>It was ordered as a replacement for my old one that broke after several  years of daily use.  </li>
      <li>Most of the newer flossers seem to be just wide enough to get between the teeth but allow for little side-to-side action to work the floss down to the gum line.  </li>

<li> By mistake I ordered both packages, so I&#x27;ll probably be buried with 14 of the holders if they all last as long as my last one did.</li>
<li> Should last a long time.</li>
<li> About three or four months ago, the wrapping knob on my faithful yellow flossing handle popped off and I found myself in a minor state of panic.  </li>
<li> We think it&#x27;s because they work so well and last too long.  </li>
<li> and so you actually SAVE money in the long run!  </li>
<li> You don&#x27;t need to buy expensive floss, just use the cheap generic stuff.  </li>
<li> Lasts quite a long time and is a bargain.</li>
<li> The other is still in use</li>
<li> I used a floss holder like this one for years until the plastic, a bit brittle due to its age, broke one morning.</li>
<li> I have used the Butler FlossMate for several years, and the only thing wrong with them is that after about 10 years, the winding button comes off.</li>
<li> I really HATE flossing with a white hot passion.  </li>
<li> My husband had one of these little butlers and his broke.  </li>
<li> and the dental hygienist says I have very little tarter built up.    </li>
<li> Unfortunately all of the retail stores which I do business with have ceased to carry the product and the only place that I could find it was on amazon.  </li>
<li> The \\&quot;spring\\&quot; (tension) between the prongs  DOES wear out on them after a while, so order a few if you can!    </li>
<li> I bought one of these at a drug store in the late 80s.</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> A durable tool to help you floss your teeth affordable to replace if lost or broken.</li>
<li> If you hate flossing with the other handles give this one a try.</li>
<li> I tried them but they were expensive and the floss was difficult to deal with and they did not work as well.  </li>
<li> They are otherwise difficult to find in stores.</li>
<li> The worst part of flossing (that necessary evil) was cutting off my finger circulation to accomplish my daily oral hygiene.  </li>
<li> These are impossible to find, and they do wear out.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t get frustrated trying to wind the floss around my fingers to try and floss my teeth.</li>
<li> I hate flossing.  </li>
<li> But I hate it.  </li>
<li> I know, it&#x27;s a necesary evil.  </li>

    <li> This flossmate saved my teeth. I floss twice a day, its so easy to use. I bought everyone in my family one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I have used the Butler FlossMate for several years, and the only thing wrong with them is that after about 10 years, the winding button comes off. They are otherwise difficult to find in stores. Thanks, Amazon!    bob</li>
    <li> I used a floss holder like this one for years until the plastic, a bit brittle due to its age, broke one morning. I drove to four separate drug stores looking for a replacement and found that dental supply companies are turning away from inexpensive tools like this in favor of one-use disposable pre-threaded flossers. I can see why. Why buy a Flossmate for $2-$3 each and use it for years when the company can get you to buy packs and packs of one-use flossers over the same period? Nice. Way to lessen the impact on the environment.    I find a flossing tool like the Flossmate to be very helpful when flossing, much better than wrapping the floss around one&#x27;s fingers, cutting off the circulation as you try to jam one or the other in your mouth. A tool like this is easier to maneuver and allows you to use whatever floss you want with economy and minimal impact on the environment, as opposed to the one-use disposables that send a bit more plastic to the landfill every day.</li>
    <li> I had one that lasted about 10 years before it finally broke. It was definitely worth getting the 12 pack - for the whole family, it&#x27;s a 30 year supply! If you don&#x27;t floss, just get one of these - it&#x27;s about as easy as brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> Had to knock a tool that helps you floss. My fingers don&#x27;t belong in my mouth so this tool is very handy indeed. Lasts quite a long time and is a bargain.</li>
    <li> We used these from our dentist for a long time, but they stopped providing them (and used the cheap, throw away stuff) and we just couldn&#x27;t find a store that carried them although we looked every time and place we shopped.  We think it&#x27;s because they work so well and last too long.  We finally found these on Amazon and bought a dozen of them-not because they break easily but to give some to family.  They work better than anything else we&#x27;ve found, it&#x27;s that simple.</li>
    <li> product was as described and promptly delivered.  It was ordered as a replacement for my old one that broke after several  years of daily use.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in any local stores anymore.   Much more sturdy than those disposible things.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these probably 1975ish.  The worst part of flossing (that necessary evil) was cutting off my finger circulation to accomplish my daily oral hygiene.  This thing looked like it might solve that problem and it did just that for the next thirty something years.  About three or four months ago, the wrapping knob on my faithful yellow flossing handle popped off and I found myself in a minor state of panic.  Stores do not carry these things anymore but I found the updated version online and ordered one.  It lasted two days before the button popped off.  I ordered a three-pack and the button on the last of those popped off this morning after setting a one-month longevity record.  I now have to consider these to be very short-term disposable products and I&#x27;m ordering the 12-Pack.  I really don&#x27;t like the downgraded quality but I really don&#x27;t want to start wrapping my fingers again; ergo, I&#x27;ve got to buy the reduced quality product until I find (or make) something better.</li>
    <li> I received the items on time. I use this product every day and they work great. I don&#x27;t get frustrated trying to wind the floss around my fingers to try and floss my teeth. Excellent product. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to hassle with using their fingers to floss.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dental floss holder probably 30 years ago, and it is the only reason I floss, because it is so convenient. Never having seen it in stores I figured it was no longer available. But after a quick search on the good ole&#x27; internet I found it. It comes in packs of 12 and packs of 3. By mistake I ordered both packages, so I&#x27;ll probably be buried with 14 of the holders if they all last as long as my last one did.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at a drug store in the late 80s. It was made of a different plastic then and lasted me around 20 years. I lost it and found this one, and bought 2 of them which is made of more brittle plastic. One broke on me within a year. The other is still in use but I went ahead and ordered a similar model; \\&quot;Flossaid Dental Floss\\&quot; because from the picture, it looks like the same plastic that the Flossmate use to be made from.  In any event, these are inexpensive, and despite their short life is a LOT better than trying to hit those back molars with floss strangling your fingertips.</li>
    <li> Very good It came sooner than I expect  It is exactly what I was looking for  I have been always pleased with my purchases at Amazon</li>
    <li> Much easier to use in your mouth than other flossers sold in stores. This makes me want to floss!  I love these flossers!</li>
    <li> My husband and I were so happy that we could find these floss holders. We&#x27;ve searched in stores and drug stores and couldn&#x27;t find them. Thank you Amazon for caring these.!! Tana</li>
    <li> My husband had one of these little butlers and his broke.  We looked all over town and finally found on Amazon.  I bought a bunch because he likes these so much more than the flexible threaders.  Don&#x27;t know why the stores quit carrying them.</li>
    <li> These are impossible to find, and they do wear out.  Hubby loves them, so finding them made me his hero of the day.</li>
    <li> I tried this product more years ago than I can remember, but back then I knew it was a worthy investment.  I can&#x27;t find this product in any of the local drug stores.  One of the reasons, I guess, is its durability.  My dentist had them available for a while but has since gone to the junk you can get in the stores. The biggest advantage the Flossmate has over similar products is the width between the prong ends.  Most of the newer flossers seem to be just wide enough to get between the teeth but allow for little side-to-side action to work the floss down to the gum line.  Plus, the only thing you discard is the used floss and not the whole apparatus as you would with the disposable models.  All in all, it&#x27;s a great product that will last for years with proper care (Clean after each use and don&#x27;t drop it on hard flooring.  It can chip or break.).  I bought the 12-pack, so I may give out some to friends to make converts out of them.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years and find it far superior to the disposable, smaller flossing forks that are now on the market.  Unfortunately all of the retail stores which I do business with have ceased to carry the product and the only place that I could find it was on amazon.  The service through amazon was superior to that which I was getting from retailers and was a very enjoyable experience.</li>
    <li> I depend on the Buttler Flossmate. It&#x27;s a great product that&#x27;s much better than disposable flossers. Delivery was swift. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> If you hate flossing with the other handles give this one a try. I almost don&#x27;t want to leave a review cuz I never want them to sell out.</li>
    <li> Super product.  I hate flossing.  I know, it&#x27;s a necesary evil.  But I hate it.  My dentist or hygienist (can&#x27;t remember) gave me one of these several years ago with the stern You Must Floss lecture.  Made flossing TONS easier!  Every time I&#x27;d go in for a cleaning, I&#x27;d beg for another one.  The \\&quot;spring\\&quot; (tension) between the prongs  DOES wear out on them after a while, so order a few if you can!    Remember, I really HATE flossing with a white hot passion.  But once you do the dreaded deed with the Floss Mate, I think you&#x27;ll be ok with it.  I am. I had one for my purse, one for travel, one in the bathroom. So now you&#x27;re hooked.....    However....    You can NOT find these in stores.  I looked and looked.  Why the darned drugstores don&#x27;t carry these is beyond me.  Oh, wait, I know!  It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re not disposable and so you actually SAVE money in the long run!  Plus I&#x27;ll bet customers looked at it in the Dental aisle and thought, \\&quot;What in the good Googly-Moogly is THAT? A miniature sling shot\\&quot;    Highly recommended!  Seriously.</li>
    <li> Had to buy a dozen to make this deal work; but hey, they&#x27;re not making &#x27;em any more!&lt;br /&gt;Will share with friends and family.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably one of the few solutions in the world that allows you to floss effectively.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to floss.  Just wrap any old cheap floss around the prongs and use it to scrub the sides of your teeth.  It&#x27;s much easier and more effective than using the floss alone.  You don&#x27;t need to buy expensive floss, just use the cheap generic stuff.  I get my teeth cleaned professionally once a year and the dental hygienist says I have very little tarter built up.    This product use to be sold in my local drug store years ago.  For some reason it disappeared from the shelves.  The only thing similar are the type that include the floss.  I tried them but they were expensive and the floss was difficult to deal with and they did not work as well.  My guess as to why it disappeared was that this item is just a one time purchase.  You can use it with any floss you want and they last for years and years.  One day one of the prongs on the fork will break.  That&#x27;s when I discovered they were no longer sold at any of the local drug stores.      I bought a 12 pack of this item and I expect them to last for decades.</li>
    <li> Got order in just 5 days in December. First time ordering from Amazon, they were great.</li>
    <li> Butler is the best of the floss handles but breaks before I think it should which requires me to purchase multiples each time.</li>
    <li> A durable tool to help you floss your teeth affordable to replace if lost or broken. Very good price break purchased in bulk.</li>
    <li> Love it. I broke my old one and got a 12 pack of these on the internet for $24.95 or $2.49 each. Should last a long time. Once you learn the best way to use these they work great. Use 3 wraps, go around the end while pressing together a little and while keeping tension wrap 3 more times around button. Wondering if Butler is stopping making these because the price is going up on the internet and you have to search a little to find a good price. People see the price on Amazon and they charge the same maybe? Got me.</li>
