      <li>So far this is a great product, and I love it.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, and seems moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to be using Skinceuticals Daily Sun Defense Moisturizing Broad-Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 20.</li>
      <li>I have been using the product for 15 yrs , since my 1st skin cancer, best zinc oxide product on the market, especially for rosacea  and sensitive skin sufferers, like myself.</li>
      <li>is exactly what i was looking for!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed lines setting into my face, specifically smile lines and creases in my forehead.</li>
      <li>This is a nice creamy sunscreen and moisturizer that is great for my pale and dry face.</li>
      <li>My face breaks out easily, but this is such a light spf</li>
      <li>Nice for dry skin, some may not like it if skin a bit oilier.</li>
      <li>I have used this sun screen for several years and still love it.</li>
      <li>Have used this product for several years and love it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long but thus far I can say it is a light cream, very easy to rub into the face and neck.</li>
      <li>In the past I haven&#x27;t wanted to do this because my skin breaks out easily and most sunscreens leave a greasy feeling on my skin.</li>
      <li>If I use too much, I do get a sheen later in the day, but it wipes off easily with tissue.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use, is invisible on the skin, and skin doesn&#x27;t turn chalky white.</li>
      <li>It takes my face looks very shinny.  </li>
      <li>After much research I decided to try Skinceuticals&#x27; Retinol O.5.</li>
      <li>Really works well.</li>
      <li>Tried several types of daily moisturing sun protection products and could not find anything better.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Glides nicely on the skin and doesnt leave a white mess on your face.</li>
      <li>It does the job and is not greasy like other products, goes on smooth, does not clogged my pores.  </li>
      <li>I live in the Caribbean where heat and humidity are issues, but the product does not feel greasy on my face after I&#x27;ve been out...</li>
      <li>At best it leaves white sunblock residue in streaks and blotches around my hairline and neck, and in general I look like I have a thin, translucent white mask on my face.</li>
      <li>It works seamlessly under make-up w/out any oily or shininess!  </li>
      <li>apply a small amount in the morning, and it is absorbed right into the skin, is not at all greasy or shiny, and odorless.  </li>
      <li>This alone isn&#x27;t enough to moisturise my face in the winter months when my skin is much drier.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily basis without much sun exposure, and I have had no adverse reactions.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin - oily in the t-zone...</li>
      <li>I am in the sun frequently, and use this every day after cleansing my face.  </li>
      <li>I use Skinceuticals \\&quot;30\\&quot; when I expect to have more sun exposure, but I prefer the consistency of this product (\\&quot;20\\&quot;) under makeup for daily use, since it seems like a moisturizer rather than a sunscreen, it is more thin and less sticky.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I would recommend this product as I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but so far I like it.</li>
      <li>I didnt receive this product in a professional box like the picture displayed but instead I got it simply put in a plastic bag with the same name and tape around it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the Skinceuticals sunscreen but ordered this one in error. I prefer a stronger coverage for our warm Califirnia sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of sunscreens, but this is my favorite. It moisturizes while protecting from harmful effects of the sun.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on your skin and best of all, there is no funky odor.  So many creams have a tropical aroma (usually coconut)which is okay if you&#x27;re in Hawaii, but annoying if you&#x27;re not. This has a \\&quot;just out of the shower\\&quot; kind of \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; fragrance that is nice and clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I decided to start a retinol regimen. I&#x27;m 30 (with combination skin) and I&#x27;ve noticed lines setting into my face, specifically smile lines and creases in my forehead. After much research I decided to try Skinceuticals&#x27; Retinol O.5. I read that retinol leaves the skin dry and vulnerable to sun damage and this product claims to address both of those concerns. I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long but thus far I can say it is a light cream, very easy to rub into the face and neck. It does not have that strong sunblock smell, it&#x27;s scent is very mild and pleasant. I live in the Caribbean where heat and humidity are issues, but the product does not feel greasy on my face after I&#x27;ve been out... there is however some shine after a while (to be expected). Also, a little goes a long way, so you literally just need a pea sized amount to cover your face. I can&#x27;t say I would recommend this product as I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen. Does&#x27;nt leave a white residue. Not greasy</li>
    <li> I have used this product before I purchased it from Amazon, but it is cheaper to buy it here than where I had been buying it. It is a great product. My face breaks out easily, but this is such a light spf it works great under my make up and I also use it as a daily moisturizer. It is not greasy at all. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this sun screen for several years and still love it. I use it alone or under my makeup everyday and it really works well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Glides nicely on the skin and doesnt leave a white mess on your face.</li>
    <li> I didnt receive this product in a professional box like the picture displayed but instead I got it simply put in a plastic bag with the same name and tape around it. Dont know why it felt kinda sticky on my skin and caused tiny red hives and it so itchy all over my face after I used it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for YEARS!!!!  It&#x27;s one of my ab-so-lute favorites!!!  It works seamlessly under make-up w/out any oily or shininess!  Will continue to order in the future!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My dermatologist recommended it because it has the Zcote. I try other kinds occasionally but always go back to this.</li>
    <li> Some sunscreens irritate my skin, but this one does not. Great for everyday use, is invisible on the skin, and skin doesn&#x27;t turn chalky white. Goes on smoothly, and seems moisturizing. Nice for dry skin, some may not like it if skin a bit oilier. Has not caused breakouts on my skin. I use Skinceuticals \\&quot;30\\&quot; when I expect to have more sun exposure, but I prefer the consistency of this product (\\&quot;20\\&quot;) under makeup for daily use, since it seems like a moisturizer rather than a sunscreen, it is more thin and less sticky. A bit pricy so mostly just use on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Tried several types of daily moisturing sun protection products and could not find anything better.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen for my fair skin</li>
    <li> This is a nice creamy sunscreen and moisturizer that is great for my pale and dry face. However, because it is relatively thick, or maybe I am not applying it correctly, but on me the stark white cream doesn&#x27;t fade into my skin after application. At best it leaves white sunblock residue in streaks and blotches around my hairline and neck, and in general I look like I have a thin, translucent white mask on my face. After a few embarrassing episodes I now tend to use it when I need to be outside but am unlikely to see people.</li>
    <li> This Sun creaam is not greasy.  It takes my face looks very shinny.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great line and super product. I use 20spf under my make up with no oily residue for added protection and 30 for going out in the sun on the rest of my body. Really works well.</li>
    <li> The best thing I use for my face!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years and love it. I have sensitive skin - oily in the t-zone...this product moisturizes without leaving my face shiny and does not cause my skin to have break-outs.</li>
    <li> So far this is a great product, and I love it.</li>
    <li> For the money, I expected this sunscreen to out perform my drug store brand, but it did not.  I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily basis without much sun exposure, and I have had no adverse reactions.  I used it on my face, neck and ears this past week while in Phoenix, AZ for a baseball tournament and I got a sunburn!  I consider myself quite knowledgeable about sunscreen, uva/uvb rays, the need to re-apply, etc.  I was not impressed at all and will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Working at a local dermatology office that stopped carrying it due to billing issues, I was distraught! I have been using the product for 15 yrs , since my 1st skin cancer, best zinc oxide product on the market, especially for rosacea  and sensitive skin sufferers, like myself. NO CHEMICALS. blends flawlessly and foundation goes on immediately NO WHITE FILM! I use it 24-7 365.  I immediately ordered 2 on Amazon that day . I ordered for our office 15 yrs ago and it was the only facial sunscreen I could tolerate and stay compliant with all this time. Never had it returned to us!</li>
    <li> Goes on very light and is not greasy.  is exactly what i was looking for!</li>
    <li> This product works great, but is definitely more appropriate for summer. This alone isn&#x27;t enough to moisturise my face in the winter months when my skin is much drier.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Good for your skin. No clogged pores, no breakouts for me! Everyone need sunscreen, so why not use the best?</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and I constantly get compliments on my skin.  This goes on light and isn&#x27;t greasy, and the sun protection is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love how it feels on my face and how it lasts all day.  My husband uses it now, too, and gets anxious when it is getting low.  It provides great sun protection.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am in the sun frequently, and use this every day after cleansing my face.  It does the job and is not greasy like other products, goes on smooth, does not clogged my pores.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Dried my face out. Went on like regular zinc-full sunscreen. Thank God I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this crap.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen for me. I have rosacea, and I needed to start wearing sunscreen everyday. In the past I haven&#x27;t wanted to do this because my skin breaks out easily and most sunscreens leave a greasy feeling on my skin. She gave me several samples to try, and Skinceuticals was the one I liked best (I don&#x27;t remember the other brands). I have been using this product for about six months and have not had any problems with breakouts. If I use too much, I do get a sheen later in the day, but it wipes off easily with tissue. A pea-sized amount is all I need. I do not spend a lot of time outdoors, so the SPF 20 is perfect for me. I have noticed an improvement in the amount of redness on my face and decolletage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to be using Skinceuticals Daily Sun Defense Moisturizing Broad-Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 20. My dermatologist recommended it to me for rosacea. It goes on beautifully, looks natural, and has cleared up my skin so I get many compliments on how great my face looks. Friends have been writing down the name of this product because they want to use it too. Various prescription drugs I had used before either worked a long time and then stopped, or could not be tolerated by my system because of side effects. Skinceuticals Daily Sun Defense is no problem at all, and it&#x27;s the only product my face needs. Thank you for selling it!</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals is the only sun screen I can apply to my face; every single other product (no matter what the price) causes stinging.&lt;br /&gt;I apply a small amount in the morning, and it is absorbed right into the skin, is not at all greasy or shiny, and odorless.  I only use Skinceuticals Sun Defense on my face as it is expensive.</li>
