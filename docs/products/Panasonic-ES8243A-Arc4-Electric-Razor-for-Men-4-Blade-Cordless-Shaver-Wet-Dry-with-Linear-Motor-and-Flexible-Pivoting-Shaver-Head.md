<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Purchased for a friend in a nursing home.  Works as as well as you&#x27;d expect for a high end razor.  I own a less expensive Panasonic model, but this one was half off the $200.00 price.  I think it&#x27;s working out for my friend.</li>
    <li> I had ordered the newer model as a replacement for this one - but it didn&#x27;t do the same job and did provide me a close shave. I ended up placing another order for this shaver and am TOTALLY pleased (except I&#x27;m stuck with the other shaver!).</li>
    <li> This product broke within less than a year.  Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> BF wanted it to shave his head weekly, the reviews seemed great but once he got it and used it, the shave on his head wasnt so good, left a little buzz cut .... it shaves the face nice though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for several months now and I like it very much.  It stays charged for a long while between charges and cuts very well.  The trimmer is excellent and use it to trim stray hairs wherever I need it.  I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> This razor is great until water ruins your button and the LCD.  I have to return mine to the factor for repair..  So it has a defect if you use it for wet shaving often.</li>
    <li> it works. I use it everyday. the only complaint is that I have to spend 10-15 minutes every morning to get a clean shave.  I think the manufacturers need to work on a better product to provide a tool that will do the job in 5 minutes.  This comes down to finding a solution for a blade that can stay sharp or a blade(s) that can be sharpened.  I find myself having to go over an area several times before it completely catches everything.  If you go over an area too much you may run the risk in slightly breaking the skin.</li>
    <li> This razor gives me the closest shave I have ever had, and that includes electric and blade! I really like the convenience of shaving in the shower. I even dropped it on the floor once, and it was not damaged at all. This is the best razor I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it! Painless and super easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I like the design. Very quick and comfortable shave, especially in the neck area.</li>
    <li> Was delivered promptly and exactly as described. I&#x27;m really enjoying having the shaver, works great.</li>
    <li> Best there is. Smooth long lasting shave. Power lasts forever. Easy to clean under tap once a week. Fits my hand, chin and face. A heavy duty shaver.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic was a revelation to my face as it shaves a lot closer than the B***n I was using. It is also faster by far &amp; more comfortable. I was using a B***n before I got this Panasonic. It came with a cleaning device but you had to keep buying their solution to go with it. This is cleaned by using soap/water and holding the switch more than two seconds, nothing else to buy. This Pope loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erik The Pope</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Panasonic ES8243A only once, and I already love it. I&#x27;ve always used electric razors (Remington and Panasonic), rather than conventional blade razors, and this model is the best I&#x27;ve experienced so far. I use the razor on my legs and underarms, and I have medium-coarse hair (rather than coarse, like on a man&#x27;s face). Surprisingly, this Panasonic gave me a smooth-as-silk finish. I had to go over the areas 2-3 times, in order to get it totally smooth. But who cares? I had to do the same thing with all of my electric razors in the past. This razor gave me a painless shave (no tugging or discomfort at all), its head bends side-to-side, as well as front-to-back, which make it easy to conquer my knees and other tough spots. I highly recommend this razor after using it once. I&#x27;ll update this review after more use, if my opinion changes. For now, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> It works well so far- very powerful. I&#x27;ve used it wet, and I have little irritation post-shave. It doesn&#x27;t cut as closely as my DSC razors, but what would? It&#x27;s the best electric I&#x27;ve used so far. I would recommend it to anyone looking to move back to an electric, or upgrade from a cheaper model.</li>
    <li> The shaver works just as good as as the reviews stated! Easy to use ready to clean, stays charged for several uses... I would recommend to buy ...</li>
    <li> This shaver is noisy in comparison with my old Panasonic 8066. Also not as substantial as my old shaver. First issue I encountered was the lack of a travel lock switch - I think the only Panasonic shaver not to have one - which is odd given the shaver comes with a travel pouch. Second issue is my thumb sometimes switches off the shaver when shaving as the switch is close to the thumb rest.&lt;br /&gt;But the shaver does give a good close shave and I&#x27;m happy with it. So a good shaver at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have been using it now for more than 3 months and all I can say is that this is a great product. A while ago I tried one of the most expensive Braun Series...unfortunately had to return it because it was iterating my skin a lot...I decided that I am not using electric shavers from that moment...but 2 years later I decided to give it a try and here we are with my Panasonic shaver pretty happy. Mayve there is only 1 con, when your beard is too long it pulls a little bit of the hair but it happens maybe 2-3 times a shave..</li>
    <li> charges quickly, nice smooth shave.  I haven&#x27;t tried shaving in the shower yet, but I assume this will be fine..</li>
    <li> I bought this because I hate to shave with a regular razor.  I was immediately impressed with the power of this thing.  I have another electric trimmer that I use for trimming my neck or when I let my beard grow for about a week, and it is put to shame by the power of this Panasonic.  I get a very close shave with this razor and it is easy to clean.  It also has a very good battery life.  It typically takes me about 3 minutes to shave with this razor (the display shows you how long you shave), and the battery lasts long enough that I almost forget that it needs charging since it is weeks before I have to re-charge it.  I do not shave every day, but probably every 3-4 days.  I am sold on Panasonic now.  I doubt this thing ever breaks, but if I ever need another one, I will buy another just like it.</li>
    <li> Wishes came true with this shaver, but I wished it were corded too!!!!I for get to plug it in sometimes...</li>
    <li> Update: 09/19/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Am on my second razor since this purchase.  The first razor developed an issue with the led display screen where everything started lighting up.  I contacted Panasonic and had a warrant RMA issued.  You have to pay to ship it to Panasonic and you will be without the razor for about a month.  Anyway, I received the replacement, or repaired, razor from Panasonic and within three months the led display started going crazy again.  Although the razor still works great for shaving, the display is now completely useless to me since it flashes every possible icon when the razor is activated.  I leave my razor in the shower on a shelf, so maybe water has infiltrated both units and caused the display issues.  If that is the case, then this product is not completely waterproof.  Since it still works for the intended purpose, I&#x27;ve just learned to live with the bonked display and simply charge it every Saturday to ensure it is charged.  Others might consider thoroughly drying it off and storing it outside of the shower, but it is too late for that in my case and I don&#x27;t intend to go another month without a razor just to have a working led display again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using various Norelco rotary shavers for more than 25 years and I thought that I was always pleased with them.  They worked decently, but I never felt it was as close a shave as the commercials made them out to be, especially along the neck.  I always found that it would just miss hairs along the front sides and the very middle of the neck.  So, I figured it was time to try a foil shaver, but I wanted one that could be used in the shower as well...unlike all of my old Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did lots of research and read way too many reviews on Amazon as well as blogs and discussion site.  I narrowed it down to two Panasonic shavers and one Braun.  I then eliminated the Braun because of the need for cleaning cartridges.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to purchase things just to clean the shaver.  That left me between this Panasonic and the more expensive ESLA63S.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the size of the head on the ESLA63S, so I decided on this model.  And once Amazon lowered the price and provided a $15 coupon before Father&#x27;s Day, I just had to pull the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It is heavier than any Norelco I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is about twice as loud as any Norelco I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;3) My first attempt was as a dry shaver, and it proved to shave a little bit closer than the Norelcos...especially along my neck.  All of those stray hairs on my neck disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;4) Every subsequent attempt has been as a wet shaver, and this is where this shaver truly shines.  For a week now, I have the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and my face actually feels smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;5)  I&#x27;ve had a new small area of razor burn with each shave thus far, but that is to be expected when switching to a completely different shaving system.  Just upgrading from older Norelco to a newer Norelco usually had the same result for the first week or two and I expect this Panasonic to be the same until my face gets used to the new system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now left wondering why I didn&#x27;t switch sooner.  Great product Panasonic...and great price Amazon.  I just love Prime!gs just to clean the shaver.  That left me between this Panasonic and the more expensive ESLA63S.

    <li> Where this razor excels is using it in the shower. It does an ok job as a dry razor but I can get a razor blade shave without the skin irritation as a wet shaver. I have discovered by going a step further that using a little soap on my face made my razor glide like cats on a smooth surface.</li>
    <li> does a great job, very happy with this purchase. if you are looking for an efficient close shave, this will do it.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again.  This shaver works great in the shower or when used with a pre shave product.</li>
    <li> Close as a blade with no cuts. Even mows down my barbed wire stubble with ease. Easy to use and clean; I highly recommend for those that hate the blade.</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of Electric razors, but this one is great. The best thing I can say is it actually works. I charge it once every few weeks and it is fine for me. It works around my goatee with no issue at all (I worried it would be too bulky). I mostly use it to shave dry and I have not had any burns or irritations. I strongly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Great product and I highly recommend this to any one.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered this product, I read several of the reviews on Amazon for this product.   I must admit, when I read people raving about products, I am usually a little skeptical.     Well, the razor arrived and I read the instruction and charged it. So far, so good.    The next morning I used it to shave for the first time. What an amazing result! I could not believe how close the shave was!  Plus the discomfort I had felt with my previous razor was gone.     The next shave was better still; less time, closer and more comfortable.    Now a month later and the results are even better.   Using the razor wet gives me the very best result plus the bonus that I can clean it every time.    Overall this is the best electric razor I have ever owned and almost as good as the best non-electric.     Just buy one, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be an awesome shaver after reading all the reviews.  However, it doesn&#x27;t shave all that close on my neck even after four weeks of use.  Also, it tends to smell as if it&#x27;s burning. I think it&#x27;s just the fast action of the blades though.  I would probably look else where  for my next shaver.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m a sceptic, so when I saw all the rave reviews of this shaver on here, I thought, \\&quot;Oh, it couldn&#x27;t be that good.\\&quot; Well, it is! I&#x27;ve owned Braun electric shavers previously, which I thought were the Audis or Mercedes of the electric shaver world. The Panasonic ES 8243A Arc IV (long and dumb name, by the way!) is just amazing. I&#x27;ve owned it for 7 weeks now. It took a few weeks to get used to it, as reported on here. I have to say, that I&#x27;ve never been able to get as close a shave as I do with this shaver. It rivals a straight-blade shave, truly. Following the reviews on here, I started out using it in the shower, as a wet shaver. But, now, I don&#x27;t bother with that and find I get an equally close shave prior to taking a shower. Either way, this shaver is just perfection and so easy to clean-up, too. Thank you, Panasonic, for truly designing and making a shaver that lives up to its hype.</li>
    <li> I am 31 years old. This is my first shaver. It meets my expectations in every area. It shaves very good and,fast and does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for a Braun - wish I&#x27;d never wasted $ on the Braun.  This one is quieter, more comfortable &amp; shaves better.</li>
    <li> The Winner Is...    The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely. Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World&#x27;s best electric shaver. The Remington shaved a little closer than the Panasonic and provided a faster shave. However, the difficulty in cleaning, noise and lack of a charging base tipped me to the Panasonic as the final choice.    This is a review of three Panasonic models; ES8243A (4-blade), ES8109S (3-blade) and ES7109, the Remington MS2-390, the Norelco 8260 CC and the Braun Series 5 8995 (8985 &amp; 8975 only differ in displays and cleaning). I have an average beard and have been using electric shavers (foils and rotaries) over 30 years. The models here are no better than any of the other higher quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned. It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave. This means recharging every 4-5 days. Gels/oils do make the process easier - not faster - and I have reviewed six of them on their Amazon sites.    ES8109S: This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work. It does give off a higher pitch &#x60;whine&#x27;, while shaving, that is somewhat annoying, but is not what I would consider noisy. Nor is the cleaning operation noisy. Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design slows shaving (see discussion, below).    ES8243A: I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave. As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face. It makes cutting in the areas where you don&#x27;t have a lot of skin area (chin, jaw line, upper lip, base of sideburns, etc) more difficult. In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design makes it even slower (see discussion, below). Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you&#x27;ll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced. What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil? All in all: the ES8243A 4-blade is a poor value.    ES7109S: The flat design of the foil is a better design than the \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; (see below). Unfortunately, this shaver has an under-powered motor and the floating head that cannot be locked.    Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago. My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new \\&quot;NANO Technology\\&quot;- a misnomer (marketing gimmick). I think the reason is that Panasonic&#x27;s older models came with cutting blades with the individual blades having been about half the width of all of Panasonic&#x27;s newer cutting blades (including replacements). This means more surface area on the newer blades and that means less cutting. Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so. Additionally, these new Panasonic \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area. Unfortunately, Panasonic puts their better motor (13,000 RPMs) only on these ill-conceived \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; designs. Battery time on the Panasonics is the shortest of all shavers reviewed here. The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt. You will have to re-position the trimmer to get what you missed. This increases the probability that you will get an uneven sideburn.    The Remington MS2-390 has the blades that thePanasonics should have (and did have years ago): flat foil area (not \\&quot;Arc Foiled\\&quot;), good length (25% longer) and ultra thin cutting blades. As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter. This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles. Using a pre-shave oil/gel will gum up the blades, as with any shaver, but these blades pop off with even the slightest brushing so be prepared to watch them fall into the sink with every cleaning attempt. A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver. Remington did a poor job with the details.    The Braun Series 5 8995 tries hard (you can hear noticeable slowing when necessary pressure is applied, like a lawn mower when it reaches thicker grass), but it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as the Panasonics or Remington without leaving a stronger burning sensation after the shave. The Braun can also leave burn marks and even cuts (nose and lips) that will bleed. Odd: you would think that, with it getting so close as to actually burn the skin, it would also give a closer shave. I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot \\&quot;lift\\&quot; hairs to cut better. Additionally, the design of the handle is inferior, making positioning more difficult. It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.    The Norelco 8260 CC: I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80&#x27;s. I switched to foil and found I could get a closer shave. This is still the case. Additionally, because of the circular blades, it is somewhat difficult to target certain spots for cleanup. However, this is the quietest shaver.    PS: don&#x27;t accept the nonsense about giving your face 30 days to adjust, unless you are coming off a blade. If you are accustomed to an electric shaver, you only need a week or two to determine the difference. The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!</li>
    <li> I am a repeat Panasonis customer who knows how quick and close their shavers cut. Unfortunately the last model I owned had a defective battery and no replacement batteries could be found. I hope this problem has been resolved by the manufactture or this will be my last shaver by Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Lets start by saying I hate shaving... My \\&quot;beard\\&quot; is more like a bunch of miscellaneous fuzz and hair that grows at weird angles than anything else. I was using a Mach 3 and the blades lasted for a couple shaves, I cut myself all the time, and my skin was always red and irritated later. Lots of people suggested this cream that lotion and who knows what else. Nothing I tried helped much besides shelling out $$$$$ for fresh blades.    Enter the ES8243A.... I read a lot of the reviews here, and as reluctant as I was to spend so much on a shaver, I pushed the button and soon an amazon box showed up at the door.    Well, what can I say... I&#x27;m a believer. It&#x27;s worth the $, it really is that good. First time I tried it there was a definite improvement in the irritation department. I decided it was a keeper, and I would also see if there was an improvement over time as the card in the box suggests there will be. I wouldn&#x27;t call it dramatic, but after a few weeks it seems that has gotten easier/quicker to shave with it. Part of it might just be getting used to which angle works best on each part of your face, but it does seem to be able to cut closer now.    -----------------------  Some other things I&#x27;ll mention:    I don&#x27;t mind having to clean it, portability was a main concern for me and I did not want to be tied down to a base station. If you always stay at home and are in a rush I suppose the version with the cleaning station is nice, but you will be buying cartridges for that as well.    Cost wise, the ridiculous pricing and short life of standard razor blades means you will not be spending as much on this as you think you are. I&#x27;m not sure how long the foils will last yet, but so far it works like the day I got it.    One of my favorite things is the consistency. With a standard razor, you put on a new blade and it&#x27;s just straight downhill from there. Every day the shave gets worse until you can&#x27;t take it anymore and replace it. With the Panasonic, its the same everytime.    Battery charges fast and lasts a long time. I tend to plug it in around 50% and it&#x27;s usually done by the time I take a shower and get dressed.</li>
    <li> If you are not use to using an electric razor and have  light to normal facial hair, I would not recommend an electric razor at all. You must go over the same spot many times, tolerate a constant pulling feeling and be left with many hairs that have laid down and have hidden from the blades. It might be a good electric razor but not good if you are looking to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> had this for a while now I do not like it you have to go over face a lot to get all hair on your face.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this product.  He says it gives a close shave without irritation.  He would recommend it to future customers.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever owned.  It shaves as close as a blade when used wet and with shave lotion -- I used superslick by billy jealousy.</li>
    <li> I wanted something waterproof, and it was sharp as heck the 1st 2 weeks but then got a little dull. For the price its ok, Ive had it for maybe 3 months now.  The display is a little off but maybe thats because i was charging it overseas. Not amazing but worth it for a cool shaver/ with display that  is water proof.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES8243A is the best shaver I have ever used!!!  Have used this shaver since October 2009. I have a heavy beard (shave twice a day)and have used electric shavers for 50 years (Remington, Norelco, Braun, Pansonic, you name it).  The ES8243A is quiet, comfortable, a fast charge, easy to use, easy to clean and gives a fast, smooth, close shave with no burns or chaffing. No hassle purchase through Amazon at a great price and with fast \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shipping. I no longer dread shaving...and I don&#x27;t have to use a \\&quot;blade\\&quot; to follow up my electric shave. Highly, highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I was using a Norelco shaver with 3 heads for about 8 years. I started to develop severe irritation on my face and that&#x27;s when I realized it was time for a new shaver. Since I shave pretty much every day, I figured a shaver is a good item to invest a little money in so i purchased this one. I also liked the fact that I could shave wet because I wanted to in order to eliminate the irritation my face had from the Norelco dry process. So I purchased this and some [[ASIN:B00005U8WT Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream - 5.1 fl oz]] and although it didn&#x27;t help at first, it ended up not only completely clearing my skin, but I also get a much better shave.    The bottom-line difference is that this product&#x27;s motor is much stronger than the Norelco and therefore it does not slow down when it is shaving longer hair or hits a thick patch. It&#x27;s quite amazing to watch this thing shave a thick beard without even slowing at all actually.    My only complaint is that I seem to get cut more by this thing but that may be a technique thing and something I need to get used to. It&#x27;s probably just because the shaver is so much stronger.</li>
    <li> Works about as good as any other razor I&#x27;ve had... but like all the other ones, it takes about 30 strokes to get all the small hairs on the neck.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m a Jew with curly hair and have had problems with ingrown hairs on my neck ever since I started shaving. Regular razors caused me to get them all the time. So, I switched to this product called Bump Patrol, which is made specifically to prevent ingrown hairs. That didn&#x27;t help. I struggled through that for a couple years, eventually deciding to just maintain a five-o&#x27;clock shadow.     Now, I have a job and have to shave daily. That is where this comes in. I started using it a few weeks ago, and I am yet to get an ingrown hair on my neck. It&#x27;s a miracle. While the shave isn&#x27;t as close as it could be on the neck, I can deal with it. I&#x27;d rather have a not-too-close shave than unsightly ingrown hairs.    I can&#x27;t attest as to whether this electric razor is better than other razors in this regard, but I can say that it gets the job done for me.    Finally, cleaning this thing has been very easy. Just detach the foil and run it under water with a little bit of soap. Voila. As this is so easy, I would recommend this over any self-cleaning razor. Self-cleaning seems like a gimmick and a way for the manufacturer to continue to make money off you after you buy the razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about five months now. It gives me a smooth shave and requires no real upkeep. I think I&#x27;ve had to recharge it only twice. I keep the plastic guard on the top when it&#x27;s not in use; haven&#x27;t had problems with the top getting dented (even though I travel with it).</li>
    <li> This is the best and closest shaver I have ever bought.  I face never needed to adjust to the shaver.  It shave smoothly and cleanly from the get go.  I love this shaver and highly recommend it!  I used to think rotary shavers were nice until I tried this foil shaver.  This foil shaver is MUCH better than anything else!</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve bought in 8 years.  My previous shaver was a Braun which I really liked, but I certainly am glad I switched to Panasonic this time.  I haven&#x27;t tried using this shaver with shaving cream - as it recommends - but even still as a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shaver it shaves very close.    I like this shaver a lot (and Amazon has it for a very fair price).</li>
    <li> Great shaver much better than the Braun it replaced.  Very close baby face shave. The shaver holds its charge very well.  It also very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> There are a ton of reviews already for this shaver so I&#x27;ll just say that it shaves my medium-heavy beard and semi-sensitive skin (that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t use a bladed razor) very comfortably. But nearly $50 for replacement blades and foil is insane. And yet, I buy them. Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find any razor that shaves me as comfortably so I keep coming back. My friends who buy razor blades also complain about the expense but I&#x27;ve not done a price comparison because I&#x27;ll never shave with a razor blade, so why bother? If the zombie apocalypse hits and the power goes out because the utility workers are lurching about looking for tasty brains, then I&#x27;ll just grow a beard.&lt;br /&gt;I was about due to buy the $50 extortion package for my old shaver when Amazon offered a Black Friday deal, my shaver for $79.99 and Prime shipping. I grabbed one since that means I just got the extortion package and they threw a new shaver in for only $30! Sometimes things just work out right. It worked out just fine for Amazon, too. I did spend more money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this specific shaver for 3 months and it hasn&#x27;t been doing the job. It doesn&#x27;t reach certain areas on my face or neck and i have to divert back to a manual razor blade to finish the job. My first use of this shaver it did a good job on the spots it worked on, now after 3 months it has been starting to nick and cut my face. My assumption is the shape of this shaver doesn&#x27;t coincide with my face personally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for many years.  Started with numerous Braun models and have been using a couple of different Remington models for the past 8-9 years.  Bought this Panasonic after trying my son&#x27;s.  This shaver gives me the best, most comfortable shave of any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  Cleans up quickly with a dab of soft soap and hot water.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After spending $20 - $200 on electric shavers over the past several years, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I am not one for writing reviews, but feel compelled to do so in this case. I bought this razor approximately 4 weeks ago and am absolutely thrilled by the results I have achieved! I have owned many electric razors over the years: Norelco, Remington, and, most recently, Brauns. But the Panasonic ES8243A (ARC IV) is far and away the best I&#x27;ve ever used!       After charging it for the first time, I wanted to try a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave. So, I found an old can of shaving cream and \\&quot;lathered up.\\&quot; All I can say is, WOW! The shave was great and closer than any I had achieved with an electric and quite comparable to a regular razor. I used regular and gel shave creams in my experiments and the shaver worked well with both. I have since used it primarily as a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shaver and experienced similar results: very smooth and almost effortless. The thing I hated about both of my Braun shavers was that I had to make multiple passes over the same areas to achieve \\&quot;passable\\&quot; results. With the Panasonic, I make fewer passes and get a closer shave; even in those difficult areas. I do have to press a little harder than I&#x27;m used to, but have not had any problems with razor burn at all (can&#x27;t say the same for my Brauns - press too hard and lots of irritation). Whether you&#x27;re shaving wet or dry, clean up is easy and can be done in about a minute.       My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that it does not come with a travel case. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker, but would be nice to keep the razor and charger together when traveling. All-in-all, I have nothing but praise for the Panasonic ARC IV (ES8243A) and have no problem recommending it highly.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shave and battery lasts weeks without charging.</li>
    <li> Previously used a Braun 7000 series.  Had it own cleaning system for which you had to continue buying expensive cartridges.  The Panasonic gives a better, closer shave and you just rinse it off!</li>
    <li> The only electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned that could cut a week old beard without tearing the whiskers out of my face.  Very comfortable to use and easy to clean.  Have been useing for over a month with no problems.</li>
    <li> In the past I have bought Norelco razors, and when my last one gave out I thought that I would give Panasonic a try.  I read a lot of positive reviews for this razor and have always had good luck with Panasonic products.  I am very happy with the performance of the razor.  I have a fairly tough beard and like other razors, you still have to go over more than once and hit it from different directions, but it does a good job.  I do like the ability to clean the razor with water and a charge lasts me about 6 shaves.  It is a little loud, but overall I Tam very pleased with the product and I have had it for over 3 months.</li>
    <li> I placed an order for this supposed \\&quot;fabulous\\&quot; Panasonic ES8243A with nano technology last November, so nowadays I have been using this shaver for about 30 days. I have a 10 year experience using rechargeable shavers, specifically Philips-Noreclo rotary system.    First of all, my beard is very light, so for any rechargeable shaver cutting and shaving is really easy.    Particularly, I don´t understand how in earth this model has obtained the best qualifications in such important magazines as Consumers Reports.   In my opinion, shaving with this Panasonic is about average, is very difficult to shave in the areas surrounding your neck and nearby the Adam´s Apple, I must finish cutting some damn hairs with my ancient rotary Philips shaver. Shaving in other parts of the face such as cheeks,chin,and mustache is quick and comfortable.     PROS:    1) Very light structure, nice to handle.  2) Good looking color,very nice shaver.    3) Very close &amp; smooth shave only at the face.   4) Easy clean up, pop the shaver heads &amp; rinse under water and soap.  5) Charges fast. Cool digital readouts for charging status &amp; battery.   6) Can use it in the shower.   7) Can use dry or with shaving cream / gel.   8) Made In Japan, a rare thing to see nowadays.                    CONS:    1) Not quite the perfect shave Panasonic is proud to announce compared with other brands such as Philips and Braun  2) Very big cutting heads, difficult to move around face´s contour and curves.    3) Battery life is short (5 days average use)  4) Can cause some irritation  5) Loud noise  6) Low cutting effect in the neck    In resume I prefer the efficient rotary system patented about 30 years ago by Philips, for me this system is smoother, quieter and faster. Don´t loose your money, buy directly the new Philips - Norelco models offer here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used a Braun foil-type shaver and a Philips/Norelco rotary shaver (which Continental Airlines was recently so kind as to lose for me). Of all the ones I&#x27;ve used, my new Panasonic is the first one that actually does a good job on my neck, and doesn&#x27;t leave patches that simply refuse to be shaved.     It&#x27;s also fast -- I find that to get a really good shave I have to make two passes (which takes under five minutes, all told) but even a single pass is still respectable: no patches, just a not-quite-perfectly-smooth shave. Cleaning is also a million times easier than the rotary kind, and there&#x27;s no need to spend money on the \\&quot;cleaning station\\&quot; version -- just clean with water, and maybe rubbing alcohol from time to time.    So really, the other reviews aren&#x27;t making things up. This shaver works nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift.  He gave it back to me.  All he said was that it did not work.  He didn&#x27;t have time to go into the details so I can&#x27;t offer specifics.</li>
    <li> I have only used the item a few days, it shaves much better than the 4 electric razors  I&#x27;ve used. It has a battery charge indicator level,and a nice contoured black pouch.  Its quite and does well on the neck that has always been a hard spot for other units to shave. I won&#x27;t be using a razor much anymore, unless I have a date? I&#x27;m lovin it. I will even shave my 5:00 shadow.</li>
    <li> I have used Bruan shavers for over 10 years, but have recently been disappointed with the results. Why buy an expensive shaver if you have to finish the job with a Gilette Track 2?&lt;br /&gt;After using this Panasonic shaver for only a few days, I am getting the best shave I have ever got -- even better than with shaving cream and a striaght razor. Plus this unit is made &amp; designed so well, it&#x27;s a joy to use. The Braun&#x27;s are going onto Freecycle today.....</li>
    <li> I will start off by saying that I tried an electric razor when I first started shaving in high school.  That lasted for about a week and I haven&#x27;t touched one until I bought this.  I am now in my 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;This razor does shave very close.  Before this I used a Mach 3 and it shaves just as close as that one does.  It is very easy to use the functionality of the razor, as well as clean it.  The display is just fine as it will tell you the percentage of battery left (just percent, not time left) as well as the amount of time that your current shave was, and whether or not you should clean the razor or plug it in.  The plug it in notification seems pretty pointless to me considering it tells you how much juice you have left in the battery too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Like I said in the good, it gives me a good shave.  That is, where it works.  I don&#x27;t know if it is my skin, or the shape of my face or what, but I just can&#x27;t seem to have it shave close everywhere.  There are always patches of stray hairs that are left.  The head of the razor is really large.  This causes you to be very precise if you have a beard/goatee/mustache, etc.  It is hard to get it exactly right as your vision is blocked.  It does have the trimmer, but that won&#x27;t quite do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is not as advertised!  I think it said something like 14, 3-minute shaves on one battery charge.  I spend anywhere from 3-5 minutes each shave and I get maybe 5 shaves out of it (that is on a lucky charge).  That being said, it charges very fast, and its not a big deal seeing that I always have an outlet nearby when using it (and if I didn&#x27;t, I think the 4-5 shaves would hold me over until I could get to an outlet).  Just don&#x27;t take this on a month long camping trip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find this to be an okay razor.  It doesn&#x27;t completely turn me off to electric razors again (as the one I used when I was younger did).  The biggest overall downside for me was the size of the head.  Sure, it might seem to give you a faster shave because you are covering more area, but next time, I will try to find something a bit smaller.to give you a faster shave because you are covering more area, but next time, I will try to find something a bit smaller.</li>
    <li> Very cool looking razor, but didn&#x27;t shave worth a dime. Wet/dry function worked as expected, but didn&#x27;t shave worth a dime. Battery display and cleaning notifier worked great but... did I mention it didn&#x27;t shave worth a dime?! I wanted to love this razor, but the $60 norelco that gave out prior to me buying this one at more than double the price was WAY better than this hunk of junk. My fiancee continually asked if I had shaved and/or pointed out many, many missed hairs when I used this razor. I really gave it a shot folks... Used it for 3 months, thinking it&#x27;s gotta get better soon. Nope! ...And dull or poorly set blades weren&#x27;t the problem as this thing nicked me up pretty well a number of times when I was pressing very hard, which is a whole different story. The short of it is,as my title simply says, this thing sucked... For me that is. I recognize that this may not be the case for everyone. I bought this thing after reading all of the great reviews, so I was completely shocked it was just this bad. To give a little more detail, there may be some other factors to consider before deciding, to buy or not to buy. It didn&#x27;t work for me, so here are a few variables to consider about my situation: 1) I&#x27;m black and probably have softer than normal facial hair  2) I&#x27;m not very hairy at all  3) I only used this shaver as a wet shaver with shaving gel or foam  4) I only shaved with it while in a hot shower    While I don&#x27;t see why any of these things would make a bit of difference, perhaps they do. I don&#x27;t make a fuss about things too often, but when you pay this much money for something and it&#x27;s completely ineffective at it&#x27;s sole purpose, it kinda ruffles your feathers. I&#x27;ll be buying the newest norleco which is equally as expensive and is also receiving great reviews. I&#x27;ll let you know about that one in a couple of months.     I also want to note that I gave this razor to friend, so I&#x27;ll be sure to update this with his comments in the near future.</li>
    <li> or the normal person this the nicest electric razor for the money,i normaly would have bought the norelco tripple header but even those are not what there cracked-up to be.</li>
    <li> This is, without a doubt, the most comfortable electric shaver I have ever owned.  Have a problem with getting the hair on your neck shaved cleanly?  This will take care of it.  Tired of spending ten minutes going over and over your face trying to get a close shave?  This shaver will get you face smooth, no problem.  Clean up by rinsing in hot water.  A charge is good for two weeks depending on how long it takes to shave your face every day.</li>
    <li> I have been through a number of expensive shavers over the past few years from various makers.  This Panasonic unit is my favorite to date.  Easy to use and clean.  Close shave dry, and slightly better wet.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and this shaver has never once irritated me.  I was concerned that the straight foil might not conform to the contours of my face as well as the trio of rotary cutters found on some other types, but I was wrong.  This one is great, and far less expensive than similarly-design Braun models.  Bottom line: go for it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research (over several months) before deciding on a Panasonic.  I bought this model thinking it had all the features I was looking for.  I have a thin beard and don&#x27;t want to use a rotary style shaver.  I have to say I was disappointed right out of the box.  Nothing about this razor is quality.  All the plastic that makes up the head of the razor is so thin and flimsy it felt like something you might buy from a dollar store. Even the base felt like cheap plastic.  I wonder what would happen if this ever fell to the floor. I charged it over night and tried it the next day.  Again not liking the feel of all the thin plastic but, if it gave a good shave maybe I could over look it.  Well it didn&#x27;t offer any better shave than my 2003 model Braun with 2 blades. And it pulled at my beard like I would expect from a rotary. It was as if it was plucking hairs from my face.  At that point I knew this was going back. I cleaned it and packed it up the next day and sent it back to Amazon.  I&#x27;ll never buy another Panasonic razor.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried about spending this much a a shaver, but i gave it a try anyways.&lt;br /&gt;For a bit of background, i have used Norelco, and Braum for a long time. I picked up a Bruam a few months ago, and it was terrible, so i got this one. After one shave i can alreday say this is leaps and bounds better then any shaver i have used in the past 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is nice and close, did not mess up my skin at all, and it was quick. One or two time over the same area, and boom done.&lt;br /&gt;worth every peny.</li>
    <li> I had heard that this was a good shaver for sensitive skin, and for my skin, it works very well and without irritation. I like the easy cleaning and the shaver even handles the longer hairs on my neck that with my former shaver I would have had to switch to the trimmer when I encountered them and then follow-up by shaving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a four star rating instead of a five star because it&#x27;s louder than I expected (bothersome, but not a deal breaker for me), and I wish that I didn&#x27;t see any signs of dark hair beneath the skin when I was done (my skin feels very smooth, but I still can see what looks like light 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in places), but it may be unrealistic to expect an electric shaver to pull the hair up and shave it so that it snaps back and cannot be seen afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update September 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with this razor and my father now owns one after I told him about my experience.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but feel compelled to share my experience.  I have been shaving with the most modern Gillette and Schick razors for 42 years.  I decided to buy this Panasonic to keep at the office for a touch-up dry shave prior to evening events.  I liked the Panasonic so much I brought it home and have used it every morning in a wet shave for the past two weeks.  It takes me 3 minutes and 15 seconds for a wet shave - about the same time with a razor.  I am amazed that my results are better than a razor!  When pressing the Panasonic harder it easily removes stubborn hairs in dimples and at the base of my neck.  Best of all, no more nicks and cuts.  I can throw away my styptic pencil.  If I had previously known this type of quality shave was available with an electric, I would have switched sooner.      Tip:  My dermatologist suggested that I not use regular soap on my face; instead, he suggested Clearasil Daily Face Wash.  It is more expensive than regular soap but does a great job - not gritty.  I shave looking into a mirror over the sink.  I first wash my face with my hands and lathered Clearasil.  Instead of using shaving creams or gels I shave with the wet Clearasil still on my face.  If I feel the Panasonic needs rinsing I simply rinse the heads under running water and return to shaving.  Result: clean face, very close shave, and save expenses of shaving gels and styptic pencil.  Works well for me.    Hope my experience is good for you.  I highly recommend this Panasonic electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I tried many types of shavers. MANY! i finally did some research and found this to be the perfect shaver so i bought it. this is the third shave and believe me, this is the best shaver i&#x27;ve ever used. delivers smooth quick shaves. no red damaged skin. and its washable!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and he LOVES it!!  He hasn&#x27;t had to use a straight razor since.  It definitely does what it promises.  I have used it on my legs as well.... and it is terrific!</li>
    <li> After 40 years of using Norelco rotary shavers, a coworker recommended a foil as much closer. When my last Norelco started to die, I bought the Panasonic foil. It shaves much closer and with less irritation on my neck. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and the only source of annoyance is the stuble that will drop onto the sink and counter. The shaver will tell you when to clean it, but I&#x27;ve found it takes too long to do so. Otherwise, it has the usual bells and whistles, if you care about that stuff. The bottom line is its a better shaver.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun, but it was old.  I assumed that I would replace it w/ another Braun.  But after doing some research, I went w/ the Panasonic ES8243A.  As you probably know by now, it is a wet or dry shaver.  However, the closeness and quality of the shave is better when wet and w/ shaving cream.  Other positives would be comfort in hand and its long lasting charge w/ display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives for this shaver would be lack of a self cleaning unit.  However, I am so impressed w/ this shaver that I don&#x27;t care and still give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun never ever was this good.  I feel that Panasonic has done an injustice to all by not promoting their shavers more.  With a product this good, they should dominate the electric shaver market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (07/05/2014):  Love this shaver even more.  It continues to provide an excellent shave, it cleans up very nicely, and it is reliable.  I replace the foil and blades as routine maintenance every 18 months or so.  I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> It shaves closer than the Braun I had before. It also shaves fast.  The only knock against it is how the clipper on it is flimsy and ineffective.  I have a beard trimmer to handle what the clipper won&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am a bit biased when it comes to electric razors. Partly because I have extremely sensitive skin plus a very heavy beard and partly because of some terrible experiences with electric razors in the past. I tried Remington one time and it tore my up my skin. I tried Braun and my face and skin loved it, but my wallet couldn&#x27;t afford it. So I trust Panasonic, went for their pitch and shelled out the money for this mid-range razor. Well, it did not disappoint. Perhaps the Braun was a little bit better of a shave, but the Panasonic is more than up to the task. I especially love the linear motor – which as I understand it, keeps the blades moving at the same speed even though the battery may be low. This cuts down on pulling your whiskers and otherwise irritating you skin. It is completely submersible so using it in the shower is just fine. I use mine dry and use the Shave Stick Powder by Remington. I know other reviewers have said nothing beats a wet razor shave, but I have to say this Panasonic shaves me just as close as a blade and shave cream. Cleaning is a snap since all you do is put a drop of liquid soap on it and run it under running water. It takes me about six minutes to shave and that uses about 20% of the battery. So that would give me five days of shaves. Not too bad, not spectacular, but like I said I have a very tough beard to plow through. Watch your prices on Amazon, I have seen the price fluctuate 30% or more in just one day. I believe in Amazon and prefer to purchase through them, but not if it’s going to cost me $20+ more. The only con I can think of with this razor is it does not have the induction recharging that they had on earlier models. Not only was it cool but you didn’t have to worry about sticking a live electrical wire into a potentially went charging receptacle. Overall this razor rates 5-stars (probably more if I could give it). It does what it is supposed to do, it does it well and it is worth what I paid for it. I will always chose Panasonic in the future based on this and other Panasonic product. Please remember this is just one person’s opinion. If you buy the Panasonic ES8243A razor, I hope you have as delightful a shaving experience as I did!onic in the future based on this and other Panasonic product.

    <li> I tried several different methods using this shaver.  Electric Shave and Gel, but by far the best method was to use it in the shower.  I received the best shave I ever received from an electric shaver.  With no irritation.</li>
    <li> I could not be more satisfied with this experience...the shaver came in the mail in a much shorter time than I expected.  The shaver is, without a doubt, the best one I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit 9 months ago and intended to write a positive review all along. But, 3 days ago, it started acting up on me. The display shows all 8:88 for time and lights up all indicators solid. If I put it on the charger, it seems to reset and work properly after it reaches 100% charge. After the 1st shave, it displays correctly, but goes wonky again after the 2nd shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until this malfunction, I have been happy with the unit overall. I previously only used Phillips/Norelco models with the 3 circular blades and only the wet/dry models priced under $100. These were previously the only ones that didn&#x27;t make my neck red after use. I decided to try this Panasonic model after reading reviews that led me to believe it might be a faster, closer shave than with my previous Phillips/Norelco models without causing me discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was right, for the most part. I found my shaving time was cut nearly in half and the shave seemed to be closer. It did, however, make my neck red if I wasn&#x27;t careful to keep plenty of shaving gel on my neck. But, it didn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable when it happened and was back to normal within about 20 minutes. Also, it did actually cut me a few times when I went over the Adams apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I have is it is rather noisy. Much louder than the Phillips/Norelco models, which you can barely hear. It&#x27;s loud enough that if my wife is watching TV in the master bedroom, she has to bump the volume a little when I start shaving in the master bath. That is, unless I close the door. It would also wake her if I were to use it with the door open. The noise alone almost caused me to return it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t is because the noise didn&#x27;t disrupt anything for me. If I normally wanted to carry on a conversation with my wife in the mornings while getting ready for work...or if I often shaved while she was asleep, this would be a no-go. However, bear in mind that my wife and I have pretty sensitive ears. Also, our shower is tile and glass, so it&#x27;s like an echo chamber in there. I&#x27;m sure that makes the sound more annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I still think it&#x27;s the best you can get in the price range. Mine may have malfunctioned due to being used daily in the shower and being taken on several trips. I&#x27;m just tired of the noise by now, so I was thinking about replacing it anyway...so, since it&#x27;s acting up on me, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and replace it with an upper-end Phillips/Norelco wet/dry model. I know it will be quieter and with the higher-end blade setup, it might also be a faster, closer shave than the cheaper models. We&#x27;ll see...ur shower is tile and glass, so it&#x27;s like an echo chamber in there.

    <li> This shaver replaces a Braun 8595. Not sure if maybe the Braun was just old (I bought it in 2006, although I maintained it pretty good with new blades and foils) but this Panasonic beats the pants off it. Very close shave. Only been using it for a couple weeks so I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco rotaries my entire life, and was ready for a change.  Overall I&#x27;ve been very happy with this purchase.  I get a very close shave with minimal effort -- except for my neck, which the rotary might have done a little better.   For the rest of my face, this is easily the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.    Battery life has been great so far, and I love that I can rinse it off under the sink.    Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Hey, this really is a great shaver.  I have been using razors for 35 yrs. (since I was 14).  And I really liked the closeness of the Gillette Pro-Glide that I had been using.  I like a very close shave and have tried electric shavers from time to time but I have never been satisfied with the results.  I also like a comfortable shave and electric shavers that I have used in the past always made me feel like I was sticking my face in a blender or at best rubbing my cheeks against an electric sander...no thanks.    Well I guess I am changing to become more like my dad...razors are getting ridiculously overpriced and I have come to the conclusion that I would rather stick my face in a blender or rub my cheeks up against an electric sander than have to pay $18-$20 every month for razors.   So I started reading all these reviews and comparing all my possibilities and options.  I was searching for a shaver that would be quick and easy to use and care for, and also a shaver that could give me a close and comfortable shave. I had pretty much resigned myself to the fact that the words \\&quot;close\\&quot; and \\&quot;comfortable\\&quot; would never fit into the same sentence with electric shaver.  So I was prepared to go to work each day with razor burns and patches of 5-o&#x27;clock shadow somewhere on my beautiful mug...oh well secretaries would just have to get used to the new me!  Boy was I surprised!  I love this shaver!  It is very quick -- it even lets you know how long it takes you to shave.  This is a neat feature for guys like me who are always trying to beat their best time...first shave took about 6 minutes, now I am down to 2 and 1/2 minutes.  The only reason it takes me that long is because I like to \\&quot;message\\&quot; my face for a while each morning -- feels great! Also it shaves very close...my face feels smoother than silicone on a baby&#x27;s bottom.    My wife is also impressed (trust me..that&#x27;s saying alot), she calls me her gorilla-man, I usually have a 5-o&#x27;clock shadow by noon.  So for this shaverto do all this is amazing...at least it works for me!   Sorry for such a long review, but hopefully this will help someone trying to decide.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette Fusions and double edge razors (with Feathers blades)for over 30 years. I was tired of rush shaving in the mornings as I shower and constantly nicking myself. A couple of months ago I decided to try an electric shaver for the first time. It was a Philips Norelco 7810. Man was I disappointed. The shave was very poor and the unit just seemed very weak and was irritant. Recently I had read many of the glowing reviews on the Panasonic ES8243A and as doubtful as I was I finally caved in and bought it. All I can say is WOW!!! This shaver not only has a lot of ooomph to it while shaving, but it actually shaves my face as close as the Fusion. The shave is very, very close and super smooth even in clefts that I was always hesitant to attempt with the fusion razor. It is absolutely remarkable. I just wish I had bought it sooner. It is very easy to clean using only ordinary soft soap and tap water; it charges very quickly, shaves absolutely great in the shower, and is very nicely put together. Every now and then a product comes out that lives up to it&#x27;s hype (reviews). This is one of those products!</li>
    <li> Light and shaves better than Braun Synchro. Quiet.  Head slightly wide. Grab it when it is  deal of the day.</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV, this is the first foil shaver I have owned usally go fot the revolving head shaver.Let me tell you I have purchased my last revolving head shaver , this shaver beats all the other ones hands down. What a great shave!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine strongly advised me to buy the Braun so I went online here and read all the reviews and that lead me to the Panasonic.  I have owned numerous Panasonic electronics over the years without any disappointments and this new razor is another notch on the ladder.  I have used it every day this week and I just love it.  It takes less than have the time to use this opposed to a razor and my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated and I don&#x27;t cut myself for a change!</li>
    <li> Gives a close shave and does not hurt (especially if shaving after a few days of growth). The sideburn trimmer actually works!</li>
    <li> Wet or Dry this Panasonic is state of the art. No one need look anywhere else for shaving perfection from their electric razor.  It delivers a close shave, it almost cleans itself it is so easy and the recharge time is as claimed.  Nothing better at twice this price.  ENJOY.</li>
    <li> This is the best electricI shaver I have owned. Wanted to wait before posting review.I have owned this for more than a year . I have not replaced the blades yet because the ones that came with it are still cutting excellant. The battery life is great I go about a month between charges. The cleaning mode has activated only twice in the year and a half that I have owned it. I had to replace the cord because a visiting dog chewed mine up. I was pleased to find out that Panasonic sold the cord for $20 and the replacement cord only took a couple of days to get here.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a lost Remington titanium. I have owned a few Remingtons in the past and I thought it would be a good idea to get a \\&quot;better\\&quot; shaver this time.&lt;br /&gt;  The Panasonic charges very quickly, can be used wet, is quiet compared to the Remington, vibration is low and has many attractive features. Unfortunately it does not shave as well as I had hoped for a shaver of this high of a price. It makes for a smooth shave alright but it takes \\&quot;forever\\&quot;. I have taken to using an OLD Remington da57 first to knock down the heavy whiskers faster and finish up with the Panasonic. If I were to do it again???? A good Remington, no question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Update January 10, 2014&lt;br /&gt;  After having used this shaver for quite some time I have found a few other specifics worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;  First off: the battery level monitor is very helpful to avoid having it die out while in use.&lt;br /&gt;  Second: The screen has lasted a very long time. This type of shaver typically starts to get holes in the screen after 2-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;  Third: the blades on the head are situated so as to be able to knock down very long hair, like on the back of the neck, quickly.&lt;br /&gt;  As for how long it takes: yes it does take a while but I just may be more particular about how smooth a shave I get. I tend to go over and over to remove any stubble.</li>
    <li> I was incredibly anal about buying a new electric shaver and researched about 10 different models for 2 weeks. In all of my hours of searching, the Panasonic Arc 4 was consistently rated the best. One I purchased it I soon found out why. I have incredibly coarse, thick hair but this shaver handles it like a pro. I don&#x27;t know about that 30 day thing, this shaver worked amazing on my first go. Granted, my old electric shaver was incredibly outdated but the Arc 4 delivers a close and surprisingly comfortable shave without razer burn or cuts.  As much as I hate to shave, the Arc 4 made me want to shave everyday instead of every other day. Now, after a year of using the Arc 4, I may not be as eager to shave, but I still love using this shaver. Recently, however, I have found that a wet shave w/ cream is a bit more comfortable than a dry shave (and more effective to boot).</li>
    <li> This is one of the best electric razors I have ever had. I have owned a few cheap ones before and I was always dissatisfied because they never gave me a close shave. After using a normal disposable razor for a few years I decided to try again with a good quality one. I got this model because it was the best price to quality ratio. I really was not disappointed,, gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> I gave up on electric shavers about 6 years ago after buying the top of the line Braun and being incredibly disappointed. I have been using Mach 3 blades ever since and have been mostly happy. I recently began to realize that these razors are costing me a lot of money so I decided to try my luck with electric shavers again. I got this Panasonic and was blown away at how close the shave is!!! I didn&#x27;t even have to get used to it, I got an incredibly close shave on the first day. I will recommend this thing to everyone I see. I love it. (ES8243A purchased on amazon sale for $79.99).</li>
    <li> Its an awesome shaver. I wasnt sure what to expect when I ordered it, because I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for many years. Im a man in middle 30s. Those few times that I&#x27;ve previously used an electric razor had a bad irritation on my cheeks. Everyone says theres a 30 day period for your skin to get used to the razor. I have a sensitive skin, but from the 2nd time i&#x27;ve used it i had no razor burn, but have to admit you can&#x27;t get a close shave no matter how much you try.</li>
    <li> Have been using for the better part of a year now and have been very pleased with the razor.  I had not used an electric razor in many years but have enjoyed after adjusting to the use of such.  Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this once since I received it as a gift. I really like it. It gave me a close shave with no irritation, and no shaving cream used. I have a goatee, and it was a bit difficult to get a good shave while coming close to the goatee. I think I just need to get used to how to use this device...but I&#x27;m now a believer in electric razors!!! I&#x27;ll never get cut again!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> (Update 12/28/2016) I have been using this razor since 2011 and it&#x27;s still going strong. I just replace the blade and outer foil at regular times and it is ready to go again. Below I posted the link to the outer foil and blade. The battery is holding up very well and I still have consistent power through the whole charge. This was a great purchase!  [[ASIN:B001J6O0IM Panasonic WES9161CL Men&#x27;s Electric Razor Replacement Outer Foil]]  [[ASIN:B001159UMM Panasonic WES9068PC Electric Razor Replacement Inner Blade for men]]  Original Review (2011) I had been using a Braun since I started shaving. I logged on to Amazon and to look for a new blade and screen for my Braun... like I normally do. As I was looking I noticed the Panasonic razor and was drawn in by the great reviews.  After some reading and careful thought I decided to take a chance. Switching after nearly twenty years of using a Braun... weird because I wasn&#x27;t really unhappy with my Braun.  But I did switch and I must say that I&#x27;m very happy I did!  A few things I love about it: * I feel I&#x27;m getting a much better shave in less time. * It&#x27;s comfortable to hold. * It seems to be able to supply steady constant power through the whole charge (It doesn&#x27;t start to slow down as the battery drains). * I can rinse it in water or shave in the shower.  Over all, this is a fantastic razor and the way I feel now, Panasonic will be my razor of choice for the next twenty years!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy shaving with this shaver every morning.  It gives me a nice  close comfortable shave in no time. Clean up is quick and easy.  I am so glad  I purchased this one espcially when I got it on a lighting deal sale.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver as a Christmas gift. I had been using a Gillette Fusion 5 and their gel, and one day got completely fed up with cutting myself no matter how careful I thought I was, so I was looking forward to a change.  The first day did not go very well. I liked the idea of a wet shave with an electric razor, so I wet my face, used the Gillette gel and off I went. Bad idea. I cut myself in 3 spots, and had nasty razor burn on my neck. I wasn&#x27;t going to give up that easily, so I let everything heal and tried it again, this time with some Lab Series pre-shave. Much, much better! It turns out I was pushing too hard, which they say in the instructions will not make for a closer shave.  So, I knew I was on to something. I was running out of the Lab Series, which I bought when I was using a Norelco Arcitec from a few years back, but I needed a new prep. I stumbled on to a store brand of Afta pre-shave, and the difference was huge. I now get a far, far superior shave than I ever got from any blade razor, and my skin is much smoother and softer when I&#x27;m done shaving. I never got anything close to this with a rotary, and even my best days with the blade weren&#x27;t this good.  Reviews like this are tough, as I think everyone&#x27;s face is going to be somewhat different, but this is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and at about $119 you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been great- my husband says....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give only 4 stars, not because of the performance(it works great and awesome!)&lt;br /&gt;, but because of its big head size- the design could have been better, I think.&lt;br /&gt;oh, well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but - so far- it&#x27;s been amazingly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my husband&#x27;s Christmas present for $82 or so, and 2 weeks later, it went up to $120 or so!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought when I did.</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic wet/dry shaver.  My first wanted lasted me eight years I gave it to my best friend, he replaced the blades and it still works great.  My second only lasted 2 years and quit working on me, it was a bad choice it did not give me the same shave as the first one.  I almost decided to go to another brand but I gave Panasonic one more chance and I am very happy I did.  This Panasonic gives me the best shave hands down, other than a razor.  Works great wet or dry and I like the fact that it lets you know how much juice you got left.  Charges quickly and I shaved my head with it the other day and it worked great (but nothing beats a razor on your head).  One of the reviews said that the head was to big, it is bigger than the other Panasonics I have owned, but it does not interfere with the shave it actually gives a closer shave.  Great product, I would recommend especially if you have a tough beard like mine.  Thumbs up to Amazon &amp; Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This is my first Panasonic razor. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical at first. I&#x27;ve been going back and forth between Braun, Remington, and Norelco for the last decade, but I heard good things about this razor and my Braun series 7 finally died. My experience with electric razors is that I can use them for a day or two, then they irritate my skin and I have to give them a rest for a day or two. I especially have trouble areas around my neck, and can never quite get all of the hairs there without getting a serious case of razor burn.  I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic for a couple of days now and my skin loves it. I don&#x27;t have any issues shaving around my neck, and I don&#x27;t even require aftershave when I&#x27;m done. I think the biggest difference is that you don&#x27;t have to apply pressure for this razor to do its thing. Just touch it to your skin, move it around a little, and let the razor do the work. I&#x27;ve been shaving dry and have the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any electric or blade.  Like many other reviews stated, don&#x27;t bother with the cleaning version of this razor. I just got the stand alone razor and have been cleaning it with liquid soap and water. I&#x27;ll never go back to self-cleaning razors after my Braun decided to pump cleaning solution all over my granite counter top while I was away at work. That was fun to come home to!</li>
    <li> I have owned it for over a year now. I used to be on Norelco and then switched to this one. Norelco never gave me this close a shave. This one gives me as close a shave as a blade - even after one year.  I can&#x27;t add anymore to the positive things mentioned by the other reviewers. Close shave, ease of cleaning, wet-dry, etc are all very positive.  Couple of minor gripes - but not big enough to reduce the rating.  1. You can&#x27;t use it while plugged in. So if you are out of battery charge you have to wait until it charges. At least once a month I run out of charge in the middle of the shave and then have to wait 10 minutes to get enough charge to finish my shave.  2. It is rather noise when close to the ear.  But I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Fits the hand perfectly. It is light, easy to move over your every facial contour and shave closer than a blade.</li>
    <li> Comments like these....\\&quot;Not a great shave, doesn&#x27;t work on the neck\\&quot;, etc.  But yet people give it 5 stars?!  I have very corse hair on my face and difficulty shaving on my neck, which is why I&#x27;ve gone with electric razors for years.  I finally decided to spend a little more on a quality razor, but I should have looked deeper into the reviews before taking them at face value.  Like the five-star rater said above, it does a horrible job on the neck, and doesn&#x27;t shave that closely at all.  Maybe the wet/dry feature is nice, but that seems irrelevant if it&#x27;s a bad shave.  It&#x27;s not great, but razors with the 3 spinning heads, like Norelco, do better with harder to reach places and curve better to the neck.</li>
    <li> This one replaced the old one. Once the battery craps out you might as well through it away.</li>
    <li> Best electric for the money.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with razors for the past 20 years, my dad and cousin both have this shaver and love it so I gave it a try. Well, it gives a very close shave not quite as close as a new razor but pretty good. Way less messing around compared to a razor. I&#x27;ve also used it in the shower and it worked well. A+</li>
    <li> As close to blade shaving as I ever want to get.  Comfortable and you are able to wash it with water.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the high cost of replacement blades (this seems to be a problem for all electric shavers now) and not being able to use it while plugged into the wall (probably a safety thing).</li>
    <li> Great shaver: holds power a good week; easy clean with the turbo overdrive option (don&#x27;t waste your money on the \\&quot;auto clean\\&quot; models-they are expensive, require monthly refills of the cleaning solution and aren&#x27;t any more effective than this turbo model); high speed for faster shaving; quick recharge; a fantastic lighted display panel that tells you when the charge is down to 10%. BUT...the little tiny holes in the mesh screens are too small for some of the tree stumps growing out my face. Maybe in Japan, where this is made, they have fine beards, but I don&#x27;t. Make the dang holes in the mesh bigger. I have to go over the missed hairs with a disposable razor. I bought this thing to AVOID disposable nick and cut razors in the first place!</li>
    <li> I love love love it.  Bought my dad one. 71 years old best one he has ever used hands down.  it melts the hair off.</li>
    <li> good shaver has a great cut fits your face not to big to miss parts that some of the newer shavers miss.</li>
    <li> Great razor. I bought my first 8243A over 3 years ago. It does a great job dry, an even better dry with some Afta preshave gel and its as good as a razor wet shaved with creme. It&#x27;s quite durable having survived several deployments and numerous getaway trips. I&#x27;m an every other day shaver, and still use the original blades. My beard is average thickness and grows fast. I expect to replace the blades later this year as a matter of maintenance. The second razor will not come out of the box until this one dies. At the sale price I paid I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
    <li> Using it more than a year and still like it.</li>
    <li> Use this shaver to shave my head. My skin is sensitive so shaving with a razor is out of the question. I was using normal clippers for a long time but that can only get so close. Eventually I switched to a rotary shaver which worked fine but did tend to irritate my skin in some more sensitive spots (like the neck). Problem with the rotary shaver is that it tended to gunk up fairly easily and was more difficult to clean. It also had a tendency to pull hairs. With the Panasonic I am able to use some Neutrogina Shave Cream for sensitive skin and since it is a wet/dry shaver I take in the shower and zero irritation. It charges fast and comes apart easily for cleaning, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it gunking up. The head of the shaver had the ability to either be in flexible mode or with a simple switch you can lock it to be rigid, this probably would come in handy for shaving one&#x27;s face. All in all, I am extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic model for traveling, and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me. It&#x27;s compact, lightweight, and the wet/dry capability makes it easy to clean under the tap. It gives a nice, comfortable shave, although not quite with one pass as claimed. For this reason I use a top model Braun shaver at home, which does shave more closely but is charged and cleaned in a cradle that is too bulky for traveling.     In short, as a travel shaver, I give this model a high rating!</li>
    <li> Relied on some of your customer comments/evaluations to persuade me to purchase this product. I am very pleased with the performance and excellent appearance of this appliance. The shave/performance is far superior to that of the Remington electric razor I have used for many years, but with which I have become very dissatisfied. Good product! I can safely recommend purchase and use to others who may be considering purchase of this electric razor.</li>
    <li> I was cautiously optimistic about the performance of the shaver when I ordered it.  It shaves as close as a blade and performs better than I expected! quiet comfortable to hold and the floating head maked it a breaze to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic Electric Shavers for over ten years and have been fairly satisfied with them.  This model is far superior to the previous ones, giving a closer shave in a shorter period of time, with a greater degree of comfort.    I would recommend this model to both electric shaver users and those who use blades.</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes great \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; shavers. I have been using them for 10 years. The original one still works fine(on the original battery) Could use new foil/blades. At 10 years old,probably not worth the money at this point.The old one just won&#x27;t die! Amazon has great deals on the newer 4 blade models.They are fast ,&amp; with no shaving cream mess. Only an hour to recharge too.</li>
    <li> i like to shave with a wet face, so based on the good reviews this shaver had received i went ahead and bought it. Frankly, i did not expect such a close shave. The shave is comfortable, fast and very close even in the areas like the chin and neck where tradititionally i could not get a very close shave. In the past I was using a norelco coolskin for years and i was quite happy with it, very durable, fairly close shave although not very close around the neck and chin. Then i bought an arcitec which i regretted since the shave was very poor and the shaver very expensive. I have had the 8243 for two weeks now and i am really surpised at how close the shave is. It is a great product, excellent price and the battery is good as i have used it 10 times now it still has 30% to go. The only disadvantage is the noise, it is certainly louder than my previous two electric shavers but not enough to give it anything less than 5 stars rating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for 25 years and have been an electric shaver user all my life. I have the usual sensitive skin/tough beard shared my many other electric shaver users. I shave wet, with Edge Sensitive Skin gel.    I&#x27;ve used many other kinds of shavers, including Remington and Norelco, most recently the Norelco with the skin lubricant dispenser built in. I&#x27;ve tried the 3-, 4-, and 5-blade razors as they&#x27;ve been introduced, just to see if my skin could take it. It couldn&#x27;t.    The ES8243A is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten. I&#x27;d been using the Panasonic ES8018 for years and it was due for replacement--batteries not holding a charge, needed new heads, trimmer not working well. I resisted the newer shavers because I didn&#x27;t like the idea of the swiveling, spring-suspended head. I felt that I knew my own face best and didn&#x27;t want the head wobbling this way and that. I quickly discovered that I was wrong.    The four cutting heads are individually sprung and the head&#x27;s suspension springs are calibrated to give exactly the right pressure for a close, comfortable shave. This shaver is a huge technological advance over the last one. I&#x27;ve always hated shaving. Now it&#x27;s actually an enjoyable experience.    I also used to laugh at Panasonic&#x27;s notion of a three minute shave being typical. It usually took me twice as long, often longer, to knock down my heavy beard, then go after the strays. The ES8243A shave is consistently three minutes and it&#x27;s far superior to anything I&#x27;ve had before.     One final word about electric shaving: Ears. I get some thick, dark hairs on my lobes and more on the tragus, that little bump in front of the canal. An electric shave is the only way to trim these closely, and this shaver is the most comfortable yet--it doesn&#x27;t bite and draw blood, as some of my earlier shavers did. When she was a preteen, my daughter once teased me, \\&quot;Ha ha, Daddy shaves his ears!\\&quot; I replied, \\&quot;How would you like it if I didn&#x27;t?\\&quot; She conjured up animage in her mind, looked horrified, and said no more about it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a month now.  Replaced an earlier Panasonic razor I owned for about three years (battery failed!).  Very quiet, cuts well and charges quickly.  The shaving head is wider than my previous version, so it dosen&#x27;t get into the \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; areas my old one did. Never tried shaving wet yet.  Still recommend this razor because it does the job quick and well. A quick update.  12/12/09.  Do NOT buy this razor!!  Just stopped working.  I am so sick and tired of buying these expensive electric razors only to have them break down WAY too early.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Buy a decent cheap razor and get your monies worth.  Thanks alot panasonic!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes to change my lifestyle to an electric shaver and purchased a Norelco arcitiec 1050X at Costco.  It was terrible! As much as I tried, It continuosly gave me razor burn. In additional my perception since made in china, always has that \\&quot;flimsy\\&quot; feel to it no matter how good product is engineered. Neverthless returned it and purchased this Panasonic ES8243A and WOW! Could not be happier- Highly Recommend. Furthermore it is Built in Japan and you can tell the quality and dedication to its construct- GO Kaizen!</li>
    <li> Out of the box, this shaver gave me the closest, most pain free shave I ever had. I opted for this model [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue]] instead of the one with the cleaning station [[ASIN:B0021AG0Z6 Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Nanotech Vortex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Silver]] because I didn&#x27;t want the clutter. But I wondered if I&#x27;d miss the cleanliness; so I was pleased to see that even without the extra cleaning base, these shavers have a hypersonic cleaning mode that you perform manually with soap and water - and the LED display has a reminder when to do it -- it keeps track of when it needs to be cleaned. Great!   10 years ago, both my linear Panasonic shavers&#x27; batteries died much sooner than expected, so I abandoned the Panasonic brand for a while even though the shave was superior. Now I&#x27;m back; I hope the battery lasts. The shave quality is definitely worth coming home to and worth another try on battery life.   Btw, Panasonic must have the best shaver design division on the planet -- all their hair removal products, from epilator [[ASIN:B000K0QWMU Panasonic Wet/Dry Epiglide 3-in-1 Epilator Hair Removal System with Skin Protector]] to groomer [[ASIN:B000F4USF8 Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)]], are superior to the competition, and I&#x27;ve spent $100&#x27;s trying all the major brands -- after years of painful hair abatement by trial and error, I finally settled on using a combination of these Panasonic products on different body regions. When I find something that really works, it just happens to be a Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have used single, double, triple, quad, six blade razors as well as three different Norelco electric razors and none of these can shave as well as this Panasonic ES8243A. This is the best. Buy no other. I can get a shave in less than 3 minutes with no burn. The Norelco&#x27;s always took 15 to 20 minutes with leftover burn. The only thing I wish it came with was a car adapter.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Is the third one of this model I have had--They last 3+ years for me!!.</li>
    <li> My satisfaction with this razor is elevated somewhat because of the fact that my previous razor was the &#x27;cheap&#x27; Panasonic that did not provide a satisfactory shave.  This product is far superior to it&#x27;s less expensive cousin.  I&#x27;ve not yet used the wet shave feature, but I&#x27;m much more satisfied with this unit.  The shaver seems to actually hold a charge for the advertised length of time, cleans easily and provides a much better shave.  Restoring my confidence in Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco electric shavers for 25+ years.  The last five years I have been disappointed with their shaving performance.  This is despite replacing the shaving heads on a timely basis and purchasing new units ever three years.  I have resisted purchasing a foil shaver versus the Norelco rotary.  Past experience with the foil heads resulted in pinching and pulling of my skin and irritation, hence I was very negative on them - versus the Norelco brand.  The Panasonic is an absolute great shaving device.  Very fast with a very close shave with no skin irritation.  I did not realize the huge advancement in the foil shavers during the years using the rotary type.  Very. very pleased with this device.  Sorry Norelco, I do not know what happened to your shaving performance but you have lost a long time user / customer.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Looked at several brands and kinds. This was a little pricey, but in the long run, glad I purchased it. Easy to use, arrived quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate young adult skin with blemishes.</li>
    <li> Husband shopping for new shaver so I got on Amazon and began reading reviews....purchased this for him a month ago and it is a hit!!!  His usual shaving ritual involved first going over his face with an electric shaver and following up  with bic throw away to get a close enough shave...but left him with skin irritation..now with this Panasonic,  he gets a great close shave and no more skin irritation.  No need to follow up...I think he is suprised by the great shave...He has not tried shaving with shaving cream as some of reviewers suggested,  said there is no need,  gets close shave without. Having reviews to read before purchasing an item is a money saving feature that I appreciate from Amazon.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because my Norelco broke.  I was a little skeptical about an electric razor that claimed I could use it wet, with shaving cream.  The instructions say to use it for 3 weeks with the shaving cream to get use to it.  Well, it only took me three days to be TOTALLY convinced that THIS IS THE BEST SHAVER ON THE MARKET, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!   I JUST USE ENOGH SHAVING CREAM TO COVER MY FACE WITH A VERY THIN LAYER.  IT IS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.  NO ROUGHNESS OR DRY FEELING.  NO STINGING AFTER SHAVING.  IT IS INCREDIBLY SMOOTH.  MY WIFE LOVES THE WAY IT FEELS WHEN I USE IT ALSO.  EVEN AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT FEELS GREAT.  I&#x27;M STILL GETTING THE HAND OF HOW TO GET THE BEST SHAVE, BUT IT IS GREAT.  IT IS EXTREMELY EASY TO CLEAN.  THE LED DISPLAY IS VERY USEFUL ALSO.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER WITHOUT ANY HESITATION.</li>
    <li> Never thought an electric shave could get as close as a razor, but this one does. No difference in time it takes to shave, but the convenience to shave any time and any place is a plus. Cleaning is a breeze...liquid soap and water, turn it on a few seconds, done. Reliability, yet to be seen, Panasonic products normally are.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used.  No irritation or bumps.  Works great wet or dry.  Cleaning it is also a breeze.  It is definitely worth the price.  I&#x27;ve tried shavers that cost more and I&#x27;ve spent a ton of money and on regular manual razors.  But neither have done as good a job as the Panasonic.  It recharges really fast and lasts a good period of time. So far I have not encountered any problems at all.  This shaver is a must buy.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco before and decided to try the Panasonic due to the good ratings.  It gives a very nice shave and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES8243A is a great shaver. It gives a close shave (not as close as a straight-edge manual shave, but close enough) and without irritating the skin. And it&#x27;s very fast, plus it&#x27;s easy to clean. This shaver exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to others looking for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my fifth Panasonic wet/dry shaver that I had since 1997. I like what they have done with product and all the new features. I have thick facial hair and if this could give me a smooth shave, then it will be very convenient for others with less irritation and no cuts. Since I put a lot of miles on it, it usually doesn&#x27;t last more than two years (I noticed that the rechargeable battery loses its capacity to hold power over time).     Overall, I like the product and I would never try anything but a Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at different electric shavers for a few months. I didn&#x27;t want to have additional costs to operate it (for example many shavers now have the cleaning liquid you have to buy periodically). I wanted something that provided a good shave, was fairly easy to clean, and provided a close shave.    This razor gives a very close shave, cleans easily under tap water, keeps a charge for about 10-12 shaves, and doesn&#x27;t cost as much as other shavers. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.     The only minor issue I noted was that the on/off button is right where my fingers would rest when I held the shaver. Sometimes I would hit the on/off button-turning the razor off. I&#x27;ve now changed the way I hold the shaver so that my fingers aren&#x27;t over the button---even old dogs can learn to do things differently.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES8243 for about two months now. The shave is pretty impressive...especially considering that I upgraded from a series of $40 Philips shavers over the years.    The only two things that I would suggest need improvement are:    1) Noise level leaves a little to be desired. It&#x27;s hard to believe something so small could make so much noise.  2) The head gets a little hot - after a minute or so (my average shave is about 2.5 min and it&#x27;s pretty warm by the end).    I&#x27;m also REALLY pleased to see that the price has gone down $20 since I purchased the unit! Oh well.</li>
    <li> Great reliable shaver for the money!</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco for years.  Had an expensive one that had an LED which told how many shaves were left.  It was 5 years old and I always worried about the battery going.  Even thought I would have the batteries replaced if they did since they no longer made this model!  Well the AC to DC charger went!  Spent time buying what I thought was a similar Norelco.  Paid $100.  It turned out not to have the LED time remaining meter.  It also did not shave as well.  Only conciliation was the charger fit the old razor!  Called Norelco and was told it was a slower speed than my 5 year old model!  It pulled and tugged and my wife was asking, \\&quot;Did you shave!\\&quot;  Bought this Panasonic and can&#x27;t believe how good a shave I get and how comfortable it is!  Also can clean it with soft soap on the blades and a special cleaning cycle!  Great comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had about 10 different electric razors over the years. Some good, some terrible, some Ok. This one has been my favorite so far. Most of the others I&#x27;ve had were either Braun or Norelco because that&#x27;s what they have at the big, buy everything stores. I like just about everything about the Panasonic. It has four razors that cut well. The head is able to move slightly to adjust to my face. I can use it wet, dry or even with shaving cream/lotion. It has a nice display that shows the battery life and when it&#x27;s time for a cleaning. The coolest thing for me is probably the cleaning. You just put some regular hand soap in the head, turn it on and let it foam, then rinse it out. And it really does clean it well. As with all razors, I&#x27;m still learning how best to use it, but so far, I&#x27;m really satisfied with the closeness and quality of shave with this razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic razors for several years and I find this one to be the best yet.  I am getting the closest and smoothest shave ever and without any sign of razor burn.  I highly recommend this product. I made this purchase through Amazon and was delighted with the savings.  A great buy at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic razor. It shaves close and is relatively quiet with a long lasting battery. I&#x27;d recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> I have ben using Panasonic Wet-Dry Shavers for years and years.  After My last one failed I decided to purchase this one which sounded like their top model.  I am very happy with my purchase. Razor shaves very close and works great. It is the best one I have owned by far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver every morning since 5/24/10. Shaving dry with it is OK, but wet is best. You can use it with shaving cream, soapy lather, or just warm water. Whichever, I suggest dousing your face with a washrag and warm water several times to soften the whiskers before shaving. Move the shaver briskly over your face and in 4-5 minutes you should be rewarded with the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor. I get 8 or 9 shaves to a charge.The only thing about this Panasonic that I find inconvenient is that when the shaver is used wet, it (the foil head especially) will collect gunk and requires cleaning fairly often. This is the tradeoff for the close shave. The Norelcos I used for 30+ years (dry) never gave a shave like the Panasonic but were a snap to clean (just blow out the head).&lt;br /&gt;Update May 2012: after two years using this shaver I&#x27;m still getting the closest shave ever from an electric razor; however, I&#x27;d describe it as a close but harsh shave that has caused problems with acne that I never had even as a teenager. I&#x27;ve abandoned the Panasonic in favor of a Norelco Aquatec 810.</li>
    <li> I break out with adult acne every once in a while and shaving with a razor can irritate the acne prone areas. My dermatologist recommended a hybrid approach, where I would shave with an electric razor on my neck and regular blade shaving on the rest of my beard.    Well, I just got this electric razor and it works great. I did not get the irritation that I normally get when shaving with a standard blade.    The manual mentions that there is a 30 day period till the skin gets used to this way of shaving. If my first couple of shaves have been good, I can only imagine this getting better. Do not expect, the same level of closeness that you would get with standard shaving, but it comes pretty close to it.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor after reading all the great reviews. I have owned several Norelco rotory shavers but the Pansonic by far is the best shaver I have ever owned. It gives a nice close shave in less time my Norelco&#x27;s did. Being it is a wet/dry shaver, cleaning it so easy. It is the most I have ever paid for a shaver, but well worth it if your looking for a close shave and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin irritated.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve never been one to get an extremely good shave, although the 5 blade jobs have come pretty close (pun intended).    I switched (back) to electric after my dermatologist told me to in order to alleviate some skin problems. I&#x27;ve had many electrics, including older rotary and a recent straight foil shaver. None of them did a particularly good job, and nowhere near as good as the Mach razors.    Well, this Panasonic completely changed my expectations. On day one I got a very nice shave, and a week later it seems to be holding and/or maybe getting better. Everyone says you should give it a few weeks for your hair to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot;, so we&#x27;ll see what happens.    The instructions suggest you should wet shave with soap/lather, but for me it works much better dry before the shower. The only downside is my showers are sometimes hot enough that it seems like I can make more hair show up during the shower :) (From the water softening your skin and relaxing the beard hair...) So, I may switch to post-shower shaves.     I also use it to shave my head. It&#x27;s a bit more awkward than a blade, so I may not switch over completely; it&#x27;s just hard to do the \\&quot;multipass\\&quot; that you have to do with electrics when holding the razor behind your head ;-)    You can tell from the sound how much faster the motor is than other razors, which may indicate why this one works so much better (more oscillations &#x3D; more times the blades cross the face).      At any rate, for a razor in the $100 range (and Amazon continually has coupons/sales that lower it $30 or so), it&#x27;s an excellent buy. I&#x27;m still not sure it will ever be as close as a blade, but it definitely provides a decent shave with less skin irritation/breakouts.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband who wanted to be able to shave in the shower and on the go. He has enjoyed its use for three months now. He still prefers the razor shave because he feels that this razor leaves stubble marks.  Cons: It&#x27;s quite sharp so he still gets cut with it like he does with a razor. He has very sensitive skin.   Pros: Easy to transport. Removes all the soft whiskers. Versatile. It holds its charge well. Signals when the charge is low. Fairly close shave.</li>
    <li> I decided to get this model instead of the ES8103S solely on the fact that it had 4 blades instead of 3.  When opened you see 2 inner blades attached to the main unit, and 2 blades attached to the foil.  I was expecting 4 inner blades, but I am pleased to say this unit is as advertised and is the BEST electric razor I have owned in my 20 plus years of owning one.  This is my3rd or 4th Panasonic and they have all been the wet/dry types, the last one being the Smooth Operator ES718, which was not my favorite.      It did not take long to charge this unit, probably about an hour as advertised on the box.  I do not think it&#x27;s too loud at all as some reviewers have said.  It sounds nicer than the old ES718, more like happy bees buzzing rather than irritated wasps!  At 42 I still have sensitive skin, and I prefer going every other day between shaves, particularly with a Mach 4 and cream.  But now I don&#x27;t mind using this unit every day and I look forward to it!  I seem to average just over 4 minutes per shave and the feeling is very smooth.  I don&#x27;t feel it tugging at my skin or hurting it in any way.  The head pivots very nicely and it stays on my skin with no problem.  I am very impressed with the lack of irritation and the closeness of the shave, the closest I have ever gotten from an electric.  I rarely use wet/dry units with cream, but I did try it in the shower once and it worked well, if you use some soap for lubricant.      Minor issues:  The head is big, and the only thing that the ES718 seemed to be better at was shaving the mustache area.  This unit takes a bit of maneuvering to get that area clean, but overall, not that bad.  My first charge lasted 2 weeks, and there is a battery indicator, which you should look at closely.  I didn&#x27;t and expected the unit to sound like it was slowing down before it cut out.  Not at all.  It sounds like it&#x27;s fully charged and will die on you in under 10 seconds, and you cannot connect it to the wall outlet and use at the same time.  I would have loved to see this razor at a store to look at, but for whatever reason I can&#x27;t find many Panasonics around, other than their lower priced ones, and only at Best Buy.  But I took a chance and got this at a great price at Amazon, and it was delivered only 2 days after ordering, and at the standard free shipping rate.  WOW!      I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month and I love it.  It&#x27;s very attractive with its blue and silver colors.  It is very easy to clean.  I get a much better shave with foil compared to a rotary.   I was given a Remington PowerClean Titanium R-1000 a couple years ago, and I just didn&#x27;t care for it&#x27;s performance at all and it irritated me no matter how long I used it.  I am very happy I purchased the Panasonic ES8243A and I will be getting many good years out of this razor.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i bought many top of the line shavers     arcetic - braun - then finally panasonic    best shaver i ever bought and also cheap price</li>
    <li> This shaver does a very good job.  Much nicer shave than my previous Remington.  Earlier Panasonics are not comparable.  Shaves very close and comfortable.  Fairly quick.  Cleaning is easy and the unit seems tough enough to last awhile.  I suspect the higher cost shaver that includes the cleaning stand is not necessary.  This one cleans simple and does not require a special solution.  Blade and screen replacements are somewhat expensive, but worth it if they keep it shaving at current level.  I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi. I decided to add a 2nd review a couple years later when it counts.  I purchased another of the same razor.  The first razor still runs well but the charging system won&#x27;t connect all the time.  The electric connection pins are corroded on the charging unit.  I believe from me leaving the razor on the charger all the time, and charging when wet.  I just blow the pins off before plugging in and only charge as needed now and have seen no difficulty on the new razor.  I tried one of the cheaper 2 blade Panasonics and was disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t compare.  Also, when the razor gets noisy or pulls hair you have gone past the time to change blades.  Don&#x27;t push too hard and it cuts great.</li>
    <li> Please note: I should probably finish evaluating these things before posting reviews since I changed this review in favor of the ES8101S before I figured out I was using too much pressure with the ES8243A and that was why I was getting irritation. So my recommendation is that the ES8243A is better if you don&#x27;t press really hard into your neck/face like I was doing.    My old review that is true if you don&#x27;t use too much pressure:  Let me start by saying I have sensitive skin and tough neck hairs which really seem grow in different directions, and I have always nicked/scratched my neck up when using a manual razor, especially around my reasonably protrusive Adam&#x27;s apple. Six months ago I jumped on a deal for the Panasonic ES8101S (like the ES8109S minus the expensive cleaning station), and I have been pretty pleased with what it had to offer since it can be used both for wet-shaving and dry. I just found that regular dry-shaving with it would not provide enough skin protection, and wet-shaving would give me trouble around my aforementioned Adam&#x27;s apple since wet-shaving does get closer than any dry-shaving shaver.    Then THE deal ($80) for this ES8243A came along and I had to see if it could beat an already pretty versatile and powerful Panasonic shaver. Again I tried wet-shaving (shower, wash face, hot/wet towel, good shaving cream), and this shaver totally rocks for that, since it drastically reduces the time needed to shave and gets closer than any dry method. I just find that with my sensitive skin paired with shaving everyday, the closest possible shave may not be right for me. Enter Afta Pre-Electric Original-scented, which I find to be more pleasant and mild than the Fresh-scented variety. Conventional wisdom is to dry shave (with Afta) before showering and washing your face, but I find that the hairs do not stand up well and you end up needing to go over and over the same areas to get good results. So I tried this shaver with Afta AFTER my shower, and I willnever look back! The hairs really stand up and, with my skin pulled taut, the shaver really plows right through them; it gets as close as I need without irritation on the area around my neck.    Shave time is definitely less than with my previous Panasonic due to the extra middle \\&quot;blade\\&quot; and better design (flatter shaving surface), so this really is the best Panasonic shaver yet. It comes with a built-in timer and traveling case, which aren&#x27;t critical but are certainly appreciated, and it doesn&#x27;t come with an expensive cleaning station which is actually a feature IMHO. Cleaning stations aren&#x27;t really necessary with wet/dry shavers since cleaning can be accomplished just by running them under water in turbo-mode with the occasional use of liquid soap and then wiping them dry. The only negative for some travelers may be the battery life since a full charge might last for only 5-6 shaves depending on how long each shave takes for you (mine take 6-7 minutes each). Thus, I would definitely recommend this shaver for even sensitive skin types over anything else on the market so far - wet or dry - when used after a shower and with the right skin conditioner.    Pros: Made in Japan (vs. China like my ES8101S), top of the line Panasonic with \\&quot;4\\&quot; blades, wet/dry versatility, closest shave for any electric without irritation (I&#x27;ve used the Norelco Advantage also but that irritated my neck), easy to clean (without needing a cleaning station), blades/foil last a long time, timer/battery life indicator, traveling case, trimmer, nice blue color    Cons: Battery life could be better</li>
    <li> I have owned alot of shavers in my day, the last one was the norelco with the nivia, this is by far the best one I have ever used.  Am very happy about this product, had a wahl that was similar and the panasonic kicks its [...]!  I had a older panasonic that I hated and was worried when I bought this (great deal on amazon was the only reason)that I was making a big mistake but it didnt dissapoint in the least.  Too top it off it looks cool as hell so you can get a great shave plus look cool doing it : )!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not owned that many electrics maybe three but this one is the best by far. It doesn&#x27;t require excessive pressure to produce results and the time required isn&#x27;t objectionable.  I like the fact that it is cleaned by washing it under the water nozzle, both the hand set and the separate blade cover can be quickly cleaned.  Amazon promotes a needless option for cleaning so be aware when the web site steers you to available options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors on and off for over 30 years...this is by far the fastest, smoothest, and most efficient razor I have ever used.  I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> If I was to think of a modern miracle, I would think of two of them, Google being the first one and the Panasonic ES 8243 A the second one.  Since the subject matter for this review is the electric shaver, let&#x27;s get started with the discussion.  This shaver is a 4-bladed system with Nano technology, rechargeable, and it has a very sweet 13,000cpm motor to drive it&#x27;s moving parts..............and they do drive very well, thank you.  The unit comes with a very nice liquid crystal display telling you the remaining time of use, when to clean the blades, and how fast it charges and the status of the charge.  A special electric cord comes with the unit for charging purposes, or if you want to use it without using the battery - just &#x60;wall power&#x27;!  One of its best features is that it can be used wet or dry and can be washed with running water.  What does shaving wet do for you?  It provides for a lubricant (a water-shampoo mix) and the shaver will glide along the surface of your skin and be kinder to your handsome face! Let me explain how I use it, step- by- step and end up with THE BEST shave ever, without cuts, sensitive skin, cut hair caught between the blades, or blades that have to be replaced about once a week.  Before shaving your face will start out feeling like sandpaper, course-grit, and end up smooth as a baby&#x27;s skin!  First, wash your face with warm water and soap.  Leave it wet, and rub on a little shampoo where you plan to shave.  Be sure you face is wet!  Use the shaver up and down, side to side, and at angles to perpendicular and parallel lines.  Rinse your face and feel for areas that you either missed or have not shaven closes enough.  Apply more shampoo to your wet face and shave again.  Finish with a warm water rinse to the face, dry it, and apply a moisturizer cream or sun-block.  The shaving time, for me, is about 4.5 minutes.  Take the shaver and apply a little liquid soap or shampoo to the top of the razor as it runs and let it clean itself for 15-20seconds.  Take off the foil part of the shaver and blow off excess moisture around the blades.  Dry the outside of the shaver and let the components dry on a folded cloth towel and away from your kids or pets.  At your next shave, put the shaver together and have fun using it again.  You will be amazed at the quality, construction, and shave that you&#x27;ll get from the Panasonic ES 8243 A.  Don&#x27;t pay extra for a cleaner for the unit and shave yourself a few bucks. This shaver rates 5-Stars +++!    Paul Beck    P.S. I saved money, postage and time buying it from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been blade shaving since I started shaving (68 yrs old). I&#x27;ve tried several electrics but I was not satisifed with any of them so when the wet/dry shavers came along I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. I purchased it in December &#x27;09 and I wanted to use it a while so I waited until to write this review so I could give it a fair rating.    I will have to say that I was impressed from the start, but I do have some recomendations though. When wet shaving reduce your lather by 3/4 and keep your lather wet and thin. A lot of thick lather seems to clog up the head somewhat. I also have tried shaving using just warm water but using just a little lather seems to work a lot better. I sometimes dry shave whenever I just want a quick touch-up and I believe that using a pre-shave lotion such as Williams Lectric Shave works well this way.   About 6 months or so after purchasing the razer all the read-outs started staying lit when the shaver was in use. This didn&#x27;t bother me to much and didn&#x27;t seem to affect the performance of the razer but I contacted Panasonic anyway just to make them aware of the problem. Their response was NONE. I sent them another e-mail a couple of weeks ago and still no response.        So I would say that this is a 5-star razer and comes with 0-star customer service.   Bottom line is this shaver will give you good close shaves, not as close as a blade but by the same token it does not remove as much skin as a blade does either.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric razor for many years and have always used Norelcos.  Tried a new one with this Panasonic--never had a closer shave.  This is terrific, plus battery life is excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, Braun, Norelco XL, and this is by far the closest, fastest shave, especially for the $$$. I&#x27;ve spent up to $200, and this one was $140, and the best. Too bad it&#x27;s not the name recogintion that Braun and Phillips have.</li>
    <li> This razor is a tremendous value. It works better than any other electric razor I have ever used, including some twice as expensive!</li>
    <li> this thing works great. i have not tried an electric shaver in over 20 years so i cant compare this one to other current models but this one definitely cleans my face well and does so in a resonable time. no raw feeling afterwords. works great wet or dry. i even tried a vvery small amount of shaving cream to test it and found that it works even better. i use it dry first to remove the 2-3 day stubble, then i use a bit of cream for a close finish. battery is great too.  seriously, this is a nice machine.</li>
    <li> I have a very tough beard, and I&#x27;ve never found an electric shaver that really works well for me. But I also don&#x27;t want to be limited to scraping my face with a blade for every occasion, so I sometimes live with the limitations of the electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years Panasonic has made the best shavers I have found. This model, with it&#x27;s broad head, provides the most efficient and least irritating shave yet from a Panasonic shaver. It still doesn&#x27;t begin to match the results from a blade, and it doesn&#x27;t get up close to sideburns or mustaches as well as Panasonics with smaller heads. But it&#x27;s a welcome addition to my shaving toolkit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several shavers from different brands.  This one works as well as a shaver twice the price.  I don&#x27;t miss having to buy the cleaning fluid for the Braun units I owned.  Only nits - This shaver cannot be used while it is charging.  So if you forget to charge it and it quits mid-shave, you&#x27;ll have to plug it in and wait about 15 minutes while you walk around with half a beard!  My other nit is that battery life doesn&#x27;t seem as long as the Brauns and Remington&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  But otherwise, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sixty one years of age, fair skinned (moderately sensitive skin), and grow an average density beard. Because I dislike shaving I wore beard for most of my adult life only shaving my neck to keep hairs from getting snagged in my shirt collar. In October of last year I began shaving all of my face, leaving just a mustache. Obviously, this made the performance of my shaver a much more important issue than just shaving my neck. My electric shavers have always been foil type shavers, mostly Remingtons, and the most recent was a DA 307 purchased in March of 2010 at a cost of about $34.95. I have just re-learned that, yes, you get what you pay for in an electric shaver.    Recently the DA 307 began making black streaks on my face. The shave quality was never very good, but as good as I had been used to through the years. The black was coming from the little black plastic bar that divides the foil heads. I cleaned the little bar daily but it continued to rub off on my face. Last week I decided to do some research and buy my first GOOD electric shaver.     My research led me to the Panasonic ES 8243 A. I paid $104 for it on Amazon, and  I bought it because one of the reviews I read claimed it to be the best value for the dollar, and I was not about to spend $250 on a shaver (Braun). The ES 8243 can be used in the shower (which I most likely will not do). It has a good sideburn trimmer, a shave head that can be set to either \\&quot;float\\&quot; or be \\&quot;fixed\\&quot;, and a nifty display that tells me the status of the charge time on the battery, which recharges fully in merely one hour. It is extremely easy to clean, and it is very lightweight. How about shave quality? Well, I had no inkling that I could shave in under two minutes, and I&#x27;m talking about a very smooth, irritation free shave! I had no idea shaving could be like this. I have NEVER gotten a more stubble-free shave. It&#x27;ll be awhile down the road before I can report on how well it holds up and how well it continues to deliver these perfect shaves, but I am very optimistic. At this point I can highly recommend this shaver. Oh, another thing; it&#x27;s actualy very quiet.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me this Panasonic razor as a birthday gift about a month ago. I have used numerous razors over the last 20 years and this is the best razor I have ever used.  Likes:  Fast - Average shave time is 2 minutes vs 5 minutes with other razors.  Smooth Shave - Leaves very smooth skin for electric razor.  Quiet - Quietest motor on any razor.  Cleanup - Very easy to clean under running water.    Dislikes:  Trimmer - Small and doesn&#x27;t seem to like trimming sideburns or goatee very well.  Replacement Blades - Are on the pricey side compared to other razors.     Overall I would highly recommend this razor to anyone. I have been very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Shaves faster and smoother than any others I&#x27;ve owned. Best feature is the waterproofness for wet-shaving and for cleaning. Longer battery life would be nice. Comfortable to hold. Works especially well for hacking off multi-day growth without pulling or irritation (I often skip days). Would have given 5 stars if battery life was better, if it could operate in corded mode, and if it could truly live up to its \\&quot;shave smooth in a single pass\\&quot; claims, which are a bit exaggerated (need to add \\&quot;and even smoother with an additional 5 or 6 passes\\&quot;).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this razor! I&#x27;ve had Brauns before and have been using Mach III and Edge gel for the last year. Bought a Norelco at Costco and took it back after 1 try. Felt cheap and not very high rpm. It doesn&#x27;t lose its charge until after a week and I like the fact that the razor on day 7 is as fast as on day 1. It doesn&#x27;t lose any speed by unplugging it either. With my Brauns, you could hear the rpm loss as you unplugged it from the wall, so I always was tethered to the sink. Not with this one.  Got this one and absolutely get the best shave I&#x27;ve had. Doesn&#x27;t leave any strays on my neck or anywhere. I&#x27;m also a fan of Aubrey Organics&#x27; products and use the North Woods face scrub first, then shave with their North Woods shave cream. It&#x27;s not a gel so it won&#x27;t muck it up. Just run a little water in the shaver and it foams it up. Makes the chore of shaving a much better experience.</li>
    <li> Have owned this for about a month and this is the best shaver I have ever owned.  It shaves closer and is less irritating than anything else I&#x27;ve had.  I&#x27;ve preferred Remington screen shavers over the Norelco rotaries due to the closer shave that the screen gives me, but this shaver can shave closer than I thought was possible with an electric.  I would say that most of the time, 5 hours after I shave with this, my beard feels about the same as it did immediately after shaving with my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic claims that these are the sharpest blades they&#x27;ve ever made and I believe them.  While shaving, there is less drag than I&#x27;ve had with other shavers and that along with the cutting sound definitely leads me to believe that these blades are slicing through the hair much easier than my old shaver.  Additionally, I&#x27;ve noticed that it cuts longer hair much easier as well.  Previously, if I skipped a day, shaving with my other shavers was a bit tough.  If I skipped more than that I would either have to use the sideburns trimmer or use a blade - the other shavers either wouldn&#x27;t cut at all or hurt like crazy.  If I skip a day with this shaver, it still cuts well, just takes a minute longer or so to finish.  I tried skipping 2 days to see what it would do.  It worked, it didn&#x27;t hurt and I only had to use the trimmer on a few hairs that just wouldn&#x27;t stand up.  That was pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the linear motor.  Its light and it definitely sounds like it is moving much faster than other shavers with traditional motors.  This shaver sounds much different than anything else I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality seems good and fairly solid.  The only two complaints I would have about this shaver at this point is that I only get about 20 shaves per charge (Remington MS-5500 went nearly 40) and you can&#x27;t run the shaver from the charger.  It does have a 1 shave quick charge, but I would have preferred that they made the body a little larger, addanother battery and a large enough charger to run off of.  That being said, I&#x27;d buy it again in a heart beat and I like it enough that I&#x27;ll replace the battery when it dies in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous shavers I&#x27;ve owned: Remington MS-5500 (3 years+), Remington MS3-4700 (2 years), various Norelco rotaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit Jan 2013:  It is nearly 3 years later and this is still bar none the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I shave for 2 to 3 minutes a day, 9 out of 10 days and I&#x27;ve still never replaced the blades and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen any change in battery life.  The next shaver I purchase will definitely be a Panasonic, but it looks like that is not going to be anytime soon.</li>
    <li> There are many worthwhile reviews, so I will only post some specifics.  My old top-of-the-line (I think) Remington MS5700 finally died, so I tried the Panasonic.  This shaver with its 4 heads shaves my fairly heavy beard 30% faster than the Remington, is just as close and has not caused any irritation. In my opinion, fancy cleaning systems are bulky, expensive (plus an ongoing expense) and unnecessary. The \\&quot;turbo mode\\&quot; of cleaning by rinsing under the faucet is quick, simple and it works. This shaver is also much quieter. The design is ergonomic and elegant.  A one hour charge lasts for about 3 weeks of daily shaves. Having used it for 6 weeks I am quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased through Amazon a Panasonic ES8243 Shaver with which I am delighted. As a long time dedicated Panasonic shaver user, it is the smoothest shaving model that I have purchased in many years. I prefer shaving while showering, and I find that this shaver is very fast and close - noticeably faster and smoother than the the ES8103 that I had purchased earlier this year. It is also an improvement over my older model ES8077. Even though it is a quad head, it is not bulky. One positive ES8243 review that I read before purchase mentioned that it was actually \\&quot;made in Japan\\&quot; as in the past. It certainly shaves my heavy beard better than my last two models which were made in China. Although shaving is a very personal experience, I recommend this model without reservation.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my son in Afghanistan.  He says he loves it, it works well, charges quickly and he can clean out the blades with water easily after use.</li>
    <li> I previously used a Norelco 7737 (Coolskin) and was greatly impressed with the 8243 from the beginning. The shave is closer and requires less time with the Panasonic. After having a hard time finding the Nivea lotion cartridges made for the Norelco, I began to use various gels/creams and found that most of them clogged the shaver. The Panasonic works great even with a thick creams, which provides very good protection for my sensitive skin. The motor is also much more powerful in the Panasonic. One gripe I have with the Panasonic is that is does not come with a charging dock like the Norelco had but minimal difference really. I took a chance having decent results with Norelco when the batteries died after 4 years and bought the Panasonic after reading good reviews and I&#x27;m definitely glad I did.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a special deal for 79$. Its supposed to be somewhat in the higher end models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; PROS :&lt;br /&gt; 1) In real it looks much more trendy and stylish than in picture.&lt;br /&gt; 2) Actually after couple of uses I felt disappointed with it since it took so much time to achieve a clean shave. But soon when I got used to it and I realized that for the little extra time it took it was giving me a really clean and smooth shave much better than the usual razors.&lt;br /&gt; 3) Lasts for good number of shave before the charge runs out.&lt;br /&gt; 4) Very good and effective on wet shave&lt;br /&gt; 5) Cleaning is very easy on running water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS :&lt;br /&gt; 5) A bit of downside though is for the close shave it skin does feel slightly irritated if you hold it hard pressed against the skin to get a close shave, but not too much.&lt;br /&gt; 6) Another thing is it *for me* it doesnt do a good job in the neck area. So what I usually do is do it in two rounds. First I use the electric shaver to get 90% of the work done and then gently scrape off the remnant 10% with an ordinary razor to finally arrive at a close shave. So the downside overall for me is the little extra time it takes than with an ordinary razor for the whole shave. Anyway since I dont shave everyday and do like twice in a week, I usually shave with it during the weekends. One important thing we need to keep in mind is that same shavers behave in different ways with different people&#x27;s skins because everyone&#x27;s skins could be so different. If your skin is of my type and you plan to shave everyday with it then it may not be suitable for you.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to this shaver after having used a Braun 7526 for about the last four years. Although the Braun was decent, I never relied on it as my sole means of shaving -- I would periodically use a razor. After seeing high reviews on the Panasonics (and feeling that it was time to see if technology had evolved), I got the Panasonic ES8243A.    I have a fairly heavy beard, unfortunately combined with sensitive skin. This is part of the reason why I alternated between different methods of shaving. The aforementioned Braun could give me a close shave, but it required me to spend about 12-15 minutes going over the same areas numerous times. This sometimes led to irritation, especially on the neck. After reading that the Panasonic ES8243A has a much faster motor than the Braun (and most other electric shavers), I hoped to reduce my shaving time while getting a closer, more comfortable shave. I also liked the idea of shaving in the shower, which was not recommended for the Braun.    Ultimately, I have concluded that this Panasonic is considerably better than my old Braun, and is overall an excellent shaver. It does indeed allow me to shave more quickly. I have had the best experience using this shaver in the shower with a small amount of non-foaming shave gel or cream. I recommend King of Shaves Alpha Gel. (Neutrogena Sensitive Skin also works well, but because it&#x27;s a white cream rather than a clear gel, it can make it a little harder to see what you are doing compared). I can use this shaver in the shower for 5 or 6 minutes and get a closer shave than twice as much time spent with my old Braun -- and I have yet to have a problem with irritation. I&#x27;m very pleased so far.    I will say that the advertising claims are nonsense. The box claims that you will get a close shave with \\&quot;one pass.\\&quot; Well, maybe if you have a very light beard... For me, the notion of a one-pass, close shave is still an electric shaving fantasy. I can get a very close shave with this Panasonic, but I still have to do a lot more than one pass -- particularly on the neck area. Nonetheless, as far as electric shavers go, this is the best I&#x27;ve used.     Other positives are:    -Very easy to clean; doesn&#x27;t require a cleaning system and expensive liquid cartridges (as my Braun did). You clean this Panasonic by putting a little liquid soap on the head, turning it on \\&quot;turbo mode\\&quot; (which cuts off automatically after 20 seconds), and it self-cleans.  -Ergonomically-designed; it&#x27;s easy to grip this shaver.   -Nice appearance; has a high-tech look.   -It charges up quickly. I find that ten minutes of shaving will run down the charge 20%, so you get about 5 shaves on each full charge. The very fast recharging is helpful.   -Made in Japan, not in China.    Minor negatives:    -There is no charging stand; after cleaning, I lay it on a small, folded towel.  -The included case is adequate, but it&#x27;s not a leather case as was sometimes provided with shavers in the \\&quot;good old days.\\&quot;    Overall, an excellent shaver but I&#x27;m withholding a fifth star because it still requires going over some areas multiple times -- no \\&quot;one pass\\&quot; miracles!</li>
    <li> I had a Braun shaver before this Panasonic - this thing is great!  The Braun required cleaner fluid and a base (takes up space, always plugged in, had to buy this insane plastic cartridges with fluid ($10 a pop)).      This thing feels great to me, and I have a considerably closer shave with no irritation.  The Braun was fine, but in the end this is one step up in terms of closer shave.      I like the weight, the head flexibility, and the power charge by % (it also posts time used, sort of interesting in a way).      Great shaver - I heartily recommend it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the ES8243A shaver to replace my aging Braun.  I liked the Braun and owned 4 before going with something different.  In my experience, all the Brauns provided a close shave, but couldn&#x27;t cut my difficult neck area.      My first impressions after I used it was that it was well-built, quieter than expected, and cut my facial hair much faster than my 5 year old Braun and even tackled my neck area pretty well after I used a circular pattern.  I have used it in the shower several times and it performed about the same wet or dry.  I prefer to use it wet to reduce skin irritation.  I don&#x27;t even have to use after shave lotion when I use it in the shower.  The shaver holds the charge fairly well, but to be honest I leave it charged most of the time.    The only negative was that it didn&#x27;t provide a closer shave than the Braun.  With that said, I have very sensitive facial hair and it does much better not to irritate my face.    Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.  I can actually bring this shaver on travel and leave the razor blade behind....really!</li>
    <li> Does everything it claims to do, Had mine for almsot one month and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Works great not much else to say</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco &amp; Remington shavers for over 30 years. I am a dry-shave guy. I purchased the Panasonic ES8243A after researching which Panasonic models claimed to do well with dry shaving. This one did not work for me. I have a normal beard, but have some extra thick beard hairs scattered here and there. After the Panasonic got below 1/2 charge, it would jam on these thick hairs. After removing the head and blowing it out, the razor would continue -- at least this worked for awhile into the shave. About 1/2 way through the shave, the razor just stopped and went dead, like a circuit breaker was tripped. It didn&#x27;t reset itself until 8-10 hours later. On top of this, the razor never gave as close a shave as my Remington. And the \\&quot;four cutting heads\\&quot; claim is a sham. There are four rows on the head, but only two cutters. Also, the width of the four rows made the head difficult to manuever in the hollows under the chin or on the upper lip. The only reason I did not give this razor a single star is because I didn&#x27;t try it as a wet shaver. Perhaps it works well in that mode, but personally, the reason I have an electric is to do away with wet shaving -- the lather and the mess.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver to replace a Braun with design or manufacturing defects.    This was available for a reasonable price via a lightning deal and Amazon even shipped this the same day that it was ordered.    This shaver is quieter but higher pitched than what I was used to but with the higher speed tends to also shave more quickly although not quite as close.  The difference is not enough to be a concern although the difference in foil/blade prices is.  Panasonic is designed for a twelve month replacement schedule with the foil/cutter running about double those for Braun that is designed for an eighteen month schedule.  However, the Braun 360 complete foils fail within two months due to splitting of the foil which are usually detected because of the slicing and cutting of the user&#x27;s face (P&amp;G denies that the problem exists).    I avoided anything that used the Panasonic cleaning system because of numerous complaints and reviews about the residue from the soap.  Liquid hand soap as per the owner&#x27;s manual works well for periodic cleaning and weekly is fine as long as the stubble is emptied say every other shave or so.  Wish that this had included a small brush as the stubble tends to stick.    I shave dry to get a closer shave and no problem with this at all and the design works great for me for the neck.  The beard/mustache trimmer is a little narrow but acceptable.  Contrary to a previous report, I do not have any problem with the spreading of stubble but the foil needs to be correctly attached to ensure proper closure and retention of stubble.    Overall am pleased with the performance and use although I will not be as pleased when I have to replace the foil/cutter due to the higher price.</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace my old Panasonic, which was great. This is better.  Pros: Slides smoother over my face. I don&#x27;t need to go over each spot several times. Average shave is less than 4 minutes and uses about 10% of it&#x27;s battery. Recharge is quick. Would buy again  Cons: Lighter weight construction than old shaver. Expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for my Dad for Christmas. He wanted something that would give him a close shave--he&#x27;d been using the same electric razor for over ten years.  He has mentioned to me twice now that he loves the close shave.</li>
    <li> I was a Norelco user for over 30 years and always liked them. I received a Braun foil shaver as a gift a couple of years ago and I never liked it due to missed hairs and being noisy. I decided to finally replace my Norelco Spectra with the Panasonic ES8243A based on all the reviews. I was going to order this a couple of times but just couldn&#x27;t pull the trigger. Earlier in the week I made the decision and am glad I did. I never write reviews and not sure many of them are honest. I can say this is the best shaver I have ever owned. I never even knew Panasonic made a quality shaver. It is easy to clean and comes with a lithium ion battery unlike some others. I shave in the shower with liquid soap and the shave is so much better than the rotary type. Don&#x27;t hesitate like I did... Go ahead and get this one.</li>
    <li> I have owned many shavers over the years.  I started out with Norelco models and then switched to Brauns.  The Norelco&#x27;s never shaved good enough for my beard.  I would have to go over the same areas on my face multiple times and sometimes I would feel the hairs getting tugged.  Also the flip-up trimmers of the newer Norelco&#x27;s were absolutely worthless.       The Braun&#x27;s performed better, but I was still left with wanting a better shave.  I have neck hairs that grow sideways and even the top of the line (ridiculously expensive) Braun&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t cut them satisfactorily.  Also, the Braun&#x27;s still use the antiquated Ni-Cd and Ni-Mh batteries that after 6-12 months can barely hold a charge more than a couple mornings worth of use.  It was time for a change and that is why I chose the Panasonic.    Positives:    The Panasonic shaver has a lot of positives over the other shavers I have owned.      1) The contoured body is very easy and comfortable to hold.      2) The shaver is water proof, so I can frequently clean the blades under the faucet without worry.     3) The shaver uses a Li-Ion battery that lasts all week and recharges quickly.     4) Most importantly, the shaver does the best job I have experienced with neck hairs.  It can still be a challenge to catch them all, but there is a noticeable improvement in how quickly I can shave my neck.  Also, there is less skin irritation compared to what I felt with the Braun&#x27;s and I have never felt the hairs being pulled like I did with the Norelco&#x27;s.  I have to say, the Panasonic is the best performing shaver I have used and ironically the least expensive (my Brauns and Norelcos cost in the 150 - 190 range [note, cleaning/charge kits are a waste of money]).      Negatives:     There are two negatives that I feel could have been avoided in the design department.      1) The shaver has a weak trimmer, just like the Norelco&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m not sure why companies feel like they can cheapen a feature that gets used on a daily basis.  TheBraun&#x27;s are the only shavers that have a consistently strong trimmer.  The weak trimmer on the Panasonic can clean up the edges of sideburns, but it does not trim down a 3-day weekend beard that you prepare to shave.  This is quite frustrating for me because I still need to use my old Braun for this purpose.      2) The other source of frustration is a design flaw that is so ridiculous, I&#x27;m not sure why it even exists.  You cannot use the shaver while it is plugged into the wall.  I understand that Li-Ion batteries (like any other rechargable battery) have a limited number recharge cycles in their lifetime (think laptop battery).  Thus, it is important to use an entire charge before you recharge the battery because frequent recharging will lead to a shortened life.  Problem is, if you are accustomed to shaving until the battery reaches 0%, you may find yourself with a half shaven face while you wait for the battery to recharge.  Not only that, but what happens down the road when the battery gets older and loses its charging capacity?  With my Braun&#x27;s, at least I can still plug them into the wall and they will work like new for as long as I want.     In conclusion, I can shave my face and neck faster with the Panasonic than with any other model I have used--and with less skin irritation.  This is important to me.  Also the price is more reasonable than the Braun&#x27;s and Noreclo&#x27;s I have tried.  Overall, I recommend this shaver and I think you will enjoy it--just be aware of the design limitations mentioned above.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for many years, including at least 10 years of Panasonic wet and dry ones. This shaver is great! i shave in 30% less time and the shave lasts longer in the sense that 24 hours later I could easily get away without shaving again. I just ordered another one for my second home.</li>
    <li> I am a Norelco Rotary Shaver guy, and i was very scab tic about buying the Panasonic ES8243A. But Belief me if I say it is the best shaver i ever had.  it save me Time and and Pain. go a head get it you will love it. and AMAZON had the cheapest price.</li>
    <li> For many years I have been a Phillips Norelco electric razor user. The Panasonic ES8243A has changed all that. It cuts facial hair like a five bladed razor, leaving a close, [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue]]smooth, finished shave. Something I could never seemt to get with the Norelco.   Kudos to Panasonic for creating a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my son who has a very thick beard that grows in at all angles-used to take him a long time to shave and even then it wasn&#x27;t smooth and missed some.  This razor is amazing-it takes him fraction of the time to shave, it charges quicker, it leaves him smooth and not a bunch of missed hairs.  I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and could only shave with a blade every other day.  On the off days I would use an electric shaver, but even it would irritate my face.  I have been using this shaver wet with a small amount of shave cream and it is unbelievable.  I get the closest shaves I have ever had and can use it every day.  After shaving, I simply run it under water to rinse and then put a drop of normal hand soap on it and let it run for 30 seconds.  It basically cleans itself.  It also tracks the battery life and time used, so it&#x27;s really easy to see when it needs a charge, which isn&#x27;t too often.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have had electric shavers in the past but none that has worked as well as this one. I find it to give a fabulous shave - so close without having to purchase those expensive hand held razor blades over and over again - love this product!</li>
    <li> After spending hours researching high end shavers I settled for this unit. The price was right, the operation is not complicated, no accessories or cleaning station necessary. The wet-dry usability and ease of cleaning make shaving a welcome daily activity. The unit fits my hand, left and right with comfort of use, it does not vibrate all that much, the hard or soft selection gives a close shave, the trimmer works well.  Panasonic&#x27;s return policy and warranty are good and the entire unit packs easily for trips. I have a mid level beard and use the shaver  daily, normally dry and have had no rash or burn. The description of this shaver is right on and I would look no further for a quality product.  I would give as a gift and recommend to friends...</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV is the best razor I have ever owned.  The shave and comfort are amazing.  I have sensitive skin and I experience no irritation with  the Panasonic.  My face did not even have an adjustment period going from a Schick Hydro five blade razor.  I did significant research before deciding on this model and I am completely pleased.  I actually look forward to shaving each day.  Thank you Pqanasonic!</li>
    <li> clean shave on my light beard</li>
    <li> I use the razor in the shower.  It gives a closer shave than any electric razor I have owned.  One improvement would be to have a flat bottom so it would stand up on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> Shaving with an electric can leave your face, and especially your neck, red and raw and you without the smooth results you want. At least this is my experience with them. In the last few years, I&#x27;ve owned and tried several, including Braun and their latest 790cc, a few by panasonic including the ES7037, and a few others. None of them were very impressive so I approach buying a new shaver with caution. I had a choice to make recently when I left my ES7037 power adapter at a hotel. I could get a new one or get a new shaver. I opted to take my chances with a new shaver. I got the most expensive one Best Buy had to offer (not recommended since its a lot cheaper here) in part because it had good reviews here. I ripped it open in the parking lot and began to shave my 2 day old scruff. It had only 10% charge so I seriously doubted I could finish shaving. After about 5 minutes or less I was done and my face and neck were smoother than I can ever remember. Not only was it fast but it was extremely effective and didn&#x27;t redden my neck like some do. I have to say that this is the best shaver I have ever owned. Oh, and it still had 10% charge left when I was done so it seems to be pretty efficient as well. There are a lot of rave reviews on the 790cc, but it doesn&#x27;t work so well for me... it might for you. If you&#x27;ve tried it and weren&#x27;t impressed then the Panny might be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I may not be the ideal person to give a review, but I&#x27;ll try.  This is my first electric shaver, and after many years of using a single blade, yes, a single blade, I moved to this thing.  I have soft skin and have had a slow-growing beard my whole life until the last year.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve finally moved to an electric.  I&#x27;ve always wanted one, but saw no use for it.  Heck, I didn&#x27;t need double blades until last year.  Well, like all Panasonic products, this thing works as it claims to.  I have strong chin and jaw lines and didn&#x27;t think this would work so great but the first time I used it , it got everything but the hair on my neck and underchin.  I used it wet with shaving cream in the shower.  I noticed that the less the shave cream, the better.  In fact, this thing cuts better without lather, but won&#x27;t glide so well on your face, so a little bit of lather is better.  Anyways, this shaver cuts well.  As for the hair under your chin, you have to go over slowly, but it will get everything if you have a shower mirror to see what&#x27;s left behind.  The trimmer is pretty good, but could be more effective.  I use it, but wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for shaping anything.  The shaver is easy to clean too.  It looks great with the blue metallic finish.  The reasons I got this one are that the others were too expensive, had a cleaning system I didn&#x27;t want, or weren&#x27;t of a good enough quality in my opinion.  For the $125 I spent, I felt this was the best choice for me, and I feel I made the right decision.  I&#x27;ve never been let down by a Panasonic product.  Perhaps the top-of-line Braun is better, I wouldn&#x27;t know, and I really don&#x27;t care.  What I do know is that anything more would be unnecessary for me and if a product has the quality I appreciate, then I&#x27;ll just stick with it, rather than get something newer or more sophisticated.  A great product overall and I&#x27;m very happy, but this thing can always perform better of course.  For example, for thick beard hair like mine and most guys,you&#x27;ll have to go over to make sure everything&#x27;s cut.  This happens on all electric shavers b/c some hairs simply will not fit easily through the foil&#x27;s holes to get cut.  But I&#x27;m sure this is better than pretty much every other shaver out there except that Braun or something.  Still, I&#x27;m extremely happy and this is more than enough for the money.  As for a product that IS perfect:  if anyone who reads this is interested in a hair clipper that will crush pretty much anything else out there, or at the very least cuts just as well, try the Panasonic ER 153A.  It&#x27;s the sickest thing you&#x27;ll own for grooming.  It is cordless and is also of professional quality with ceramic and titanium-coated blades that slice right through hair.  (I have thick hair that always gets comments by barbers and stylists.)  It was the only professional cordless hair cutter I could find at the time (several years ago).  It is also extremely lightweight and compact for a professional clipper, not to mention far easier to use with its attachments than American or European clippers.  So easy to use that it can be used as a trimmer as well for beards or your crotch hair lol.  It&#x27;s that good.  It is ridiculously easy to use and It still works as well as the first day I bought it, seriously.  I&#x27;ve easily saved the $180 that cost from not having to go to a barber.  I hope this shaver works just as long.  If four foils are not necessary for you (for me it isn&#x27;t, but it also didn&#x27;t make the shaver more cumbersome or less precise), then the 8103S is your best bet with three foils.  I probably would be just as happy with that one as well.  The three models that cost more than this were simply too large and sophisticated for me so I passed on them.</li>
    <li> Got this product for about $110, works as described takes a little getting used to if using electric shaver the first time</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve owned a few electrical razors, receiving them as gifts over the years. All have failed in shaving my neck hairs. Recently I finally grew tired of the ingrown hairs and razor bumps from those 3 and 5 blade razors.  So I thought I would see how  electric razors have evolved and after much research I found this Panasonic ES8243A. Wow what great reviews and with little regard of past experience I was lured in, Dumb Me. Electric shavers just cant get those neck hairs or least not mine. I tried it wet and dry. It did great on my face but my neck was left scattered with individual hairs neck hairs. So needless to say I had to drag out my 5 blade razor to clean up the scene. Amazons great, I sent the item back and purchased a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] here on amazon along with [[ASIN:B002L03N74 CO Bigelow Premium Menthol Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil - 5.2 oz]] and [[ASIN:B001XURHAW Colonel Conk Progress Model 1001 Standard Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Black Handle]]. Now this is how to shave. A super close shave with no razor burn, ingrown hairs and the blades are super cheap.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver after my Norelco SpeedXL became essentially worthless for getting a decent shave. I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 weeks and am quite impressed so far. Hopefully this shaver will have some long term durability - that&#x27;s my main concern.    Pro&#x27;s:  - Very close (dry) shave - best I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric  - Handles tricky neck area well  - Long lasting battery - I can get over 8 shaves (5+ minutes each) out of it before recharging  - Pretty easy to clean/rinse (and this does not need to be done every shave)  - Included travel case    Con&#x27;s:  - A bit expensive  - No \\&quot;stand\\&quot; for shaver to sit upright on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic electric shavers for many years now. The two models that preceded this one were pretty decent shavers, but can&#x27;t hold a candle to this one. The ES8243A is an outstanding shaver. It appears to be well put together and feels well-balanced in your hands. I usually shave dry. The shave I get out of this is very close, no irritation at all, and I&#x27;m usually done in just over a couple of minutes. As another reviewer remarked, the shaver makes a nice \\&quot;satisfying\\&quot; sound as works through your hair :) I&#x27;m extremely happy at this point (after a couple of months use).</li>
    <li> I have found it nearly impossible to get a reasonably close shave with this shaver.  I have decided to go back  to a Norelco, which I have used for many years.</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and got a new razor. My old Remington was literally duct-taped together. I ordered this razor and it just came today. I opened the box, turned it on, and shaved right there and then. Wow. I apparently forgot how shaving was supposed to feel. A great improvement over what I had going and I can&#x27;t wait to shave every day now.    To other reviews, yes, it seems a little loud, but so what?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent half my life shaving with Norelco razors, believing I was getting a good shave.  But that was only until a few months ago, when my trusty Norelco broke and I found the parts for it can&#x27;t be obtained any longer.  I started searching out a new one, but I didn&#x27;t care for the comments I was reading about the current Norelco (Phillips) and Braun models and I landed on this Panasonic.  What appealed to me was that fact that it is simply cleaned with a little soap and water.    I wanted to give it some time before giving any feedback and now that a few months have passed, I think I can give some qualified comments.    The razor feels good in my hands.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver around my face and neck.  It&#x27;s a slight bit noisier than I imagined it would be, but still not bad.  It gives a close shave, even on my neck and around the Adam&#x27;s apple, and is a closer shave than any Norelco rotary I ever had -- and possibly even better than a blade.  I&#x27;m able to shave in 3 - 4 minutes if I shave every day or every-other day.  If I go beyond two days, the razor doesn&#x27;t get bogged down, but it does take 7 to 10 minutes to get the same great results.      I wear a fu-manchu moustache and a soul patch.  I was concerned that a shaver with such a large head couldn&#x27;t shave around it as well as a 3-head rotary could, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It gets right up close and I&#x27;m even able to use it to shave the space on either side of soul patch out to the corner of my mouth... and that&#x27;s with the shaver head, not the retractable trimmer.  The retractable trimmer has very fine teeth and does a great job on the side-burns.    The battery on this shaver requires charging every 7 to 10 days.  I expected more, but this is certainly good enough.  After each shave, I remove the head cover and blow out the clippings.  The \\&quot;clean shaver\\&quot; light seems to come on about once between each charge cycle and it&#x27;s very simple to do.  Follow the instructions in the booklet and the razor is clean and refreshed in just a moment or two.    I love my new razor and wish I made the change from shaving with a rotary to foil shaving sooner.  I get a clean and close shave from this shaver -- consistently across my cheeks, chin, and neck.  And my girlfriend loves the smoothness of my cheeks on her thighs, too!    Stay thirsty my friends!</li>
    <li> This shaver is very good.  It is comfortable to use.  Recharges to full  stored power in just a short period of time.  All around it is probably   the best electric shaver I have ever had.  I am pleased with it, but the  short fall is just that it is like all other electric shavers.  They don&#x27;t  shave as close as a blade.    I am pleased with it and would recommend this shaver to my friends and anyone else who asked my opinion.  Try it, you will like it.  Amazon made this purchase sweet and easy.</li>
    <li> After checking out all the reviews, I bit the bullet and made the purchase. Because the Panasonic ES8243A was less   expensive than the best rechargeable shaver, I was shocked when it arrived. The shaver was built well, it has a battery meter,   it holds a charge for quite awhile and it cuts your beard very close to your face.   Trust me, if you need a good, but less expensive rechargeable shaver, THIS IS THE ONE TO PURCHASE. Don&#x27;t think about it or you  will end up spending more money then you need to on a shaver that is not as good.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised! Easy and works much better than I expected it to. Much better than the other electric shavers that I have tried in the past. I have now put my blades away!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews I read on it. It works great, but it wasn&#x27;t as close a shave as I was hoping. Maybe when my skin gets used to the shaver it will be better.</li>
    <li> This razor is great in term of shaving. The only point that made me remove one star is the display. First it shows you the time you are using it... still wondering the interest of that, but more important the battery status (that come only few sec after the use) is not accurate. I can use mine at least one week at the lowest level...</li>
    <li> Lets face it, there is no electric shaver that can match the closeness &amp; speed of  a razor blade shave! I have tried many and none compare. That includes this one. However, it is pretty good in \\&quot;COMPARISON\\&quot;  to the best electric shavers. The head of the shaver is large and not the best design for those who have sideburns or a trimmed beard. It also eats up battery power because of its high speed blade system. It feels nice in your hand and looks very modern. The upper Braun models seem to be just as good and have a smaller shave head.   The wet/dry feature is very good. The shaver seems to work better in the shower.   If you want the best shave use a razor. If you have skin that does not permit a razor shave this, and the top line of expensive Braun shavers, would be a good alternative.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted  a wet/dry electric shaver, so I started my exhaustive research before Christmas last year.  I settled on this one since it was highly rated and well priced.  My husband loves it! He said it took him a little time to get used to it initially since he&#x27;d never had a device like this before.  He uses it both in and out of the shower.  I especially like how it creates a close shave on his head without the super squeaky clean and shiny result a razor would give.  It&#x27;s still soft and smooth, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past he would wait a week and use a buzzer to clip his fuzz.  This razor allows him to easily stay on top of the new growth without the hassle of a more substantial buzz session. It&#x27;s amazing how much difference a few millimeters of hair can make!  A clean shaven head instantly makes him look younger and to be honest, more sexy!  One could therefore say that WE are both pleased with this purchase!  ;)</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. As was previously mentioned in other reviews and the product literage, it has taken me a month to learn how to effectively use it. This shaver does a better job than any other electric shaver I have ever owned(some much more expensive and some cheaper). Clean up is also easier and less expensive plus I think it does a better job than the shavers with \\&quot;cleaning stations\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Very impressive, by far the best electric shaver ive ever used...now if it will last longer then 6 months it will be well worth the money</li>
    <li> This is my first use of this type of shaver, previous shavers were all rotary blades.  After doing my research on other customer reviews a chose the Panasonic ES243A.      It has been a great shaver and a significant step up from my previous rotary shaver.  I get a shave that is on par with what i can get  from a blade, but without the worry of nicking myself.    The shaver gives you a display of how much time has elapsed.  I get a good shave in less than 4 minutes.  The trimmer works well for sideburns...    I get at least 10 shaves before I need to recharge.      I am very happy with this product.  Quality seems good.</li>
    <li> The cut hair falls out of the razor and gets all over me and my sink when I am shaving.  I even clean it regularly and it still doesn&#x27;t hold the cut hairs</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver from Amazon in February 2010.  After about two weeks, I found I liked it much better then my blade. (Gillette Fusion Power).  The Panasonic does not give the face irritation a blade does.  Recently, it developed a short and then stopped working.  I did not have any of the paper work, but I down loaded a copy of the Amazon shipping info and mailed them into the Panasonic service center.  10 days later they sent a replacement that was also under warranty.  I am very happy with Panasonic&#x27;s service and products.  In the 10 days I was without the ES8243 I realized just how much better a shave it gives then a blade.  Even compared to the top dollar Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun Series 3 and 5 for the last 3 years and got good shaves from them but would always need to take the double edge out to cut the remaining lumber if I needed to be closely shaved that day.  This Pany cuts so close its almost as good as a very careful and time consuming full shave with a double edge razor.  Compared to the Braun&#x27;s it&#x27;s a few minutes faster and quieter and shaves much more closer on the first pass.  It also makes a mowing noise as it cuts my whiskers, I can hear the blades whacking away.  When that sound is gone, the shave is over with little left standing.  I paid $[...] bucks and got a deal.  Knowing what I know now, I&#x27;d never pay full price on this, but at $[...] I can justify it.    Downside  Braun appears to be better made with more metal.  Pany is light and plastic almost everywhere.  Don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
    <li> WOW is the only word that comes to mind with the Panasonic wet n dry shaver. I switched from Gillette&#x27;s fusion 5 blade razor with vibra mode and at first there were awkward moments and a couple of days when I missed some spots but after 2 weeks of continuous use and practice I now get a perfect shave every morning. The closest shave I have ever experienced. I highly recommend this product but stress that converts from razor to electric need to be patient for atleast 2 weeks or longer until thier face and growth gets accustomed to the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I was referred by a fellow worker to try the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver. His claim was the Panasonic shaved as close as a razor. Having always been a Norelco user, and my third Norelco had died, I gave this razor a try. News Flash: There are no Norelco Shavers to compare with this Panasonic Shaver. The BEST RAZOR to date I have owned! Shaves as close or better than a razor. Wet Use in the shower is the greatest. I would not ever want to return to the \\&quot;old\\&quot; dry shave again. Great Product! Worth the MONEY!</li>
    <li> Buy the Panasonic ES8243!  Why shave over the same area 4 times to get a good shave?  This razor really is a BIG step up from others I&#x27;ve owned.  After 10 months, I&#x27;m looking to buy one for my 16 year old.  I rarely write reviews, but this is a great product!  Don&#x27;t compromise on a cheap razor.    PRO&#x27;s  + Razor head, not just the blades, adjust to my face.  The spring action moves it up and down smoothly.  It also swivels side to side, but you can lock it to be stiff.  + Cut somewhat long hair going back-to-front on the blades and then a close shave going the normal front-to-back.  + Get a grip that fits your hand and has textured, soft plastic to hold when wet.  + Shave the back of your neck easily because of all the above.  + Best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned on electric razors.  It flexes without feeling flimsy.  Nice cut too.  + Cleaning is much easier than the old rotary razors I had. Hold the power and the head switches to a high vibration for a sonic-like clean with liquid soap and water.  Easy to pop the top too.  + Switches for power and the trimmer are placed for easy reach with your thumb.  + Display tells you how much power is left.  + Recharges very quickly and then flashes the display to tell you it&#x27;s at 100%.  Holds charge long enough that I don&#x27;t take the charger on week-long trips.  + Flat design packs easily.  + Plug is thin enough to fit something in the plug receptacle next to it.  + No pig tail cord that gets caught on itself, just straight wire.    CON&#x27;s  - My difficult neck spot still takes more than one pass to cut hair.  - The display turns off quickly.  Either look at it quickly or read before turning off.  - My son wants mine.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving. I purchased my first electric razor years ago on a whim. It was a Norelco rotary and I was suprised that it gave me an adequate shave. I used it until it wore out then I purchased an ancestor of this model a Panasonic wet dry shaver. Loved it but it slipped out of my hands in the shower one morning and the blade apparatus broke rendering the shaver useless. So I purchased a braun 360 model which seemed to work pretty well and has lasted me 4 years. It came time to puchase new blades for the braun along with new cleaning cartridges so I went online to see if I couldn&#x27;t upgrade for just a few more bucks than the blades/refill would cost. The top of the line braun is outrageously priced. At under $100 bucks this razor is a steal.    I also shave my head with the electric razor and my hair is tough so I am a demanding customer. I used this for a week dry shaving in the morning and it outperformed my braun. This morning I gave it a try by doing a wet shave using King of Shaves gel / oil and... WOW. This razor shaved as close as the gillette fusion blades!! Amazing shave!!    Pros: The best shave out of all the electric razors I have used. As close as Gillette without spending a fortune on the fusion blades. Did an awesome job on my head as well as my neck - both tough areas.    Cons: the fat head doesn&#x27;t do too well shaving around a goatee / facial hair    Consensus: This electric razor is a steal at under $100. If you are in the market for an electric razor buy it</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and after years of using blades, this is my second electric shaver.  Previously I bought the Philips Norelco 7810 and it was cheap, but not good.  I got razor burn constantly, I had to go over the same spots again and again to get all the hair.  I decided it would be worth the money if I could find a better shaver, so I tried this one, and though it is twice as expensive it works much better.  It works pretty well on my dry face, getting almost of the hairs quickly and painlessly, I have to go over a few spots on my neck multiple times.  Like a lot of guys I have a lot of contours on my neck and I don&#x27;t think any sort of shaving system will be created in my lifetime that can cut all of the hairs on my neck in one pass.  I can only hope for my children.  Anyway, the best way that I have found to use this shaver is to apply shave cream right after a shower (I have only tried Cremo Cream, which works fine) and it feels like I am massaging my face with a vibrating stick of warm butter.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, no shave burn at all, just a mild feeling of heat.  The only drawback (and the subtraction of a star) is that I have to go over the same area multiple times, then I have to wash off the cream, reinspect, and go over again without cream to get all the remaining hairs.  The cream remaining on the shaver is enough, so I don&#x27;t need to reapply cream to my face.  This takes an extra minute, but the end result is a smooth face that feels moisturized, and no nicks, cuts, or burn.  The shave is not as close as a blade, but good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I am 42, and have been shaving since I was 15 with nothing but Norelco electric shavers. My last Norelco was a top of the line model, purchased about 4 years ago. I thought having to go over my face 10 different times, using 10 different angles and spending 10 minutes doing so, was just the price of using an electric shaver...........That is until I bought the Panasonic Arc IV! Just like you, I read all of the reviews on this shaver, and I thought \\&quot;What the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try\\&quot;.     It is hands down the best shaver I have ever used. I have only used it dry, and I will probably only use it dry. I have \\&quot;average Joe\\&quot; stubble, and my shaves are all under 4 minutes long, and they are the closest shaves that I have ever experienced. I just cleaned it for the first time, and that too is the easiest, and most complete experience that I have had cleaning a shaver. Some dish soap, hot water and 3 minutes, and it looks just like new. I shaved for a week and the \\&quot;clean shaver\\&quot; indicator never came on, so I cleaned it anyway. Next time I will wait for the indicator to come on before I clean it.    I could go on and on about this shaver, but if you are wondering if it is really as good as the hype, I say no, it isn&#x27;t.........................It&#x27;s better!!</li>
    <li> This shaver is excellent. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but its the smoothest shave I ever got. Much better and more comfortable on the skin than my previous Panasonic, which was just OK. Price is great, value is excellent. Works great wet or dry but is really impressive with shaving cream. A great buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent, panasonic rules</li>
    <li> As an electric shaver guy for 50+ years I&#x27;ve tried Schick, Phillishave, Remington, Payer, Braun, plus others.&lt;br /&gt;Without exaggeration they all pale by comparison with this made in Japan Panasonic ES8243A.&lt;br /&gt;My only concerns are&lt;br /&gt;1) how long will the ES8243A maintain it&#x27;s stellar performance&lt;br /&gt;2) battery endurance.&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell ... no worries ....  it&#x27;s Panasonic!&lt;br /&gt;As of July 30. 2013 still runs great!</li>
    <li> Okay, just got this in the mail this afternoon and I&#x27;m already thrilled.  This was a replacement for a Braun (not sure what model) that all of sudden was terrible after they changed the foil design on replacements.  It was practically unusable due to the poor quality of the shave and the fact that it continuously pulled hairs.  I charged this beauty up and used it for the first time and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Great, close shave and it even did a good job on those hard-to-get neck hairs.  Of course, there were a few stragglers that took more than one pass.  But on the whole it did a great job.  And it didn&#x27;t pull a single hair.  This is a win-win for me, because now I know what to get my brother and dad for Christmas.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have owned. Previous were Norelco, Remington, Bruan.  Panasonic beats them all.  Easy to clean, east fast charge, close shave, good looking and reasonable price. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I always used a Norelco...until now. It used to take me 30-40 minutes to shave, and now, it takes me 5! No more problems with my stubborn hairs, it just comes right off. The blades are super sharp, and it usually only takes 1-2 strokes to get all of the hair off.</li>
    <li> I read previous reviews of this shaver and purchased it based on those reviews.After one month I have already had to return it to Panasonic because the enclosed literature said that you can get up to 14 shaves out of a single charge, I found that I was getting no more then 5.I have a light beard and a shave takes no more then 3 to 4 minutes.I also found that it could not get the hairs at the corner of my mouth.I will not buy another Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> It does not provide ultra close shave but it does what it does for the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought my first razor, the Norelco 5821XL, back in 1998. I have never replaced a part on it, and used it almost daily for 11 years. Eventually, the battery leaked, and shorted the razor, frying a resistor, and I was forced to move on to a new razor. After several months of research, I settled on the Panasonic ES8243A. The razor comes with a travel pouch and a wall charger. The display is nice, and probably one of the few improvements over the Norelco, which had a full LED and an empty LED. The time to reach 100% was several hours, which seemed reasonable from a Li battery.    Shaving dry, I find that this does not perform as well as the Norelco. I have a light beard, and I had read that foil shavers are worse than rotary shavers on light bears, so that did not come as a surprise. I find that shaving wet is a nice option. If I have extra time on the weekend, then I will use colonel conk shaving soap, with a badger hair brush, and I don&#x27;t need to have two separate shavers to maintain.    Only 4 stars, because I expected more improvement in the last 11 years, but I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old Norelco that never had the cutters changed, shaved closer and with MUCH less irritation. The Panasonic does poorly on all areas. I have to pull and stretch and shave back and forth and upside down many times over and it still does poorly at the jaw line, neck area (especially) and with the chin and mouth area. Plus this razor actually draws blood! My Noreclo not once had ever cut me. With this razor I suffered cuts on several occasions in attempt to get it to actually shave. Oh well. It&#x27;s going back and I&#x27;ll just get another Norelco.</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing.  I used to shave with a Mach 3, and then the mid-range Panasonic ES7056 (which was quite good).  My beard is *so* coarse, thick, and fast-growing that I would cut myself several times per shave with the Mach 3 (and yes, I do know how to use it properly).  I then switched to the Panasonic ES7056 which gave me a decent shave without the cuts.  Unfortunately, that broke after two years of use and I upgraded to shaver that I&#x27;m reviewing now (the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV).  There is a definite difference between my old Panasonic and this one.  If my old Panasonic was good, this new one is hands down better, with the razor making short work of my very coarse hair.  The four blades do not appear to be a gimmick--I definitely feel like I am able to shave more quickly with this razor. My old Panasonic razor came with a one year warranty.  I am glad to see that this one comes with a two year warranty on battery and razor considering that my last Panasonic electric razor broke just before the two year mark.    Pros: Probably the best shaver available, waterproof (can use in the shower, which I do regularly), very easy to clean (don&#x27;t bother getting the more expensive version with the cleaning station...it cleans itself), two year warranty.  This is a no fuss razor that does its job and does it VERY well.    Cons: There are a couple small spots on my neck that I still have to go over multiple times in order to get everything (this has been a problem with every razor that I&#x27;ve owned in the past)...although, this problem is much improved with this new Panasonic (I guess no electric is perfect) , replacement blades / foil is expensive (they&#x27;re around $40, I can&#x27;t comment yet on how long the foil will last but if it&#x27;s anything like my last Panasonic, it should go at least a year), at over $100, it&#x27;s not cheap (but it is worth-it).    Final thoughts: if you have a beard that is thick and/or tough to shave, I can&#x27;t recommend this razor highly enough.  It&#x27;s notcheap, but if shaving with a non-electric razor causes many painful cuts (like they do for me), this electric gives a fantastic shave without the pain and embarrassment and for me has been money well spent.  Note that if you&#x27;re used to non-electric razors, it will take at least a few days and possibly a couple weeks for your face to adjust and for you to get the most out of this razor.</li>
    <li> Works great, but use shaving cream (or shave butter)</li>
    <li> After two years with the ES8243, I&#x27;m going back to a rotary.  Here&#x27;s why:    - Takes about four minutes to shave each morning, which is about twice as long as with my rotary.  - Battery lasts about a week, which is less than half of my rotary.  This really decreases its value for travel because I have to take the charger for even short trips, and the charger is relatively huge and heavy.  - Very poor shave below the jawline and on the neck (generally a good shave above).  - Shaver \\&quot;leaks\\&quot; or sprinkles whisker dust everywhere while in use, which is annoying at the sink, but really eliminates its utility as a shaver you can use while driving/riding to work, or at work unless you don&#x27;t mind cleaning your desk or the community sink.  - After using it as a wet shaver, water drains out as it is moved to different positions, meaning that it&#x27;s going to leave water in your shave kit when traveling.   - High operating cost relative to my rotary.  Replacement foils and blades are very expensive (one-half the cost of the whole shaver purchased new on sale) and supposed to be replaced regularly.    On the plus side, the construction is good and it generally shaves well to very well (above the jawline), but not any better than my rotary.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it works likes it suppose to. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a month now and I love it. I&#x27;d tried electric shavers in the past, did not like them for one reason or another, not close enough or too rough on my face. I have sensitive skin and sense the first day my face never hurt or broke out, I have been using an after shave balm though. I shave in the shower after washing off to soften up my whiskers, I did try dry shaving once. I did not like it, it just didn&#x27;t feel as nice while shaving. I read others reviews about not good for neck hair, but I&#x27;ve had no problem shaving mine. I used to shave, using a disposable, every third day due to irritation. I use this every day and no problem with my skin irritating. Good luck I hope this helps someone. I love using this razor and I love have a clean face everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband for Christmas and he said it has been the best razor he has ever had.  He is very particular with his razors, so it has to be a great one!</li>
    <li> Hello. Compared to my previous Philips Norelco Speed XL 8140 (it broke) the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV is much better in terms of a closer shave done in less time. I used two solid hours of my life researching all facts and opinions on nearly all the other competing razors (Braun series, Remington, etc.) and this is the best one. I could afford any razor, but this is the best shaver for my course and stubborn thick beard. Like a baby&#x27;s butt, seriously.</li>
    <li> Just a short review to cast my vote with those who recommend this shaver. Principally, I use this shaver to shave my head. I also use it on my neck, under my beard. My position is that a close shave from an electric shaver is a better shave than an average shave from a blade. And it&#x27;s infinitely quicker and less messy. I&#x27;m shaving dry with light pressure and the Panasonic ES8243A is doing an outstanding job. Charging, operation, and the displays work perfectly. It has been many years since I used an electric shaver and I&#x27;m impressed with technology&#x27;s progress. I&#x27;m also quite happy that I spent a few extra dollars for this product and even happier that I resisted the inclination to pay twice the price of this shaver for a \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; shaver. This is the right product at the right price for my shaving needs. --Ron    UPDATE 07-06-2011: I wet-shaved my head over a lavatory using shaving cream. The shave was noticeably closer than a dry-shave and considerably less-messy than I had envisioned. I&#x27;ll dry-shave for daily convenience and wet-shave for special occasions when I need to be smoooooth. --Ron</li>
    <li> Bought for the husband a couple of years ago. He hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m one of those guys who has a tough time shaving because my skin&#x27;s sensitive, I get ingrown hairs, my facial hair grows in different directions depending on which part of my face is being looked at.  Because of that, I have to shave against the grain, not in the direction the hair is growing like you see in commercials.  I was a bit skeptical about buying another cordless because I owned a Braun before and it was a good product, but it couldn&#x27;t get the job done as I had to finish my shave with a Gillette.  So I saw that the Panasonic ES8243A received a lot of high ratings (many 5-star) and I decided to order it.  OK, so this is a bit premature as I have only shaved once with it, but this shave was amazing.  Remember, I have a tough time shaving with a normal razor and I typically still have a light darkness (if that makes sense) to my face after I shave as my facial hair is jet-black and I use a 5-blade Gillette, but it seems that no blade can shave me close enough.  Well, I just finished charging the Panasonic and decided to test it out and it has been a revelation.  It gave me a closer shave than any razor ever has.  YES, I SAID IT!!! NO RAZOR HAS EVER GIVEN ME A CLOSER SHAVE!!!  The timer is great as you can time your shaves and mine was just under 3 minutes which isn&#x27;t bad considering how close the shave was and how comfortable it was.  I just wet my face with warm water and proceeded with my shave.  Also, I have a tough time with the neck area and although I had to go over it a few times with the Panasonic, it got all of the hairs.  Not a single follicle was left behind.  I checked about 4 times!!! My skin is baby smooth now and no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow directly after my shave.  It&#x27;s also a nice looking shaver and well designed ergonomically.  So, in a nutshell, that&#x27;s my first impression of the razor and I would highly recommend it.  Take if from someone who dreads shaving everyday.  This has actually made me look at my bathroom prep time as less of achore now.  I will also follow up a month from now with a second review.    Update - January 30, 2011    So I&#x27;ve used this shaver for two weeks now and my face has already adjusted.  My first shave was amazing, but the following up until a few days ago were a little rough.  Again, my skin&#x27;s sensitive so I felt some irritation and my shave&#x27;s weren&#x27;t as close as I wanted.  I tried the shave dry a few times and it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as I&#x27;d like compared to a wet shave.  Wet shaves are, of course, really close.  I used King of Shaves shave gel that I bought at Walmart for about 3 bucks and it&#x27;s fantastic.  I would highly recommend a wet shave or some sort of light shave gel when using this shaver.  I&#x27;m amazed at how close a shave I get from the Panasonic ES8243A.  It&#x27;s definitely as close as a top of the line razor and causes way less irritation for me than a razor would.  Remember, if you do buy this shaver, as with most or all shavers your face has to adjust so don&#x27;t be disappointed if your first few shaves are very comfortable.  Now that I&#x27;m two weeks in I can say that the battery life isn&#x27;t as bad as most have commented on, but it isn&#x27;t great, either.  I probably get about 6-7 shaves between charges so you can expect about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves at 3 minutes per between charges.      Again, I would highly recommend this cordless shaver.  It looks good, is light and ergonomically designed, and best of all gives a fantastic shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll get right to the point. This is the best shaver I have ever owned. I used to have a Norelco - which I liked, then a Remington - which was not so hot. I read the reviews and got the Panasonic and couldn&#x27;t believe how much better it worked. Sounds different, feels different, the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever got out of an electric. I don&#x27;t normally bother reviewing products I buy. This time I&#x27;m passing on the word. This razor really is better.</li>
    <li> Based on the other reviews, I had high expectations for the shaver.  It was not even close to giving me an acceptable shave.  It failed at the jaw line, the neck and the area along the sideburns near my ears.  I always had to touch up afterward with a disposable razor and would invariably find a spot that I missed once I got to work.  I tried everything before giving up on it.  Maybe it isn&#x27;t for all beard types and face shapes.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, easy to clean, quite, holds a charge foreverand easy to clean&gt;  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it doesn&#x27;t have a STAND TO PUT IT IN. Wow what a close shave.</li>
    <li> This is the first Panasonic shaver I have used! I have found a electric shaver that works! I have never shaved with a blade and never felt that my shave was very close this feels good. This is the best shaver I have ever owned. Thank you Panasonic....</li>
    <li> I just got my Panasonic ES8243A in the mail yesterday, unpacked it, and read through the manual.  I plugged it in at it was 100% charged within 50 minutes!  I shaved the left half of my face in the shower and the right half of my face after my shower after applying liquid pre-shave.  Both sides of my face are as smooth as glass.  My wife LOVES how smooth my face is!  The wet/dry shave capabilities are outstanding!  It is not very noisy compared to most foil shavers.  I have owned 2 foil shavers and one rotary shaver.  None of my previous razors can compete with this one!  Great product and a very satisfied customer!!!!  Very close shave with absolutely no irritation which is good for me because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Read a lot of reviews on this before buying. It lives up to it&#x27;s promises. I had an electric before but a cheap get-me-by for $39 4 years ago (I procastinated) :) It worked OK and when this arrived my first few dry shaves did not really see an improvement unless I spent some extra time shaving and pressing harder. Even at 3 weeks the dry shaves really have not improved but they are perfectly acceptable.    The only downside to it (for me), was gripping it, while comfortable, I find my thumb perfectly over the on/off button and I have turned it off accidently several times when putting on some pressure, although I am getting more sensitive to knowing when I am on it. It&#x27;s just in the wrong place. I would suggest if they had made a thumb rest where you can get some grip and leverage without hitting the button on accident it would be great. The instructions say pressing harder does not mean a closer shave, I disagree, it does work better and this is where the thumb problem comes in when you want to apply more pressure, you grip harder.    I have tried wet shaving and the difference is amazing. It feels like a blade shave on my face afterward, the neck still has some spots hard to get but that is always a problem only mostly solved by a blade. If you need that close shave do it wet, if ya just need a good shave dry is fine. I spend about as much time and make just as much of a mess as doing a blade shave when doing it wet, but it feels easier and you can&#x27;t argue with no risk of nicking yourself and the blood trouble that comes with that on your way out the door with a white collared shirt :) It is easy to clean. I am at 3 weeks of daily use and it is just now telling me to recharge it, so it has gone way past 14 shaves as they advertise. Maybe I don&#x27;t shave as long as the normal person.    Overall I am very happy with it and would recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful electric shaver. I often alternate it with my Gilette and/or my Norelco. I still prefer a blade&#x27;s shave, but this is a phenomenal alternative.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few weeks now and was using it everyday, prior to that I was using a really old norelco 3 head razor, so coming from that this was head over heals better, it shaves very closely. For the reviewers that couldn&#x27;t get a close shave in certain areas they just need to pull their skin tight so the razor can pick up those hard to get places better, easy fix.</li>
    <li> I have used various excellent Norelco and Panasonic shavers for nearly 25 years, with my most recent being a Panasonic ES8103S. I have a very tough, fast growing beard, and my job requires frequent evening events. So, my measure of performance is whether or not I have to shave again before heading out for the night.     After several Panasonic Linear shavers (which I use primarly wet with shaving cream), my wife gave me a Norelco 1150x for Christmas because of its similar ratings and wet/dry capability.  After a few weeks of trial, it just could not match the closeness and comfort of my old Panasonic.  So, I purchased the ES8243A in place of it.    Astounding.  Simply astounding is all I can say.      The ES8243A is providing the closest, most comfortable and fastest shave I have ever had in my life when used in wet mode with a thin layer of shaving cream.  It buried the Norelco 1150x for both closeness and comfort and beat my well-loved ES8103S.  For me, it shaves more closely and comfortably than a blade.  I have not even had to use a blade for touch up around my sideburns, which I have always had to do with other electrics.  The shave is so superior that I have no need to shave before evening events, and my beard is noticably shorter when I wake up in the morning.  And, I have found it equally efficient and effective for a quick dry shave on weekends.    In other respects, the ES8243A is very good - comfortable to hold, good trimmer, quiet and decent battery life compared to my previous Panasonics.  The LED readout is easy to read and lets you know exactly how much power and time you have left.  I also like that the charger plugs directly into the shaver, eliminating the need for a bulky charging stand.  It&#x27;s also an incredible buy at around $100.  An added improvement is the 2-year warrantee - a full year longer than my previous Panasonics.    The Norelco&#x27;s been returned, my beloved ES8103S is now my travel shaver, and this ES8243A is now my best friend in the morning.  It is clearly the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this razor. I have been skeptical of electrics and almost always shave with a blade until I got this. I&#x27;ve had a couple of Norelco electrics previously, and they never shaved as well as a blade or as fast. However, I just had some surgery and wanted a new electric so took a chance on this one based on the many good reviews. I was also attracted to the wet/dry nature as I thought this might shave better in the shower. But for me, I found it shaves better dry. I haven&#x27;t tried it with &#x27;Lectric Shave or any kind of electric shaving lotion yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had it a week so cannot comment on longevity, durability, etc. But here&#x27;s the bottom line - it shaves great! I&#x27;m throwing out the Norelco, and tossing my blades. At around $100, if it lasts 4 months it breaks even with the cost of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot compare to other foil shavers but vs. the 3 head norelcos this is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;* Cuts well - very close shave. I think 98% as close as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;* Cost effective&lt;br /&gt;* Wet/dry - nice for shaving any body parts in the shower, if you are into that.&lt;br /&gt;* Comfortable ergonomically - fits well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;* lockable/free floating head at the flip of a switch&lt;br /&gt;* very easy to clean - pop the top and rinse it out, or squirt soap on it and run it in turbo mode.&lt;br /&gt;* readout is easy to see...seems well organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;* You wouldn&#x27;t want to try to do detail work with this, like around a beard or mustache - the large head is more &amp;#34;lawn mower&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;weed trimmer&amp;#34;. But it does have the flip up trimmer on the back side for sideburns and that works about the same as others I&#x27;ve used (which is not that great by comparison to a razor blade)&lt;br /&gt;* I wish it had a stand so I could stand it up vs. laying it down, to take up less surface space.&lt;br /&gt;* Slightly slower than a blade shave, but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall highly recommended, very nice shaving razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE September 2014....I&#x27;ve been using this razor daily since I bought it in 2010...still going strong after 4 1/2 years. 3 years in I replaced the blades at $50 because they suggest doing it after 1. It wasn&#x27;t really necessary and didn&#x27;t shave any better than the original 3 year old blades. Still highly recommended...buy it. Solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Dec 2015 - Still going strong.

    <li> Since it arrived it my primary shaver.  It takes less than 3 min to shave and is almost as close as a razor.  Buy it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Keeps a good charge. Cleans easily. Handles well in and out of the shower. Blue looks cool too.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say that this is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever written a review for any product that I purchased on Amazon. However, I purchased this product based on the reviews that it got, and the fact that i was looking to try an electric shaver that was different from the Phillips Norelco, non-foil type shaver, which wasn&#x27;t that impressive at all as it did not get to all the areas of my face and neck effectively and needed several passes to get even a not so close shave, not to mention the irritation that it would leave on my face.   So I received it today and decided to give it a try. I used it in the shower, and let me tell you that I&#x27;m completely blown away..........waw! I heard that one should never expect as close a shave from an electric than from a regular razor, but this is as close a shave that I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I was so impressed by it that I thought that I must spread the word........Guys, GET ONE OF THESE! it requires minimal pressure on the skin and the motor is really fast and powerful. Cleanup is a breeze as well.........Incredible product!</li>
    <li> It works when the whiskers are shorter but if you let your face get a bit out of control, this does not do a good job.  Perfect for the shower, or for those who like a wet shave.</li>
    <li> I absolutely despise this product! Don&#x27;t let the reviews fool you, it&#x27;s not worth your time. I was recommended the product by a family member and after seeing how highly people were rating it, I decided to purchase it. And now I&#x27;m kicking myself over that stupid decision. I&#x27;ve tried this product multiple times. It&#x27;s advertised as a wet/dry shaver so I made sure to try it out in multiple different ways. I&#x27;ve shaved dry, I&#x27;ve shaved when my face is wet with water, and I&#x27;ve shaved with shaving gel. The product is awful in absolutely every case! The commercials I&#x27;ve seen for it claim that it uses &amp;#34;one-pass nano-technology&amp;#34; which is absolutely garbage. It takes pass after pass after pass after pass to even pick up SOME stubble! And after that, there&#x27;s still plenty of stubble left that it missed. It&#x27;s absolutely infuriating how terrible of a job it does. I&#x27;ve just gone back to using my standard Gillette disposable razors which work MUCH BETTER than this product. I&#x27;m returning it to Amazon for a refund, I&#x27;d rather use that $120 to buy enough disposable razors to last me years. Again, I highly recommend that you DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> For some reason the screen has a hole in it after 3 months of use, not sure how that happened. My son is usually keeps good care of his stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several rotary and coil razors in the past.  This is the first high dollar one i bought, its great my facial hair grows in fast and think, and if i use this razor once or twice a day, its get my skin just a smooth has any mach 3 or sheik quattero blade could.  Its a pricey unit, I got it in a really good sale price off amazon.  but well worth the money, buying disposable blades are really pricey and add up fast, so it should save money in the long run.  Another amazing panasonic product.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for years and owned only top of the line models. This one truly lives up to its hype. It is very easy on the face and comfortable to hold. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works very well wet or dry.  Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned in the last 30+ years.</li>
    <li> After three weeks I am impressed with my first Panasonic shaver. It consistently shaves close even during the more humid days. I will see how it holds up as relates to closeness and blade change out. I am pleased that I switched from Braun and thought I received good value for my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love my new shaver!  It works great and was a good buy decision.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> After a series of electric razors, both rotary and traditional, all of which were either initially or shortly thereafter disappointing, I&#x27;ve found one that satisfies me. Best of all, it delights my wife. Every shave now reveals a younger, happier me. Okay, maybe not a younger me. I&#x27;ve been working this visage of mine for 50 years now. But the Nano Arc IV tops any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever tried--and I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all. It&#x27;s not cheap; like love itself, it costs. But my wife&#x27;s approving glances, post shaving, tell me I&#x27;m making all the right moves now. Charges quickly, handles like a finely tuned Lotus Elan, and actually makes shaving enjoyable. I&#x27;d buy another in a heartbeat. And I&#x27;m shooting for lots more heartbeats.</li>
    <li> Brilliant Shaver, one of the best. Good engineering made in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend product. Good shipping speed by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just turned 60 and have always used a straight-edge razor to shave.  I was turned off by the price of the cartridges, so I decided to purchase my first electric razor.  I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long.  This razor works great.  It even cuts my neck hairs just fine and I love the ease of cleaning it.  I&#x27;ll never go back to straight-edged razors so long as the manufacturers continue to price their cartridges so high.</li>
    <li> somewhat disappointed</li>
    <li> This shaver is twice as fast as my two previous Norelco&#x27;s - 15 minutes rather than 30.  It has a high speed motor.  My best results are with the  head set for steady rather than floating.  For an electric, this is the one to buy! Still, a safety razor does give me a faster shave, nicks and all.</li>
    <li> ive used this for a couple of months now. for me it works great. with a regular razor i get irritation when im working because of sweat. this razor causes very little irritation. almost as close as a razor. i can shave my whole face in about 3 minutes but i might miss a few. if u take your time and shave in a mirror you could probably shave in 5 minutes or so. if i could shave with it plugged in it would get 5 stars.       this is my first electric razor and i love it. much easier and faster than regular razor.      i cant cut any hair on my adams apple or it will cut me a little though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 2 months, and it just died 2 days ago. Had it on the charger, and when it came off it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.     On the plus side, it worked very well, wet and dry, up until this point. Not sure what I&#x27;m going to replace it with. Panasonic doesn&#x27;t seem to have very good support for these products.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Panasonic wet/dry rechargeable shaver.  While they&#x27;ve all been adequate to good, the 8243 is fantastic...the best Panasonic shaver by far!!!</li>
    <li> This shaver is my first electric shaver. It works well, gives me a close shave, and is gentle on the skin for dry as well as wet shaving. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My Norelco 7616X would no longer hold a charge after many years of excellent results.  Based on positive reviews I purchased the Panasonic ES8243A.  I dry shave and found that the Panasonic was uneven in its shaving and could not shave hairs underneath my nose.  I tried pre shave lotion but no real improvement.  The only positives were the quick charge and easy grip along with and water for cleaning.  But the closeness of the shave if where the rubber meets the road and it does not measure up.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Mt husband loves this shaver. Says it&#x27;s the best shave he ever had. Wants to get another as a spare.</li>
    <li> Have always used a straight razer, because other shavers missed under my neck. But the Panasonic ES8243A works well in the shower - very satisfied...</li>
    <li> Is best electric shaver I have ever used.  Very happy and clean shaven.</li>
    <li> This is a decent shaver. I use it to shave my head. The first time I used it was the best time. It shaved really close very easy. But after that it&#x27;s been a bit of a hassle to get a close shave. It takes a lot of passes. But eventually I can get it as close as I want it. This is my first time shaving my head with any type of razor so I guess my head with have to get use to it.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric shaver. I&#x27;ve now used it five days in a row with no problems. It replaces another Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve had for about 10 or 15 years. I was happy with it but this one is even better. I use Edge shaving gel and my shaves are smooth, close and fast.</li>
    <li> First Panasonic shaver purchased. I like it so far,had it @ a month. The shaver is well balanced - I like the way the handle feels in my hand. It seems to be holding the charge well so far.&lt;br /&gt;I like the read out it gives on the percentage on the usage. It gives a pretty good shave and the trimmer while basic does the job.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Panasonic.  They are my razor of choice...I&#x27;ve tried them all.  My first one purchased in 2000 is still my favorite but the battery went out after a couple years and I was unable to replace it...  This one cuts very well but feels as though its not well built.  So far so go though.</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic shaver in a row.  I&#x27;ve used them for the last eleven (or so) years. I&#x27;ve had very good luck so I keep going back.  To me you can&#x27;t beat being able to wash it with soap and water. The blades in my last one lasted for as long as the razor (six or seven years) since I never used a brush on them. This is my first Nano razor and it&#x27;s quieter than my old one. I thought the high speed and bigger head would cut my shaving time in half, but it hasn&#x27;t really changed much. It does a much cleaner job, so I guess I&#x27;m not checking for stray wiskers like I used to. This razor has a bigger shaving foil and it seems bulky compared to my old one. I have a hard time shaving around my mustache without making it uneven, but that will probably get better.  I do like it!</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband,he really is pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, close shave, easy to clean, smooth operation. Battery life seem to be lower as compared to my prior Panasonic. I get 10 days out of this one, the manual promises 14. Perhaps it will be better after the break-in. One thing remains, Panasonic makes the best shavers I ever tried.</li>
    <li> I have more than several brands of electric shavers.  I wouldn&#x27;t give you five bucks for the Norelco Arcitec (their older, heavier models like the 8240, however, are excelent).  But this Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV gives the best shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I use the razor daily and it works great, only now am I needing to replace the foil and blades. It a good razor that gets a close shave.</li>
    <li> Gives adequate shave. Will use it for travel because lightweight and doesn&#x27;t require cleaning gear, but probably go back to my Braun for everyday.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned and used. My previous electric shavers include bruan series 3, travel shaver, and remington. This is by far the runaway winner. I did tons of research before buying this shaver.I knew I would want to spend around 100 bucks and this was available for 94.99 at the time of my purchase. I chose this because of the excessive amount of good reivews and it did not disappoint!     I believed this is the closest shave you can get with an electric shaver. (No electric shaver can compete with straight razor) Sure, you can try the best and the latest shavers such as the Braun Pulsonic or even the lastest 93k Panasonic Shavers for a lot more money. But this gets the JOB done. That&#x27;s the main goal right? I thought Braun Pulsonic shavers were overhyped and overpriced and it operate only at 10k RPM. This shaver runs at 13 RPM. 93k Panasonic seems too bulky for my likings and extra 100 dollars is not worth it. You do not need to pay extra money for newer products when this ES8243A does the same job if not better.       I use this Panasonic ES8243A everyday for about 3-4 minutes each time in the morning. It is convenient just like all electric shavers but it gives you the close shave and smoothness comparable to fusion pro-glide. I can grow about full beard in about 2 days and it gets every hair off of my face. I do not even get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow now because this shaver gets close as shaving with a razor. Also, I have sensitive skin and this shaver doesn&#x27;t not give me any redness or irritation at all.         Unless you are extremely lazy and have never wash anything in your life, you do NOT need its own cleaning device. All you need is remove the foil head and rinse under hot water for about 15-20 seconds. It has its own Turbo Mode used for cleaning running at 17k RPM.         All in all,   Pros  - Closest and smooth shave you can get with an electric! Can compete with the latest electric shavers.   - Powerful motor  - No irritation- Compact Design   - Around 100 bucks   - Quick charge and last around 10-14 days      Cons   - Bad placement for the pop up trimmer. The 4 blades gets in the way. And the trimmer itself is too small.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, great controls, great features, but it takes me so much longer to shave my face with this than it does a blade.  I have to keep going over the same areas to get them smooth.  Maybe all electric razors are like that?  If they are, then this should get 5 stars.  Maybe it&#x27;s because it only has 2 coils instead of 3?  I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, unfortunately.  If you&#x27;ve never used an electric, expect irritation for the first week or two, but then it goes away as your face gets used to it.</li>
    <li> Swear to God this thing is light, easy-to-handle, leaves your face smooth (even in hard areas)Waaaaaaaay better than the cumbersome,unwieldy Braun, with its stupid cleaning system. Hooray!!!</li>
    <li> My husband got this and says it gives him the closest shave he has ever gotten. He can&#x27;t believe how well it works. He will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews on shavers before deciding on this one. The 5 blade shaver was too expensive for me. This one certainly meets my requirements. I find that one charge does not hold as long as I was lead to believe, but I can cope with that. It certainly gives me a good shave. Haven&#x27;t tried it &#x27;wet&#x27; yet. Shaving cream/electric razer is hard for me to get my head around. (Old fogey.)</li>
    <li> I love this shaver it works great.  I had just bought a braun series 1 shaver and it was junk.  And I had 2 braun shavers before.  I have no complaints so far.  The battery lasts me long time GI and it shaves fast and close.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  He used it for the first time yesterday.  This is the first electric shaver he&#x27;s ever used so I think there&#x27;s a learning curve.  He used it wet and shaved his face, it really did a nice job.n very clean, smooth and we were both impressed.  He began to shave his head and then we were NOT so impressed.  We could still feel the stubble, so he redid it, but shaved very slowly and then WOW!  It was really smooth!  Instructions say it takes about a month to get used to a new shaver or system, so he says he&#x27;ll give it a month.  It&#x27;s easier to shave with than the conventional razor, but it did take twice as long.  In the end he was happy with the results, but it it takes significantly longer to shave, he&#x27;ll go back to using a razor.  Will try to respond back in 1 month.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old Panasonic electric shaver, which lasted for 7 years, including a year-long combat deployment in Iraq. Having made a previous mistake of switching to a Braun shaver, which yielded a terrible shave, I researched reviews on Amazon and other websites to find the very best replacement. Bingo! This model, the ES8243A , equipped with cool-sounding \\&quot;Nanotech Blades\\&quot; is a marked upgrade from my old reliable version. \\&quot;How so?\\&quot; Well, I&#x27;m glad you asked...&lt;br /&gt;1. Four blades are better than two. I know that this might provoke a \\&quot;No Duh\\&quot; response, but the added blade array cuts my average shave time in half.&lt;br /&gt;2. \\&quot;Silence is Golden\\&quot;. This razor is easily 50% quieter than my old one, even when my previous model was brand new. My Spousal Unit, who enjoys the perks of retirement such as sleeping in, while I&#x27;m up getting ready for work at Oh-Dark-Thirty, thanked me this morning for electing to shave on the drive to the office...then was surprised to find me clean-shaven. Nice dividend, though I ended up being late to work as a result...&lt;br /&gt;3. Lighter weight shaver (hey, 6 oz is 6 oz!) makes it a better travel partner. The power cord is also much lighter and less bulky. For longer trips, that&#x27;s a plus!&lt;br /&gt;4. Cleans up nicely using liquid soap and running water, so I don&#x27;t have to mess with that cumbersome cleaning base...which seemed like a good idea at the time, but in practice was about 10% Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;5. The blue color matches my eyes, which for some reason my Spousal Unit finds irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;6. The price was very reasonable, as I expect this sucker to last for at least 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;7. Last, but definitely NOT least, this razor gives me a superb, close, comfortable shave! I plan to try it in the shower once our in-progress bathroom remodel is completed, using the highly-recommended \\&quot;Billy Jealousy Shaving Gel\\&quot;. Spousal Unit has given two enthusiastic \\&quot;thumbs up\\&quot; for the scent, but we both think the name is goofy as hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only potential concern with the ES8243A is the lighter-construction of the shaver head, which is thin plastic. My old razor sported a metal head, which came in handy when my rucksack got dumped out of the helo 15 feet above the LZ. (Long story, but the razor survived intact.)y potential concern with the ES8243A is the lighter-construction of the shaver head, which is thin plastic.

    <li> Bought this in the spring of 2010 so have over 1 1/2 years experience.  Not quite as close as a blade, and takes a little longer than a blade, but does a great job.  Takes about 1-2 weeks for your face to adjust to an electric razor.  Can get 5 long shaves off one charge.  Automatically adapts for European current (no converter required).  Can use in the shower or not.  Great for traveling, in a plane or train.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST SHAVE I&#x27;VE EVER GOTTEN.  YOU COULD SHAVE UNDER WATER WITH THIS UNIT.  GOT MINE FOR $104 AT CHRISTMAS.  HO HO HO</li>
    <li> This razor does a very good job on both my face and my head.  Yes I use it to shave both I find it gives me a clean complete shave in 10 min (wet).  I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s so most of my facial hair is grey but this razor takes it to them.  I either use the ES8243A wet or I will use it with a pre shave gel which I find give the better results.  I found dry shaving takes more time and doen&#x27;t get as close.  Wet gives me to closest shave I have ever had by any other razor.      For years I used the Hydra razor and the Fusion recently but got tired of the constant nicks and burns.  Plus neither one ever matched up to what they boast.  So when I looked into electric razors I spent alot of time looking at reviews and consumer search sites.  Panasonic was always in the top 5.  I settled on the ES8243A because I didn&#x27;t need the cleaning unit.  This unit is so easy to clean and maintain.      Thanks Panasonic!</li>
    <li> Easy to clean, easy to use, gets a pretty close shave except around the neckline. Has held it&#x27;s battery charge for a while as well.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is awesome.  I get a super close shave on my very dense beard.  It is lite weight and is easy to use.  The battery duration is exceptional.  Icing on the cake is this shavers ability to be used dry and in he shower!!!</li>
    <li> I lost my Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out to be a pretty good thing as I discovered this Panasonic!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s twice as good as any Braun at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for three weeks now. I used it every other day for the first two weeks to break it in.   It cuts closer than I expected from an electric shaver. It does a good job even on my neck.   It holds a charge for a long time. It seems to have a powerful motor unlike some of the cheaper rotary shavers   I have used in the past that are too weak to do a decent job. I like this no frills electric shaver. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband back in september 2010 and works very good. Make sure you keep the info for replacements. It is very quite compared to his old Panasonic!!</li>
    <li> Razor did not shave well after about 6 months.  Replacement head quite expensive.  A cheap Braun works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to receive a previously opened Panasonic shaver from Amazon.com.  I purchased a new product, but got someone&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;return.  The box was ripped and taped back together.  A black Sharpy pen had been used to cover up the tears.  What a disappointment for such an expensive product.  Shame on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> best electric razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I had been shopping for a new electric shaver for about two years. I had owned several Norelco triple head shavers, but they never gave me the shave I was looking for. Then I was asked by my daughter to check out this Panasonic ES8243A because she was looking for a gift for her husband. After researching this razor, I decided to purchase it for myself. Once received and charged, I was so pleased with the performance, the feel and fit, the easy use case and the simplicity of how easy this razor is cleaned. This razor is the closest electric shave to a blade than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I am sold on Panasonic. The quality is far superior, as Panasonic makes commercial grade products used by hair dressers and barbers. I rate this shaver a full 5-Stars. 100% satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with a rotary(S) for 40+ years and this is perfect.  Time left on charge, when to clean and other info comes up on the display.  After 3 days of break-in, the shave was stellar.</li>
    <li> The positive reviews about this razor were precise. I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor in the shower or with shaving cream and can&#x27;t wait to use it that way. I just used it on my bald head,face,neck and under chin and I am glad I purchased this razor. Its like a Thousand bee&#x27;s inside it as far as the sound goes. Never once did it pull a hair, hurt or burn. If your like me and have a few hairs under chin/neck area that is almost laying sideways or flat to skin, then you will have to turn the razor sideways and kind of rake the area more than once to get that hair lift for a good bite of the razor. Once you do this, those left over sleeping hairs are gone for sure. It is the best razor I have every experienced so far. I had did some research and read comments and a lot data gathering before I settled on this razor. The only thing I personally wished it had was the ability to accept disposable batteries instead of charge with cord only. Bald people out there this razor is for you! A very close shave &#x3D; to a razor blade.</li>
    <li> This Pabasonic is the great investment to the newest technology. Before that I used a Braun shaver and would like to buy new Braun. As the Braun comes mostly with cleaner system which don&#x27;t nessesary at all, i&#x27;d prefer to buy this Panasonic and i&#x27;m very happy with my choice! Highly reccomended!</li>
    <li> In my search of a electric razor to use in the shower after the battery of my Norelco Cool Skin went south, I went to Amazon to see what everyone else thought was the best razor for that purpose was. Thinking I was just going to buy another Norelco, I changed my mind when I read most the reviews on the ES8243A. I didn&#x27;t think I had anything to loose since if I didn&#x27;t like it I could return it to Amazon no questions asked. Now I&#x27;m 63 and have never found a electric razor that would cleanly cut the hairs smoothly on my neck. They go every which way and are tough. To my surprise, the first time I stepped in the shower with a 4 day growth and used the ES8243A I was sold. First time I didn&#x27;t have to follow up with a blade razor on my neck. I&#x27;m a Believer! This razor really impressed me and as my wife is always telling me, \\&quot;you never have anything good to say about anything you buy. You always find something wrong with it\\&quot;. Well not this time, at least not yet. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry. And the nonsense about giving your face 30 days to adjust, unless you are coming off a blade. I agree with others, and I quote, \\&quot;if you are accustomed to an electric shaver, you only need a week or two to determine the difference. The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund\\&quot;.    8/1/11 Update. Still as pleased as can be with this razor. Found that when it tells me to clean it, I just apply  a little body wash in my hand and turn the sonic speed on and in seconds it&#x27;s clean. Simple.</li>
    <li> I have an industrial strength beard and had to shave every day for like 10 minutes.  For decades I&#x27;ve used Eltron then Braun high-end shavers and they worked well.  My latest Braun, only a few years old, died and needed major work so I shopped Amazon.  I use 40% of the battery with each shave so 2 shaves per charge.  This shaver gets the job done 2X faster and cuts deeper.  My face and neck feel smooth with much less effort.  It is a dream!  More expensive Braun goes in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I tried several other electric razors before I tried this. This fast, powerful razor works fine if I shave every day. If I skip shaving for a day I still have to use a razor.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this little machine. Excellent quality, excellent size and excellent performance. I&#x27;ve used electrics before and have always gone back to blades, but not this time. It&#x27;s amazing how fast it charges up, too. Very easy to clean as well. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Pros:  -  Shaves very closely  -  Easy to Clean  Cons:  -  Makes a cheap sounding vibrating plastic sound when in use  -  Does not work when battery is gone but is plugged in and charging.  (This was pretty surprising.  Once you&#x27;re out of battery, it turns back on again for a few seconds then dies, but WILL NOT work again when plugged in.  Must wait for charge to build up again.)  -  All the edges are rounded and hidden from view when in use so precise edge-shaving is out of the question.  It&#x27;s all guess work.  -  $$$!</li>
    <li> Love it, Works great!!</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is acceptable. My previous review lambasted it for several reasons, but I have decided that it is not so bad after all. I clean it with warm water from the faucet and it stands up to water permeation perfectly -- no problems with water damage. Only complaint is that it still does not do the best job on my neck. Cheeks and chin it gets very well but my neck always requires the beard trimmer piece to clean it up evenly.  While this may seem like a personal problem, I disagree. I have had this item for over a year and it is still the same deal. I could hack away at my neck stubble all day and all it does is irritate my skin without cutting much.</li>
    <li> Got as a present for my father. Works great, He loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver 15 months ago after a 10 year old Panasonic that cost $300 crapped out on me. I liked the old one but didn&#x27;t want to spend as much money so I got this one. It works just fine! I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy a higher priced model. It does not include any kind of holder, which I was used to with the old one, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver provides as close to a blade shave as possible. The popup trimmer works great as well. Wet or dey I truly love shaving with my Panasonic ES8243A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been living with several Norelco&#x27;s and Remingtons as well as conventional blade razors for many years. After reading so many positive reviews of the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano, I decided to give it a try. Wow! Why did I wait so long to try a different brand? My shaves are quick and really clean, just like I shaved with a blade. Amazing, and satisfying. I&#x27;m enjoying shaving again.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND SAYS IT IS OK, BUT NOT LIKE A BLADE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for years, and finally tried this razor on the advice of some friends.  Overall, it&#x27;s able to shave more closely than the norelco did, but it can still be hard to get the neck completely close.  Very satisfied, though.  Will definitely get another Panasonic as needs require.</li>
    <li> Closer shave and easier to clean    the Battery does not last quite as long.... but still 3-4 weeks for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works great. Closest shave I ever gotten from an electric shaver. Perfect for wet or dry shave. Easy to clean and has a freat display telling you what it needs charge, cleaning, how much power is left, and how long it took to shave. Would buy a panasonic again</li>
    <li> I have been using the Norelco brand shaver for years and thought I would give this panasonic a try. Its pretty darn good. Closeness---slight edge to the Norelco.  Cost-- large edge to Panasonic  Norelco does hold the charge longer.  Thats no big deal. Overall, a good buy.</li>
    <li> i have had the worst luck with razors, ive tried everything but i always had breakouts on my neck. once i started using this one though i have not had a breakout, i use it dry. i also use the razor to shave my head, it gets as close as a blade if not a little closer, my head gets baby butt smooth. i highly recommend this product, been using it for three months and it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> this shaver is a very good shaver, and by that i mean it gets a close shave in about 2 minutes and doesnt pinch.  easy to clean, nice to hold.  overall, its just a very good razor for the price and i would absolutely recommend it to someone else</li>
    <li> I have regularly used a Braun 790 shaver for many years. This Panasonic is the first shaver that I have tried that gives as good a shave as my Braun. I now use both of them and I am equally satisfied with the shave I get from each.</li>
    <li> This razor is better than my previous Panasonic razor.  The battery in my old Panasonic ES8152 has a short life after over 5 years of use.  I decided to try this new ES8243A since I was so happy with my previous razor.  All I can say is that the shave is better and I don&#x27;t have to make as many passes.  I shave my head and my face on a daily basis so my previous razor was used well over 2000 times without a flaw.  I always use the razor wet for that very smooth close shave.  My friends do not believe that I use an electric on my head.  I could continue my old razor but I wanted to upgrade.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  Been using electrics for 40 years and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Haven&#x27;t tried it wet, but cleaning under the tap with a little liquid soap is great.    Reccommend to anyone.  Even my wife likes it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype.  I wanted to try a new, state of the art shaver, and was impressed by the reviews on this page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this shaver to be screechy loud, quite harsh on the skin, actually causing a mild folliculitis on the front part of the neck under the jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to finish up with my Gillette Trac II plus to get a true, close shave, due to residual beard stubble that just wouldn&#x27;t go away with this over-priced gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 2012 update: sending it to the garbage heap.</li>
    <li> I have a cat who, back when I had whiskers and a mustache, liked to settle on my chest just after I woke up and nuzzle my face, and then when I least expected it, would yank out a mustache hair. That&#x27;s what it was like with the electric razor I inherited from my dad when he got a new one. Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, OUCH! As a result, I gave up on electrics and went to blades during the clean-shaven phases of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disposables work well the first few times, but invariably let you know when to replace them by the amount of blood they draw. Plus, I have this scar on my upper lip from a flying piece of metal in the machine shop that&#x27;s difficult to shave around, hence the long periods of facial hairyness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, however, I&#x27;m embarking on a new career which requires me to be clean-shaven. Tired of disposables, I read the reviews on Amazon and decided to give the Panasonic a try, primarily because I can use it in the shower to save a little time in the mornings. I&#x27;m pleased to say the shaver has lived up to its reviews. My face feels as clean as with a blade, but without the fear of cuts. I can even bear down a little on the upper lip scar; no problems and it&#x27;s as clean as a whistle. After only two weeks, I&#x27;m VERY pleased with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it with just a wet face, but it does need a soap for smooth motion. When I used a blade, my choice of soap was a shaving gel. That works okay with the razor, and I got about the same results with a drugstore generic foam for sensitive faces, but the best results of all have been with a coconut oil based liquid soap called Dr. Bronner&#x27;s that my wife uses. Just a couple or three drops rubbed between the hands then applied on a wet face gives me that blade-close shave. The daily morning chore is a chore no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the battery life, I&#x27;ve been getting 9 shaves to the charge (I recharge it when it gets down to 10%). It is indeed waterproof, and the small cheapo mirror I hung in the shower makes it easy to see and get at all the areas of beard (if the mirror fogs, rub a couple of fingers on the soap bar then wipe the mirror with them to keep the fog off). You&#x27;ll need to experiment for a bit for find the best motion pattern for making sure you get all the stubble off.the areas of beard (if the mirror fogs, rub a couple of fingers on the soap bar then wipe the mirror with them to keep the fog off). You&#x27;ll need to experiment for a bit for find the best motion pattern for making sure you get all the stubble off.</li>
    <li> After 12 months of use, the charging/cleaning station simply will not turn on.  No lights, nothing.  But you can&#x27;t just buy the cleaning station, you have to purchase an entire new razor.  Very disappointed in quality in the long run.</li>
    <li> After noticing the positive reviews for this wonderful Panasonic shaver, I purchased one thru amazon for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its the first electric shaver I have ever purchased, I mostly prefered the old school shaving technique. Anyhow it has a great color combination and is excellent built. After 2 weeks of use, I noticed the battery lasts just 5-6 shaves per charge. I am impressed it shaves very close wet or dry, but the major problem is the neck area. About 25 percent of neck hair remains no matter how many times I try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess there is no perfect electric shaver, the Panasonic shaves very close on the face but the neck area is an issue. I found a solution to this, I use the trimmer on the neck and it works.</li>
    <li> I have always used a rotary type shaver, predominantly the Norelco line, and this method of shaving is quite new to me. It has taken a good month to get my face to adapt to this method of shaving and I have been getting the closest shave I have had in years except for a razor.  So I am happy with the purchase and would recommend this razor to all.  Shaving in the shower is very convenient and this razor excels in the water with or without soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for reviews but I felt the need to write one for this product as there are many electric razors to choose from and the reviews that I found although outdated were very helpful.      Ok, for starters, I was very reluctant to purchase a foil shaver and did my share of research prior to purchasing this item.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver a little over three weeks and at this point I absolutely love it and won&#x27;t be going back to a manual razor any time soon.  For best results, I shave in the shower with some shaving cream and it shaves as close as a manual razor but with less time.  Also I would like to point out that some of the cons that I saw for this item was the battery life in between charges.  I&#x27;m in week three still on the original charge at only at 50 percent.</li>
    <li> So I am a believer in razors getting a close shave. One thing that you have to understand about me is that I have a very rough beard. So if I wait to long it can horrible to shave. So I wanted to get an electric razor to try out. I didn&#x27;t like the electric razors I have tried from friends. They were the circular kind. So i sent out to get a linear one. Well, I got this one and it has done me well. I actually used it today in the shower and it works well. I have tried to use it with shaving cream, conditioner, dry, and wet with water and for my face wet with water works best. Keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s face is different and it will take a little time to find what works best. I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried it dry, wet, with shaving cream and brush, I tried with hot water and after bath, tried different angles and ways. What are the odds! everybody else is happy with this product for me it is !!!!!!!!!!1 (in one line, IT&#x27;S NOT WORKING).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not I&#x27;m spending 20 mins with this it hardly manages to shave 50%. I have to use traditional razor to complete my shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is redirecting me to Panasonic telling that 30 days return period is over. I tried to call Panasonic twice but I couldn&#x27;t reach them. I have purchased this product based on the amazing review in amazon.com and other places too. I bought it here as the seller is amazon it self assuming that I would be on safer side. Finally this is what happened. I sad to have this kind of experience with amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anybody want video review I can provide</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife. She prefers a man&#x27;s shaver. She believes they are more durable than a ladies. She has used it several times since Christmas and gives it rave initial reviews. She also likes the pop up trimmer feature.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8243A about a month ago. I am absolutely satisfied with this product, use wet and dry method and get a close shave every time. If your looking at this razo..do not hesitate...BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver about a month now.  I was not totally sold on it the first few shaves but after getting my face broken in on a elec shaver (I have used a blade several years)I am completely sold on it. Elec shavers I have used in the past would not cut my neck hairs and every several days I would have to get a razor after them, not now.  This Panasonic does the job, I am completely sold on it.  Oh yea, and my wife thinks my face is soft again.</li>
    <li> I have shaved my head since 1996 and have been through many devices since then. This is hands down the best electronic device to provide that service so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sworn by Norelco® triple-headers for years and laughed at the thought of trying to shave my hard, round head with a rectangular screen, when the three &#x27;floating&#x27; heads of the Norelco seemed to get every nook and cranny, scar and bump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read reviews of this Panasonic® and convinced myself that it wasn&#x27;t very pricey and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The first time I used it, I made a pass on the side of my head above my right ear and then paused, felt the newly-shaved patch and marveled: That one was one close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is definitely louder than the Norelco, but the 13,000 RPM motor makes quick work and smooth shaving a breeze. (NOTE: I only get 4-5 days of shaving between charges if I do both head and beard; the Norelco provides at least double that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah--I could get a little closer with a blade, but who wants to cut their head shaving AND pay Gillette an arm and a leg for a small package of Fusion® blades on what seems to be a way too frequent basis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is the very flimsy &#x27;traveling case&#x27; that is nothing more than a thin leather-like, zippered, razor-shaped bag -- that does not protect the razor in almost any way (unless you are worried about scratches). The first time I tucked it into my suitcase, I accidentally hit the &#x27;on&#x27; button on the razor through the case. Good thing I heard its 13,000 RPM engine to alert me before I closed the lid!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, and it holds a charge for about a week of shaving.  When it does need to be recharged, you can get enough of a charge for a quick shave after 10-15 minutes of charging.  The head snaps apart for easy cleaning.  Have not tried using it in the shower, even though it says you can.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver (model 8243A) this past May 2009. It&#x27;s my third Panasonic shaver. I&#x27;ve tried Brauns, Norelcos, and even a Grundig shaver over the years, but Panasonic seems to be the best - for me at least. I have sensitive skin, so shaving in the shower works best to keep the blades cool and delivers an irritation free, very close shave (try this shaver in combination with a little Billy Jealousy Hydroplane Shaving Cream for a truly close, irritation free shave). I would say an even better shave than the Gillette Fusion because I experience absolutely no minor cuts or irritation when using the Panasonic. (I only use the Gillette when I forget to charge my shaver!)    Like I said, I purchased this shaver this past May, and five months later the LCD began displaying unintelligible readings. Then the shaver just died - it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I&#x27;ve never had that sort of problem with my Panasonics in the past, and since it was still well within the 2 year warranty, I contacted Panasonic by phone. I was instructed to ship the shaver to their service center in Texas. About 2 weeks later, I received a new replacement shaver in the mail, and get this, Panasonic sent me a brand spankin&#x27; new model ES8249K - the Arc 4 Nanotech shaver with the Vortex cleaning system. I was a little annoyed by the turn around time, but it was obviously worth the wait! The ES8249K shaves exactly the same as the 8243A - it&#x27;s the same shaver but just can be used in the Vortex, whereas the 8243A can&#x27;t. Thanks Panasonic for your awesome shaving product and awesome customer support! You&#x27;ve got a loyal customer in me, and like Ahhnold in The Terminator, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll be baaaack\\&quot; when it&#x27;s time to purchase my next shaver! :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver, opened the box, turned it on and it was so loud that I didn&#x27;t even want to put it near my face.  It takes me about 7 to 10 minutes to shave and having this shaver next to my ear for that period of time was a scary thought.  My previous shaver was a Norelco which was much much quieter.  I also didn&#x27;t like how big the head of the Panasonic shaver was.  It looked too big to shave the area under my nose.  I packed up the Panasonic shaver and returned it without even using it so I can&#x27;t comment on how it shaves.  I then bought the Norelco 8240XL which is 75% quieter than the Panasonic and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> After fewer than 15 shaves I love the comfortable feel of the razor in my hand, the power of the razor, the close, smooth shave it gives, the quick, easy cleaning process, and the digital display that tells everything you need to know. The somewhat short battery life is more than compensated for by the fast recharge. At a little over $100, it&#x27;s a bargain and the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned in 60 years of shaving.   --Steve DeWolf   Hendersonville, NC</li>
    <li> This a very good shaver and works well on tuff beards. This is the best shaver I have had by far. Cleans easy and I really like being able to see how much time I have used it and battery life. Takes very little time to charge it and seems to hold a charge for a week.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and effective, although a bit slower than I would prefer</li>
    <li> Good razor, no complaints, like the wet dry, east to clean.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a couple of weeks now and I am very pleased with it.  I have used an electric razor for several years as I would get cuts regularly with a regular razor.  However, this razor is much better than either of the previous two electric razors I have had.  I did spend a little more on this one than the last one but I think the three advantages to this one are the moving head, the four blades and the fact that you can shave with shaving gel  vs dry.  This razor in my opinion shaves almost as close as a regular razor but without the razor burns and cuts you get from a regular razor.  With my old electric razor if I didn&#x27;t shave for a day I would have to use a regular razor as my electric razor would not shave me well with that much growth.  This Panasonic razor has no problem giving me a great shave even after skipping a day of shaving.  It did take my face a couple of weeks to adjust to the closer shave.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a very good product.  I say this after having previously owned two Remington electric shavers (about 4 years), the last one being the Remington Titanium MS280 shaver.  I have also been a long-time wet shaver and have a ton of experience with Mach 3, Schick Quattro, and Merkur Double Edge razors (have tried Feather, Gillette, Bic, Dorco, Crystal, Derby, Merkur, etc. blades) via wet shaving.  The Remington shavers usually got a pretty close shave, however this close shave was accompanied by a lot of skin irritation (razor burn), mostly around the neck area due to repeated passes; although, I did find that applying baby powder before the shave would help with the burning a bit.  As for the wet shaves, they mostly produced very close shaves, but often the amount of time it would take me to achieve such a close shave (on average about 15-20 mins.), and the resulting nicks and cuts on my face, plus ingrown hairs, eventually had me abandon this method of shaving.  It wasn&#x27;t efficient and ultimately became incredibly frustrating - I tried before-shower, after-shower, shave brush, no shave brush, and used tons of different types of shave creams and gels and ridiculous combinations of this and that before I said, this sucks.      So, my brother purchased this same shaver, but with the cleaning dock.  He let me do a trial shave on his, so I have to give him credit for introducing me to this product, even though I ended up buying the shaver without this cleaning dock.    A little bit about me, my beard, and my shaving habits - I&#x27;m a 25 year-old engineer, I have incredibly sensitive skin (I sunburn easily, get razor burn easily, and get dry skin often in the winter), my beard is pretty dense (about 7/10 on the density scale), not extremely dense, but the whiskers are extremely coarse (about 9/10 on the coarseness scale) and curve slightly toward my face after a few days of growth; consequently, my beard is very prone to ingrown hairs.  I shave around 4-5 days per week, usually letting the weekend scruff go for about 2-3 days.  When I shave, it&#x27;s usually in the mornings (pre-shower). I always shave dry, but do apply Williams Lectric shave (w/ Green Tea extract) to my beard pre-shave to straighten those whiskers and slightly lubricate the shaving surface of my skin.  One complete and close shave, usually after one full day&#x27;s growth, will take me about 7-8 mins. on average.    Now to the review:  Sound when operating - In my opinion the Remington shavers that I have used emitted a much deeper-toned and coarser piercing sound when in operation.  This sound was often pretty loud also (9/10 on loudness scale), and sometimes would hurt my ears when I was shaving close to them.  The Remington shavers would often pull slightly on my hairs when going over them, and the motor would noticeably strain when navigating through thick patches on my face, most notably on my chin and stache regions. This Panasonic shaver, by comparison, has a much higher-pitched sound - I believe due to its much higher RPM motor.  The motor really seems to have plenty of power, even for my very coarse beard.  I&#x27;ve heard some people say this Panasonic shaver is pretty loud.  I would say that in comparison to the Remingtons I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s definitely quieter and less harsh on the eardrums.  That being said, it is not a very quiet shaver.  It reminds me a bit of my Sonicare toothbrush with that high-pitched almost sonic wine, and this sound coupled with the sound of your hairs being mowed down can be considered somewhat noisy by some people&#x27;s standards.  In my opinion though, this thing is a 7/10 on the loudness scale, about average, but definitely tolerable (a 10/10 would be ear-piercing and painful most of the time).    Closeness of shave - This thing definitely gets a pretty close shave.  It does have four blades, as advertised.  It has two independent blades within the shaving compartment of the shaving head, and two additional blades located on the exterior of the shaving head, located between the two screens protecting the two internal blades.  The two blades on the surface of the razor head interlock with each other during operation to create the effect of a trimmer almost (imagine two razor sharp screens slightly overlapping each other; the hairs enter the holes in the screen, and as the screens move toward each other, they cut the hairs; the screens move out again away from each other such that the holes realign and the hair slips in again. Etc., etc.  This repeats but at hyper speed!).  Hopefully I was able to explain the operation of the external blades ok.  Altogether, the four blades working together in sonic-speed harmony really seem to create an irritation-free shave, and never do I notice a hair-pulling sensation as I did with the Remington shavers.  The biggest plus with this razor is that is produces little but mostly 0% shaving irritation!  Usually, I get no irritation at all whatsoever; although I have to say that on occasion, when I spend too much time on my neck going over the same area several times, I will get a very slight burning sensation, but this never results in really any redness - just a slight burning sensation (nothing a little bit of Nivea post-shave lotion can&#x27;t fix!!)  This phenomenon really threw me at first but after using this razor for almost 2 months now, I am REALLY impressed with that aspect of the shave.  Overall, the closeness of the shave above my jaw-line would rank a 9/10 (10/10 being a Mach III shave) and about an 8.5/10 on my neck.  Pretty good considering the short time invested.    Design - This thing fits pretty ergonomically in my hand.  It is very lightweight and sits comfortably in my hand during operation.  The high motor speed transfers very little vibration to the handle or head surface, resulting in a very comfortable and manageable grip and shave.  The shiny blue body is very sharp, especially in contrast with the orange font digital readout on the LCD screen,telling you the elapsed time of the shave in minutes and seconds (i.e., 7&#x27;08\\&quot; would be 7 mins. 8 secs.).  This screen also flashes the battery life remaining (i.e., 80%) for about 3 seconds after you turn the razor off but before the screen dims completely for power-down.  There is a single push button power switch to turn the razor on and off.  It is conveniently located and the razor reacts instantly once it is pushed.  If you hold this button down for greater than say 5 seconds, it will enact \\&quot;cleaning mode\\&quot; which basically is like a turbo mode that increases the motor RPMs and lasts for about 20 seconds before turning off automatically (I have not found a real use for this feature yet).  The razor head is somewhat bulky in size, and the cover enclosing the screen is made of a durable and lightweight plastic, as is most of the razor.  Note - the large razor head does make it somewhat difficult to shave around facial hair, i.e., sideburns, stache, goatee, etc. due to its wide size.  The razor head is spring loaded with a gentle suspension that allows the head to tilt left and right, up and down, to better glide along the contours of your face.  The head may also be switched to the locked position, which will give the head rigidity and restrict its movement.  The trimmer that pops out is somewhat useful but it is not the best design I&#x27;ve seen.  In this respect, the Remington razors do outperform this Panasonic here in terms of trimmer effectiveness, use, and design.  The somewhat narrow Panasonic trimmer pops out at about a 110 degree angle from the body and seems to have a difficult time staying in the locked position whenever I use it to trim any stubborn hairs that I missed during shaving.  Also, the funky angle that this trimmer sits when extended makes it tough to trim missed hairs on your face, but especially more difficult to do so on the neck.  For making a straight edge on sideburns, it works quite well, however.    Cleaning - The reason I purchased this standalone razor over the package with the cleaning and charging dock is pretty simple.  You don&#x27;t need the charging/cleaning dock!  Cleaning this razor is effortless.  As many have said here, a drip of dish soap on the screen spread with your finger all over the razor head while running under hot water for about 20 seconds is all you really need (do this while the razor is on of course).  I of course pop off the razor head to make sure to rinse off the internal compartment with the internal blades (do this when the razor is off so water doesn&#x27;t splash all over the place), but in total, cleaning takes about 30 seconds!!  This is great because I have felt that my Remington dry razors would sometimes accumulate bacteria on the screen over time and this would be evident on my face via breakouts of achne, etc.    Charging and battery life - Charging is a breeze and takes about an hour from 0% - 100%, as others have said here.  The cord plugs directly into the wall and plugs right into the bottom of the razor.  I would say that the battery life, for me, lasts about the equivalent of 4-5 good shaves.  Also, this is rated for up to 220 volts AC.  Just brought this with me on my on trip to Australia and it handled the 220V AC power there no problem.  (US uses 110V AC power).    Overall impression and final notes - If you buy this razor, you must know this FACT: this will not get quite as close as a Mach 3!  However, it gets pretty dang close!  If you are willing to compromise a bit of shave closeness in exchange for ZERO irritation, then this is the razor you&#x27;ve been waiting for.  For me, using this razor saves me time, as compared with wet shaving with a  Mach III, so in my case, this is an added benefit.  This shaver claims that it will get a close shave on the first pass, but I have yet to see this.  Often I will go over the same area a few times (gently of course, and that is key!) to make sure that I get every hair ground down as close as possible.  This is especially true on my neck, as the hairs seem to change direction all over the place.  Also, I find that stretching the skin on your neck during shaving with this razor will help to expose some hard-to-cut hairs, especially on the outer regions and on the adam&#x27;s apple.  Definitely use some sort of pre-shave lotion.  As I said previously, Williams Lectric shave is definitely liquid gold, super cheap, and will last you a while.  People with facial hair may find this razor has a tough time shaving around such places.  This razor works best for full-face and neck shaves, with minimal facial hair to navigate around.  The replacement blade/screen razor head cartridges are expensive ($50), but this annual cost is still cheaper than buying Mach III refills and shaving cream over the span of a year.  Very importantly, this shave is most efficient after a day or two of full growth.  Any more growth than this, and this razor really becomes less efficient.  I tried shaving a week&#x27;s worth of growth and it takes a lot longer (2x)!  It also requires use of the trimmer to get the longer growth hairs that this razor seems to miss beyond 3 day&#x27;s growth.  And lastly, don&#x27;t buy the cleaning dock!  It is truly a gimmick and a waste of money!  Otherwise, props to Panasonic for this tactfully engineered consumer grade electric shaver!  I am a new convert!    Cheers,    Rob</li>
    <li> Purchased ES8243A on 7-25-11 - I use once a day - clean per instructions - on 1-5-12 noticed shaver leaving scratches on my face - upon closer inspection found that blades had ate a small hole in foil - this after less than six months usage - called panasonic customer service who told me that the foil was a consumable item and not under warranty and is recommended to be replaced once a year - I asked how much they charge for replacement foil - $60 - I asked her if she thought that was reasonable to expect to spend $60 every 6 months and her response was that she could not help - not an inexpensive shaver to have such short life on foil - shame as I liked the shave I got with it</li>
    <li> My facial skin is very sensitive. I have tried many electric shavers, regular razors, creams and lotions combinations, but I could never shave more than once every three days. I had to wait for my skin to cool down and the razor burns to go away.   This shaver is amazing, if I shave everyday it doesn&#x27;t give me any burns either wet or dry. Wet gives a closer shave.  Very well done Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I am coming from a Panasonic ES8043 which after 3 years started have battery problems.  At 3 1/2 years the charge would only last for 2 days.    I chose the ES8243A based on the reviews and the fact that I did like how my old unit shaved.  This razor is a bit smaller in the hand which took some getting used to but it did a better job of shaving may face.  My face did not have a problem getting use to the shaver since it was most likely use to the previous one.  I love the digital display to let me know how much of a charge is left.  The charge is lasting me 10-14 days.    Cleaning the shaver is easy without needing any special chemicals or container.    My issue is with the foil.  You are supposed to remove after shaving so as to clean the unit.  The foil feels fragile and I have had some difficulty getting it to snap back into place.  I do believe that this is a weak spot for the unit and that I may have to replace the foil often (price is about $35 on Amazon).    Overall a very good shaver but only time will tell if the foil is durable and if the battery will last.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how good this machine is. It gives me an smooth and deep shave, that last longer. Very good battery charge, usually good for two weeks. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my husband and loved his so much, I bought myself one! Works great for a time saving shave or for a person who has trouble with tub or shower shaving due to mobility or lighting issues. My husband likes it if&lt;br /&gt;he uses it every day or every other day. Prefers a traditonal razor shave if it has been several days. He says it doesnt do as good on longer hair, not as close of a shave. He and I both really like it! Just keep in mind its purpose and the directions for use. We wouldnt be happy if someone took them away from us. We go to them daily or so. The best electric shaver we have found thus far anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these as birthday gifts, based on reviews I read online. So far the guys have not complained and they both have tough beards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited for awhile to rate this product and I&#x27;m not happy with it at all.  The battery does not last over 3 days and the shave is inconsistant.  Worked well for the first couple of weeks and that was it, my old razer works better than this unit.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He has always used Remington shavers but for the past few years their quality has been awful. So after reading reviews on many different shavers I decided to take a chance on this one.  All I can say is WOW he loves this shaver.  His beard is very heavy and coarse but this razor gives him a very smooth shave and it doesn&#x27;t should like he&#x27;s using a wood chipper. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation on his neck or ingrown hairs.  He used to use a skin prep before he shaved but now he doesn&#x27;t have to.  This razor was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am coming from an older high end Panasonic shaver. This one is lighter, cuts faster, charges very fast, and gives an excellent shave. I&#x27;d say it actually gives credence to the old saw \\&quot;Shaves as close as a blade\\&quot;.    The shaver comes with a carrying case along with the power cord. My previous shaver had a charging stand and could be charged while wet. This one is a direct connect, so is not quite as \\&quot;safe\\&quot; but works well and makes the whole package less bulky.    I highly recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a fast, close shave. I have been using it dry with no irritation and for the money is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Product arrived and was defective even after using it is barely shaved any hair at all.  Probably defective blades or something. I mean it didn&#x27;t cut at all. I looked to make sure there were blades inside it. There were. Overall this felt very cheaply made with the part that holds the foil feeling very flimsy. I had bought this for a travel razor since my Braun 9595 needs that blue flammable liquid and you can&#x27;t take that on a plane. I guess I&#x27;ll stick with Braun. I never shave wet, takes too much time and I often have to shave twice a day as it is.</li>
    <li> Charges quickly,  I use it for myself (female) no nicks, it pivots for behind knees , over knees etc... great.  Better than any women&#x27;s razor out there.  Leaves skin smooth, even underarms.  Power button in bad spot, have turned off several times while shaving by hitting the button by accident and it is harder to use on long hairs.  Cleans easy.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco, Braun and now Panaonic shavers. None have done a great job on my neck area with Norelco being the worst, Panasonic 2nd and Braun 1st. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this razor. It is quiet and shaves my face well, but it just couldn&#x27;t handle my neck, forcing me to reshave with a standard razor to clean up the areas it missed. Charging was fast and the shaver is quiet. I do not like that the shaver cannot be used with mains power, so if the battery ever fails you MUST send it in to have the battery replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands I am going back to my 8000 series Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this shaver.  It does what it claimed and works well in the shower.  I have been with Braun for years, but this is a good shaver for a lot less.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun&#x27;s for the last 10 - 12 years and I thought I was getting a pretty good shave.  I decided to switch to this Panasonic and the difference is unbelievable.  I could not get a closer shave, even with a blade.  The cleaning process is so simple and it recharges quickly.  The unit is comfortable and balanced.  I am now a lifetime panasonic user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I bought this shaver over two years ago.  Several months ago I put it in the drawer after buying the Panasonic Arc 5 (for big bucks).  I just didn&#x27;t get a good shave from that $300 plus shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went back to the ES82443, and again I&#x27;m getting a shave closer than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is, I think that leaving the shaver in the drawer for that long messed up the battery.  The charge no longer holds for very long and it takes forever to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now I&#x27;m ordering another ES82443.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> i purchased the ES8243 and thought it did a good job.  But, it has now failed after one year of use.  The on/off switch does not work, and it turns on sporadically through the day.  I called Panasonic and was told I would have to pay $42.50 to get it fixed or they would give me 15% off full retail price ($199) to buy a new one (Amazon price is $125).  Why can&#x27;t companies make an electric razor that lasts more than one year??  I am going back to shaving with a blade. . .</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of the ES8243A and was hoping for a little more. My earlier version (forgot the model number) did not have the electronic display, which I appreciate on the ES8243A. I was hoping for a quicker shave but both models still take me 15 to 20 minutes to get anything close to a shave. I would like to find the guy that shaves in 3 minutes and gets 14 shaves per charge as the instruction manual suggests. I get at most 4 shaves per charge and usually 3. So I am afraid to travel without bringing the charge cord with me. I really like the wet/dry shaving system - although I cannot see how anyone shaves in the shower given the shaving time - Al Gore would never approve. I will never go back to a dry only shaving system. Amazon did have the best price I could find.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver going on two years.  The first one completely broke down after a year and Panasonic sent me a replacement - it was refurbished!  I have had that one about 8 months and it is terrible: the place where it shows minutes and other data is so scrambled that it is impossible to read - the shave is rough and no longer close. I just believe this shaver is meant to last no longer than a year and then it goes bad. By the way, this is an authentic review - I live in California and have been a member here for years.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I ever had but if you are using manual razors think twice before buying any electric razor because shaving with good manual razor can be faster, cleaner and cheaper.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a decent shave, but I can&#x27;t say its better than my comparably-priced Norelco.  The major disadvantage to this razor is that when you shave with it, it gets tiny hair debris EVERYWHERE; on your shirt, in the sink, wherever.  If you don&#x27;t shave over the sink, the hair will be everywhere. If you do shave over the sink, you have to clean out the sink and counter after every single shave.  I suppose this doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re using the razor in the shower, but if not this is a major pain in the a$$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Have been living with this razor for close to a year now and felt compelled to update this review.  I went from three stars to two because the way it dumps hair everywhere remains abominable and now I have discovered that when the battery is drained it will NOT shave as a corded razor; you have to re-charge it before it will work again.  With my cheapo Norelco, if it ran out of juice I could at least plug it in and finish shaving.  This one? Better be sure there&#x27;s enough charge in it to finish your shave, or you&#x27;ll have half a beard.  I wish I could still send it back.</li>
    <li> A follow-up to my earlier review: My ES8243A by now is five years old and it is still working as well as it did in July 2011. The problems I find with it: 1. The &amp;#34;replace blades / head&amp;#34; symbol often comes up after about 6 months of use and it is almost impossible to get rid of it. 2. In the neck area, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like it to do. I follow up with an age-old, 3-blade Remington that is noisy, but finishes the job. 3. The price of the shaver, including travel pouch and charger cord, in round numbers, is $90. The replacement blades and head combo, after taxes (in New York City 8.875%!) is over $50 - so I am tempted to buy a new shaver the next time the &amp;#34;replace blades/head&amp;#34; symbol comes up. In my experience, the replacement blades do not last as long as the ones in the new unit, so the price difference may be worth it.</li>
    <li> When I received this shaver I was a bit dubious as to whether it could perform better than the Braun that I had.From the first time I used it I could tell that it was so much better a closer smoother shave I sure did have just amazing,really thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Costs a pretty penny, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only shave a couple of times a week but this little beauty does the trick quickly and painlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers all of my adult life (30+ years) but have never gotten such a close shave (even on rare occasions when I had to use a blade). With a little shaving gel, this baby did in less than four minutes what no other electric shaver has ever done--remove all traces of stubble and left me with my cheeks and chin smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside. After a little cheek-to-cheek test (which I recommend be done *every* morning, by the way), my wife gave it a thumbs-up, too! Hopefully I won&#x27;t be looking like Fred Flintstone by 5 PM anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shaver. I have been very unimpressed with electric shavers up until now.   I am really impressed with the quality of the shave this provides. It is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used, and I have used quite a few over the years.   It is really nice to be able to use it wet, or in the shower. It gives a much closer shave without any irritation when used with face soap or shaving cream. In the past I used mostly rotary shavers. This was my first higher end foil type shaver and I will not go back to the rotary variety ever again. So far, It has proven to have great battery life. I have only had to charge it after 5-7 days of shaving.   My wife was also very impressed with the closeness of the shave. The rotaries I have used in the past came nowhere near the smooth, close shave that this one achieves.   I will certainly buy another one if/when this one wears out. I am one of the people that researches things to excess before I buy. This was well reviewed on multiple sites and I am glad I took the time to thoroughly research these these types of shavers before I plunked down the $100+ for this model. So far it has proven itself worth every penny. If you are on the fence, I suggest you give it a shot. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.    Donovan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several brands of shavers, including previous Panasonic models.  I&#x27;d read the ads, etc. on the 7-series Braun and gave it a try.  In the long run, I was not impressed. The battery life was poor and it didn&#x27;t cover all areas of my face well.  This Panasonic is the best one yet.  The battery lasts for several shaves.  The unit is comfortable to hold. And most importantly, it gives a nice close shave in less time than the Braun.  You can tell the biggest difference in the afternoon.  The Panasonic shave was still fairly smooth even at 5pm, whereas the Braun shave felt like you needed to shave again if you are going out.  I don&#x27;t miss the cleaning system and purchasing the solution.  A little soap &amp; water every few days and it&#x27;s clean. I won&#x27;t venture away from Panasonic again.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance, wet and dry for a low price, very easy to clean, the shave is smooth and fast, ergonomic design making this shaver easy   to manipulate. The battery durability is very good, I am recharging after a week and something, and I am shaving no just my face but my head as well. For me that one is a winner  in comparison with other brands that I have had in the past and old Panasonic models.     http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DKMY9Q/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> Note:  This review is only commenting on using the razor as a wet razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this razor for about 1 month and am very pleased with the close shave in the shower.  My wife hated my old electic and wanted me to get something with a much closer shave.  I tried using other electric razors including Norelco and Remington (both wet and dry) and I also tried blade razors (including Mach 3 &amp; 5 blade Fusion).  None of them gave me a better shave than this panasonic razor (including the blades) when I use it in the shower with shave gel. I have not gotten shave bumps or irritation which is something I experience with all of the blade razors I tried. I do have to go over the same areas a few times to get a very close shave, but anyone that has ever used an electric razor knows that is a given. The razor is also quite noisy, but again a common find with most razors. Also, the razor feels strudy and the charge lasts about 5-10 shaves, which is quite good in my experience.</li>
    <li> The reviews I read were favorable for this shaver so I decided to give it a try. (I have been using rotary shavers for many years and have always been happy with them.) Well, I really like the Panasonic shaver. It gives a very close shave especially using it wet will a shaving gel. Less irritation than the rotary and a quicker shave. My one concern is how long the blades will last before needing replacement. They are fairly expensive so hopefully a few years. Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I like the way it handles and the way that it shaves close to the face and does not make the neck red. Also the way that you can keep the head still or let it float. The clean up is easy and does a good job of cleaning the razor.</li>
    <li> I have used top of the line Norelco shavers for 30+ years, but because of the reviews of others I tried this Panasonic.  It blows the Norelco&#x27;s away.  It&#x27;s a little noisier, but the shave is much closer and faster.  I was also put off by Norelco because I needed a replacement part that was discontinued way too soon.  This Panasonic shaver is comfortable and does a great job with just one pass, the top of the line Norelco needed many passes to get a shave that was not nearly as close.  The Panasonic shave is as closer hours later as the Norelco shave immediately after shaving.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> nice, close, comfortable shave...... wet with just a little shaving cream, or even dry!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 and purchased this razor after 8 years of shaving with blades. I have always had a problem with ingrown hairs and acne in the area of my beard, but no longer! This Panasonic is fast, close, effortless, and cleaning it is as easy as a little soap and water- ill never go back to traditional razors again. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself works quite well. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever leave blades. It works fast and I have to follow up only a few spots with my blades. The problem is that I need to replace the foil and blades about every 6 months - and they are not cheap. Even so, the price compared to blades comes out about even.  I&#x27;m also receiving some strange messages on the display.  Still, it works great and saves me about 90 minutes a week shaving.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive face when it comes to electric razors.  I was nervous switching to a new razor when my old one stopped working.  While the first shave was a little rough with this razor, since then I have gotten the closet and most gentle shave of any razor I have owned.  I have been using this razor for the past year and I am very happy with it.  Would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have had.  I had three Braun&#x27;s before this and they were good ones.  However, they cost almost three times what this one cost.  I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive cleaners for the Panasonic.  Each time I charge it I wash it with liquid hand soap under hot water.  In my opinion the Panasonic give a closer shave than the Braun.  The Panasonic is the best electric razor I have had to date.  I am 72 years old.</li>
    <li> My husband just loves this shaver - said it&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s ever had and he is pretty fussy about that.  This was a special deal on price and I would never have been able to afford this at the full price.  Just love this purchase and Amazon&#x27;s deal of the day.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver as a Christmas gift. The foil developed a small hole after 4 months of normal use. I called Panasonic to find out that foils are not under warranty and a replacement foil would cost $60 and the cost of shipping. I believe the razor cost my brother $85 on sale. $60 for a foil, really???? I was told the normal life of the foil should be one year. I am sorry but if this foil failed after 4 months of use I believe that indicates a defect which should be covered under some type of warranty. Panasonic really needs to take a few courses in Business 101 and have definitely lost a customer. There out of pocket cost for this part is probably about $3. Considering the circumstances they should have just sent me a new foil. Repeat customers are more valuable to a company then a lost customer and a bad review (which will hopefully lose them a few more) than a lousy $3 foil that was apparently defective. By the way the shaver&#x27;s performance is not what is hyped up to be anyway. Buy at you own risk!</li>
    <li> Ive owned braun shavers before and this panasonic blows it away. Ive always had the other shavers leave stuble around my atoms apple, not with the arc 4. Its all gone. Good Bye Gillette Fusion blades you wont be missed.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really bother with this shaving machine..    It&#x27;s quite nice when it does the job, the problem is, that after two months of constantly using it, it still leaves facial hair that I have to finish off with a shaving knife.  That&#x27;s absurd, the product doesn&#x27;t really do the job.    Anyway, waste of your money, I don&#x27;t understand how it receives 4.5 stars..</li>
    <li> Close shaves.  Very good.  I have used Braun for years and found them to be satisfactory, but not nearly as good as this one.  I like the idea that it is all in one unit with no extra components needed for cleaning.  Also, I like to shave and forget it.  I do not like to fuss around with fluids for cleaning.  The longer that I use it-- the better I like it.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Panasonic electric razors ever since they were first sold by Sharper Image.  I purchased this model to replace a dying ES8249 that is about 5 years old. It had been dropped one too many times. I had no use for the cleaning system, and this is the same razor but without the cleaning tank.  This new razor uses the same foils and blades as the old, so I could use up my inventory, and keep the automatic order subscription that I have with Amazon. I get blades and foils every 6 months without having to think about it.  This razor, and all my previous Panasonic&#x27;s, give me a great shave. I love being able to shave in the shower and this waterproof razor does that nicely.  The high speed feature is a must for me, I have tried some of the &#x27;normal speed&#x27; electric razors and they are painfully slow. based on about 20 years of purchasing experience, I expect this one to last 3-4 years, maybe more. Worst case that is 9 cents per shave.</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun 7 series shaver from sometime around 2005 until early this year.  It was an overall good shaver, but after such a long time, the battery was starting to get low and I decided to gift it to a friend and get back in the market to see if there was new technology out there.  Like a lot of guys, I think, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a shaver that can get the job done in the least amount of time possible.  I&#x27;m also a redhead with sensitive skin that breaks out if I use a blade, so it&#x27;s been shavers for years.    After hunting around, I purchased this Panasonic in early 2010.  So, I have about six months in on it.  I don&#x27;t have much of a beard, so I can get by with shaving every other day, for the most part.  In comparison with the Braun, it does a better job at getting the bigger stuff on the first pass.  I do notice that to get the really close shave, I sometimes have to angle it a little bit so that the foils, which are on the outside edges, can get more surface contact and take off that last little nub of hair coming out of the hair shaft.    My only real disappointment with this shaver is battery life.  Since I shave every other day, I can go about 10 days without recharging.  This is on a brand-new battery (it&#x27;s been this way since I bought it).  For me, at least, the Braun was still going longer than this without a recharge after like 5 years of use.  And when it was new, I easily went longer than two weeks.  I found this to be unexpectedly disappointing.    As far as wet/dry, I tried just wet (no shaving cream).  I seem to get a better, quicker shave if I shave dry right before hopping in the shower.  That may just be because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing for years and am more used to doing it that way.    Would I buy it again?  Maybe, but I would probably take a harder look at the Brauns again first.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after being impressed by its positive reviews on Amazon. I must say I am extremely disappointed with this product.  I gave myself sometime before I came to any conclusions.  I also used it with the Pre-Shaving lotion as recommended by many.  Although the results were better but only slightly. The manufacturer recommends you use the product for at least a month so that your skin adjusts to the shaver but I still do not find any significant improvement after using this for over 2 months.  I have to run the shaver back and forth numerous times before I can get a decent shave.     I must add that for the first time I feel the reviews at Amazon to be biased.  Quite possible that I got unlucky.  Nevertheless, I am returning this product!!</li>
    <li> Update Dec 2012:  Had this shaver for almost two years now....still works great. Replaced the screen and blades only once (after a year).  I think rinsing after each use prolongs the blade vs using the brush tool (which I&#x27;ve never used). Nice razor...though I see it is about $21 more now than it was in Dec 2010.  Still very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Panasonice shaver in Dec. 2010, just after Christmas.  I decided to try it based on the positive reviews.  Having used electric razors in the past, they never really performed all that well, but the reviews convinced me to give it a try again. I have used inexpensive disposable blade razors but they usually perform just OK and getting knicks was not uncommon...so I had to get the more expensive premium blades to get a close, clean, shave.  So I decided to try the Panasonic ES8243A.  I have been VERY pleased with this razor. It shaves about as close as the premium disposable blades and of course you don&#x27;t need shaving cream.  Once the razor is charged, you will be able to use it for a week on a single charge (you don&#x27;t need to keep it plugged in...just charge and use for the week).  It recharges fairly quickly as well (maybe an hour for a full charge).  The instructions guide you to clean it with water after so many shaves (and the razor has an indicator symbol to tell you when to clean using the cleaning mode - an ultra-high vibration mode), but I rinse the blade and screen after almost every shave to keep it clean.  I have also used the original blade now for almost 11 months....and it still cuts well!  I don&#x27;t use the cleaning brush that comes with the razor as rinsing it keeps it clean.  Great razor.....I am impressed with how this razor performs.  After 11 months it still cuts about as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 25 years.  I&#x27;ve tried Norelco, Braun and Remington.  This is my first Panasonic.  I&#x27;ve had it for 18 months and it&#x27;s still my favorite shaver ever.  Pros:  Great shave.  Very close - even after 18 months on the first set of blades.  Large cutting head makes shaving faster than others.  Love the wet shave option.  Cons:  Battery life could be better.  Also wish you could shave on AC power instead of having to wait for the battery to recharge at least a bit.</li>
    <li> have shaved electrically for over 60 years and have tried them all from Braun, Norelco,etc....this is absolutely the best electric I have ever used....very close, comfortable shave, quickly, with no razor burn....price was excellent as well as service on shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off with the admission that I normally use razor blades to shave (specifically Fusion ProGlide). I have tried electric shavers in the past but have always felt they caused more irritation and couldn&#x27;t provide as close a shave as a razor blade.    I first tried this shaver dry, and although my skin is very sensitive, I was able to get a good shave without much discomfort at all. The next day I tried the shaver on a wet shave, and it felt wonderful. It felt like a face massage in the shower, and alhough it took me some time to get a close shave, it was quite enjoyable.    I have had a couple of small issues with the shaver, mostly when I use it after letting my stubble grow out for a couple days. I&#x27;ve managed to cut myself with the shaver on two occassions--both times were on my neck and while shaving 4-5 days of hair growth. I&#x27;ve also found it very difficult to get a clean shave with more than 2 days of growth.    The good: comfortable shave, easy to use, wet/dry capability.    The bad: doesn&#x27;t work well on longer hair growth.    Verdict: A good shaver for every day use. Do not use to cut significant hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric razor my whole shaving life.  My last razor was a braun and I really liked the razor I had it for many years.  The only reason I changed was because from everything I could tell they (braun) doesn&#x27;t make the blades or the foils for it any more.  So after searching th internet.  I found the panasonic, the price was more than what I really wanted to pay but it seemed that most of the other razors I was looking at were more expensive.  So I decided to purchase the panasonic.  All I can say is I love this razor.  It shaves closer than my braun ever did and clean up is so easy with being able to just rinse under the faucet.  I have yet to wet shave but I sure do like this razor and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 and i have  very fast and thick growing facial hair. I have had people tell me electric razors don&#x27;t work as well as manual ones. Well i just received mine today and had grown me a thick long chinstrap, to try it out. It was my first shave with an electric and WAS IT GOOD!! This razor did more than i expected. It gave me a really close shave and made my skin so smooth, almost as smooth as my manual Schick 5 Hydro. I had read about this and the BRAUN 7. i always do research on appliances i buy, and read on Bestcovery.com (GREAT RATING WEBSITE) that this Panasonic razor was #1 and beat the Braun 7, and i have taken advise from this website beforree AND THEY HAVE NOT LET ME DOWN. ALLL IN ALL GREAT RAZOR, WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas. It has turned out to be a very good purchase. He found that using a gel-type product on his face really improved the performance and comfort (as oppposed to a dry shave). I feel that I made a good decision on this razor, having read lots of reviews of all the different brands and models of razors available at Amazon. My husband does mention that the process isn&#x27;t much faster than using a regular razor blade.</li>
    <li> I have now used the Panasonic ES8243A for seven months.  This is my first electric shaver in decades, and it is close to a blade shave.  I still prefer a blade shave if my beard has gone for two days or longer, but the Panasonic is less irritating as a daily shaver, or for touching up in the evening.  It is easy to clean, recharges in only an hour, and will last me a week on a charge.  I do not use it in the shower or for wet shaves, so cannot comment on that.  Be careful to dry it and store it in a dry place or it can develop mildew.  Clean the heads with soap when indicated by the shaver.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Much better than my previous one, but that one was more than 12 yrs old. Has some difficulty shaving the longer hairs on my neck. Would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have been a hand razor shaver for zillions of years and was tired of having to always buy new blades. I got this razor over a month ago and am well pleased  with the results. I get a clean, close shave with out razor \\&quot;burn\\&quot;.    The fact I can use shaving cream, wash it and not have a build up of whiskers  remaining for the next time is one great feature.  I average 3 - 4 minutes per shave and it needs recharging every 10 - 12 shaves.   If the battery dies, I can quickly recharge for 3 minutes and finish.  Recharge completly in one hour.   I will revisit this review site in about 6 months to reassure readers I  hold the same opinion.</li>
    <li> My husband always used a Norelco shaver, rotary razor, until I purchased this for him last year. He loves this razor. It doesn&#x27;t give his skin a rash, or rub it raw. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair when it shaves, the battery lasts a long time. It&#x27;s easy to care for, easy to clean. If he could give it more than 5 stars, he would. We are VERY happy we bought this shaver. We would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have gone from an electric shaver to using a razor. The razor is always a hassle because of the shaving cream, etc. I think I finally found an electric that can really do the job. I have had it for about a month and it works great.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I just had to! This is the best electric shaver I have ever had and I have had a few... I was a blade man for the longest time but just got tired of buying blades. I was a little weary of going back to an electric in the past electric shavers have caused me significant razor burn, ingrown hairs and irritation, but let me tell you flat out this is the best shaver you can buy for the money! Non of the downside and all of the upside a fast clean shave every time! It works great wet or dry, its easy to clean and never fails to deliver a smooth consistent shave. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is thinking of going electric. I put this thing to the test. I grew my beard for a week before I got it just to give it a \\&quot;real\\&quot; test. I was surprised by how well it performed. Great job guys!</li>
    <li> Just got this for Christmas.  Best Electric Shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  Way closer than my Norelco and my Braun.  HUGE Time Saver!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend as a Christmas present and he absolutely LOVES it He says it&#x27;s a great close shave without any ingrowns and it&#x27;s the best razor that he&#x27;s had.</li>
    <li> I had an older Panasonic wet/dry shaver. It is battery operated. So this rechargeable unit is much more convenient and I hope cost effective. It is a smooth, comfortable close shave with very little irritation. It is comfortable in the hand and easy to use. The cleaning process is washing and it does not come with a cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors most of my life. I have tried various Norelco and Panasonic models. This one is providing a good shave. It picks up the stubborn hairs without much if any effort. This is better than the others I have had. It takes about 2 minutes to get a good shave for me. The tight curve areas are handled without issues and I have had no raw spots show show up nor found unshaved areas. The pivot head is working as it should for me. All in all I would buy this model/design again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. As of June 2013 this shaver is running like new. Battery still holds a charge without issue. Everything I said in the original write up has not changed. The blades have not wore out just yet, but then I will use beyond the normal life as that is the way I am.</li>
    <li> It was a gift. He has usedit in and out of the shower and loves it. Super lightweight? Has had more expensive ones and said this one is just as good</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for over a year now.  It has been wonderful; far far superior to several other shavers which only took my money but never delivered the close shave they promised.</li>
    <li> For years now, I have used an electric razor and have been very frustrated.  Shaving could take me 20 minutes or longer because my facial hair was so thick and my face is sensative.  Even after being careful shaving, my face would still leave a rash from all the shaving.  My wife kept suggesting that I find a wet/dry shaver, so  I did some research and found that this might be the solution.  The product came as expected and was in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I used the razor, I was sold.  Not only did it take my 2 minutes to shave, I did not have to baby certain parts of my face to avoid a rash.  I&#x27;ve used this for the past 3 months now and not one rash.  This is a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensative skin, I highly recommend this shaver.  I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor 1 year ago after researching and reading a lot of reviews.  Before buying this I was a disposable razor guy that shaved every other day and have sensitive skin.  My brother uses a Norleco which I&#x27;ve tried several times but never like the way it pulled my hair or left patches.  After one year of using this Panasonic razor I&#x27;m sold.  It only takes me an average of 3 mins to shave every other morning and 2 mins if I shave every day. The battery life is great.  I only charge this razor once every 2 weeks and the battery life has not decreased any over 1 yr of use.  No razor burns, no missed hairs, no pulling of hairs and cuts closer than any disposable out there.  This is a must buy for anyone.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a replacement for a similarly featured Panasonic shaver purchased 7.5 years ago which I will still use as a travel shaver. The new unit is is ergonomically designed, well constructed and gives a close, comfortable shave. I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to comment on its long term durability but I believe it will stand the test of time. I highly recommend it.[[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Blue]]</li>
    <li> Works well. I gave four stars because nothing is perfect. When you are using this razor make sure its wet and have some shaving cream being used.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Panasonic ES8243 Arc IV nano from Amazon. I usually shave dry. This shaver is very good, better than my Braun 7 series. My skin does not feel hot and I have not experienced shaving nicks.     The only cons that I can think off is that the plastic cover over the shaver foil is difficult to remove without removing the foil as well</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best razor I have ever owned.  It gives a very close shave without irritation.  The charge generally lasts (for me) two weeks.  If it goes out mid-shave, 5 minutes of charging is enough to finnish.</li>
    <li> I got the Panasonic ES8228S. My dad refuses to use electric shavers as they always irritate his face. He liked the ES8228S so much that I got him the Panasonic ES8243A.     Pro: Very close shave. Little irritation, even for sensitive faces. Waterproof means it easy to clean. Little vibration. The handle is lightly textured making it easier to grip, even with slippery hands.    Con: It does not used the nice induction charger that the ES8066 used. However, the plug in charger is much more compact and easier to travel with. Since it needs charging only once a week or so, it is not much of a con either.</li>
    <li> I dry shave with this razor every time I shave and it does a great job leaving no missed spots or irritation anywhere. It even gets my neck area clean and smooth which a lot of shavers do not. I usually just use a can of compressed air to clean it off but once and a while you&#x27;ll need to run some water over it while cleaning it. Its one of the most durable things I have in my possession, I&#x27;ve been stationed in Iraq for almost a year now and it has served me well with a long battery life. Shaving only takes a couple of minutes. Its been through sand storms and 120+ degree weather and still works and shaves like the day I got it. I never thought a electric razor would give me a close military shave like my normal mach 3 razor, but this one does and I&#x27;m happy I found it.</li>
    <li> I notice that a lot of the reviews are over 3 years old! Companys do make improvements to their products! I&#x27;ve had mine over 7 months and love it! No problems just fantastic shaves. I have a Braun Series 7 that I bought a couple of years ago and paid $150 for. It drags and doesn&#x27;t give near the smooth shave that the ES8243 does, plus you have to buy their cleaning solutions! I let my brother-in law and my nieces husband try my ES8243 on Easter. They both bought one and love it! Don&#x27;t buy the Panasonic with the cleaner base, it cleans good just putting soap on it and running it under the faucet.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this exact same razor.  I loved first one, but after it finally died, I was seduced by a cheaper razor.  Mind you, the cheaper razor was that popular brand starting with an N and ending with an O, so it was a quality product.  I gave that razor a year, but never liked it.  The shave was not as close, and it was rougher on my skin.  So when I saw this same Panasonic on Amazon on sale plus a coupon, I jumped on it and bought it.  I&#x27;m so pleased with this razor.  My first shave was remarkably closer and once again I get absolutely zero skin irritation.  I will never leave Panasonic again when I have to buy a replacement. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic razor based on the wet/dry and speed features.  For  cenvenience, I wanted a razor that could be used in the shower.  I have been using an electric razor for years and shave my head almost daily.    I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a month and am very pleased with how close the razor shaves, the speed of the shave and \\&quot;cleaning the razor\\&quot; is a breeze.</li>
    <li> You name it Ive tried it. This razor is the best Ive ever used, fast, easy to get around the upper lip and jaw line . It shaves better than the safety razor in less than half the time.</li>
    <li> It has beed a number of years for me for trying a electric razor, they never shaved close enough for me thenew Panasonic E58243A did a great job shaving close and no razor burn using it wwet with shaving gel worked for me and I am sold, may buy another one to have a spare in casse they elect to discontinue this moldel</li>
    <li> Does more than I expected, clean close shave with almost no irritation.  I used a Gillette Fusion Power for the past year but always had random cuts and copious razor irritation.  This shaver, when combined with a pre-electric, plows through hairs and leaves nothing on my face, great purchase!</li>
    <li> For the past year, I used a Braun Pulsonic 9595 and a Remington MS2-390 as my primary foil shavers.  I was never satisfied with the shaves I received from either model - the Braun was more comfortable, the Remington more close, and both had build quality issues that required shipment to a repair center (Braun) or outright replacement by the manufacturer (Remington).    I had heard about the Panasonic ARC IV Nano shaver line and what superior shavers they were, and I almost bought a Panasonic last year instead of the Pulsonic.  Now that I have experienced shaving with the ES8243a, I definitely wish I had!!  This shaver delivers a closeness/comfort level beyond my wildest expectations. It can be used dry or wet, its foil is hypoallergenic stainless steel and the unit is  easily cleaned under the tap without having to resort to a cleaning system (although you can get the more expensive ES8249k if you really want that).  I&#x27;m very pleased with the build quality.  The shaver is sturdy, fits well in my hand, and the blue/black color combination is quite pleasing to these eyes!    I now have a single foil shaver that performs the way I expect every morning.  Check the ES8243a out - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver based solely on the reviews I read on Amazon for my husband who has not owned an electric shaver for many years. He loves it! It provides a close shave in or out of the shower (without first-use irritation) and he likes the convenience of the battery charge display and that it that it holds a charge for two or three weeks; no need to leave it sitting in a charging base. Thanks Amazon reviewers!</li>
    <li> I bought this one after trying many many other brands. Others I have had were also automatic cleaning, I grew tired of purchasing the cleaning solutions - so I tried this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderful. Cleans up very well, if not better than the auto-cleaning razors, and I can clean it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my face/beard did take about 3-4 weeks to get used to the new razor, so don&#x27;t get discouraged upon the first couple weeks and think it is not working - hang in there and you will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges quickly, looks great sitting in your bathroom, feels great in your hand, very nice unit.</li>
    <li> My husband said that this is the best razor he has owned thus far. Easy to charge, great shave - he has had no problems with this whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver based on the excellent reviews I read here at Amazon. The high rev/pitched operation of this shaver was different from other shavers I have used in the past, but what an excellent shave! It operates quickly dry or wet. The trim mechanism is something I use for sidesburns and quick maintenance of longer hairs around the ears. The feature that displays the amount of charge is something I reference often. I also enjoy the cordless advantage. Cleaning is simple.   I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I used my Braun shaver for 10 years before it was the time to move on. Panasonic ES8243A was a great choice. Clean shave, very easy to maintain and clean up takes a second.. I would not mind if it kept charge for a bit longer, but 1 week is good enough for me. What I like the best about this shaver is how it takes care of my neck area, nuch better than Braun did.  I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great!  And I especially like the quick turn around time from ordering to receiving the shaver!!</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever had</li>
    <li> I used a Norelco Spectra razor for over 5 years before getting the Panasonic.  The Norelco worked pretty well, but did not provide a really close shave, and I felt like it irritated my face.  I use the Panasonic with shaving gel and hot water, and it definitely shaves closer--almost as close as a blade, although it misses a hair or two on my neck.  My face feels better too.  The trimmer works very well.  Battery life could be a little bit better, but I really like the shave time/battery display.  I recommend this razor, especially if you can get it for less than $100.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet, hoping I could possibly convey those with a similar situation to switch over to this electric razor. Firstly, I am 24 years old and cursed with thick,black facial hair and incredibly sensitive skin. Previously, I&#x27;ve been shaving with all sorts of straight blade razors...Mach 3...Fusion..disposable...Schick Quattro etc. etc. etc. While the shaves are close, the discomfort DURING the shave, and the pain AFTER the shave (from tons of nicks and cuts usually, no matter how hard I try). I usually would shave every OTHER day, and now my job requires I shave daily...its a nightmare. Sure, the pain goes away and so does the bleeding after a quick shower and an hour, but jeez who wants to go through that every morning? I tried expensive shaving creams, gels, oils, RAZORS....nothing. All temporary fixes.      NOW. I used to have a top of the line braun about 3 years ago. It was a pretty good shave but got my skin all hot and bothered, soon I stopped using it. Lets talk about the ARC 4. TWO SHAVES IN, it is immediatly the smoothest, most comfortable, CLOSEST shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my freaking life. YES, closer than a blade! I SWEAR TO YOU, GOD MADE THIS RAZOR FOR MEN. With a bit of shaving cream, the experience is sublime. No irritation, no cuts, no nothing. I can only imagine how good this thing will get in a few weeks as I adjust to it and it to me. So far I am so impressed that it can hardly get closer or more comfortable. Hear me say this one more time - THIS SHAVER GETS CLOSER THAN A MACH 3 ON MY SECOND DAY USING IT. IN 3 MINUTES. WITHOUT A STEAM SHOWER. For $130 this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought and I urge more men with a similar situation to get on it immediatly! It fits comfortably in your hand, doesn&#x27;t make a ton of noise (others think its loud? really??), and washes clean without an expensive base to take up your vanity space. God did indeed make this razor, and he gave it to Panasonic to distribute. Thank GOD!</li>
    <li> This razor lives up to the hype.   I shave in 60% less time (approx 4 mins)and ths shave is as close as a blade.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and use.  It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that I will ever use another brand.</li>
    <li> Part of the system outer foil has disintegrated to where I can&#x27;t use it. Shaver was brought Dec 2, 2011. Always performed cleaning according to the owners manual.  Panasonic warranty is for 2yrs parts and labor but Excludes both parts and labor for the following items which require normal replacement: Foils, blades, cutters, batteries, accessories, attachments etc....(this statement is on Panasonic site but not in the literature you receive with the unit). This is totally ridiculous!  The system outer foil costs $60.00 plus shipping. The shaver only cost me $106.60 from Amazon. Shaver work good on a two to three day growth but using it everyday really irritated my face. Would not recommend any Panasonic product due to the useless warranty.</li>
    <li> This shaver is well worth the money spent. Great shave, with very little skin irritation. Shaves very efficiently on every stroke for less passes. Its also very simple to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> This thing is just great, I have been persevering with a Braun I paid $59 for at Walmart, and this is like nite and day, no pressure, no going over and over your chin trying to get a close shave, it just cuts so close with no pulling. I&#x27;m sold, I&#x27;ll never use anything else but a Panasonic ever again and this has got four blades too. I hope it works as well in a year, when I put a new foil on it we will see if it&#x27;s as good then as it is now, but right now it is very very good.  The Braun is in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Purchased about a month ago and have been using it daily for about four weeks.  I have used every brand of electric razor under the sun.  This one is nice because it isn&#x27;t too loud and is very easy to clean.  The charge is fast and lasts for over a week before needing to be recharged.  The readout display is simple and easy to use at a glance.  I especially like the fact that it can be used wet or dry.    On the downside it takes longer than most shavers to get a true close shave.  Several passes though and it achieves a nice smooth shave.  This shaver does not do too well on the neck area.  My neck has been irritated consistently since using the razor, I&#x27;m hoping this will cease as I use the razor more.  I have relatively thick growth, I have a true five o clock shadow by dinner time so most razors have to work hard on my face.  I would say it is probably worth the money if you find a great deal on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. Only complaint is you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s recharging. Whats up with that.</li>
    <li> I have this posted as well on Amazon.ca from a Canadian&#x27;s perspective, but I&#x27;ll re-post it here with some revisions because my experience addresses some of the (few) negatives about this fantastic shaver.    Let me start by stating that for the first time in my life, I actually enjoy shaving!    Prior to buying this product over 2 months ago, I had been using the Gillette Mach 3 series of disposable blades for almost 10 years. In recent months, I was considering going back to an electric shaver, but I wasn&#x27;t motivated enough to make the switch. However, I came into a job situation that required me to be clean-shaven every day, but the blades were leaving my face raw and often bloody on the neck so the absolute most I could handle was shaving once every two days. This didn&#x27;t matter whether the blades were new or old, or whether I used cream or gel.    So I did what I normally do: went onto Amazon.com (or .ca) and researched. I zeroed-in on the Braun Series 7 shavers because I had used Philips rotary shavers prior to 10 years ago and wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality of shave, plus the rotary blades were a time-waster to pull apart and clean. I&#x27;m sure technology has improved since then, but I decided that my next one would be a foil shaver regardless.    However, the Braun Series 7 shavers had a rather mixed set of reviews regarding quality and customer service, different reviewers stating how this might be the result of no longer being exclusively built in Germany and also because Braun in North America has been bought out. So I was on the hunt again.    The Panasonic ES8243A caught my eye next because it is rated very highly on this site with very few negative reviews relative to positive ones, so I decided to take my chance even though I have always associated Panasonic with video players and microwave ovens!    Right when you open the box, there&#x27;s a piece of paper that encourages you to shave for 30 days with this product before deciding it&#x27;s not for you - a verywise move on the part of Panasonic. I also noticed some wonderful words that you don&#x27;t often see too much any more: \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot;. This alone was music to my eyes.    My first few shaves were a learning curve, to be sure, like any new product. I also started with wet shaves - using products like Cremo Cream and water, or just plain water - because I feared the same burning sensation as my old Philishave. However, getting tired of the same routine and mess as using blades, I decided to try dry shaving and find this to be my preference by far. My face does not get irritated, unless I try to go at it for too long; I have to remind myself that no electric shaver will get as close as a blade, although I must say that this Panasonic comes darn close, perhaps as close as any electric shaver will get.    The first few times I shaved with it, some portions of my neck under the jawbone were causing me grief; there were always some stray hairs, much to my frustration. But now, especially with a dry shave, this is not the case.    So the key with this shaver is PATIENCE. Don&#x27;t even THINK of returning it or complaining until you&#x27;ve given it a couple dozen chances. The odds are extremely high that if you do, you&#x27;ll consider this the best electric shaver that you&#x27;ve ever used.    Cleaning this shaver is ridiculously simple, probably because the head design is ridiculously simple: Just remove the foil, rinse the cutting blades under the tap, and use some liquid soap if necessary. However, I have not once needed to use the soap. Then I just let it sit out to dry before I re-assemble it and put it away.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t even rinse it; I&#x27;ll just shake/brush out the clippings and put it away when I&#x27;m in a hurry.    I know that I could have chosen a cheaper shaver, but why? I know that there would be some sort of compromise in the closeness and comfort of the shave. Besides that, this shaver doesn&#x27;t come with a cleaning station that requires expensive cleaning solution, so I&#x27;m onlyspending money long-term on foil and cutting blade replacements, and no more either on disposable blades and shaving gel.    I can get a great shave in under 4 minutes if I&#x27;ve shaved the day before. (The fact that I can shave every day is something I could have never dreamed of with a blade, or even with my Philishave of old. This alone gives this shaver a top rating in my mind.)    If I have 2-3 days worth of growth, it will take a little over 5 minutes, but this is way better than the 7-8 minutes when I first started out and trying to get used to its operation or the up to 10 minutes with a blade and shaving gel (including prep and clean-up time).    If there is one strike against this shaver, it&#x27;s the fact that you can&#x27;t operate it while it&#x27;s plugged in and charging. Sometimes this would be nice when the indicator is showing only 10-20% battery power left! And because a full charge takes 45 minutes, it means you&#x27;d better remember to plug it in before you need it, like when trying to get out the door and to work on time.    Another strike isn&#x27;t against the shaver, but against retailers. This is a remarkable shaver, but I think its availability is limited because retailers can&#x27;t make money off of cleaning solutions, but this is just my theory. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll see mostly just those Braun and Philips shavers with cleaning stations on their shelves, and not often the ones without.    So the pros:  - Very close shave with little/no irritation.  - Ability to do a wet shave (for those who prefer this).  - Remarkably (ridiculously?) easy to clean.  - 45 minutes for a full charge that lasts at least half a dozen shaves.    The cons:  - Not being able to operate while charging (i.e. with the cord plugged in).  - Limited availability for those who don&#x27;t wish to purchase online or who don&#x27;t want to pay for cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to stress that I have no issues with the quality of the shaver.  The problem is the blades.  From Panasonic, they run $80, though they can be bought for just over $50.  This is still far more than other shavers.  The ES8243 isn&#x27;t much different than the old Remington Intercept, yet the blades are more than twice the price.  Panasonic is gouging us, plain and simple.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, no catching, very close for an electric. Time and percentage remaining is useful. Strongly recommended. Use for a full head shave.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver over a year patiently but finally gave up.&lt;br /&gt;What bothers me most was that loud noise.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just too loud that I can&#x27;t listen to the morning radio nor even can&#x27;t hear phone ring outside the showroom.&lt;br /&gt;What a relief to go back to a quiet rotary shaver - this is how every morning should start.</li>
    <li> Update: I can&#x27;t believe  I&#x27;ve used this thing for 5 years. Just got a cheapo rotoray shaver to replace it and it works 100 times better. The rotary shaves every hair no matter where it is on my face.  I&#x27;ll never get a foil shaver again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one month of using this shaver I find that it works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve had better shavers. I&#x27;ve exclusively used rotary shavers in the past. This is my first foil type shaver and also my first wet/dry shaver.  So some of my gripes may be common to all foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice readout of time spent shaving. Easy to clean. Its convenient to shave in the shower. Gets a lot shaves off of a single charge. Seems well built, its quite a solid piece of machinery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Fairly close shave, but not as close as other shavers I&#x27;ve had. There are always some hairs on my neck that this shaver will never shave. I go over them a hundred times in every direction, tried it wet, dry, with shaving gel, and without. It doesn&#x27;t matter, there are always a few hairs that refuse to go. I don&#x27;t even try anymore and just use the razor on those.  With rotary shavers I&#x27;ve had hairs that would take several tries to get, but they always would get cut eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its good enough for me, but I&#x27;ll probably be going back to a rotary shaver next time.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Braun shaver for a couple of years with excellent results (the first comfortable shave I ever found - blade or electric - in 30+ years of searching).  However, it was time to replace the heads on the Braun and I had been intrigued by the Panasonic shavers (the wet shave feature) when I bought the Braun.  Instead of buying the Braun replacement heads, I decided to spring for this shaver.    It is a very nice shaver and I like the ability to shave in the shower.  Not having to purchase the clean and renew cartridges for my Braun (a pre-7 series, 7 series shaver) was an added benefit.  However, the Panasonic shaver simply doesn&#x27;t provide near as comfortable shave for me as the Braun.  I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic for 4 months.  I tried a number of shaving creams, soap, dry, before showering, in the shower, after showering, the \\&quot;hot towel\\&quot;, light touch, medium touch, etc. but I always had some level of irritation.  Plus, I routinely got shaving bumps from the shaver - something that never happened with the Braun.  Thinking it may have been a sterilizing of the heads issue (the Braun&#x27;s liquid uses alcohol to sterilize), I actually resorted to putting a little alcohol on the Panasonic&#x27;s shaving head a few times.  It didn&#x27;t help.    Therefore, I decided to go back to the Braun shavers.  However, why go back to a 2 year old shaver?  Where&#x27;s the fun in that?  So I ordered the Braun 790 from Amazon.  It came in, I charged and cleaned it, and gave it a spin.  There is just no shadow of doubt - Braun is the shaver for me.  Far better for my face.  Plus, even though the clean &amp; renew cartridges are a hassle, they are well worth it to me.  I like the fact that with each shave, I&#x27;ve got a sterilized shaver for use.    Based on the excellent reviews of the Panasonic, it is undoubtedly a nice shaver - and about 1/2 the price of the Braun I am using - so nice that even though the Braun wins hands-down for me, I still rate it 4 stars.  However, it just didn&#x27;t workfor me.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have usually spent $40-80 on a razor, but I figured I would spend a little extra and she what I get, and I am so happy I did. This razor is awesome!! Well worth the small difference in cost!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a young man who really is into some man-scaping.  No good.  Great for the outdoorsy shadow look ... nothing more.  ~~~~ Okay so I am adding to this review (Oct 2013), great for the guy who wants the rugged look.  One of my college -age sons loves this razor for the \\&quot;kept\\&quot; unshaven look.  I don&#x27;t know, good or bad?  I guess it depends on what you are shopping for. I will move from 2 stars to 3 for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an Arc IV with the cleaning station (forget the exact model number  - 8249 maybe?) that died after 2.5 years of really hard use.  Not Panasonic&#x27;s fault - I think it got voltage spiked while I was on vacation in the Caribbean and it was plugged into a 220v outlet, recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil is thin and the blades sharp.  I did take a little adjustment period when I got the original one a few years back, but after that zero &#x27;blade burn&#x27; or razor pimples after shaving, and I&#x27;m not that careful about only shaving after showering (e.g. not sweaty), using a skin lubricant, etc.  Holds a charge good for about a week or more if I only shave my face, maybe 4 days if I also shaved my scalp every day (yes, I&#x27;m one of those baldies).  Head movement and individual foil movement is good for most curvature - do have to work at getting the longer whiskers on the neck, between the chin and adam&#x27;s apple by coming at it from different directions, but that&#x27;s true of an actual blade razor half the time too.  Trimmer is sufficient for what it does, but it vibrates so fast it tickles when I use it to trim nose hairs (ewww!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, great product.  I&#x27;d say this one is just fine vs. the higher end one with the &#x27;cleaning station&#x27; it is wet/dry so you just pop off the foil, rinse beneath it, rinse the foil, and maybe lightly soap it all up and re-rinse every week or two.  In my case I did have the cleaning station from a prior purchase so FYI - although this particular model looks identical the &#x27;recharging bumps&#x27; on the handle aren&#x27;t really metal and this will not charge in the station for the 8249(?), it only charges when plugged in at  the base.</li>
    <li> This Razor is so much better than my Braun I had...What a Difference close shave and I use it with Cremo Cream! Thanks Fast Shipping, Perfect Condition. Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor that I have owned. The only issue that I have had is that I keep pressing the on/off button by accident.</li>
    <li> Very close shave! I feel like I shaved an hour or two ago after using this shaver. It leaves a tiny bit of stubble behind, but shaves WAY closer than anything else I have ever used.  *** Shipped faster than anything I have purchased on Amazon! (APO ADDRESS)  Worth every penny and then some!    I originally was looking for an electric shaver to maintain a shorter beard throughout the day since I am working 12 hour shifts now. I bought this preshave lotion after reading some info about how much closer of a shave it will give you. [[ASIN:B000Q71HY0 Mennen Afta Pre-Electric original 3 FL OZ (PACK OF 2)]] The combonation of these two products has changed how I will shave forever. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else ever again. I have such faith in this product after just 2 weeks of use that I bought one for my Step Dad for Father&#x27;s Day :)</li>
    <li> Very close shave for a fraction of the price of high end shavers</li>
    <li> Bought 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I shave twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;it works yet. waterproof is  good!! suprisingly, battry life is good!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why four star??&lt;br /&gt;* for your information&lt;br /&gt;No use in while charging.</li>
    <li> This razor definitely gets the job done when your using it dry. It&#x27;s smooth on the skin and gets every curve. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because when using it wet, its hard to tell if you got the hair or if its just sticking to your skin. That&#x27;s most likely how any wet/dry razor is though. All around great, and easy to clean, just run it under the water and done.</li>
    <li> Great product very durable with a clean shave. Long lasting battery as well, but is a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my birthday, and I actually look forward to shaving everyday! I use it in the shower and it gives me a close shave EVERY TIME.  I researched thoroughly before I purchased and all the reviews on the shaver are spot on!  thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me a few shaves to get used to using an electric shaver after 50+ years of blades. I do love the simplicity and efficiency of it, no heating the face with hot towels, no having to time it with just getting out of the shower. Just throw on a dash of pre-shave and zip, it&#x27;s done. I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t be close enough but it is. Fast, close and easy. Works of for me.</li>
    <li> Shaves closer and faster than my previous shaver. Also, is very easy to clean with the turbo clean feature. I would purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> Great shave, but head is a little too big for my small face, takes work to shave under jaw line. I have a heavy beard, and this razor breezes though it.</li>
    <li> This was an upgrade from another 8-year old Panasonic that still works but is now in our vacation home. I think this newer model is an even closer and smoother (and quieter) shave. I use it for my legs (I&#x27;m a woman) since razors have given me rashes. I especially like the digital % of battery used...slick!</li>
    <li> I use this shaver exclusively for head shaving, though my wife recently picked it up and started using it on her legs.    I&#x27;m really pleased with it. I can shave my head fairly rapidly, as long as it&#x27;s not too long. I haven&#x27;t nicked myself ever with it. I get a shave that&#x27;s fairly close (close enough for a head), without any irritation.    I can&#x27;t speak for how it performs as a face shaver though, as I&#x27;ve only used it that way once and I was not terribly impressed. I didn&#x27;t give it a fair chance though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a month now.  It has performed flawlessly.  The shave is very close.  With the built-in electronics, I see that the average time it takes me to shave is usually under 3:00.  I strongly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> does what it says on the tin.  holds charge for a long time and gives a clean cut.  has survived several drops and still works.  good wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used just about every major shaver.  From 3-4 blade razors of various brands, to Norelcos, Remingtons, and Brauns.  Just before this one I was using a Braun 8000 series until it died (after several years).  I have sensitive skin and most razors/shavers irritated at least my neck, until the Panasonic.  This is hands down the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had (been using it for 2 months).  It gets close without any irritation and it shaves really quickly (&amp;lt;3 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the fact that there is no cleaning fluid to buy.  Just a little liquid soap, water, the turbo cleaning setting, and a couple of minutes will do the trick.  The LED display telling how much charge is left is also very helpful as is the 1 hour to fully charged time.  I&#x27;ve also read some reviews about how short the battery life is.  I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 months, but it seems to be able to go about a week before needing a recharge (just under 3 minute shaves + cleaning and drying).  The fact that it was about half the price of a new Braun while shaving my face better made we actually want to go so far as to write a review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I haven&#x27;t tried shaving with it wet yet but the fact that you can fully submerge it in water to clean it is nice.  Being that I can use it wet also means it can be used with various electric shave conditioners (Afta, LectricShave, etc...) for even closer/more comfortable shaves, though I haven&#x27;t needed anything like this yet.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver ever.  Gives real close shaves and I use it dry.  Charge lasts at least two weeks.</li>
    <li> Shaving has evolved from tedious daily chore into a pleasureable task with this Panasonic wet/dry shaver. I am a 25-year cartridge razor man, after my original Norelco triple-head gave up the ghost gnawing on my tough beard. In the past I tried the first-generation Panasonic wet product only to be sorely disappointed (literally), returning it after a bad case of razor burn. However, the idea of being able to shave in the shower as well as on the go intrigued me and after reading the glowing reviews here on Amazon, I decided to give it a go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews are spot-on: this is a great shaver and I can get a clean close shave in just a few minutes without making a big mess. However, I&#x27;ve found that if I take a little more time and use some gel or even a little soap, it grooms my face more closely than I get with a regular razor. I get a week of shaves off of a one-hour charge, so I don&#x27;t even have to pack the AC adapter when I head out on business trips.  It takes about a month of consistent use to train your beard to get the best shaves, but you won&#x27;t want to go back to a cartridge razor once you do.  It&#x27;s a quality product made in Japan (not China) and it performs as advertised. It will be the last shaver you&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace another Panasonic razor (ES8068) which is still working, by the way.  I have used this Panasonic razor for about 10 years, and it has done well.  I have replaced the foil and blades several times, and it shaved well.  But the battery was beginning to not last as long, so it was time for a replacement.  After doing research here at Amazon and on the internet, and reading many reviews about electric rechargeable razors, I thought that the ES8243A Arc IV was the best choice.    The ES8243A Arc IV has been a great choice.  The shave is very close and very comfortable.  My other Panasonic shaver was good, but the ES8243A is much better.  It is close to the quality of shaving with a blade.  Very pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. I am very happy with it. It cuts very close, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I really like the way it has a soft mode (for around the chin and neck areas) as well as a locked mode for the rest of your face. I would definitely recommend this razor. It is way better than an old Braun electric one I was using previously.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on Sept 9, 2009, and initially had great results.  I made sure the blades were kept clean, and that the lithium battery was properly discharged before recharging it.  About 2 months ago, the information window on the shaver began to flash all of its options at once.  Now the charge meter, the \\&quot;clean-it\\&quot; notice, and everything else it can display lights up when I turn it on.  There is no way to determine where the charge level is now.  I just plug it in every 4th or 5th day. It has never been dropped, and I actually cared for the thing like it was fragile!  The blades are also getting dull, and I&#x27;m torn between finding a new shaver or buying new blades that may be useless if the electric brain decides to die altogether, or if the battery gets fried. (The blades are about $20 here on Amazon, and can&#x27;t be found at any local store)  The overall shave has been close and smooth, a little tough to get under the chin, but  that seems to be the way of every shaver.  If the info window hadn&#x27;t lost its \\&quot;mind\\&quot;, I&#x27;d give it a solid 4 stars.  Just thought I&#x27;d share a year&#x27;s experience with this model; it may be just an anomaly, but an annoying anomaly for sure!</li>
    <li> It works *OK*. I had a norelco razor before that wore out and broke. This had good reviews.  I bought it, used for a month to let mey face get acclimated to it, but it just does not shave all that good.     The battery lasts a long time and it is a convenient package, but it just doesnt do a great job in the one area it needs to: shaving.    I also noticed that my facial hair grows back faster (I have more of a 5 o clock shadow than before).    all in all, 90 plus bucks is just not worth it.</li>
    <li> The product performs great.  My old Braun would barely put a dent in my thick neck hair, but this shaver did the job efficiently.  I like the read-out of the charge left and the amount of time you have been shaving.  It gives a very close shave on the whole face, and the trimmer works good on sideburns and neck hair. If you are looking for a great wet/dry shaver that will give you a clean, close shave this is the Shaver for you.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have owned.</li>
    <li> item as described A+++++</li>
    <li> I rarely use electric shavers as they have never shaved as close as a blade in my opinion. That is until now! It really does shave as close as my gillette fusion system. I simply wet my face as i do with blade shaving, and start shaving for a shave as close as the blade. I have not tried using shaving foam or gel with the Arc IV, but am amazed it worked this well. The trimmer is especially useful to me also as i have sideburns. The battery seems to last a very long time too, at least 20 shaves, and the unit is very quiet compared to other braun and Norelco&#x27;s i have tried.    I would highly recommend this shaver to those who are used to blade shaving as it is very close to a wet shave, but less messy and quicker. To get a closer shave with a blade, i would probably need to spend 15 minutes to shave twice!</li>
    <li> I was torn between this model and the top Braun model 790CC Pulsonic (9595). The Braun is not a wet/dry model. This Panasonic usually sells for $100 here at Amazon. If it is selling for more, be patient and you&#x27;ll find it for this price shortly. I do not want needless and expensive cleaning gimmicks like found on the Braun and the top Panasonic model, the ES8249K, which is identical to this model but adds the cleaning system. I can clean mine under running faucet water very easily and for free. Using this shaver is smooth and comfortable. I like it a lot. Even shaving dry, with no lubricants or anything, is great and very smooth.  Unfortunately it does not shave well under my nostrils. I have to use a razor for this small area. Being a wet/dry model, you cannot use this shaver with the AC cord plugged in. This is to protect a moron user from electrocuting themselves while showering. In case the battery is depleted, you only need a 5-minute charge for a complete shave.  I have tested the Braun shaver. It does shave good too, but found it feeling a bit fragile and plasticy when compared to this more robust Panasonic shaver.  My research also showed that the Braun shaver is susceptible to more breakdowns and is not as heavy duty as this Panasonic shaver.   Overall, I think this is the best shaver in the world. The $100 price I paid is unbeatable. I have used it for a month now, and have been extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Always used Norelco dry shaver 40+ years. Switched to shaving in the shower and won&#x27;t go back to dry!</li>
    <li> I recommend this shaver to everybody.  It shaves closer than mach3 when you shave wet, I never believed that until I tried this shaver.by the way I tried at least 4 shavers before.This was the best.  I do not know how long that will last.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry razors for 20 years. I have always been pleased with the quality and reliability of their product. I have not purchased any of their razors over the $50 price point but that comes with drawbacks. You only get one shaving head and no indicator of how much charge is left.     This time I had a couple of Amazon gift cards and used them on this model (ES8243A Arc IV Nano - Blue). I didn&#x27;t want the model with the cleaning cartridge thing (that&#x27;s what soap and water are for) or a large charging station taking up valuable counter space in my bathroom.     After just a few uses I can&#x27;t believe how close the shave actually is. I will say that even though I have used Panasonic razors all these years there is still a period of adjustment for your face and some razor burn is part of that.     A big plus is the LARGE shaving head - powered by 2 razors underneath, and the digital readout displaying how much charge is left. Even if it goes to zero it takes no more than 1 hour to put it back at 100% good enough for at least 5 shaves (a big improvement on what I was using) even a 5-10 minute charge should be enough to get you by in a hurry.     I am very glad I purchased it, so is my wife. Definitely worthy of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 8595 yes I like it, but buying those refill cleaning kits gets expensive. I wanted  a shaver that I could just rinse off. The Panasonic  ES8243A Arc IV Nano  men&#x27;s wet/dry  was the perfect choice.  Great shaver very happy with this purchase. It gives me a better shave than the Braun 8595 without buying those refill cleaning kits saving me $$$$.  Would I recommend this shaver YES!!</li>
    <li> This electric razor is about as close to a blade shave that you can get.  I bought it to use in the shower and am not disappointed in the least.  It gets very close and I like to use it with shaving soap the same way I do with a blade (on occasion).  I was amazed how much more quickly it gets the job done and with little or no irritation.  I have tried many different products and procedures for shaving and this is without a doubt the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever experienced with an electric razor.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a dense tough beard and has to shave daily and can be used wet or dry.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used.  The shave is comfortable and close.  I really like the convenience of shaving in the shower with a a gel shaving product.  I get about eight shaves per charge and the razor charges quickly.  My only negative is the travel bag is not large enough for the power cord.  I recommend this product without any reservation.</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue    This is a very solid shaver. My primary use for it is not for my face, but rather my head. The general reviews implied it would be perfect as a head shaver.    Upon first using it, I was a bit bewildered. It didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. I had just finished taking a shower and thought I&#x27;d try the new shaver. (Before taking my shower I trimmed my hair down to stubble with a ConAir trimmer). My scalp was wet and the trimmer worked, but it didn&#x27;t cut anything, or if it did cut, it was completely uneven. I was incensed at this point and thought I purchased a lemon of a shaver and proceeded to finish the shave with a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo. Right then and there I started to wonder what I would have to do to return it.    I forgot about the shaver for a day. The next day, I decided to give it another try, this time with a dry head. The difference was night and day! It cut closer than my Gillette Mach 3 Turbo. I was so surprised. I shaved back and forth over my head and it was skin smooth. Cleaning is easily done by using the Turbo mode and some water. The easy to read LCD screen is handy and informative. I wonder how long the blades will last as a head shaver though?    It still managed to irritate my skin a bit and gave me some redness, but it was better than nicks and cuts. Also, the ears are difficult to get around with the large square head. Most of all I&#x27;m perplexed by the performance as a wet shaver, maybe it&#x27;s different for beards/scalps that are wet?    Pros  Very close shave  Easy to clean  Easy to use  Charges quick    Cons  Easy to irritate the skin  Doesn&#x27;t seem to function all that well when skin is wet, at least on the scalp</li>
    <li> This is my fifth electric shaver and is the best ever; easy to clean, very close shaves and holds charge for a week.  - highly recommended</li>
    <li> Ecellent shaver - found it superior to the several Brown and Norelco/Philips shavers I had during the past 20 some odd years: in less than 2 minures I get a perfect shave, with no spots missed even earound the chin and near the nose areas, I now need about 2 passes to complete the morning shave. No pulling of hair. Quiet. Easiest to clean - just hold it under the tap. Shows charge left. Realizing that different facial features and hair patterns might find other types of shavers better - for me I consider this Panasinic the best shaver I ever had.</li>
    <li> I have had electric shavers on and off for 30 years but always seem to end up back with a blade.  Last 15 years I&#x27;ve been sold on shaving in the shower.  My last electric was a 3-head rechargeable Norelco which was OK, but I had to keep a blade on hand to clean up and especially get my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more.  This thing rocks.  Fast and easy.  Powerful.  Regular blades are out of the shower and my face is smooth and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems a charge is going to last Mon-Fri.  Bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best shaver yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATED 5/1/2012]&lt;br /&gt;Several weeks ago the LCD display that shows how long the shave has been in use and what percentage of charge is left started acting up -- it lost about 30% of what it would display.  Doesn&#x27;t affect how it shaves, just a bit annoying.  After a full charge this weekend, the screen is completely dark -- no idea how much is left, and now I won&#x27;t know when it is fully charged (it used to show 100% and flash, but now it is just a sad, dark display all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still shaves fine, but makes me wonder how much longer the electronics will last if the display only lasted 5 months...</li>
    <li> When I first used this product the shave seemed to be smoother than my previous Panasonic. But just a few hours later I noticed a roughness indicating the hair was already coming up through the skin.  My old Panasonic left my skin smooth for at least 6 hrs.  This product does charge faster and holds a charge longer.  I have found the shave is closer if you lock the head to prevent it from swiveling or dipping.  If you use this on your privates, it will bite due to the center cutting heads.  I expected more considering the  price.  I am also concerned how long the head casing will last as it is not too securing designed and gives the impression it will break easily.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and stubble.  Sensitive skin has been a problem to get a close shave.  This razor works great and I get a smooth save without the irritation from other experiences with different shavers.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works very well! Switched from a Norelco type razor over to this one. It does a great job of quickly giving me a shave, it even gets those neck hairs consistently. No problems so far. I use it dry and it is not irritating to my skin at all. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had terrible experiences with electric razors in years past, but that is because I had always used rotary razors.  I have used this foil razor in both wet and dry conditions, using it exclusively since I&#x27;ve had it.  I have had little to no irritation or in-grown hairs in areas that are problematic unless I get a professional shave.  This is a great value.</li>
    <li> Nice wet/dry shaver.  Cuts close and also cut those longer stagglers that my other shavers can&#x27;t seem to cut, even after several passes.  Nice LCD display showing power and time remaining.   It also does not require a separate bulky ac charger, just a cord.      It washes and cleans under regular soap and water, with nothing special to keep it clean.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric shaver but after 4 months, the screen started to flicker. Then it kept telling me that it needed to be charged all the time. Eventually it stopped turning on all together. I am trying to get some help from Panasonic for a replacemenent.</li>
    <li> I ordered and rcvd this shaver from Amazon at the beginning of September 2009. It is now January 2011 and I&#x27;ve had the shaver 16 months during which I used it once per day. In many ways my experiences mirror many others; at first the shaves were not so great but afterawhile they did improve vastly altho never as good as a shave from a new Gilette Fusion. Within 6 months the shaver&#x27;s display went south and was essentially useless. As of now however the rechargeable battery has refused to recharge any longer. From what I read to replace the battery will mean a trip to a repair shop ( and you can bet that won&#x27;t be right around the corner ) assuming I don&#x27;t want to deal with  water tight shields and soldering a new battery in place. And who knows what this will cost. Will I do it, probably not, as a rule repairs on small appliances never make any sense.   So in essence, I&#x27;ve paid over a bill and rented a shaver for 16 months and I&#x27;m not a happy guy.</li>
    <li> I switched over from a Gillette Fusion (non-power) razor and at first I was admittedly skeptical.  I bought this Panasonic based largely on the positive reviews (both here on Amazon, and elsewhere) and at first I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed.  Following a few weeks of near daily usage, however, I am sold.  It&#x27;s painless to clean and use.  The irritation (especially on my neck) is dramatically diminished to the point of near imperceptibility.  I&#x27;d buy this product again in a heartbeat and have highly recommended it to those who&#x27;ve asked me about it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good electric shaver. It takes a little while (3 - 4 minutes), but it leaves my face as clean shaven as a razor; although the razor does seem to do it more quickly. I do like to shave in the morning before I leave for the gym or a workout, and on those mornings the electric shaver is just so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Great works for my 92 year old dad</li>
    <li> Pulls hair terribly bad.</li>
    <li> Very nice electric shaver that does not irritate your skin. Perfect to use as a primary shaver, but also great for quick touch-ups. I have used it both wet and dry with good results.  As the directions say, you must give it 30 days for your skin to properly condition to this way of shaving. The only small negative is there is nothing to duplicate a good blade shave, but it comes close. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> My go to is a rotary but this is my clean up machine for the very close shave -- it works. The wet/dry feature is awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product and works as advertised. Shaves close and without cutting your skin, fast motor so it does not pull on facial hair and charges fast. I would definately buy this shaver again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for 30 years, but the last one was no good.  Didn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s charge at all (would sag after 2 minutes of use on a fully charged battery) and the pop up hair trimmer broke after 4 months.  So, I decided to try this one.  What a difference!  Ten times better than the more expensive Braun. It is really light, the head pivots nicely and the shave is very close for an electric shaver.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Im on my 4th or 5th Panasonic shaver. It&#x27;s a great shaver that is well made and shaves very nicely. I really like that I can simply wash out with some soft soap and water.</li>
    <li> Historically, I have been a razor-guy. My hairs on my neck seem to go in all directions and traditionally, electric shaving has been tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Panasonic ES8243A. This shaver is handsomely built, with a good, solid feel to it as you hold it in your hands. The electronic display is clean and easy to read. The battery is excellent (I recommend a full charge before using, and using until it won&#x27;t turn on anymore, and then another full, 10 to 12 hour charge to condition the battery properly). I shaved once a day for about 3 weeks or so before it got low again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is pretty impressive. The motor is quiet and effecient, with a pleasingly high whine to let you know just how fast those blades are oscillating. I found the shave to be very close, skin tight,  with miminal irritation or \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot;. When I first bought the shaver, it required many passes at different angles on my neck hair. However, I followed the advice about using a new razor for 30 days before passing judgement, and I have noticed a marked improvement as I continued to shave every day. Now, most of the neck hair gets taken care of on the first pass, and I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time going over areas with multi-directional hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving dry for the most part, no pre-shave face washing or use of cream. This razor can handle it pretty easily. I jump out of bed and shave and I get a great, smooth face out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried shaving wet for the first time this morning and the shave was excellent. Hair and dirt build-up seem to be minimal and cleaning is a breeze. Just wet the foil and put some hand soap on it and activate the cleaning cycle and in less than a minute your Panasonic ES8243A is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was concerned about switching permanently to an electric razor, the Panasonic promptly put those fears to bed by giving me the best electric shave ever, and one that can compete with a razor any day! I definitely recommend giving it some time, if you are like me and have stubborn neck hairs, and you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the value, this is the best electric razor on the market, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Have used this product for over a month now and I still stand by my review. My  neck hair is getting easier and easier to shave and it actually feels smooth to the touch!like me and have stubborn neck hairs, and you will not be disappointed.    For the value, this is the best electric razor on the market, in my opinion.    EDIT: Have used this product for over a month now and I still stand by my review.

    <li> I know its a review about the product, for any technical info/review anyone can use the top rated review on this product. I have a Different point of view review:    Good for- those who wish to have Fairly NEAR to good shave   Good for- ppl like me who is pretty lazy about shaving, would like to accept Fairly NEAR to good shave.  Good for- ppl who has good tight skin (not like me, i have loose skin type)  Good for- ppl who has more time to shave ( for a   Fairly NEAR to good shave). Takes more time than the blade razor.      nothing is better than old BLADE/razor shave...learned after using electric razor product...if you are going to a party or any important event, must use the old BLADE razor shave.</li>
    <li> This is probably a five star shaver for most, it does shave very well. My problem is shaving along the jaw line, no shaver has ever worked well for me in this case. If I really work on this area, this shaver will do the job if I devote a lot of time to it. I&#x27;ve been shaving since 7th grade so my beard may be tougher then many others. I like this razor and would buy another one.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because the majority of reviews I read suggested it was the best and most affordable electric shaver available. This is my first electric shaver, so I can only compare it to my experience with normal razors. I have several critiques that I believe make this electric shaver a poor choice compared to a normal non-electric razor. The shave is uneven, especially on my neck. No matter how I try, I always have to pluck a number of hairs after shaving because the electric blade cannot get them. I&#x27;ve tried using pre-electric shave liquids to remedy this, but to no avail. Because it is harder to get these random unshaved hairs, it also takes me longer to shave than with a normal razor. Also, I constantly get razor burn because I have to go over the same areas so many times with my razor. This is especially a problem near my Adam&#x27;s apple and one I never experienced using a non-electric razor. Finally, the shape of the shaver is rather bulky (although it seems like a standard size for this type of screened electric shaver) and it makes it rather difficult to shave precisely, especially if you are trying to keep the borders of your beard even. I am quite disappointed on the whole, and I have been using this shaver for over a month a this point.</li>
    <li> Best Razor EVER. It is the closest shave you will find. Blows the Braun razor away that I had.</li>
    <li> Gives an awesome shave in the shower.  And it is considerably faster at giving a clean shave than my two previous Braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;The shave timer is a really interesting feature.&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 years of use, the display screen slowly started losing segments of the digits, and it is now nearly blank, but the shaver shaves on!&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other shavers which slow down audibly as the batteries discharge, this Panasonic maintains a constant frequency until it just shuts down with low battery.  Since I lost the display, I just charge the shaver whenever I notice that the shaving efficiency is slipping a little.  With a full charge, the efficiency is back, and I can go typically 2 weeks of daily use before I need to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;Other than losing the display, this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I use this razor in combination with Gillete&#x27;s shaving mouse.  I have been using it for just over a year and am very pleased with the shave I get from it.  It holds a charge reasonably well (about 14-18 shaves for me), and recharges very quickly (about 70 minutes).</li>
    <li> A great electric shaver</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive neck and shaving more than once a week used to be very painful.  I work as a firefighter and have to be clean shaven before all shifts.  This used to cause quite a dilemma until I purchased this shaver!    This shaver is great.  Works quick, easy to clean, and fast charger.  I am very satisfied.    Would have given 5 stars if the battery lasted longer between charging.  Only other downfall is this shaver misses some hairs on my neck that must have a funny angle.</li>
    <li> Pretty impressed with how close of a shave I got with this product. I tried for the longest time to use a razor - but my skin is SO sensetive that even with shaving in the shower - using pre-shave oil - shaving cream - etc. - couldn&#x27;t get a smooth - irritation free shave. With this razor - I still have to be careful to keep my face clean and moisturized - but I definitely get way less burn and a MUCH closer shave.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  I never had a closer shave with an electric razor.  Easy to use on my face.  \\&quot;Simplicity\\&quot; is my best overall assessment of this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried several electric razors over the years, but I always returned to the blade. Simply couldn&#x27;t get a close shave with an electric razor. I heard from a friend that the technology was much better now, so I decided to try again.    The Panasonic Arc IV Nano is great. It gives me a close shave in about three minutes either wet or dry. I usually shave in the shower, but sometimes I am pressed for time and the Nano gives me the flexibility of shaving while I am running around the house getting ready to leave. The battery life is a little short, but not inconvenient. I get about a week of daily shaves on a charge. Clean up is easy.</li>
    <li> I have always been a Gillette kind of guy.  Every few years, I buy a high-end electric razor with the hope that the technology has improved to the point where I&#x27;ll get as good a shave as with a blade, but I have been disappointed every time, until now...    My new Panasonic ES8243A is the best electric razor I have found. It&#x27;s fast and shaves almost as close as a blade. I recently bought a high-end Norelco Arcitec, which did a very good job, but it still couldn&#x27;t do as good job below my jaw line and above my lip and took longer to shave than with the Panasonic.    As long as I don&#x27;t press too hard, I get no irritation from this razor. I tried it both wet and dry and much preferred using it dry. I need the hairs to stand up when I&#x27;m shaving and that doesn&#x27;t happen when I use it wet. I am confident that after using it for several weeks I will get an even better shave than I am getting now.     I chose not to buy the model with the automatic cleaning system and I&#x27;m very glad I did. Cleaning this razor takes about 20 seconds and all you need is a little liquid soap. There is really no point in spending the extra money for the automatic cleaning system that requires expensive cartridge refills.     One more thing - it seems like every electric device you buy today recommends charging it for 24 hours before using it for the first time. The Panasonic is different - you plug it in, charge it until the light flashes telling you it has a full charge (about an hour) and then you use it.     Obviously, I am very pleased with this razor and I recommend it even to guys who&#x27;ve been using a blade. I think Mr. Gillette will have to learn to survive without my business from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a year now. Previously, I used the Panasonic ES8077 which I thought gave a nice shave, but this ES8243A blows it away!  The shave is close and smooth and, thanks to the larger shaving head, the shaving time is so much quicker! Also, I don&#x27;t miss the self-cleaning feature of the old ES8077 one bit; as a little liquid soap and running water does the trick! While I agree with some of the reviews that state that the shaver is a bit noisy, I can live with the noise given the nice shave this unit provides. So in sum, I would definitely recommend this shaver to others and would definitely buy it again myself!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best electric shaver I have ever used. I&#x27;ve had many $50-$60 electric shavers from Remington and Norelco (both foil and circular). I&#x27;ve always gawked at paying over $100 for a shaver. When this Panasonic shaver came up on Amazon&#x27;s Deal of the Day for $87, I was still a bit leary of paying that much, but the fact that it normally retails for over $100 (and a SRP of $199) and all the good reviews I read, I made the jump. I am so glad I did. I have never experienced quite a close shave as this one has provided. It literally makes my face feel as smooth as if I had used a straight edge.    From the package, it had 10% battery life. It claimed it was at 100% within 40 minutes or so. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 days now and it still says 100%. The manual does state that the battery is lithium-ion, which is awesome. Does not state so anywhere in the product details.</li>
    <li> I had done some research and found this Panasonic ES8243A shaver to be highly recommended. I bought it for my son and he loved it so much I just ordered another for my husband. Both were Norelco users and found the blades to dull quickly and the batteries to not hold a charge for long. Although it&#x27;s too soon to validate these issues with the Panasonic, in general the Panasonic has a higher quality feel, sound and appearance. And most importantly, works great according to my son. He says he gets a closer shave in far less time. I noticed the price had increased since my first purchase but I guess it&#x27;s because of the Christmas demand. Still a good bargain though.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my son, after buying the ES8249 for myself. The ES8243A comes without the elaborate charging/cleaning system, which I find to be unnecessary.  My son did not shave every day because of irritation from other shavers, but I let him try mine and he really liked it.  After several days, he realized he was not getting irritation bumps, so I bought this one for him.  He is now clean shaven every day.    I find these Panasonic shavers to be the best either of us has  used, including Braun and Norelco.    Well worth the price and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very easy to clean. Does a good job. It comes in a small zip-up wallet which makes it handy for carrying around. However, it&#x27;s a pity that the wallet does not have room for the lengthy charger cord which means two things to pack, rather than one.</li>
    <li> This ES8243A Arc IV Nano Shaver by Panasonic does not do a better job than older models.  Infact, the battery life of the shaver is about 30 minutes.  My much older Panasonic  would go for 1 1/2 hours.  The on/off button is extremely sensitive to pressure and one is likely to be constantly turning the shaver on again and again during a shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who suffered from terrible rash and burning every time he used his Norelco 3 head shaver.  I did a lot of research and decided on this one.  He hasn&#x27;t tried it wet yet, but so far says that he gets a lot less irritation with this than he did with the old shaver.  He has very sensitive skin so he still experiences a little sensitivity, but nothing like before.  Overall, a winner!</li>
    <li> First, I am coming from a Braun 7526 which I had for over 5 years. I could not let the shaver go. It really did it all - it left a smooth shave and the trimmer was unreasonably powerful. You could have ZZ Top beard and the 7526 would annihilate it. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the thing could cut wood like a chainsaw. Anyways, on with the review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic shaver is really great. Comparing it&#x27;s ability to shave, it blows the 7526 away. It&#x27;s lighter in your hand, and the motor seems to be much faster. It took me about the same time to shave with this Panasonic as my old Braun, but I anticipate it will get quicker as I get to know the new shaver better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con is the pop up trimmer on this Panasonic is incredibly weak. It was getting jammed up on whiskers that the Braun wouldn&#x27;t blink at. If I could change one thing, it would be a better trimmer on this. If you can live with that, I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband as a Christmas present.  He is very pleased with it. It gives him a clean, close shave and the ergonomically correct handle makes it easy to control.  Also, with the dry, cold weather we have been experiencing, the shaver has been extremely gentle on his sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers over the years and none were \\&quot;keepers\\&quot;. I heard an advertisement for this one and it got my attention. I normally shave in the shower because I have been shaving my head for the last 7 or 8 years it is a lot easier and cleaner and I can stand under the water and relax at the same time. I have had it now about 6 weeks and am totally happy with it. It can be used wet or dry, with or with out shaving cream, it tells you when it needs to be cleaned and is easy to clean. You just run it under a stream of warm water. The charge last a reasonably long time and charges in about an hour. It is great for quick touch ups before going out and I have had no shaver irritation from it. I ordered from Amazon who had the best price I could find on it and had it in 2 days even with their standard free shipping. I liked it so much I bought another one for a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> Does pretty fair job. Little noisy, but still like its performance.Cuts better than the mid-priced Norelco it replaced a while back.</li>
    <li> I shave both my face and head, so there is a lot of surface area to test over.    I&#x27;m used to dry electric shavers, so I&#x27;ve only used this dry and it has produced a very close smooth shave faster than my previous electric shaver.    A few recommendations would be that the battery could last a little longer (I get about two full head shaves out of a charge).    I like having a bigger trimmer. I think this one is comparable to most on the market, but my previous shaver had a larger one, which was nice when I had to trim a beard down first.    Overall very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time searching for an electric razor, and ultimately chose this one based on the value. It&#x27;s reasonably priced (comparatively speaking) and has years of good reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 10 months, and I absolutely love it. I have nothing bad to say. It gives a good shave, holds a good charge, and is easy to clean.  I highly recommend it. It took 2-3 weeks or so for my face to get adjusted. I was previously using disposable razors. In years past I had tried and given up on an electric razor (I forget the model) because I didn&#x27;t have succes with it. Not so for this Panasonic; it works great for me.</li>
    <li> I have rarely used Electric Shavers over the years as I never gotten a close shave as compared to  my trusty Gillette razors; however, after cutting myself recently, I looked at some shaver reviews  and surprise, the Panasonic ES8243A wet/dry shaver was listed as a top shaver.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t even know that Panasonic produced razors.  The reviews for the most part indicated that a very close shave would result, you could use both wet &amp; dry, there was very little skin irritation and that it was a better value than other electric shavers.  I would like to say that the ES8243A  has even exceeded my high expectations and has produced a wonderful shave (almost as close as a  Gillette or Shick shaver) and I expect to be using it for many years.  I did not purchase the  cleaning system and am happy just cleaning it the conventional way every couple of weeks.  I would  strongly recommend this shaver for anyone currently using an electric shaving or contemplating   purchasing one.  I assume the very competitive price that I received was due in part to the new  version of the shaver which just arrived in the marketplace.  It is basically the same as the   ES8243 so I don&#x27;t have any regrets in purchasing the one that I did.  It is a superior value  especially considering the cost of the upperend Norelco and Braun shavers that probably don&#x27;t   compare to my shaver in closeness of shave.</li>
    <li> Never had a better shave, including straight razor, blade razor, electric rotary shaver. This one fits the hand perfectly, gets right down to the skin everywhere. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!</li>
    <li> Update 05/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did order a new foil to replace the damaged one. The new one is black, not blue as was the original. It works a lot better. Still not sure whether wet or dry is the best approach though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:05 10 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using shaver occasionally. Somehow damaged the foil. $33 to replace. i don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********************&lt;br /&gt;Went looking for an electric shaver due to sore face issues from using regular razors. I did a lot of research and decided on the ES8243A based on many customer reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is much higher quality than any I had seen in the past. The concept of wet shaving appealed to me as I had tried dry electric shaving in the past with unsatisfactory results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a three month effort, I have concluded that this is a top qualty product that under any wet or dry  senario does not give me a close enough shave. (It did help relieve my facial soreness )I have gone back to a regular shaver. I will use the electric shaver from time to time if the soreness returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02 02 2011</li>
    <li> I will keep this review short due to the many other great detailed reviews.  Yes I get a fairly good shave (on my face), I like the fact that I do NOT have to have the \\&quot;cleaning system\\&quot; taking valuable space on my bathroom counter.  I like the fact that this shaver does NOT need a cradle to charge (again taking un-needed space).  I do not like the fact that it does have an AC brick (albeit a small one), all my other shavers had none (small peeve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1.  I do not get a good shave with this razor on my neck.  I have to use a magnifying mirror and light and then shave over and over to get a clean shave.  I have a light beard but the hairs have a slight curve to them.  So they grow out and then back in, so it is hard for a razor to catch them.  The best razors I have owned for this was an inexpensive ($40) single foil Braun (bought it 25+ years ago) and the Norelco&#x27;s with the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2.  Here is the worst thing, and I have NOT SEEN IN ANY OTHER REVIEWS.  This shaver does not seem to have a reservoir, in other words, as you shave (dry), the hairs drop down upon you.  Why has no one else complained about this?  I do not understand, seems to be a big deal to me.  I HATE shavings dropping on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 20110617  I pulled out my old Norelco today and tried shaving with it.  WOW!, I got a MUCH better and quicker shave in my neck area.  It was much better at picking up the hairs that have a slight curve to them.  The Norelco shaves without me having to pull on my skin (as much) to try to \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the hairs up so the shaver can cut them.</li>
    <li> After using various Norelco shavers for years, I have been delighted with the switch to this Panasonic unit.  It is very comfortable and easy to charge as well as clean.  The time of usage and time remaining is clearly visible.  I get a much closer, more comfortable shave either wet or dry compared to all of the Norelcos.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband who was using an older Braun which was having issues and was on it&#x27;s last leg. We looked at a lot of reviews and compared them with price and decided to go with the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano. It came to us without delay (shipping from Amazon has been excellent for all of our purchases so far). My husband has used it for several weeks and is very happy with it. The shave is closer than his old razor by far and takes less time (though he did say its not as close as a blade but said no electric razor is). It does have a higher pitch sound but not enough to wake me when he gets up before me. All in all it is worth the price which we thought was very reasonable. He has sensitive skin and would recommend this to those who also do as well as those who don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic razors for over 10 years.  Each model seems to have a few more bells &amp; whistles or features than previous model.  The shaver works as advertised.  Smooth shave all in 2 to 3 minutes.  I am not sure how it would compare to a Braun.  And that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  But being over $100 cheaper than the Braun 7 series which is not a true wet dry shaver.  I am completely satisfied with the shaver as I have with previous Panasonic&#x27;s that I have used.  I have tried a few rotary shavers, but don&#x27;t get a close shave as I do with the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver, a Norelco, for four years, but have been dissatisfied with the shave: It leaves unshaven or badly shaven patches, and trying to remedy that by pressing down or going over the area more frequently led to discomfort: red, irritate skin.    I bought this Panasonic and my first shave out of the box was a revelation: A shave that had taken five minutes or more with the Norelco took less than three with the Panasonic, and the quality of the shave was uniformly superb, a smooth, even result that I had not gotten since I stopped using a safety razor.    I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> As a cancer patient, I was told my skin would become tender from my treatments.  So I was told to ditch the bladed razor for a while. I&#x27;m not real crazy about electrics, but the wet feature does a fair job.</li>
    <li> Over my shaving years (more than 50 of &#x27;em) I&#x27;ve had electric razors from every US manufacturer that \\&quot;was\\&quot;, and Norelco. All \\&quot;worked\\&quot; with varying idiosyncratic design and/or use features. Now, with this Panasonic Nano I factually achieve the closest electric shave ever, rivaling my Gillette 5 blade wet shave BUT no skin loss, so I have baby-butt smooth and soft cheeks :-)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor.  Even though I do have to go over a couple of areas more than once, it does a better job than any electric that I have ever used.  I also like the handy faucet that is displayed when it needs cleaning.  Great razor!</li>
    <li> I brought a Panasonic 8224 shaver back in 2008 may and cost me $100 and it&#x27;s still working, and now it needs new blade. So I was looking and I found this one at Amazon.  I got it after two days after I order it. The new 8243&#x27;s look, feel and sound better than the 8224, it&#x27;s four blade tech is way comfortable and smooth then all the other shavers that I ever used. I am really happy with my purchase and I will recommend it to the other friends.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of electric shavers in my life, non that I have used more than once except for this one. The quality is superior and it does the job almost effortlessly! No cuts, bleeding or shaving rash.  I am hooked to Panasonic Arc Shavers now!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Took down 3 days growth with ease. Have used both wet and dry.  Very pleased with it so far.  Highly recommend this product if you have a thick growth.</li>
    <li> I have had probably six Panasonic Wet/Dry. They keep getting better, though everyone i have has had  probably less than a year of battery life. The shave is the best I have had, but the jury is still out on battery life. Hopefully this one will be longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a $60 Remington wet/dry shaver for a long time, as well as a Schick Xtreme blade. The Remington not only had dull blades but wasn&#x27;t holding much of a charge and didn&#x27;t get in the crevices very well. When your face isn&#x27;t perfectly smooth, shaving every day with a blade is a pain in the neck. I wanted an electric shaver that gave a close shave but wasn&#x27;t exorbitantly expensive. The reviews on this Panasonic were really good so I gave it a try. I see why the reviews were so good. It&#x27;s an awesome shaver and well worth the money. First of all, it fits perfectly in the hand so that you can maneuver it without nearly dropping it. The best part is how close it shaves. I disagree with some of the reviews that it cuts as close as a blade. That&#x27;s physically impossible, but it does come close. Plenty close for me to use as a daily shaver, leaving the blade for special occasions. It holds the charge for quite a long time and the display gives you all the information you would need from a shaver. I definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever. No chafing, no burning. Super smooth result. Takes the chore out of shaving. Holds charge for long time!</li>
    <li> I read that Panasonic linear motor shavers are the best, and after trying them, I agree.  This is the best shaver I have ever used.  Not much more that I can say.  Look for a sale and buy one.</li>
    <li> Works great, holds charge for a long time as well. Cleaning is easy with can of compressed air, just blow out and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband who has sensitive skin and gets ingrown hairs from shaving.  He loved this shaver.  Said it felt great, gave a close shave.  He is going to also use for wet  shaving to make the sensitivity non existent.  He happily now shaves even on weekends.</li>
    <li> works pretty good. have to go over some spot over and over again.  in the end, it gives a pretty smooth, clean shave. love the fact that you can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norleco rotary shavers all of my life, and this is the first of this type shaver I have ever tried. What a difference! This so much better and faster than the rotary type that it is almost unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad.  He had really coarse whiskers as he grew older and it was hard for him to shave.  This solved the problem.  He really loved it.  The head was easy to pop off and clean.</li>
    <li> By far, the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;ve been using them for about 50 years.  This is the first one that doesn&#x27;t ever give me a rash/irritation no matter when I use it.  This shaver is a dream to clean.  I don&#x27;t see how it could be made any better.</li>
    <li> I have a tendency to flip-flop between an electric shaver and a razor (Mach 3). Once again, I decided to go back to the electric shaver. Before doing so, I did quite a bit of research and decided on this model. The various reviews on the internet (and Amazon) were persuasive enough for me to choose this particular shaver. I can use either the wet or dry shaving method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the shaver arrived, I opened the box to see what contents were there. It&#x27;s relatively simple. The shaver was enclosed in the travel pouch with a plastic cover for the head. The charger next to it. On top was the documentation. I plugged the shaver in and saw that it was on zero percent power. I waited as it fully charged (just a little over an hour) and the digital readout showed 100% charge. I then tried out my new shaver and I must say, I&#x27;m completely happy with the results. One thing that I noticed in many of the reviews was that to shave with this particular model, you need to move the shaver around in a circular motion, not just up and down. Once I did that, I found that I now had a close shave, which is exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: close shave, very intuitive (easy to use), wet/dry mode, reasonable charge time, no need for a shaver &amp;#34;bath&amp;#34; just place the head under running water and turn shaver on in turbo mode (press the power button and hold) to clean.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: A small nuisance but still it needs to be pointed out: the travel bag does not have enough room for the charger. Not sure I get that.</li>
    <li> After using it for more than 3 months I can say that it is a very good product.  It takes me from 2 to 4 minutes to shave, cleaning is very easy and I can use it for a week without recharging. It also gives me the closest shave I have ever gotten since I use electric shavers. I am really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Have been shaving for over 40 years with a blade. Started RVing this year and was not always practical to shave in the morning. Read the reviews on this shaver and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert! Takes 4 to 5 minutes to shave as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Works great for a touch up if going out in the evening.  Charges up in no time (less than an hour). No problems with adapting to an electric razor, and no face irritation.</li>
    <li> Within a couple of months the electronic display stopped working.  I decided to keep it because the shave was so good and I didn&#x27;t want to wait a month for the product to be fixed.  Now (the razor is less than a year old),  the razor stops working for no reason and also switches to the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; function in the middle of shaving.  To make it start again in the correct mode I have to plug it into the charger for several minutes (even at full charge - which is difficult to know because the display doesn&#x27;t work).  For a Japanese product costing well over a $100, its a terrible purchase.  Again, great shave, but I would expect the razor to last several years, not a few months.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. The reviews here were very helpful in leading me to try it, and I am glad I did. I have sensitive skin and a tough beard (always has taken me multiple passes and discomfort at times regardless of whether I use blade or electric). Switched from blade to electric many years ago and had to give up a close shave for less irritation. Been using a variety of Braun shavers which are the best I have found ... until now. This Panasonic is not only a lot less expensive, it gives me a much closer shave. What used to take 20-25 minutes with a Braun now takes me 15 minutes or less (don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever get it down to 5-10 like most folks due to my troublesome skin/whisker situation, but I am very happy with the results). It is also a breeze to clean. The only knock is it doesn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s charge very long, so I pretty much have to charge it every 1-2 uses, but that&#x27;s minor to me. Also, some of the other reviewers mentioned dry versus wet, using pre-shave products, etc. I tried dry, and it doesn&#x27;t get as close, but for quick touchups it works well. I tried a couple different types of pre-electric lotions, and it helps me get a closer shave, but the best for me is just using plain water - really gives me the closest and most comfortable shave. I highly recommend this shaver especially for those like me who have always had a tough time finding a shaver that gets a close shave, is comfortable and little or no skin irritation, is quick, and is easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Razor was fair at best for shaving from jaw line up.  From jaw line down it was horrible.  No matter how my husband tried it, wet or dry, pulling skin in every direction, it would not shave neck area. Totally unsatisfactory.  Very disappointing because product&#x27;s features are exactly what he wanted.  Amazon&#x27;s return policy and process are fantastic. We won&#x27;t hesitate to try products with Amazon making it so easy to return something we&#x27;re not happy with.</li>
    <li> Used this for about a year. Easy to clean needed every second use. Shaving head a bit small, an extra 3/4 centimeter would speed shaving time-4 to 6 minutes average. Well made parts clean of tags and fit to tight tolerance. Shaves razor clean witout the skin burn. Shave three day beard growth at most. Longer tends to pull and cleaning required. Long shave time reason for four star rating.</li>
    <li> This razor works really well. Never nicks you. Holds a charge well and has a digital display to tell you how much longer it will last. I wanted a durable shaver, so I purchased it for myself. However, my husband tried it out and won&#x27;t stop using it. We&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks and my husband still loves it. We are ordering another one, so we don&#x27;t have to share!</li>
    <li> I researched and reviews were good for this shaver. Easy to clean with soap and water and with turbo boost mode. Requires a number of passes to get a close shave but then, this is my head where the stubble can be quite thick. Only had a couple of months so will see how the foils last and the add to this revue.</li>
    <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had w/ an electric razor.  I&#x27;ve found Norelco&#x27;s blades to be slow and they pull (and hurt!) when shaving longer hair. The Braun I used was better in that regard since the speed of its blades are much greater, but the whole shaver vibrated something fierce and it didn&#x27;t shave particularly closely. The Panasonic&#x27;s blades move at a much, much higher speed than either of those. None of that vibration is transmitted to the rest of the shaver and as a result it&#x27;s much quieter than the others. It only takes me 3 to 4 minutes to shave in the morning and it does a great job. Well done Panasonic!</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best, if not THE best, shavers I&#x27;ve ever had.  I have had for about 2 years with no problems whatsoever and don&#x27;t anticipate any.  Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> my husband, being a man with a heavy beard and sensitive skin especially around the neck area, he was impressed by the rave reviews. his initial shaves showed promise, he used this product both in the shower and with shave gel at the sink. he had better results after or during a shower, but it was leaving patches on his neck and side burn area and jaw line, that no matter how much he went over it there would still be a small amount stubble left. Then about three weeks in he started getting cuts and nicks and the razor burn on his neck area was getting bad.  he has an old norelco that i paid 20 dollars for at Walmart 10 years ago that never once cut or nicked him! I&#x27;ve never heard of this happening from an electric razor. he hasn&#x27;t used it now in 4 days and he still has scabs on his upper lip from where it cut deep in 3 places. this was from normal use, he wasn&#x27;t even pressing hard, needless to say, i&#x27;m returning this today after his 3 and a half weeks of misery, he says he thinks he&#x27;ll have better results from my cheese grater. save yourself the $100.00+ and look else where.</li>
    <li> This has worked like a champ.  Much better than my previous 3-rotary head electric razor.  It is a little noisy with the buzz of the high oscillating blades, but what should you expect.  It works good and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Better and faster than any manual razor.  Leaves faces far less irratated.  Better than my last electric  razor.  Do buy</li>
    <li> This Razor works great . The best I have ever tried, no razor burn and close shave. What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this shaver.  It&#x27;s easy to handle and clean -- important for me, a person who has use of only one hand.  It \\&quot;glides\\&quot; while giving the closest shave I ever had from other comparably priced brands.  And it tells me when it&#x27;s time to wash the heads, which is kind of fun (turning on the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; speed.)  Hey, this baby even tells me when it&#x27;s time to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate Amazon&#x27;s service too: I received what I ordered -- and fast too.</li>
    <li> All I can say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; what a close and smooth wet shave, I haven&#x27;t had a great shave like this since my brothers wedding in 05&#x27; I had done at the barber shop.     Best Regards,    Nick</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using razors for years because of my sensitive skin. Before that I used a norelco, which was hard on my skin.   I decided to give a wet/dry electric razor a try.  After much research, I decided to purchase the Panasonic Arc IV.    It was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have been shaving with an electric razor for over 20 years. This is the best I have ever had. The spots on my neck my Braun would leave behind are easily gone with this razor. Have only had it for a month but it is the best razor I have had. Water proof makes it easly cleaned without a special cleaner.</li>
    <li> I really like the shaver overall, but with only two blades, it takes me a bit longer to get the close shave I desire than I&#x27;d like (around 5+ minutes).  My previous Panasonic Linear shaver had 3 blades which I believe provided a faster shave.  Otherwise, this one gives a close shave...and I like the timer and percent charge remaining indicators.</li>
    <li> This has been the best wet/dry shaver I have ever owned. I tried the Billy Jealousy shave product and it was ok. I found a product from Real Shaving Company that works great. Amazon carries a limited product line (currently unavailable), but I can find it at my local Rite-Aid Pharmacy. They do not however have it on their website. The only online stores are in the UK. Hopefully, Amazon will carry this item.    Anyway, great shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Panasonic razors and had one prior to this model for over 2 years.  Just wanting to see what the future of shaving was, I cast aside my perfectly good but aging electric and, based on the reviews on Amazon and my belief in the Panasonic product line, purchased this model.  Within the first minute of use, I knew this was the ultimate shaving experience.  I have a heavy beard that wants to (and does), grow in many directions.  This Panasonic takes full control and leaves me smooth without the burn that I have felt from other razors in the past - especially when shaving dry.  Battery life is good and I find the indicator very helpful.  This is the first time I have taken the time to write a review, if this gives you a clue as to how I feel about this product.  I had to get the word out!</li>
    <li> This was the first electric shaver I bought and was pretty excited to get to use it.  Once I got it I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out because the reviews I found about it were great.  I&#x27;ve had it about a month now and it shaves your face great but when it came to neck hairs it was not that great.  I would have patches where it just wouldn&#x27;t cut and ended up having to rub it over the same spot for 5 minutes or would give up and just get out my razor blade.  To me, if you can&#x27;t get the neck hairs its pretty useless and its past the 30-day money back guarantee so I can&#x27;t return it now either.  I would say if you are looking into buying an electronic shaver for the first time check to see if the reviews mention neck hairs because those are the hardest spots to reach.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd panasonic razor similar to this one I have owned. I have replaced them only due to the battery eventually wearing out after several years. I have pretty bad in grown hairs on my neck and after your skin is used to an electric razor it does fine. One thing this razor does not do that the other foil razors I have owned is cut your skin. Does this cut as close as a Mach 3?  Of course not!  No electric razor does. I am sick of people comparing electric razors to regular ones.  I can shave in my truck on the way to work (and I shave my head too and it works great)  Can you do that with a regular razor/no shaving cream? I know people are going to argue this, but honestly if you want the closest best shave then do it the old fashoined way.  If your like me and are always in a hurry and like to multitask.... Then buy this.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used many electric razors in the past, but this tops them all.  I suppose it depends on whether or not you prefer a foil razor, but if you do, this one can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have used. I used a Gillette Fusion razor before that. I did a decent amount of research before buying this one.    When I initially started using this shaver (little more than a month ago), it did a very good job on the face, but really struggled on the neck (there were patches of hair it could not remove) - trying it wet or with a regular shaving cream did not help either. I put too much pressure and tried repeatedly, but that did not improve results (just as the manual says), it only caused irritation. The manual also says you need to wait about 30 days to see improved results (so do others, with experience with an electric shaver), so that your skin and hair get \\&quot;used\\&quot; to it. Even though I was disappointed at first, and wanted to return it, I patiently waited for 30 days, even though waiting past 30 days would mean it will be beyond the returnable time limit.    Gradually, it started doing a better job on the neck. Now, I can get an excellent, close shave (just like an excellent razor), without applying any pressure, and without any irritation, both on my face and neck. Dry seems to work better than wet or with a regular shaving cream, for me. However, the best results were with a pre-electic shave lotion - closest shave (even on the neck), least effort, least irritation and least amount of time spent.    Pros:  + Excellent, close shave (face and neck), like an excellent razor  + Very little effort required; easy and convenient to use and carry (comes with a travel case)  + No shaving cream required; also does a very good job dry  + Does a phenomenal job with an electric pre-shave lotion  + No irritation, no cuts  + Not messy - most of the cut hair stays inside  + Very quick - usually takes about 2.5 minutes for me; it has a timer  + Very easy to clean - just remove foil, and rinse both foil and blades in running water (an expensive, elaborate and cumbersome cleaning system is not required)  + Enough charge - I can get at least 15 to 20 shaves on 1 charge (no need to take your charger with you on most trips); charges very quickly  + Money saved on expensive regular razor blades - I believe you need to seldom replace this electric shaver&#x27;s foil and blades (at a reasonable price)  + Excellent value for money    Cons:  - requires at least 30 days to start showing good results, especially on the neck (in my case)    Overall, an excellent product (as you would come to expect from Panasonic), however I had to be very patient for a little more than 30 days, and had to resist the urge to return it.    Worth every dollar - I thoroughly enjoy using it! Much more convenient and quicker shave than a regular razor, without the mess, cuts or irritation!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this shaver. It met all of my expectations. It far outstripped a Braun shaver which I had recently purchased and have junked.</li>
    <li> I did a great deal of research before buying my new razor.  The ratings on this thing were pretty high and everyone had good things to say, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impressions... it&#x27;s expensive, but well made.  The LCD screen is pretty cool looking and it&#x27;s waterproof.  But the shave sucks... maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve always use rotary style electric razors.  This razor failed to give a close shave and it would often pull on the hairs, making the shave both painful and ineffective.  Even with the discomfort I used this razor for about a year before I finally replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline... After a year of use, I still regret this purchase more than any other I&#x27;ve made online.  I trusted the reviews and ended up with an expensive razor that I absolutely hate.</li>
    <li> In my search for the best electric shaver, I have tried various Braun and Norelco shavers. The Braun models did an excellent job with the mustache area, a good job with the facial area, but a terrible job with the neck.  The Norelco models did a much better job with the neck area, a good job with the facial area, but not as good for the mustache area. Almost reverse from the Braun results. I stayed with Noreclo for years but was extremely disappointed with the Sensotouch 3D model and switched back to my older Norelco model. When I decided to purchase a new shaver I purchased the Panasonic ES8243A. Finally, the electric shaver that gives me an excellent shave for the mustache area, facial area, and neck area! Trimmer works great (one of the worse features for the Sensotouch). Clean-up is quick and simple. Battery indicator lets you know when to charge so you never lose power during the shave. The only negative is it is definitely the loudest electric shaver that I have owned but the minor inconvenience is worth it for the excellent shave.</li>
    <li> Goodbye Braun razors after 20 years....hello Panasonic.Panasonic wins hands down.So smooth and efficient.I had the Braun 5 series...YUK so Panasonic is now the Champ</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the best one he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> this particular razor is terrible at shaving.  Have had it for a couple of years &amp; it takes for ever to get a clean shave.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> So let me start out by saying that I hate shaving. Its such a waste of time and energy. I specifically hate shaving with a razor.  The process of getting your face wet applying shaving cream and then cleaning up after myself is particularly daunting especially in the morning where I just want to get out the door and get to work on time. Secondly I have a younger looking face so if I don&#x27;t shave I look like a 25 year old homeless man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I go.  Be under no illusion that this device can give you as close of a shave as a razor would.  Let me precede this by mentioning that when I shave with a razor (mac 3) I shave against the hair so when I do go to the razor its a very close shave. I, however, don&#x27;t care to have a close shave unless I&#x27;m doing something special like going out to dinner with my wife or going to some nice event. In the rest of the cases I just want the majority of that itchy facial hair to be at a minimum and to avoid my \\&quot;homeless\\&quot; look.  Thats where the Panasonic wet/dry comes into play.  I love it. It takes me about 2-3 minutes to shave with no cleanup no shaving cream, nothing.  So much easier than having to get my face wet and all that other stuff. Its so easy to cary around and I just throw it in my travel bag whenever I am going anywhere.  The nice thing is also that I don&#x27;t need after shave afterwards (where as when using a razor I definitely do).  I justs shave and go.  That said I have to mention that the quality of the shave is not as good as compared to a razor.  On my checks and around my lips I get a clean enough and close enough shave but around my neck, especially around my adams apple, it tends to miss stuff and I have to do multiple passes.  With the curviness of my neck it tends to have a bit more problems and I have to go over the same spot a few times if I want to get everything.  In general I don&#x27;t care that much about that area since I just want to look semi presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is really good. I usethe thing once a day or once every other day and I feel like I need to charge it about once every two or three weeks. Cleaning it is a breeze.  Just shove it under water or if you really want pop the top off (super simple) and run some water over it. Cleaning takes me less than 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this thing is a great time saver.  Its not as good as shaving with a razor but I don&#x27;t need that clean of a look all the time so for me its a perfect middle ground device.  I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything.</li>
    <li> This is the first Electric Razor that I have ever bought that I can say I love.  Use it in the shower and out of the shower and it works great either way.</li>
    <li> This is my first foil shaver. It shaves OK (not great) but is quite noisy compared to the Norelcos I&#x27;ve used previously. I like the cleaning system. My next shaver purchase likely will be a Norelco.</li>
    <li> The shaver has replaced a Braun one that&#x27;d been in my possession for almost 4 years and the change is for the better.  With Braun (not a cheap one) I&#x27;ve had a small but persistent irritation under the chin. Nothing like that with this Panasonic; it just removes the growth and that is it. And that is what I want from it.  The head is noticeably larger than the head on the Braun and it took me a few minutes to develop a proper shaving technique; life is better now.  The proposed cleaning procedure looks scary on paper but is actually very unsophisticated and is quite entertaining - you get to watch how liquid soap gets foamed up right before your eyes, and how it moves about, and how the foam gets less and less clean as it removes stuff from the blades; and it takes less than a minute to clean the shaver.  The battery holds the charge well. The time between charges is variable, but I&#x27;d say that I need to charge it every other week; that is with frequent cleanups.  Thumbs up so far.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands first electric shaver. And he is so in love with this shaver, he uses it every morning and boost how good it is.</li>
    <li> OK - I bought this razor 10 months ago in December of 2010 and after 10 months of using it I can honestly say this was a waste of money.  Really, I could have told you that after 4 months but I never got around to posting a review and an extra 6 months has only firmed my opinion that I wasted my money.  First - let me share that I do not have a heavy beard at all. I have light hair and I have never been accused of having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Heck, I don&#x27;t have a shadow the next morning if I shave with a blade. When I have a beard, the hair is finer than most mens.  I do know that after the first 30 days I thought about writing a review and at that time I would have given it 4 stars.  I would have taken 1 star off because the closeness of the shave was not as good as my Norelco rotary that had just died.  However, it was fine at 30 days.  The shave lasted the day.  Now? Its almost a joke.  The shave does not last until the end of my work day.  I get home and neither my wife or my kids want to kiss me as my face feels like sand paper to them.  When I am done shaving, its not even that close. I stop because I&#x27;m tired of running the shaver over my face.  There are several places on my neck that it completely misses after a few days I find I have to use a blade to get the long hairs it keeps missing.  I have to use the blade often after my shave anyway just to get to some spots.  And if I am doing anything important where a shave is important? I use a blade.  I would not recommend this to any one. Heck, if I came across a brand new one of these laying in the street, I would not pick it up.  I can only imagine that the bulk of the 4/5 start reviews were written by people in the first 30 days, when it works fairly well.  For me - I will go back to the Norelco rotary next time, which will be soon.</li>
    <li> This shaver provides a smooth shave. Whether or not it is better than my 9-year old Norelco I cannot tell -- how much has the Norelco improved?  The buzzing sound is rather like a giant bumble bee around one&#x27;s head; I await the sting. It is not unpleasant.  My only disappointment (compared to my old Norelco) is a short battery life between recharges. The literature refers to a \\&quot;3-minute shave\\&quot; in it&#x27;s computations. How many folk can shave in 3 minutes?  I am also concerned about the adverse reports on how the company deals with customer complaints or problems. I can only hope I have none.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who cannot shave with regular razors.  He loves it.  He&#x27;s had it for a couple months and it&#x27;s still sharp. It charges fast and it&#x27;s easy to use.  He&#x27;s used alot of other electric razors that didn&#x27;t cost as much as this one but were inferior to this one.  It was well worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth without being abrasive. Cleans easy. Great shaver!</li>
    <li> Second Panasonic shavor I had and would never go back to the other higher price and less satisfying of a shaver.  Very close cut and comfortable to use.  Simple to clean.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco shavers for many years, but this panasonic has given me my closest shave ever. I only shave wet in the shower and this does a better job than my norlelco 1290 3d. Also was half the price. PS blade replacement is about 40% less than the norelco.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES8243A is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned in my 59 years. In my opinion and experience, this shaver excels in wet mode with a bit of hot water and shaving cream slathered on the face. It effortlessly glides over your beard, leaving a baby skin smoothness in only 1 or 2 passes. No irritation whatsoever. I use it in the shower where the steam and hot water seems to soften the beard nicely. Love the fact that it&#x27;s made for shower or wet shaves at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to hate shaving (both with blades and other electric shavers). Now (if you can believe this), I look forward to shaving with the ES8243A. Clean-up is a snap with popping off the foil and rinsing the blades in hot water for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great purchase from Amazon with no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (6/1/2012):  6 months later the motor started to have weird behavior.  The motor would oscillate from low to high speed, and the shaver would then pinch the skin when trying to shave.  I called Panasonic support, who had me send it back for warranty service at my expense ($12).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-3 weeks later Panasonic mailed me what looked like a new, sealed box with labeling saying it was made and imported from Japan.  The shaver inside was sealed in plastic as if brand new. It worked well for a month and then the original problem returned.  The motor would oscillate between low and high speed and it wouldn&#x27;t shave.  It looks to me like there&#x27;s a design flaw with the foil and how it attaches to the shaver, as the motor runs fine with the foil removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Panasonic again, and mentioned that the same problem returned.  I half jokingly said maybe they just sent me the original problem unit back the first time.  Surprisingly, the rep said that just may well be what happened.  I was directed to send this second one back at my expense.  I&#x27;m about ready to give up.  Downgrading from 5 to 2 stars (would be 1 star but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a universalproblem or just me).</li>
    <li> Pros:  1. Good shaving in General   2. Fast charging battery and long lasting batteries  3. Easy to clean compared to Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d   4. Well made  5. Good in we/dry shaving  Cons  1. Not very good around neck line, Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d gives better shaving in this area  2. Philips Norelco 1250x/40 has a smoother shaving compared to this one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned three Braun shaving systems that were much more expensive than the ES8243A. The Panasonic out performs the Braun hands down.</li>
    <li> This shaver is like a high revving Sport Bike Motorcycle engine in a lawnmower.  I simply move the razor up and down one row after another on my face and the hair is gone.  There is no need to go over the area twice; and the only reason I do is because I&#x27;m obsessive/compulsive.  What a great product!  The only negative I can say is about myself: Why did I take so long to find this shaver?  P. S. Amazon is fantastic.  They make buying a product so easy that when it arrives you can only stand in awe of their expertise.  I have now bought several things through Amazon and will only buy from them--E Bay who?  Thanks Amazon for giving me another purchasing option on the Internet.  I like you more than Zappos, and I like Zappos a lot.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for our son who never used an electric shaver.After using it for the first time he said he would probably never use a regular razor again. He said it shaved closer and smoother than a regular razor!!  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> The Panasaonic shaver is a great product that can be used underwater for a close shave. I have been using them for the past 15 years and they keep on getting better each time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic razors for many years and the ES8243 is arguably the best yet. My only complaint is the high price of the replacement head and blade kits. My first Panasonic was an ES8065 that with new head and blades can still rival the latest Panasonics. Assuming that Panasonic&#x27;s razor technology would evolve forward over time, I later purchased an ES8092 that, for whatever reason, turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment in cutting performance, not at all comparable to the ES8065. The ES8243 restored my faith in Panasonic razors with superb cutting performance. The only issue is the absurdly high-priced replacement head and blade kit. You almost might was well buy a new razor instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was a dry shaver for years. I suppose I was a traditionalist. But with the ES8092&#x27;s poor cutting performance, I experiemented with lectric shave and Afta. These products work, but I disliked having to wash them off my face afterwards. I finally took the plunge with my ES8243 and began wet shaving (with Aveeno shave gel). I&#x27;m sold on this being the best way to shave, and get the most out of one&#x27;s Panasonic razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m still satisfied and feel Panasonic shavers are the best electric shavers currently available. But I have a thought. The performance of Panasonic&#x27;s blade and foil design depends on high quality (expensive) metals. However, while the price of such metals has risen much over the last 5 years, the market won&#x27;t accept price increases from Panasonic. Their shaver pricing hasn&#x27;t changed much over the last 3 years. So something has to give somewhere. I suspect blade quality isn&#x27;t as high as years past, resulting in lower performance and shorter life. This is my humble thought, I may be all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: After a little more than a year of use, the upper half of the LEDs of the \\&quot;percent remaining\\&quot; number have failed. Having just changed the foil and blades after one year of use, to have this happen, I&#x27;m disappointed. From my personal experience with Norelco and Braun, I still prefer Panasonic. BUT, the quality isn&#x27;t what it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, since I have not witnessed any benefit to the ES8243A&#x27;s 4-blade design, and the replacement foil/blade kit is absurdly expensive, I plan to replace this with the more affordable 3-blade ES8103S. My older 3-blade razors (e.g. ES8065) cut great with the Panasonic 3-blade design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3: The LED display is unreadable. Half the LEDs don&#x27;t function. I&#x27;m very disappointed. My earlier Panasonic razors never had any failures. I simply needed to buy a new blade and foil kit every year. Panasonic&#x27;s design quality has clearly changed. If I can make it to year-end, I&#x27;ll buy the ES8103S at that time because its purchase and re-blade costs are more reasonable. I certainly have not found any advantage in the higher priced ES8243A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Shaving in the shower with shaving gel, although I take off the head and rinse the head and foil well, over time I noticed an almost invisible build-up that seems to bind the head&#x27;s moving parts. I now soak the head in a glass of white vinegar every month and it safely disolves away the shaving cream/gel residue.d. From my personal experience with Norelco and Braun, I still prefer Panasonic.

    <li> I have been shaving with Panasonic shavers for about 6 years now, I settled on the panasonic brand after trying Norelco and remington, I feel that the panasonic shaves better for me.    My previous panasonic models were the 8066 that I used for 3 years then got replaced with the ES8163 which has worked flawlessly for about 3 years now, the only complaint on the 8163 is that the LCD screen doesn&#x27;t work after 3 years of daily use but does not interfere with the performance.    I decided to upgrade to the new Arc Nano 4 ES8243 after seeing very good reviews on the electric razor forums and from previous positive experience with this brand, I just got it and all I can say is WOW! This new model shaves way better than the 8163 I had! I feel that the shave is closer and more confortable, wet or dry it shaves more closely than previous models with less irritation and no burns specially in the neck area and jaw.     This model also feels lighter than the 8163 and is less noisy. The pictures posted on Amazon does not do this shaver justice!!! This blue shaver is gorgeous!    The only Con I see is that they should have included a charging base as the 8163 had, nothing fancy just a nice base, and drop the price of the screens and blades to around $30&#x27;ish this would be an even sweeter deal.    If you are on the fence on one of these, I suggest you go for it and buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.    Thanks!  AlexGT</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this shaver since the first time I used it. I was looking for a shaver that really makes the shaving process an agreable one.</li>
    <li> I have several electric shavers - always looking to try out something new. Up until now, my best shave was from the Norelco Arcitec line. Well, the Arcitec has been put aside in favor of the Arc IV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a Panasonic a couple of years ago (one of their lower-end models) and found it gave a pretty good shave when used wet, but a so-so shave when used dry. It was particularly poor on the neck and jaw line, areas where the Arcitec really shines. It was a very comfortable shave, but the Panny got passed along to my nephew since I mostly tend to shave dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heard that the Arc IV had some notable improvements, so I thought I&#x27;d check it out (especially since it was on sale). I&#x27;m pleased to report that the improvements are real -- the dry shave is far better than before, especially on the neck area. Just as gentle as the Braun Pulsonic, but far closer.  Perhaps even a wee bit closer than the Norelco, and certainly more gentle on the face than a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is excellent -- very solid with a non-slip grip. The screen area gives info on charge status which is very helpful (does it in percent of charge left). Recharge time is great (under 1 hour for a total discharge to total charge status).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is one of the easiest to clean, so save some money and get this model rather than the model with the cleaning station. I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic cleaning stations and, while they are better than the ones offered by Remington and Norelco, they are way behind what Braun offers. You&#x27;ll get the razor just as clean -- and usually cleaner -- if you clean it under the tap (just a couple of drops of liquid soap, run it in turbo mode, quick rinse, and you&#x27;re done). Since the razor is built to be used in the shower, you don&#x27;t have to be careful as you are with other razors when rinsing it off under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent shave, easy to clean, quick to charge, and comfortable to use. Five stars!!</li>
    <li> I have, like many of the reviewers, used a rotary shaver previously. They never shaved my neck well, as I have a tough beard. I was hesitant to buy another electric shaver. The Panasonic is a \\&quot;cut above\\&quot; (sorry!) any shaver I have used! I also used the Gillette Fusion 5 blade razor. This Panasonic shaves nearly as well. Each time I use the shaver, it does a better job, as my face gets used to it more and more.</li>
    <li> Really not a review of shaver.  I had a mixup and within 5 minutes wished to cancel/change.  Can not. This may be a repercussion of being an Amazon prime member/2 day shipping. This is just a warning to others that may make a similar error, be forewarned.  I accept that I made a mistake. I have had mostly positive with Amazon, but this does disappoint me.  I guess I can still return, but will cost me shipping.</li>
    <li> The high praise from other reviewers about this shaver was if anything, understated. The shaver gave me a close, smooth shave with no irritation. And the trimmer which wasn&#x27;t mentioned by others, is also a nice addition to keep my sideburns even. The ergonomic friendly handle makes this a really good buy. It is easy to maneuver, especially for those hard to shave hairs under the nose and between the chin and the neck. I used to use a Braun 5500. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to change over. I have had to clean it once so far; and it was relatively easy if you use some sink water. I suggest that you dry it with a hair dryer, rather than a dry cloth suggested by the handbook, because moisture remained for one day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three Panasonics, a Braun, a Norelco, and an Eltron (loved the Eltron, the original, not the Braun knock-off).  This is, however, the best I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s (almost) a pleasure to shave with it.  And it has such a nice timer/battery power indicator/time to clean it display to boot.  Just a wonderful shaver.</li>
    <li> It is one of best shaver I have used.   Very close shaving. Better than braun series.  Good to use in shower.  I give it four stars because its battery life is too short and only last less than 1 hour.  Overall it is good one.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver gives me the best shave that I have ever had in over 45 years of shaving. I have used various electric shavers over the years including several generations of Norelco and Remington. I have used various safety razors over the years all the way to Trac 4 style razors. None compare to this Panasonic. After shaving, my face is smoother than it has ever been. At 5 o&#x27;clock, my face is smoother than after just finishing shaving using the other electric shavers or regular razors. I would not have believed it possible if I didn&#x27;t try it. I have been using it for a month now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is shaver is great.  My sensitive skin didn&#x27;t take long to adjust to it while it never got adjusted to my older shaver (Norelco).  I don&#x27;t recall having my face this smooth.  As the last poster stated, it has a tough time under the chin but looking at the mirror you do not see any hair there.  I find that odd.  Must be my double chin causing the problem.    This shaver has rpm motor and gets loud, but it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Works great dry.  The lady loves it so far.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have owned since the 70&#x27;s.  This is great for a quick shave in the morning.  Glad I purchased it.  I still use a razor one a week and the Panasonic shaves just as close.</li>
    <li> This have been my shaver for over 2 years. I shave in the shower once every 2 days and this shaver has lasted over 2 years and has yet to fail me. I have replaced the blades once already and it&#x27;s like a brand new shaving experience once you do that. I recommend replacing the blade every 6 months if you shave daily and every 8 to 12 months if you shave every other day like I do. The battery lasts 2 to 3 weeks or so of shaving every other day. The battery is still strong even after 2 years of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dropped this thing on a concrete floor several times and this thing is STILL a juggernaut even after 2 years of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows in every direction, so this shaver tends to miss a few spots. Other than that, it&#x27;s an awesome shaver! I cannot recommend this product enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/12/14 update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 years!!!!! Still works! I started using this shaver again every other day and the battery still holds a good charge. This is indeed a high-quality item. Buy this.</li>
    <li> I usually refuse to write reviews of products becuase it takes away from valuable time- however this is a different story...&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to replace my Norelco Speed XL razer, which has served me well.  A few years ago I tried a Remington foil type razer and returned it becuase it was terrible.  I read some reviews on this Panasonic razer and thought, what the heck- I&#x27;d give it a try.  It is by far the BEST razer I have every owned.  I shave in my car on the way to work every morning- this thing does the trick in less time than that rotary blades of Norelco.  I am so glad I bought the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> shaves okay, but the pop up trimmer became dull in about a months use... i wouldnt buy this again at this price, but it does give a decent shave</li>
    <li> Nice shave, close shave after multiple passes! Next to impossible to find replacement blades! And you WILL need replacement blades after about 4 months!</li>
    <li> Got this Panasonic ES8243A razor in the mail today and just gave myself the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor.  I have sensitive skin, but had no reddening of the skin on my neck as usually happened with past electric razors.  I have to say I got just as close a shave as with my Gilette Proglide, and I don&#x27;t have to buy the expensive blades anymore! When I charged the razor, it went from 10% to 100% in less than a half hour.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I had two  Braun 7600 series and was satisfied with them until the latter stop working.  The reviews of Braun replacement were not promissory.  I got the Panasonic and am happy with it. It is smooth, quiet and easy to clean and maintain. My beard is dense and somewhat hard. In the beginning i had to finish my shave with a manual razor, but not any longer.  Good product for its price.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. It is my second one. Just wish the battery was longer. Gets me through a full 7 day week of shaving though. Wish it could shave while plugged in but it only takes about 60 min to recharge.</li>
    <li> excellent closeness,comfort and easy to get to hard places on face.Easy to clean and like wet or dry face.EASY TO CLEAN BUT WOULD LIKE A STAND TO HOLD RAZOR</li>
    <li> Replaced an old remmington triple foil that I loved that finally broke (think it was the MS3000).  This doesnt shave as close and takes some work with a razor to clean up.  It does do a better vs vs the remmington when I havent shaved for a few days - no pulling or ripping.  However, the final outcome is not as close.  Too bad they don&#x27;t make the MS3000, or whatever it was anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like over the remington is that it is much better constructed and very easy to clean (dont buy the cleaning dock).  Just put liquid soap and a little water on the blades, turn it on and run it under water.  This is the method described in the instructions, but they do not state that online, presumably to try to upsell the cleaning kit.</li>
    <li> After struggling for years to get a nice close, clean shave with an inexpensive electric shaver I finally broke down and spent a few extra dollars to get a better razor.  Man, am I glad I did!  For the past 2 years or so I have been using an inexpensive Braun shaver,  and besides being rough on my face I had a hard time cutting the hairs on my neck. I would constantly have to go over and over the same spot to try and get all the neck hairs cut close, finally I would pop open the trimmer, cut the long hairs, then go over the spot with the razor...a complete waste of time!  This new Panasonic is light years ahead of what i was using.  Absolutely no struggle to get neck hairs or hairs anywhere.  In about 180 seconds I had my whole face and neck shaved without irritation or struggle!  It took me about 5 minutes daily to get a \\&quot;decent\\&quot; shave with my Braun.  I use the razor dry, I figure if I want to use shaving cream I can use it with a blade.  I might actually try shaving cream with this razor someday to see if I can get an even closer shave than I am presently getting. I highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a convenient way to get a close, almost blade-like shave!! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I am proudly holding a soft baby&#x27;s *ss for a face at almost 40 years old.      I am not kidding..... I started my electric shaving journey in my teens with a mid-model Norelco, graduated on to my first Braun before upgrading four more times with various Braun models.      My last shaver was the 9595 Pulsonic model and it was an absolute joke compared to this Panasonic Nano.  I stood at my pedestal sink in awe this evening just staring at the little baby&#x27;s *ss in the mirror.      The Braun never gave me a close shave and within a year, it started pulling (not cutting) the longer whiskers like a modern day torture device.  And even worse?  I paid over $220 for the experience.    This one?  As if I took out the lathering cream and slid a razor over my face for over 25 minutes.    Having gone through Norelco models and several top-of-the-line Braun models, this Panasonic is THE BEST SHAVER ON THE MARKET.  PERIOD.      FYI... Don&#x27;t waste money buying a higher end model. For cleaning, simply rinse the head under warm water.  After it dries, just spray with lubricant/cleaner.  And whalla.... you just saved yourself some $$    A company has mastered the Art of Shaving once and for all in the form of an electric razor.  That company, folks, is called Panasonic.    Thank you for ending my painful experience with the Braun Series.</li>
    <li> This razor was ordered to replace an almost new brand that I hated, one rated first in almost all reviews. This one, made by Panasonic, is fast and quiet and works well.</li>
    <li> Without  a doubt the best electric shaver I have used.  The shave is fast and close without being irritative.  The design is comfortable in the hand and the razor holds a charge for 12+ shaves making it travel friendly.  Cleaning is easy as well. I recommended the shaver to a friend who has now sworn off the triple blade disposables.  An excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric for over 25 years. I purchased this Panasonic cause I was tired of lathering ritual before using my Bic throw aways. The Panasonic is doing an acceptable job (though not as close as a blade). It does take longer to shave but is no big deal since I can walk around the house doing other things while I shave. The battery life is good and I have had no problems. I did buy some Gillette pre-shave stuff that is supposed to help get a closer cut. I don&#x27;t know if the shave is closer but it smells nice and the shaver seems to glide over the face nicer. I hope this shaver does hold up over the long run cause I like it.</li>
    <li> My father in law purchased one for himself and one for me as a gift. For the past several years I&#x27;ve used shaving cream and a regular razor, electric ones just couldn&#x27;t give me a close enough shave. I tried this Panasonic and could not believe the shave I get with this product. I have a very rough \\&quot;Fred Flintstone\\&quot; type of face that looks rough even after I shave. But with this razor my skin gets as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. I travel a lot for work and not having to lug a can of shaving cream around is a pleasure plus the charge is quick (1 hour or less) and it lasts a long time. I bought one for my son he and loves it, and a co-worker also purchased one on my recommendation and he is very satisfied.    The only thing remotely negative about this shaver is the fact that the case it comes with does not hold both the shaver and the charging cord.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by saving that this shaver gives one of the better electric shaves you will find.  Unfortunately, it is flawed.  Maybe its just my unit, but when i shave, the thing leaks hair clippings everywhere.  My cover is on properly and I regularly empty and clean it so I know those aren&#x27;t the problem.  It fairly annoying to have my chest/shirt covered in hair after using this.  Hopefully this is just a defective unit I got and not a widespread problem.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an electric shaver and came across this one, the shaver is very comfortable and it shaves excellent. The arc holds a battery charge of about 2 weeks and this is very nice. the feature that i like most about this shaver is the fact that when your done it&#x27;s incredibly easy to clean. It comes in a nice traveling case also. I would recommend this shaver to anyone</li>
    <li> Shaving is a highly subjective experience, and hair and skin texture varies widely, but this shaver is perfect for me. I&#x27;ve tried several electric shavers in the past (Norelco) but my sensitive skin simply couldn&#x27;t tolerate them for more than a week or two. I had been using a Gillette Fusion, and didn&#x27;t think any electric shaver could get close to the smoothness that it produced. Well, this Panasonic accomplishes that for me. The dry shave is quite good and works well when I&#x27;m in a hurry, but a wet shave in the shower with shaving gel is every bit as good as my Gillette Fusion Power. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it was possible, and I do realize that your skin or beard may respond differently, so don&#x27;t flame me if you try it and don&#x27;t like it. For myself, the search is over. I&#x27;ll never go back to using a razor as long as a Panasonic wet/dry shaver is available. It rinses clean in seconds, so I agree with other reviewers that paying extra for a cleaning system is unnecessary. For a quick, easy, clean shave, I&#x27;ve never found anything I liked even half as well.</li>
    <li> Having a Wahl for 14 years, I was reluctant to change but glad I did.  This razor has been excellent in my first 2 weeks of use, almost fun to shave with, very quite and shaves very close.  For this razor to be this good, makes me wonder how the more expensive Panasonic razor could top it.  Almost now wish I would have gone a step further and bought it.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades for this item cost around $25 dollars... not bad.... BUT... they do not come with the foil... the foil cost $45... and you will HAVE to replace it at least twice a year if you use the shaver every day... that is RIDICULOUS!</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic wet-dry electric shavers ever since they first came out in the 1970&#x27;s.  They have steadily improved through the years, both in battery strength and shaving performance.  I have always used shaving cream as it gives the smoothest and most comfortable shave.  This shaver replaces a previous nano, 3-blade model that I used for 2 years.  This 4-blade shaver is by far the best Panasonic model that I have used.  It gives me a very smooth, comfortable shave and I get about 14 shaves on a full charge.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems of one sort or another with electric shavers.  They never came close to a razer shave for me, and on top of that, really irritated my skin.  I use this fabulous shaver wet with the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shave cream, and the Billy Jealousy Shaved Ice aftershave balm, and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. Finally, an electric shaver that works great, and is really well made.  Would very highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving, and I bought the Panasonic ES8243A a few months ago to make the process more convenient.  I have never previously owned an electric shaver because I had always heard the standard refrain that you can&#x27;t get a good, close shave with them.  After some extensive use now, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  I think this shaver debunks that common argument: I have gotten shaves with the ES8243A that are just as close as I ever got with blade shavers.  It takes some getting used to, but after you are conditioned to it, the results are great.  To get the closest shaves, it&#x27;s necessary to use a pre-shave treatment (I use Lectric Shave), but I definitely prefer this over using shaving cream with a blade razer.      Aside from fantastic results, the shaver is pretty convenient and requires minimal maintenance.  The wet/dry option allows great versatility for use in the shower or on the run; the battery life is fantastic (I probably get about 15-20 uses between each charge); and cleanup is simple (a few seconds of washing with cold water and soap).      If you&#x27;re on the fence, take the leap.  This is a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> This is just so amazingly fast and works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it to replace the Panasonic electric shaver I have had for over fifteen years.  It was one of the first shavers with a linear motor and still works, but I&#x27;ve dropped it so many times it finally needed to be retired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  Handles well, comfortable to hold, pop-up trimmer works just great and there is a timer and a battery indicator so you don&#x27;t get stuck with half a shaved face.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) is an excellent electric shaver. I am 50 y/o and have used my share of electric razors and this is by far the finest one yet I have ever seen and i have used many by most all makers.  Does it shave as close as a hand held bladed razor like a Mach 3, dont be silly, of course it doesnt. No electric shaver will ever compare to a blade..period! Does it get very close, indeed it does this coming from a man who is bald by choice. I shave my head and most of my face everyday and this shaver does a great job.  With an average 7 minute shave time (To do my entire head and face) I get 6 to 7 days out of a charge. It is very easy to clean and charges in an hour. I found it on Amazon for well and I mean well under $100 on sale. For the money and the shave nothing compares to the Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) at twice the money. There is nothing here you dont need, a charger and carrying case and the shaver, no bulky unneeded elaborate cleaning system to clutter up your bathroom. I find it to shave equally well both dry and in the shower but I am use to an electric shaver. If I want and extra close shave for that super shiny look afterwards I will quickly go over my head with a Mach 3 but that is in no way an everyday or necassary thing. If I never picked up another blade the ARC 4 ES 8243A does a great job!</li>
    <li> Love it. I could not ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;At first, it did not worked very well. But the key to shaving with this kind of shavers is to make sure your hair is short, you will get best results that way. Because, the hair has to get inside the holes in order for the shaver to cut it, and the best way to get it there is when it is short.&lt;br /&gt;I always cut my hair short with the shaver first, then use this panasonic shaver to finish off, I use it dry, I get the best results that way. The attached trimmer is a joke, wonder who uses that.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor along with the recommended accessories it listed, the replacement blades, and the vortex cleaning system refill cartridges. Well, it doesn&#x27;t even have a vortex cleaning system! So i&#x27;m stuck with these useless cartridges now since its not worth the cost to return them..</li>
    <li> I used Braun shavers for 15 years before getting this Panasonic wet/dry shaver as a Christmas gift this year. It does shave much closer and cleans up easier than any Braun I&#x27;ve owned. The noise is higher pitched, but managable, especially since it shaves faster. To clean, all you do is squirt a tiny drop of dish soap on the foil, turn it on for a few seconds and rinse. I&#x27;m a convert now. Doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy a Braun again. I also love the digital power meter. The only time I could tell when my Braun got low is when the motor started operating slower. This tells you exactly how much shaving power has been used and is available. Only drawback with the Panasonic is it didn&#x27;t come with a travel case like my Brauns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big believer in \\&quot;crowd-think\\&quot; when it comes to purchasing commodity items like this.  So after reviewing Consumer Reports and all the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to go with this one.  The first thing I noticed upon opening the box was a piece of paper that said, \\&quot;Please!  Give it a chance!  Use this razor for 30 days before giving up on it, as it takes your face that long to get accustomed to a new shaving method.\\&quot;  Wow.  I have been a rotary shaver user for about 15 years, but decided to try foil this time around.  So I started using it and was immediately not impressed.  Seemed like I had to go over the same areas over and over.  And then my wife would notice areas that were still stubbly.  But I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to the 30-day trial, so I waited.  Even after the 30 day period (shaving almost daily and exclusively with this), I still don&#x27;t feel like I got a good shave.  So I have returned it and will be ordering a new rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, many people seem happy with this, so your mileage will vary.  It felt great in the hand, the LED information about charging was terrific, and it cleans super easy.  But at the end of the day, it&#x27;s all about how smooth your face feels, and that&#x27;s where it let me down.  I could eventually get a smooth face, but it seemed to take a lot longer and a lot more work.</li>
    <li> this razor works really well. close shave. simple to operate and clean. And it doesn&#x27;t need eight more words either.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son who is 21 and has a disability.  He has a very quick-growing heavy beard and would complain that his previous electric shaver would pinch and pull, making it very uncomfortable to use.  He seems to be satisfied with this product and finds it easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor that I have shaved with.  I have used Norelco since I was 15, but this razor is closer than the Norelco.</li>
    <li> Good product. Using it.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  I shave my face, neck and head with it.  I let the hair on my head grow out a couple days to see how the razor performs on hair longer than whisker length.  It really wouldn&#x27;t get the job done.  However, if you use it every day or every other day it is very impressive</li>
    <li> My father loves this razor. It takes him only 2-3 minutes to shave all the broad planes of his face and neck, plus a minute or two more to take care of the details like the nostril creases and close under the lower lip. He loves the simplicity of its function and appreciates the fact that he only needs to pop the foil off and run the blades under the tap to clear them.  I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity yet, seeing as he&#x27;s only had it three weeks, but once it&#x27;s proved itself in that area as well I will be happy to recommend it to any man who uses an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews on men&#x27;s shavers, I purchased this Panasonic Rechargeable Shaver ES8243A  4-blade system for my husband as a gift through Amazon.com and he has used this for about a month now.  He absolutely loves it!  This cuts very close and he has no problems at all getting all areas including neck and is comfortable in his hand.  Say goodbye to the disposable blades and cuts.  As his wife, I will and he will too...highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Husband uses daily &amp; loves it.</li>
    <li> Highly suggested, many great features( wet/dry, quick charge, clean under faucet). I have had 2 Braun shavers in the last 10 years. My most recent being an 8500 series about 5 yrs ago. Just felt like it was tugging hairs more often, so I started researching. Finally, deciding on this shaver its great. Its, definitely a faster motor, never any tugging, as the Braun did a little since day one. This also is cake to clean with a squirt of antibacterial soap and a rinse under the faucet. No more buying those expensive solution cartridges with the Braun. Also, it can be used wet/dry. Once in a while I&#x27;ll treat my self to a wet shave....extra close and smooth results. Even used primarily dry I get very nice results and much better under chin than the Braun. I have a medium grade stubble.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these, one for me and the other for my father as a present. Panasonic wet &amp; dry shavers are the best and will never switch to another brand.  This shaver is best used after taking a warm shower. Wet face with warm water, apply shaving cream then shave away. The outcome is a close clean shave!</li>
    <li> I have always use panasonic shaver because they deliver the best shave. The Panasonic ES824A has come through for me again, it&#x27;s comfortable in my hands,&lt;br /&gt; it shaves very close without irritating my face and last but not least the battery life is really good, i can get about 5 complete shave out of one full charge.&lt;br /&gt; I would definately recommend this shaver to anyone, i&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I ever wanted for the first three weeks. But then it turned the corner, becoming very dull. I do not recommend it to anyone. I had a Phillips before this one. After 10 years, that shaver is now just as good as this Panasonic is after ten weeks.</li>
    <li> Never gets the hairs on my neck under my chin, especially if they&#x27;re a little long. I try to use the flip-out trimmer, but it&#x27;s very sensitive, and will grind if the pressure is too much. This means I need a separate razor to do a complete shave. The rest of my face is cut just fine with this razor, but that&#x27;s too much money to pay for a razor that can&#x27;t handle everything.</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used.  This is my second one because after many years the older models battery would not hold a charge.  But, like the previous model this one provides a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Still trying to get used to Electric shaving.First one in 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin this is the one to order.</li>
    <li> After 1 year every day usining stll going very goodddd...i will buy one moree for sure diferent model same brand</li>
    <li> WOW.  Puts any other razor I&#x27;ve used to shame.  This is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve even gotten from an electric.  Why did I wait so long!</li>
    <li> 100% great product. Shaves clean, fast, no burns and easy to wash. Perfect for those, who doesn&#x27;t like wet shaving and on the go.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband as a surprise. It arrived in time and he loved it. Its color is so beautiful and it works amazing.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to review this, it has turned out to be one of the best shavers I have ever owned. It has a much higher cutting speed than anything I have had before, it cuts well and close and is so easy to clean, being wet or dry you just cant beat it in my opinion. Function form and price make this a solid winner, giving it five stars.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked for about a year and then totally broke on me.  Now it spontaneously goes on all the time until the battery dies.</li>
    <li> I loved this shaver &amp; used it for about one year before it went crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave causes the internal circuits to short out eventually.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that ALL of the front liquid crystal display icons were illuminated.  Soon thereafter, the shaver would randomly start in the middle of the night (scary).  Eventually it stopped working all together.  I paid top dollar for this &amp; feel that it wasn&#x27;t worth the excellent shave it gave for only 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;It also lacks a travel lock on the switch, so if it gets bumped in your suitcase it will turn on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying the less expensive Panasonic 8103 to replace it that has just as good reviews.  We&#x27;ll see.  I AM sold on the closeness of the wet shave.</li>
    <li> Are you Asian? then this is the crappy shaver for you. (my wife and son are Chinese so don&#x27;t give me bull on racism. Asians do not have facial hair and that is a FACT). Unless you are Asian, this shaver is a total waste of over $100, go donate it to a charity and shave with a six month old razor. you will have the same experience you would have had had you purchased this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I TRIED EVERYTHING !!! dry, wet, with soap, cleaned it every time. charged it, USED LECTRIC SHAVE (helped a  little). to sum it up, it will work for about two months. then it will go dull and basically make you finish spots with a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This expensive \\&quot;high end\\&quot; crap does not even wok plugged in. like a $20 Remington crap you have to charge it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- And then the fun part: the defective garbage of a machine is designed in such an inefficient way that it shaves, then pushes the hair back out (onto your face, through the net !!!) and then back in (shred). what you get is an extremely inefficient machine which half of the time is not shaving, but blending your facial hair back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;this is extremely entertaining when shaving wet as you will have a hair puree on you face as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************  DO NOT BUY THIS !!!!!  **********************</li>
    <li> Bought this razor after doing online research...it&#x27;s a replacement for a 13 year old Braun razor I dropped 8 weeks ago!  So far it gives me a very similar shave and waiting to test out the wet part of the wet/dry shave capabilities until I redeploy back to the states in July!</li>
    <li> Love this Panasonic ES8243A Razor. Used a Norelco razor for years, didn&#x27;t do that great a job, especially on my neck. The Panasonic cuts my beard as close as a safety razor and very quickly, am extremely satisfied. I recommend this razor for the cut and ease of cleaning.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a quick and smooth shave. However, the shave is not long-lasting. After about 6 to 8 hours, I need another shave. This time interval is much shorter than with previous electric shavers I have owned. Shaving longer helps a bit with this problem but does not solve it. Apparently, the shaver does not cut very far blow the surface.</li>
    <li> During the years, I have been using any kind of razor available on the market. Starting from BIC&#x27;s , shick&#x27;s  to mach&#x27;3, no one can get me the closest shave I desire, especially on the neck. Then I decided to go to the classics: double edge razors. I bought  a DOVO - Solingen (open comb) - the closest you can get on double edge razor, a pure badger brush and some natural glycerin soap.  This was a step up, but still not satisfied. Then I went to the next level: Straight Razor !!!  Takes time to learn, but this is the closest you can get!!!  Perfect shaving, but is time consuming, you need to warm-up  your face with a hot towel, make some good lather from the glycerin soap and start shaving. The all procedure takes about 30-40 minutes.      But if you don&#x27;t have 40 minutes to shave, just buy the Panasonic ES8243A - it will get you the same close shave as a straight razor, but in 5-10 minutes. This electric razor shaves wet or dry, the wet can get you closer shave, just buy a good shaving gel like: Cremo Cream or King of Shaves Alphagel Shave Gel. And is very easy to clean.     I am still shaving with the straight razor, but only on the weekends, when I have more free time. Straight razor shaving involve buying many additional thinks like 3\\&quot; Black Latigo Razor Strop  for  sharpening your razor daily and some sharpening stones for deep sharpening - every year.     This is my second electric shaver, the first was Norelco Philips Architect  - wasn&#x27;t shaving close enough - so I returned.     I need it to buy a electric razor for times that I need a fast shavings. Originally I headed for the Braun - but when checked all the razors at department store (Fry&#x27;s) - it turns out that all Braun&#x27;s are made in China (No offence here)  and  Hi end Panasonics were made in Japan.......</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous shave!! Nothing else that I have ever used is anywhere near as comfortable! Use it with a Gel Lather and you will never ever again feel the discomfort of \\&quot;Razor Burn\\&quot; no matter how hard you work, or workout, and prespire...EveR!!!</li>
    <li> I received this product about a month ago and i have to say it is a great electric razor.  It takes me about 3 minutes to finish up my shave.  You may want to take this with a grain of salt because i really only have to shave every other day.</li>
    <li> I had many electric shaver in the past 15 years, and this one is at bottom of that list.  VERY DISAPPOINTED! It cuts pretty good around cheek, and not at all for the chin and neck</li>
    <li> It makes more noise and vibration than Norelco. I guess may be this one has more horse power but I see both Norelco and Panasonic does the job.  However, I prefer Norelco because it&#x27;s quiet. Quality buid and design is exellent for this Panasonic. May be the next one, I may consider to buy Panasonic if they can bring down the noise and less vibration.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if my skin/beard are completely different from the other reviewers here, or if the product I received was defective. But this shaver does not work for me at all. It does a pathetic job at shaving my beard. I have a feeling that even if I run it five times on my beard, it will still not give me a shave with which I could go out. For more than 3 weeks, I patiently tried using it. I used this shaver for couple of passes on my beard and then I had to use my razor to do the shaving. The shave from this shaver was so bad that I could not go out without completing the shave with my razor. I used shaving foam as other people suggested in their reviews. This was the first time I was using an electric shaver. I am back to my razor now.</li>
    <li> Shavers really are a very personal item, but for me this relatively inexpensive Panasonic has been astonishing.    I have that worst of combinations: a heavy black beard with sensitive skin.  Plus, the hairs around my mouth and chin seem to grow at every possible angle.  Add to that the fact that I insist on a perfectly smooth shave.    Result: for years I have used a Mach 3 blade for most of my face, generally with one pass with the grain, followed by a pass against the grain.  Then a Track 2 blade to trim my sideburns.  But I needed a Norelco to shave around my mouth and chin, which took many passes and, worst of all, ultimately irritated the sides of my mouth down to my jawline.    I had stuck with Norelcos for years, after beginning shaving with Remington and Braun foil shavers and finding Norelco to be a great improvement.  So I was reluctant to switch, but Norelco quality seems to be going downhill fast.  My last few sets of replacement heads felt like cheese graters.    So after reading many, many reviews I decided on this Panasonic, which I bought at a reduced price, less than half of a top of the line Norelco.    I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months now, and can reliably report on its performance, though not on its longterm durability.  I haven&#x27;t needed to use its wet shave option, though being waterproof does make cleaning extremely simple, quick and effective: a little liquid soap, some running water, shift it into Turbo Mode (which it shifts out of automatically; Turbo Mode is for cleaning, not shaving), and without even taking the cover off, it&#x27;s squeaky clean and shiny again inside.    The shave is as close as the best blade--totally smooth--yet with no cutting or irritation--even shaving dry, and even on the crazy quilt of hairs that surround my mouth.  It&#x27;s just a delight to get a smooth face after only one or at most 2 passes against the grain.  And I now have 15 extra minutes every morning: priceless.    Plus, the trimmer is excellent, so I no longer need anything extra to use on my sideburns.    The LED display is also quite good, especially for the price, though it is not quite as good as the LCD on my old top of the line Norelco, which showed \\&quot;minutes remaining\\&quot; before recharge.  This display gives you a percentage of battery charge remaining, and a prompt when it&#x27;s time to clean, plus a rather useless bar that is supposed to graph remaining charge but is not helpful whatsoever.    One other minor complaint, that applies to ALL new shavers, even the most expensive: they all seem to only pack 60 minutes worth of battery charge.  The last few Norelcos, going back a decade, gave me 99 solid minutes, which usually meant 105 minutes because they ran for 5-6 minutes after reaching 0 percent.  What&#x27;s going on here?  I thought battery technology was making leaps lately!    Still, this shaver has literally changed my life.  No cuts, no irritation, no need to bring along the Mach 3, the Track 2 and shaving cream when I travel, great, virtually self-cleaning blades, a great trimmer, and best of all, 15 extra minutes every morning when I need them the most.  At around $100, any man who shaves and has periodic access to electricity should try it.  Do NOT mess around with the models that have the cleaning unit.    That is a totally unnecessary waste of money, time, counter space and plastic, especially with a shaver that cleans so well in Turbo Mode with just a little soap and water.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve had that allows me actually to go into a business day with only an electric shave.  Historically, with a series of Braun shavers over 25+ years (up to and including the latest Series 7), I&#x27;ve always had to electric first, then blade-shave to get an acceptable result.  While I still do that occasionally, this Panasonic (my first) gives a satisfactory shave by itself.  I use it dry for now (have not yet experimented with wet-shaving with it).    Only 1 criticism:  it&#x27;s loud.  When it&#x27;s near an ear, it&#x27;s really piercing!  On balance, however, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife said \\&quot;here you go again wasting money on an electric shaver\\&quot; I am glad to say we are proving her wrong.....  I dont write reviews either but I thought I would help my fellow man in making a decision as I spent many hours reviewing reviews trying to decide what I should spend my money on. I decided on this after reading the Amazon reviews.  Had my first wet shave today and its fantastic. Just as good as blade shave except I dont have a sore tender neck &amp; no need to clean up my towels and sink from my bleeding neck after as I did with wet shave...  I have sensetive skin and thick stubble and this worked great just a close as wet shave and charging took only about 1 hr.  My best buy on Amazon...</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a shavor to replace my old Norelco shaver (which I was not happy with since day one).  After reading the positive reviews in the Amazon reviews section I selected the Panasonic ES8242A shavor.      I have to say that after using the Panasonic razor I am completely satisified with the results.  It gave me closer shave with no irritation. To date no other razor has worked as well for me as the Panasonic.  The battery life between charging is only about 5 days but it is certainly worth plugging it in a little more often.      If you are looking for a close shave with no irritation I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Panasonic shavers. One, my old ES 882, is still on the job in my travel bag. There have been several different variations on the linear drive motor, some better than others but all decent. The 8243 is about as sharp as it can be with out being abrasive. Shaving times are fast and thorough. The pivoting head along with the curved shape makes it very easy to shave the hard to get to places. It can be locked in place but I find it works much better if left unlocked. I&#x27;d like to see a little less plastic and the vinyl case is a bit cheap but adequate. The clear plastic head cover is a good feature.  My only complaint, a minor one, is how often you have to charge the battery. It lasts for about 4-5 10 minute shaves before requiring recharging. The battery is a 3 volt single cell Li-on. I&#x27;ve had better results with the old ni cad batteries. There is a replacement but very hard to find. I&#x27;d look for a 3 volt ni cad if I could find one. Meantime, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this shaver. Head replacement is easy, clean up after each shave is simple and quick. I also keep a can of Remington Shaver Saver handy to keep the heads sharp and lubed. The other item is noise. The motor is fairly loud.    Pros: Close shave, easy to clean.  Cons: Loud motor, battery drains quickly.    Bottom line: Good shaver overall. One of Panasonic&#x27;s best efforts.</li>
    <li> I am not one to take up writing reviews. However, I make the exception because I feel compelled to write to thank both Amazon, and Panasonic for making this item available to us users. I have used an electric shaver before, but it occasionally resulted in razor burns and in-grown hairs on my face. I stopped using it. I switched to something that I have been using up until now. I normally used Costly, \\&quot;Disposal Razors.\\&quot;  These razors usually cost me $15.98 for a package of 8 razors. I try to squeeze approximately 3 shaves out of them, Shaving my head and face Everyday. I found them to be the best, leaving me with no razor burns, bumps, or in-grown hair. Now I ask you to do the math. I have been using these for about 8 years now. Your conclusion, like mine this is quite Costly.     I can safely say that my newly found Close Friend, \\&quot;Panasonic ES8243 Arc IV Nana Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver\\&quot; will save me lots of Money, it is Superior to any Shaves I have ever had up to my current age of 60. I cannot say enough about this unit. It feels Solid when you handle it, Easy to hold, Great texture in your hand, Very quiet, Very easy to clean and also Easy on the eyes. The most important thing is that it glides on my face, Even during Dry Shaves. I have not tried it wet yet. I simply found no need to go wet yet.    Most important Question to ask is: Would I do it again. My answer is Absolutely, Without Hesitation. Best feeling I have had in months when parted with my money. Well Worth every penny.

    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Faster than my previous Rotary-head&lt;br /&gt;* Handles older growth without pre-trimming&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;* Joy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Not quite as close as a lift-and-cut rotary, rough stubble may reappear mid-day for me. Evenings out may require a second touch-up shave.&lt;br /&gt;* Under the nose and the neck-line seem to require adjusting technique to ensure you don&#x27;t \\&quot;miss\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;* Not so much a con, just an adjustment in behavior - the shaver won&#x27;t operate if plugged in. Must be operated cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extended Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d take a chance at a different style razor when this device showed up in a Gold Box deal for a steal of a price. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider me a bit lazy, but I don&#x27;t enjoy shaving daily. That said, I could with this razor because it&#x27;s fast and easy to use. On those occasions when I feel like skipping a day or three, this razor handles my thick, semi-coarse, quickly-growing beard with ease. On days that I don&#x27;t skip, the shave is quick and reasonably thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous rotary bladed Norelco would skip most of the hairs after an extended \\&quot;razor vacation\\&quot;, requiring me to pre-shave with the trimmer before shaving with the rotary head, taking 10-15 minutes. This Panasonic doesn&#x27;t require a pre-shave in most cases and rather attacks longer hairs with ease. I may still find the occasional stray missed hair, but those could be counted on one hand. Shaving longer hairs doesn&#x27;t come with any pulling, though occasionally if I move too quickly, the head may briefly \\&quot;stall\\&quot; (changes tone). At this point, that is never associated with any pulling though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is simple - when the indicator lights up, simply apply liquid soap and activate the 20 seconds of turbo-cleaning speed. Rinse under water, remove the blade cover, and repeat the soap and turbo-mode treatment, followed by another rinse. Blot dry with a towel and reassemble. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some other reviewers remarked, because this isn&#x27;t lift-and-cut, the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close or as long-lasting as that which I used to get with the Norelco. Because I can achieve a clean shave after a few days in ~5 minutes vs. 10+ w/ the previous device, I&#x27;ll take the trade-off any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another point that required me to re-adjust my behavior - the placement of the foils makes getting the spot under my nose just a bit harder. I find I miss some of those spots and have to revisit them 10-15 min later (say, after my shower). The neck area continues to be a challenge with this razor as with any other electric because of the parallel-to-the-skin angle the hairs tend to grow toward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very happy with the purchase.e or as long-lasting as that which I used to get with the Norelco.

    <li> Great razor. Worth every penny. I hadn&#x27;t used an electric in 15 years and it has been easy to use and clean. Shaves close and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the way the old rotary blade razors did and also the way standard manual razors do.</li>
    <li> The razor works great.  I&#x27;ve got particularly thick facial hair and it has not trouble with it.  I have to clean it our regularly, but that&#x27;s easy to do.  After using a straight razor for the last 10 years, I think I&#x27;ve finally found an electric razor that can handle my coarse facial hair.</li>
    <li> I have owned many electric razors over the years with constant disappointment.  With the constant improvement of razor shavers,  I never expected to go back to an electric razor.  This razor had received so many great recommendations, and Amazon had it at the lowest price, so I figured I would give it a try.  It was a great decision.  I can&#x27;t believe the closeness of the shave.  I love how easy it is to clean and maintain.  I get about 10 shaves before I have to recharge.  It is a fantastic razor and well worth the money.  I would occasionally get an ingrown hair with shaving with a regular razor, and have never had that issue with electric.  So glad I mad the switch back to electric.</li>
    <li> My husband has used a hand razor his entire life because electric razors could never get close enough in some areas. After researching electic razors this one seemed like the best bet and the price was reasonable. He LOVES it!! He hated shaving so much that he would only shave every 3-4 days, now it is so easy that he shaves everyday. So nice to have a clean shaven man.</li>
    <li> Update: It doesn&#x27;t run anymore and I have to send it in for repair. About a year after purchase it would not hold a charge for more than half a day. I&#x27;d have to remember to charge it before using it. Last week after it displayed 100% charge it would not run and the charge indication switched back to 0% instantly. Now it&#x27;s dead. It&#x27;s never been dropped or submerged, only used at my sink. I would have expected no problems with charging for at least a few years but I guess nothing is built to last anymore. I&#x27;m lowering my rating from 5 to 3 stars; 3 only because it was great when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this shaver as a replacement for a low end Panasonic ES3041K that was cheaply constructed and hurt me when I shaved. The ES8243A is light years better and well worth the price I paid for it. The construction looks and feels high quality. It cuts through my tough beard effortlessly and leaves smooth skin. It charges quickly and I really like the digital display that shows how much battery is left. I clean it by running a little soft soap for about 5 seconds then rinsing and that works great. The only negative I found is that I tried to use it when it showed only 10% power, my mistake because as it ran down the battery it felt like it jammed on my chin, ripping off a piece of skin leaving me bleeding so I just won&#x27;t run it at that low a charge anymore. Overall its a Superbly designed piece of gear and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> For the last 6 years I&#x27;ve been using a Philips (Norleco) rotary head and changing the blades each time the display advised. It was fine for a few months after but didn&#x27;t really feel like a close shave after that. I thought I&#x27;d try the foil type and I&#x27;m glad I did - this is a really good product. I previously shaved dry and tried dry shave with the Panansonic but it did feel a bit &#x27;scratchy&#x27; however wet with shaving foam I really like it. I&#x27;d read it took a month before you feel at home with a change like this but after a couple of weeks it felt normal. Takes a few minutes extra in the morning but the results are worth it for me.     Had it over 6 weeks now and glad I purchased it, the only downside is the battery charge is good for 5-6 days whereas my last one was 30 days. Just need to get in the habit of charging more frequently (and remembering the charger when I&#x27;m travelling)</li>
    <li> Been shaving over 50 years, have thick stubby beard.  Wore out my last shaver and wanted to try a wet dry shaver.  Looked at many reviews and decided that this looked most promising and Amazon had the best deal.      I think the only way to get a better shave is to use a razor, but this is faster and more convenient.  Panasonic did a great job on this one, and I saved some money on this model since I like to clean my razor after each use manually.  The following routine works for me.  BTW, My beard didn&#x27;t need any adjustment period - hope you find the following helpful.    Fully charge the shaver before first using it - a full charge lasts for several shaves.  Spread a little shaving lather on the shaver head and shave about 1/3 of your face before the lather dries - then repeat two more times over the rest of your face.  The lather lets the shaver glide smoothly over the face without excess effort and you&#x27;re done in less two minutes.      To extend life of shaver, after shaving, let COLD water run over shaver head while it is on for about 5 seconds then turn it off and take the cover off.  Turn shaver back on and rince cover and shaver head then turn it off.  Blow water out of the blade area and let the shaver &amp; cover lay on a papertowel for a few minutes, then put the cover back on and put the shaver away.      Unfortunately Panasonic doesn&#x27;t include a stand for vertical shaver storage.   I converted another brands shaver stand by removing its charging connectors and put a folded papertowel in the bottom.  When the shaver is put away, it is mostly dry and sits pointed downward so any remaining moisture will be absorbed.      Aside from occasionally charging the shaver, it works like new every time.  I&#x27;ve used electric shavers with triangular, rectangular, large &amp;  small heads ... this is by far the most quiet, ergonomic efficient and comfortable shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  Highly recommended.  :-)</li>
    <li> I am retired and do some traveling with my family. I also work part time as an over the road truck driver. The razor fits my needs.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Panasonic ES8243A shaver for just over a month now. This shaver out performs any of the several Norelco shavers I have worn out over a period of years. None of the Norelcos ever gave the pleasing shave of the Panasonic.Needless to say, I am totally sold on the Panasonic. I use it daily and the charge lasts for 8 to 10 days. The price I paid for this razor from Amazon, along with free shipping, was very reasonable in my opionion.</li>
    <li> I got it a month ago and love it.  No problems at all.  I had a Braum before and this one is alot better.  It&#x27;s a closer shave and holds a charge better.  If you are looking for a electric shaver this is the one.</li>
    <li> my husband was always complaining he couldn&#x27;t get a decent comfortable shave.  his other electric razor was shot, the store blades were up to five and counting with an even higher price and though our son praised the benefits of an old-fashioned brush/foam shave, he just didn&#x27;t want to go there.  with a lot of research, he came upon this shaver.  no complaints since and he shaves every day!  our other son also has this panasonic with the cleaning bath and he is also a happy shaver.  thank you panasonic!</li>
    <li> Shaves well, holds charge fairly well for a light beard person. Wish it would shave when plugged in though ...</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t shaved with a blade since I got this shaver.  I&#x27;ve had all brands and this one, by far, out shines, (shaves), them all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great electric shaver, but it will still take between 10-15 minutes to acquire a shave as close as a razor.  Otherwise, it performs admirably.</li>
    <li> The razor works great and has all the features described. Great battery life, I haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet and I have had almost a month. I am very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> It is clearly better than the other ones my husbund had been used, but he is still hoping if it could be even closer to a classic manual shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never writen a review before but felt compelled to do so. I&#x27;ve had this Panasonic razor for two weeks and&lt;br /&gt;Am amazed by how close a shave it provides. Billy jealous hydroplane shave gel plus this razor gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten in about 3 minutes time.</li>
    <li> This shaver provides an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; shave.  Believe it or not, the shave is not nearly as close as the one I get from the little battery-powered travel shaver made by another manufacturer that fits in my Dopp kit. The shaver needs re-charging about every 3-4 days, which is more frequently than the last shaver I owned made by another manufacturer.  That&#x27;s not really a significant problem for me, but I usually need only about 3 minutes to shave each morning, so if you have a really heavy beard and expect to spend more time on each shave, then you might want to consider that factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the shaver does seem to re-charge fully quite quickly-- I think in about 30 minutes. The travel case is small and soft and does not accommodate the cord.  Twice when I got the shaver out of my luggage at the end of a trip the shaver had no charge. I suspect that was because the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button accidentally got pushed through the soft side case when the shaver was inside the luggage. I wonder how a running shaver inside a suitcase gets treated by TSA.  Anyway, it recharges quite quickly, as noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, it&#x27;s an okay shaver, but I think it would be worth taking a serious look at another model or brand if any of these issues are of concern to you. And if you take your shaver when you travel, I recommend that you consider a shaver what comes with a hard case that also accommodates the cord.  It is nice to have the two packed together.  Sometimes I have forgotten to pack the cord, which makes the shaver useless during the trip after the battery runs down. And sometimes I find myself spending quite a bit of time fishing through my packed luggage trying to find the cord.  So I think a shaver with a hard case that accommodates the cord is a good idea. That said, I suspect that for $15 to $20 you can probably buy a small hard-side camera case that would work to hold both the shaver and the cord, but of course you should factor that in the price you&#x27;ll be paying.  Alternatively, if you are considering a shaver with a soft-side case and you plan to use it for travel, then you might also want to consider whether the shaver is designed so that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button cannot be pushed accidentally through the soft side case.g.  Alternatively, if you are considering a shaver with a soft-side case and you plan to use it for travel, then you might also want to consider whether the shaver is designed so that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button cannot be pushed accidentally through the soft side case.</li>
    <li> The noise level &amp; the weight are much less than my former shaver, a Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They expect me to clean the shaver under running water but I clean my shaver daily &amp; I find it easier to clean it with a cleaning brush.  It&#x27;s a shame that I have to use an old cleaning brush since they didn&#x27;t include one.  That&#x27;s why I gave the shaver a 4-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;m satisfied &amp; recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have purchased so far.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this razor is the best I&#x27;ve used.  I would recommend it to anyone, whether you prefer wet or dry shaving.  It is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift.  He had never used one with these type of blades, so I was unsure but the reviews were very convincing.  The first couple shaves it didn&#x27;t get as close as he was hoping, but by the time he shaved 3-4 times, he says it&#x27;s just as close as using a straight razor.  It isn&#x27;t painful and it&#x27;s incredibly close.  The only complaint is that the hair can&#x27;t be past a certain length or it does not pick it up.  If he waits too long to shave, he has to go over it with the trimmer that is included on the razor first.  Clean up is very easy, you just hold under running water.  We did not purchase the self cleaning station, as other reviewers said it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  They were correct as running water works perfectly.</li>
    <li> The shaver produces an very nice shave and does not irritate my skin. There are three shortcomings that are worth noting. The first is that the shaver will not run while charging. You need to estimate before starting a shave if you have enough charge to make it to the end. The second is that the configuration on the head of the shaver makes it difficult to shave close to nostrils since the razor head is curved for a better overall experience. I may have noticed this more because I moved from a basic Norelco where this was not a problem. The third is that she shaver is surprisingly loud, so much so that its annoying to have it near my ear. My son had the&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES8103S which is noticeably quieter and produced a very similar result&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you see a version of this shaver that allows shaving while charging, I suggest going for that model instead.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have had. Smooth, quiet operation and great result. The charge lasts me about two weeks and then the recharge cycle is only about one hour. Strongly recommened.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in January based on the recommendations and was sorley disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It may stand up well to Remington or other \\&quot;name\\&quot; shavers but it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I stayed with it for a month as recommended by the manufacturer but its performance did not improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old electric shaver was old and needed blade and head replacement and my local shaver store had closed forever.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried to move into \\&quot;new\\&quot; technology but with poor results.&lt;br /&gt;So I checked on line and found replacement parts for my old Payer-Lux and ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;I had only ever purchased Payer shavers for the last 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What difference when I shaved. The shave took half the time and was so close that you could not feel any stubble/whiskers. And yes I could feel that with the Panasonic no matter how long I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the only positive I can say about the Panasonic is that it is rechargable and the trimmer worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the very best shave from an electric, source out Payer-Lux (or just Payer).&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard, and shaving takes about 4 minutes if I do it every day. I have sensitive skin, but shave dry because the products I&#x27;ve tried either have a scent that makes me nauseous, or I&#x27;ve not seen any benefit to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this shaver is extremely comfortable. I&#x27;ve not had to adjust and my skin has not been irritated, even on my neck. The shave is nice and close without giving me a burn, and while the unit is not silent it&#x27;s not super noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge has lasted a week, and I&#x27;ve yet to try the \\&quot;sonic cleaning\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m hopeful it will be as good an experience as the rest has been.</li>
    <li> Great shave for the price.  I read many online independent reviews and this razor scored well On most.  For the money you get a great shave and the razor is simple to use.  I would not hesitate to buy again.</li>
    <li> We have gone through several electric razers for our 17 year old son.  He isn&#x27;t old school - he doesn&#x27;t use regular razers.  He also has stubborn stubble!  It seemed his shavers would glide over the stubble and he never looked &#x27;clean shaven&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we purchased Panasonic 4 blade wet/dry nanotech shaver - the planets are in alignment again !!! no more fussing about shaving......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Panasonic! ..and Amazon for reliable shipping.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic ES8243 shaver is great. I am 44 and have had only norelco and remington shavers before this.I did alot of research before purchasing this shaver, I chose this one over the 5 blade model just above this one only because this one looked a little less bulky and i was worried about shaving next to my gotee. it does a very good job and i love the wet feature mostly since it is so easy to clean. i seem to get a better shave dry with some baby powder. it mows thru 2-3 days growth much better than any shaver ive ever had. as far as a \\&quot;one pass\\&quot; closeness for me there is no such thing since i have wiskers that grow straight down and so close and tight against my skin, even with this shaver i have to streach the skin and make many passes but i do not get razzer burn with this shaver and it does do a better quicker job than any others i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great product. This shaver cuts really close</li>
    <li> I just received my ES8243A and after the first shave, have to say I&#x27;m totally impressed. I have a heavy beard and have been shaving with a Braun for about 5 years. I was getting tired of spending 10  minutes every morning going over and over my face to get a close shave (only to be asked \\&quot;Did you shave today?\\&quot;) so I decided it was time to take the plunge and get a new shaver. After researching different options, I settled on the ES8243A. I decided against the much more expensive Black Vortex model after discovering that you can just as easily, with a few drops of liquid soap, clean the ES8243A and avoid having to buy the $5 monthly soap cartridges that the Vortex requires. That appears to be the only difference between the two models - the Black one has the Vortex cleaner/charger and the Blue one just has an AC adapter and you clean it with soap and water.   After charging the shaver (only takes 1 hour) I gave it a try and am totally impressed with how fast and close this shaver works. Compared to my older Braun, it&#x27;s a totally different shaving experience. This Panasonic shaver is quieter, lighter and all around a great shaver. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it out in the shower (something you can&#x27;t do with a Braun).</li>
    <li> I am a bit surprised by the high rating that this product has so far.  Maybe I am just not used to this shaver yet.  It would be interesting to find out what type of beard every reviewer has.  Bottom line is that, while it performs well, it cannot cut the hair from  neck-chin junction point. If you don&#x27;t grow any hair there it will do.  I have to go over that are a few times, and still need a blade to cut   the hair that it leaves behind. This obviously causes discomfort and irritation.  Another thing is that it is quite noisy.  Apart from the points above the quality of the shave is good.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve had a Braun which worked pretty well on my cheeks but couldn&#x27;t get neck hair and Norelcos, which didn&#x27;t shave close and gave me TERRIBLE neck burn.     This razor is fast and efficient, gives the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had with absolutely no neck irritation!    I love watching it with a little liquid soap as it foams and cleans itself. This little machine really delivers!</li>
    <li> This is the first foil type razor.  I have used Norelco rotary shavers for years and was a little concerned that I might not like this shaver.  I was pleasently surprised.  This Panasonic razor is one of the best I have ever used.  I use it as a dry shaver with Williams electric preshave and it really gives me a smooth, close shave with no razor burn.  It also tells you when it needs to be cleaned, which is easy and also tells you when it needs to be recharged.  I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just amazed at how quick and easy shaving is with this model. I&#x27;ve been avioding foil shavers for years because one that I bought long ago didn&#x27;t cut the longer hairs. The rotary norelcos always did a nice job of cutting the longer hairs, but never shaved as smooth as a foil. I was never good with a razor. Always getting little nics and cuts, and, quite frankly, too much of a hassle for me. This model gets the long hairs, and shaves every bit as close as a razor blade, all in under 2 minutes. It works equally well wet or dry. I honestly don&#x27;t know how it can shave so close without a hint of razor burn, but it does. Truly a wonder of modern technology! Before this one arrived, I had thought about getting my broken Norelco fixed, but after shaving one time with the Panasonic, I&#x27;ll never go back to a rotary again.    I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s me, but after a year, I started having the same problems with this one as I did with the Norelco. This unit no longer works. It turns on and off randomly. I originally purchased a cheaper model, because I couldn&#x27;t justify spending so much on a shaver if it&#x27;s only going to last a year, however, the amount of time this model saves me shaving, I think it&#x27;s justified, so I&#x27;ve ordered a similar model and just hope it last longer this time.</li>
    <li> I received this as a christmas present and I have been delighted with it.  I give it 4 stars rather than 5 for the following reasons:  1. Replacement head is VERY expensive - around 50+ dollars!   2. Unable to use it from the charger, so if it goes flat mid-shave you have to wait for it to charge up.    Other than those two issues it does a fine job.</li>
    <li> I have used blades all of my shaving life (45 years) with a few intervals using an electric shaver. Blades give me the closest shave (I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard) but there are times when I am in a hurry or when traveling that I like the convenience of an electric. The ES8243A is by far the best electric I have owned. It is quiet, powerful, and in 2 minutes gives me the next best thing to a blade. With a coupon I paid $100 for this outstanding shaver. Delivery was earlier than expected and I am very pleased with my purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different safety razors (1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 blades), 2 or 3 Remingtons and I&#x27;ve also had one Braun. All of the safety razors caused a lot of irritation on my neck. The Remingtons &amp; Braun shaved very well when new, but after a month or so they all seemed to dull and give only a fair shave. This Panasonic, from day one gave a great shave, and after well over a month, the shave has not changed!     I&#x27;ve tried using the shaver dry, but didn&#x27;t care for it that much.  I wash my face &amp; neck in hot water, rinse the soap off, and put on a thin coat of shaving cream (I heat up the shaving cream for a better feel, not a better shave). On the neck I have to move the shaver in all directions, since my beard seems to grow that way. It takes me around 5 minutes or so to finish, rinsing the shaving heads  now &amp; then to keep the shaving cream from piling up on the them.    When finished, my face is smooth; the shave is close, and there is absolutely no irritation. Is the shave as close as a blade? I&#x27;m not sure, but my face &amp; neck sure feel a lot better then they do after using a blade.   Would I buy this razor again? Without question! Do I recommend it? Let&#x27;s just say that it&#x27;s far better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever shaved with.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic electric razors for several years.  From time to time I have tried other brands, including top of the line Braun models, but I always came back to Panasonic as the best overall for me at least.  I was pretty satisfied with my current Panasonic, a triple blade Arc nano unit (8109).  However, I saw some unusually good reviews for this new Arc IV model that led me to try it.  I have to agree with the reviews I saw.  This model is clearly the best Panasonic has ever made, and better than any other brand that I have tried.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the wider head, something about the extra blade in the center, or some other design change--but this model gives a closer shave with fewer strokes.  I noticed the difference the first time I used it.  It is easy to clean under the faucet (no need for those cleaning bath units), and it has a nice display on the razor that shows not only battery time remaining but also elapsed time and other indicators.      Just FYI, this razor has two conventional blades that are mounted separately under the cover and replaced separately.  The other two blades are built into the cover.  One of those appears similar to the one on triple blade models intended to cut longer hairs.  The other appears more conventional from the outside, but is still integrated in the cover.  I am not sure why this was done, but it seems to work.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor - smoothest operating and best shaver I had used in the past 10 years - this is the third electric razor I have purchased.</li>
    <li> All I can tell you guys is that this has worked like a charm for me. I was very skeptical at first, after all I have used so many other electric razors including a few higher end norelcos, and brauns, but this Panasonic really impressed me. It does take a few days to fully appreciate the way this razor works, but trust me when I tell you that it is really worth it. The unit itself is very sturdy, and very easy to clean. The razor looks much better in person than in the pictures. Take it from an average guy, this is one very good product that both you and your spouse/girlfriend will appreciate.</li>
    <li> I switched from a Spectra rotary razor that was about 7 yrs old...I expected improvement but this is a great razor.  Once you get used to it ( ANY new razor takes some getting used to) it is a smooth shave, smoother when used with shving gel.    If you have any reservations about buying this, throw them aside and buy it!</li>
    <li> For a bald guy that shaves every day this is by far the best razor I have used yet.  I used a TCT 3 for 8 years and only replaced it because it was dropped and not worth repairing.  I THOUGHT I had the best razor because it never let me down.  I searched for the best replacement and this was by far the best reviewed for the money.  I now know why.  This razor takes a minute or 2 longer than usual when you first use it.  But after a few weeks it averages out.  There is definetly a break in time for the razor and your skin.  It&#x27;s almost like the shave trains the hair the correct way to be shaved and you don&#x27;t realize this until you have used it for a couple of weeks.  The result is a shave as close to a blade but much more comfortable and alot less irritating.  I never realize there was something out there this good.  The timer on it lets me know it takes me 13 minutes a day to shave face and head.  That means I spend 4745 minutes a year shaving.  That&#x27;s 3.3 days of continous shaving a year!!  Why wouldn&#x27;t you invest in a razor like this if you where spending that much time?  The only thing I can say about this razor is it advertises as one pass shaving.  While it does a good job on the first pass you definetly need to cover an area more than once.  Frankly what razor out there cuts on one pass only?  Maybe a straight razor but who uses those anymore?  By far this is well worth the money.  If you are reading these reviews you obviosly take shaving seriously.  You owe it to yourself then not to think twice about purchasing it.  You will not be disappointed.  I will be sure this razor is never dropped.  Make sure you keep it plugged in.  A 13 minute shaves brings a full charge to 80%.  That means I get 3 good shaves before the productivity decreases.  So bring the charger when you travel.</li>
    <li> After about a year, it&#x27;s still working like new and the quality seems great.  It does a pretty good job shaving and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband who has always used a 3 rotary blade razor. He hasn&#x27;t complained and said it works good gives a close shave, easy cleaning, and long lasting charge.</li>
    <li> Previously I&#x27;d only used low end electric razors.  I thought buying a more expensive model would lead to much better shaves but that is not the case.  The shaves produced by this razor are not appreciably better than by my previous razors and not nearly as close as the shave from a Mach 3 manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wet/dry feature is nice but not a real difference maker.  The wet cleaning capability is somewhat more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it difficult to shave the mustache area close to nose with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display is not as useful as it could be.  I don&#x27;t care how long a particular shave took and feel that displaying the amount of battery life left should be the default mode for the display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly light beard.  Maybe this razor would produce better results with a heavier beard.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  Finally, a razor that works on a woman&#x27;s legs.&lt;br /&gt;I have to use an electric razor due to taking Warfarin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other electric razors, but none are as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost like using a regular razor, my legs are smooth and stubble free.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shavers that I have ever used! I would recommend it to everyone! Love it!</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my husband for Christmas.  He thought it was very flimsily made and was afraid if it slipped through his hands in the shower it would break on the shower floor.  He did like the feature of being able to wet shave with it.  He was disappointed that it does not have a charging stand like the handy one my own lady&#x27;s Remington shaver has.  He did not like the way the shape of the head felt on his neck and chin.  He read that foils and blades have to be replaced periodically and did not want the expense involved with the replacements. He asked me to return it and I did.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver.......closer than the 4 blade manual shaver which, although is great, costs a bundle for blades.&lt;br /&gt;This will work if you don&#x27;t shave for a couple of days although, shave cream is advisable.&lt;br /&gt;The features of available power, short re-charge time, wet shave capability and ease of cleaning make this a winner.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to clip the $25 coupon available at Amazon........you do need to look for it though!</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a month and a half now, was ready to give up on it at first, but overall it works well enough. There just seem to be some days when it shaves close and some when it doesn&#x27;t. The toughest places to get close to are the jawline and just under the nose. By now I have tried four different shave creams and nothing seems to be any better than plain old inexpensive creams. It is definitely not a perfect shave, but I am willing to accept that for not having to go back to blades again.</li>
    <li> I have always used straight razors to shave, because when I would try various electric shavers they never worked well. Unfortunately even the best straight razors I would get irritation on my neck. I tried everything including expensive oils and shave gels but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what a difference this shaver made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have ANY irritation. Even when I very started using it and was in the \\&quot;one month transition period\\&quot;, I got a good close shave and no more bumps on my neck. It works like a champ in the shower and practically cleans itself. I also get a good 6-7 shaves per charge, and could probably get more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use, I bought a second one to keep in my suitcase for travel use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this shaver enough.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in years. The last electric was a Norelco in about 1994. The technology has really changed. Much better shaver BUT not as close as a razor. Of course, you don&#x27;t get cuts with the electric. Wish I had bought one with a cleaning system. Pay a little more and get the cleaning system.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a week and love it.  The trimmer is the only thing that holds me back from \\&quot;five-starring\\&quot; it.    What I like:  If you have four high-quality blades, they&#x27;re going to shave faster and better than the one.  And they do!  This shaver gives me an incredibly close shave, no overdryness or irritation to my skin, and it&#x27;s fast.  I can&#x27;t get my shaving time down to 2 1/2 minutes like what I see from a lot of reviews (more like 3 1/2 - and I don&#x27;t have a thick beard or anything really challenging), but there&#x27;s so much surface area to the head that the shave does go faster than what I&#x27;m used to.    What I don&#x27;t like:  The biggest issue is the trimmer.  My last shaver, a low-end Braun, had a great trimmer that went through anything like a lawn mower, but with more finesse.  This doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve kind of adapted so it does kind of okay on my sideburns, but other things I took for granted with the old Braun, like eyebrows, the back of my neck, even my own hair on my head sometimes, are way more than this wimpy trimmer can handle.  Distant second concern is battery life.  Squeezing a week of shaves out of this is a challenge, although it recharges fully in an hour, and there&#x27;s a display to show remaining battery life.  Final concern is that the large shaving area - a plus for speed - makes it difficult to get to small or tight places, which everyone&#x27;s face has here or there.    I had often thought that the extra money spent for a razor costing more than $40 was for useless bells and whistles.  I was wrong, and this product is great proof of that!</li>
    <li> Why I hate this razor:&lt;br /&gt;Underpowered motor - It barely has enough power to cut any more than a 5&#x27;oclock shadow off my face.&lt;br /&gt;Weak battery - Forces you to charge the razor after 1-2 shaves&lt;br /&gt;Weak beard trimmer - Panasonic must have included it purely for vanity purposes, because it sure doesn&#x27;t trim longer beard hairs</li>
    <li> look, it was simple,,,i did the homework, product comparison, surveyed the users, Panasonic ES8243A was the right pick for me, period,,,,</li>
    <li> I certainly like this Panasonic much more then the current razor I am using. It performs well all over my face and neck. The passes made are about the same as my current razor, but the closeness to skin ratio is superior. I have yet to find a razor that can get the thick hairs that grow in a couple of areas that I have moles removed. The ES8243A certainly lives up to it&#x27;s claims and I would certainly recommend it to anyone asking.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver and I especially like that it is a wet/dry one.  It works well on a tough beard.</li>
    <li> I left my 4 year old 8000 series razor for the Panasonic and I am nothing but impressed.  I have been using the Panasonic for over a year now and it as good as it was when I bought it.  I can&#x27;t scientifically prove it but I am fairly certain it shaves more efficiently and closer than the Braun.  I loved the Braun too but it was time for a change and I got tired of buying the cleaning solution so frequently  This one is a breeze to clean.  Just a little soap and water. A great surprise and a fantastic buy!</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes a great razor. The wet dry feature is great, but it shaves just fine dry. This is my fourth Panasonic and they have all been great products.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Norelco razors for years and was satisfied until now. I bought the Panasonic ES8243 because my old Norelco was dying and thought I would try it. I haven&#x27;t wet shaved with it yet but using it dry gives me a smoother shave than I have had since I gave up shaving with a blade. I only gave it 4 stars because of a small inconvenience, battery life is short. With the battery monitor display this is no big deal if you look at the monitor and it sure is no problem to plug it in for a charge, just would have liked to see a longer life battery.  Overall I love it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the top of the line Braun, Remington, and Norelco shavers.  I&#x27;ve used both foil and rotaries.  Nothing I&#x27;ve ever used holds a candle to this Panasonic.  After becoming frustrated with my last Braun shaver, the Series 7-790cc Pulsonic, and its inability to give me a decent shave that didn&#x27;t require me to go over the same area 50,000 times from different angles, and then end up getting out my old blade razor to finish taking off what the Braun just couldn&#x27;t seem to cut, I went searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across the Panasonic brand and recalled I&#x27;d had a much more basic Panasonic model some years ago.  It was one of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever had, and my son eventually boosted it from me when he moved out on his own.  Why I didn&#x27;t just stick with the Panasonic back then I&#x27;ll never know.  Probably because, who associates Panasonic with electric shavers?  You never see them at Christmas time making cute commercials with baby polar bears and penguins sliding down snow-covered hills like Norelco, right?  Anyway, I read a lot of positive reviews on this shaver, so I took a gamble and ordered it.  I&#x27;m ecstatic I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still requires me to cover an area a couple of times, but then any electric shaver is going to.  It does require far fewer passes than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, so I guess it&#x27;s the least of all evils.  I haven&#x27;t actually timed it, but my perception is that it does not hold a full charge quite as long as some other shavers I&#x27;ve used.  I think most guys will get at least a full week out of a charge, and if you have a relatively light beard as I do, you&#x27;ll probably get 2 weeks, possibly a day or two more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if I was in the market today for a new shaver, I&#x27;d go right out and get another of these Panasonics.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of electric razors, and this is the best.    Good fast shave. Nice compact size.    Two minor improvements? Pan beasonic could have provided a little brush to clean the razor; can the noise suppression be enhanced?</li>
    <li> This shaver is good, I love it I bought this 1 year ago it steel work perfect, I really recommend</li>
    <li> IN SHORT: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT even bother using this electric razor WITHOUT [[ASIN:B004GKAKK0 Mennen Afta Pre-electric Shave Lotion with Skin Conditioners, Original, 3-ounces (Pack of 6)]].  If not this one, then some other pre-electric lotion, but that is the only one I&#x27;ve tried so far.  I actually purchased it from Wal-mart because it came out cheaper, even with the cost of shipping.  It will probably vary upon your location.  Wherever you buy it, match the picture with the product you want, as the title of the product wasn&#x27;t as accurate as I would&#x27;ve liked it to have been.  REVIEW  I bought this product almost a year ago. I don&#x27;t shave everyday, just when I have to go to work.  I get lazy on weekends.  Now, I&#x27;m not a skinny guy, but I&#x27;m not huge.  My face is fat, so I have to stretch my skin with my other hand to get a closer shave.  I&#x27;ve had to use my old razor to finish up on my neck and the corners of my mouth, as this electric razor didn&#x27;t get the job finished.  Well, that changed this morning...  Earlier last week, I was reading reviews on this product.  One customer mentioned Afta Pre-Electric shave.  I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose, considering I&#x27;d spent $90 (at the time) on this razor, already, and I wasn&#x27;t quite due for new blades, yet.  So, I ordered this stuff.  My complaint is that it comes in such a small quantity. I would&#x27;ve liked a bigger bottle.  Anyway...  Just wow, my neck actually was shaved correctly.  Well, OK, my old razor STILL did a slightly better job, but still, the conventional method of shaving takes a bit longer.  I&#x27;m all about conserving time.  Here&#x27;s what I did:  1. Showered  2. Got Partially Dressed  3. Applied AFTA (Note my face had a few minutes to dry after shower)  4. Shaved  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any need to wipe the AFTA off your face, afterward.  While I was reading the reviews on this product again, last week, I discovered that there is a cleaning mode.  That&#x27;s what I get for not reading manuals.  To activate thecleaning mode, hold the button in for 2 seconds.  This activates \\&quot;Turbo Mode\\&quot;.  The manual says to NOT shave in Turbo mode.  I think it only stays in turbo mode for 20, maybe 30 seconds from what I read.  That&#x27;s more than enough time to run the razor under water.  Because of the addition of AFTA Pre-electric shave, I have updated my rating of this product from 4 stars to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Look no more, as your face will become hair-free WITHOUT the irritation. This electric shaver by Panasonic has truly changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shaves, for years, were with a blade. However, my skin would always end up irritated -- especially at the neck area. Plus the ingrown hairs would always be present and had to be plucked away. Later on, I read that an electric shaver would minimize both the irritation and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My very first purchase for an electric shaver was a Norelco; one of their mid-priced models. It did deliver its purpose, by minimizing both irritation and ingrown hairs, but in order to achieve a close shave (which was not that close, actually) it took 15 to 20 minutes! Other than the fact that it could not be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas, I researched reviews from both professionals and customers, and found that this Panasonic electric shaver does its purpose, and beyond. It will deliver a blade-like shave in 5 minutes or less -- NO JOKE nor exaggerations. I could not believe how my neck area ended up smooth and irritation free. That itself is amazing. Plus you get the versatility of using it both inside or outside of the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review comes literally one year after purchase. And I can assure you, I am one truly happy customer. Great shave and great skin at an awesome price. Who can beat that formula?</li>
    <li> This shaver is totally worth it. My husband has thick rough facial hair that grows quickly. Shaving everyday with razors leaves his face irritated. This electric one shaves it so close I am still not always able to tell the difference. It is quiet and holds it&#x27;s charge longer then the last one we had. I definitely reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I combined this with the art of shavings shaving cream and found the following steps to work best:  1) Take your badger brush or hand and grab a small amount of shaving cream. Work it over your face covering the areas that need shaving.  2) Make sure when you apply the shaving cream it&#x27;s not too thick of a lather  3) Take your shaver and run it under hot water while it&#x27;s on.   4) After running the shaver under hot water apply it to your lathered up face.   5) Go down in straight lines and then rinse the shaver under water to get the shaving cream and hair out. Go over the area of your face you just shaved one more time and work from opposite direction up. Will get a a thin lather to form as the shaver foams up the shaving cream and a really close shave  6) Repeat for remainder of face</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ususally write reviews, but I must admit, this is the best razor I have tried.  I use it alot and seem to overshave, but it does not tear my face, which is sensitive, and I do get a really good shave.  I would recommend it to anyone. I do like the fact I can clean it under the faucet, and the recharge is amazingly fast.  Hope you enjoy yours too!</li>
    <li> Works well, especially inn the shower - although it is difficult to dry afterwards.  Not sure how robust the blade foil will be with all the cleaning and drying.</li>
    <li> I replaced a cheap electric razor with this.  Shaving is comfortable and quick.  Cleaning is easy.  The razor will tell you how long you have been shaving - a weird, but fascinating metric.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd es8243 (I just buy a new razor when on sale versus buying replacement blades). I have literally tried all the high end shavers over the past few months (Braun 7(even tried the old cartridge with blue cutting strip), arc3 Panasonic, eslv51, eslv61 (yes the 5 blade model), esla63), the es8243 is honestly is the best of the bunch. I have a heavy beard with super sensitive skin. This  shaver gives the closest shave with the least amount of irritation as compared to ALL the other shavers I have tried. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this razor anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever owned, better than Braun, works fast, shaves great, trimmer is good.</li>
    <li> I still need to shave with a razor after using this shaver.  It does not cut the hair as close as I would like.  I wish I could have tried this shaver before I bought it because I would have left it on the shelf.  If you are looking for a close shave then don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> This is my fifth one. I have warn two out, have one at home, one at my remote office and one in my suitcase. Durable and a close shave</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have found to date! Its fast at 13000rpm and you can use it dry or wet! And, its a breeze to clean! Perfect for me since my beard is not super heavy! Those might want to buy next expensive model!</li>
    <li> I have had the top of the line Braun&#x27;s for years, but this Panasonic puts them to shame. Just charged for 1 hour and used on a three day growth and took it out smoother than the Braun&#x27;s in 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on Panasonic shavers from now on...</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave I have ever had from any electric razor. Will never use any other brand.Easy to use and easy to clean.Just love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun Series 7 for years now and wanted to try something new. This is by far a superior razor for my beard being it has the wet/dry shave and my wife says my face has a much smoother feel and less stubble than with the Braun.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my legs, and it works great. I love never having to use a razor! Charges quickly. Only downside is you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
    <li> The razor provides a fast clean shave.  It does seem to have relatively short run time on the battery so one needs to be near a power outlet for multiple shaves.</li>
    <li> Outstanding, durable product</li>
    <li> My husband is confined to bed. He used this razor easily and can stay shaven by himself. The way it pivots and moves on the face makes shaving easy. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Now have 2 years shaving experience with the ES8243.  Having used the highest end Braun product just prior, and Remington, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve tried.  It provides a closer shave, is robust and easy to use, easy to clean (dry or wet), and provides a charge message (high end products do this now).  The charge lasts 9-12 days.  For Braun users ... High end Braun products are good but in my experience the mechanical parts tend to fail from use over time (on/off switch on 2 of them because of the extension for trimming ... presume they&#x27;ve fixed this).  The last one was a 7000 series with the proprietary cleaner system (you don&#x27;t need this; I stopped using it because experiments showed it wasn&#x27;t doing anything).  The Braun 7XXX provided a good shave; the Panasonic provides superb shaves.  Full disclosure:  None of these products shave as close as a good multi-blade razor but without being careful I tend to cut myself seeking a closer shave against the hairs.  I jettisoned the Remington with Ti blade.  It abraded my face and I don&#x27;t recommend it.  If you are a Braun fan, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the top model but you are missing out on a better product with the Panasonic, at a lower relative price.  Hate to say this because I tend to own a lot of PG stock from time to time.  Improvement:  The sideburn / long hair trimmer is adequate but could be improved.  This is true on Braun models as well.  February 2013 Update.  Worth noting that I am still using the original foil and cutter which provide a satisfactory shave.  I purchased replacement parts but being frugal have not come to the decision to use.  The current shave is noticeably not as good as the first shaves, but it is adequate.  Offering this message for those of you concerned with the cost of replacement parts.  I don&#x27;t use the shaver wet, tap to remove cuttings every day, brush cutter every 1-2 weeks, recharge about every 8-10 days.  This is a very low maintenance appliance. April 15, 2013 Update.Decided to treat myself to new blades and foil but keeping the old ones in case of need.  They still work fine. September 2016.  New blades.  Shaver still working very well.  Only disadvantage is blades and new shaving head/screen expensive.</li>
    <li> I have had several electric razors (Braun, Norelco and Panasonic) and this is by far the best ever.  I&#x27;ve stuck to Panasonic for their Wet/Dry feature because of my dense beard. This shaver is so good I rarely have to use it wet. The result is a quick smooth shave. It has a locking feature which firms the head or unlocked which helps the head/beard interface conture better.  Nice display and charge time. Cons are no stands like the past razors and the travel case is cheap looking. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a week and am mostly impressed with it.  I have used it dry exclusively.  I have previously used Norelco rotary shavers and find the Panasonic to shave closer but only marginally faster.  I&#x27;ve experienced very little irritation.      Like many shavers, Panasonic claimes this one offers \\&quot;remarkable shaving on the first pass\\&quot;.  That is, of course, a fantasy on their part but this is still a good shaver.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure what \\&quot;remarkable\\&quot; means, but I find it still takes several passes on areas such as my neck which are difficult to shave.    All in all, this is a good shaver for the price but not the holy grail of shaving.</li>
    <li> After using numerous other razors (mostly Remington&#x27;s &amp; Norelco&#x27;s) I switched over to this panasonic as a gift and it&#x27;s great!  The wet shave feature is more useful than you realize, being able to shave in the shower without worry.  The only complaint is a lack of full width trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with it, but it does not get as smooth a shave as a manual one.  Pretty close but not the same.  I do the time savings as opposed to straight razor.  And the ability to use wet is very good.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> After a lot of research &amp; reading a lot of reviews, I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas. He tried it out as his old one (5 year old Remington) had seen it&#x27;s last days a number of months ago and he hates buying anything for himself. It was walking around ALL day asking me to feel his face. He is so very pleased with his gift. I just hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I was in the market to find a shaver to replace my seven-year old Braun.  Used to be a big fan of Braun&#x27;s shavers, but get irritated by their push of models coming with pricey washing solution cartridges.  I was impressed with features of this Panasonic shaver and decided to give it a try.    I ended up a very happy user.  This is probably the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  Here is my take for this shaver:    Pros:  1. A terrific wet/dry shaver which allows you to shave in the shower or with shaving cream.  2. It comes with a \\&quot;sonic washing mode\\&quot; which allows you to wash it right under the tap water.  The shaver even let you know when it needs cleaning.  3. Fast recharge speed.  Ready in minutes.  4. Provides a smooth, close shaving experience.  Never had I been treated by an electric shaver in such a clean and polished manner.  5. No need for pricey cleaning cartridges.    Con:  1. It would be better if it&#x27;s power cord is \\&quot;retractable\\&quot; (something like those connected to conventional telephone receivers, which are used on some of Braun&#x27;s shavers).</li>
    <li> After my old Norelco Cool Skin died, I was in the market for a new shaver. I really don&#x27;t like a dry shave, so I definitely wanted to go waterproof again. I wasn&#x27;t ever totally happy with my Norelco. It did a great job on my face, but I couldn&#x27;t ever use it on my neck without severe razor burn. Consequently, I was left having to shave my neck with a blade. I&#x27;ve read rave reviews about how great this Panasonic is, but the high price of it scared me. Still, I figured, if it works on my neck and I don&#x27;t have to buy Fusion blades anymore, it might very well be worth it, so I took the plunge and bought it. And I am I glad I did. This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric. It works as advertised. It is fast ( takes me about three minutes to shave with this ), comfortable and very close. I haven&#x27;t had any abrasion or razor burn. And best of all, it works great on the neck, not only on the face like some other shavers. I have only two minor complaints about this shaver. First, I wish it had a wrist strap for use in the shower to help keep you from accidentally dropping it like the Cool Skin does. Second, is the charger. It is simply a cheap-ish charging cord. A high-end razor like this should really give you a nice inductive charging stand for the amount of money you are spending. Other than those two minor quibbles,  this is probably the finest electric shaver on the market right now. Worth every penny.   PROS-  - Fast shaves. You&#x27;re done in 2-3 minutes.  - Comfortable - no abrasions, nicks, or razor burn  - Easy to clean - no expensive cleaning solution cartridges  - Great shave. Almost as close as a blade, especially wet.    CONS-  - Somewhat pricey  - No wrist strap for the shower  - Cheap charger</li>
    <li> i first bought the braun 790cc...the big expensive one!! and hated it. this razor picked up what the braun left behind.....BUY IT</li>
    <li> My favorite shaver. Bought 3 and gave 2 as presents. Great all round shaving. Super reliable, durable... Bought another shaver as it was being&lt;br /&gt;praised soooo much, but soon realised that the one I already have is a better choice. I have reviewed the Panasonic ES-LV61-A Arc5 as well and gave it only 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Damn fine electric razor.  Sure the price isn&#x27;t cheap but it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s a good close shave and it&#x27;s comfortable. Cleaning it is very simple and the batter life is good too. He&#x27;ll it even tells you how much battery is left after and during each use. Being cordless is a plus. This is great for deployments.  I myself am currently overseas and I use this a lot more often then having to shave with water and a razor in the field.  Great investment regardless</li>
    <li> The shaver works great and does not cut my skin which is what I was hoping for. It shaves very smoothly which I like.</li>
    <li> I had a Panasonic shaver before, but I gave it to my son when he started to shave.  That one was an es-la63-s. It had duel motors. The es8243a just has one motor. The only difference I really notice is that the es8243a has a smaller head which I prefer. It&#x27;s easier to get a good shave. I don&#x27;t regret not buying one with a cleaning station. It&#x27;s so easy to clean these razors that I don&#x27;t think that is necessary. I love the option of using shave gel and water to get an extra comfortable shave, but the best advantage of this shaver is the close shave that you can get with a dry shave. It takes practice to get your neck good, but I have not experienced any discomfort from this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought a Norelco senso touch shaver that I did not care to use much.  The three-round blade is inconvenient to use and it does not shave that well either.  This panasonic shaver however provides much different experience.  Not only is it way easier to shave than Norelco&#x27;s but this awesome product shaves as close as if you would use a manual shave.  Definately worth buying.</li>
    <li> I have many many  shaver before . i never  satisfy , but  this shaver is fantastic   I really recommend , you gonna love it.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time mulling whether to try an electric razor again and then a few months looking at what I would pick. Settled on the Panasonic, but it was really close on the Braun based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Well put together&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Cuts surprisingly well on the top half of my shave, including cheeks, chin and upper lip&lt;br /&gt;-Super easy clean-up and maintenance&lt;br /&gt;-Good charge (lasts a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Cuts very poorly on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the electric razor and use it a few times a week. However, the only downside is I could never take on a trip without a straight blade to clean up my neck. Sometimes I wonder &amp;#34;so what&#x27;s the point&amp;#34; and may not replace once this breaks.</li>
    <li> I really hoped this was going to make shaving easier for me each morning especially after reading all the great reviews. The shave was terrible, left me with stubbles everywhere. I had to go over it again and again. If you have thick hair, do not purchase this item. I end up cutting my self badly, and never got the results (close shave) I was hoping over. After I was done, I had to go over it with my Fusion razor which end up cutting much more that this shaver couldn&#x27;t do. I guess Its back to the razor for me :(</li>
    <li> I have had several shavers from Panasonic. This is the best one yet. I use it just after showering. The shave is even closer than my previous Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver for 1 year, and I can say that this model is really great. Besides this Panasonic, I own Braun Syncro and Philips Norelco 8240 as I wanted to try different brands and technologies to find the one which is best for me personally. So, this Panasonic model is  optimal in my opinion as it deliveres exactly what you expect from the high quality shaver. By the way, I remember that I did not like it once I tried it first (after my Braun this model looked too lighweight and \\&quot;not serious\\&quot;, i.e. like a toy), but 1 week later I fell in love with it and 1 year after the purchase it works perfect and looks to be as sharp as before. Full charge is enough for about 5 times of shaving. It charges very quick - in 30-40 minutes from 0 to 100% in my case.   I highly recommend this product to anyone who prefers electric shavers.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 90 year old dad who was continuously shaving with a razor and wanted something safer for him to use.  This is awesome because he can still do the same process of cream, shave, rinse and never use a blade again!</li>
    <li> I have used the razor only with shaving cream, and it works as well as a razor. I use it before showering.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by this shaver, it included a trimmer which was not apparent, and the head is cushioned and tilts side to side. I was looking at this shaver due to it being cleaned with soap and water, unlike the alcohol bath that my current shaver required, along with continually buying new units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is fairly light and very comfortable to hold and use. However, for anyone who has every heard an angry hornets nest, this would drive them crazy. Shaving your upper lip is somewhat like finger nails on chalkboard. I&#x27;m not sure yet if I can tolerate using this product, but I&#x27;ll give it some more time before I decide.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe a dry electric shave can get this smooth, but it does with this sucker!  Finally, no more need for shaving cream and razors...</li>
    <li> Hubbie&#x27;s Review:  Really, it is that good.  But, it is difficult to keep clean, which is important for it to be able to shave as close as a blade.  Very comfortable to hold and maneuver.  Got use to it very quickly, after being a blade guy for 40 years.  Unfortunately, my overall time to complete a shave is more with this, due to feeling the need to clean it after every use.  Perhaps the Braun&#x27;s are easier to maintain with their cleaning stands.  They are certainly more money for the same quality device.  It&#x27;s nice, but I won&#x27;t forget where my blade razor is anytime soon.</li>
    <li> After 50 years of my life FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! an electric shaver that does NOT pull my hair - and shaves CLOSER than a blade - no B.S.!  I am actually buying another today for the office for emergency 6pm meetings/dinners etc.  I actually enjoy using this! it is so smooth and fast - no pulling no pinches - this is by far the best electric I have ever used - ever - and I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen over the years. Simply perfect! And still have not changed the blades - after 2 years!</li>
    <li> This shaver is great for those with sensitive skin! I&#x27;ve used rotaries and other foils in the past...those tore my face up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does the job nicely without irritating my face: as in, it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. No heat rash, no skin bumps. No pulling. It&#x27;s not terribly loud, either (not quiet, mind you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some trouble with certain parts of my face, so I finish the job with a razor. Some men don&#x27;t mind a couple of lurking whiskers, but they bug me. You may find you don&#x27;t need to finish with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It is so much better than my previous razors!  Why did I wait so long?  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Basically a good shaver, but was just a little disappointed in how close the shave is.  I was under the impression that the higher speed of the motor would increase effectiveness.  I do have lest razor burn, however.  Overall a good razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned electric shavers for years. My first was a Remington, then a Norelco. I gave up on both and went back to a blade because they didn&#x27;t shave very close. I eventually decided on an electric shaver again and bought a Braun (5614). It was better than my first shavers, but I still had to go over the same areas on my neck over and over again to get a close shave. Finally, after reading the reviews here on Amazon, I tried this panasonic ES8243A. All I can say is, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; I am totally blown away at how close it shaves. It is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. And the trimmer works great, unlike other shavers I&#x27;ve owned.     One note on price. J&amp;R ([...]) has better prices than Amazon. Check it out and compare.     I realize everyone&#x27;s face is different, but for me at least, this is an awesome shaver!</li>
    <li> Is my first time with a electric razor. So far so good. Is easy to handle, the battery last for more than 10 shaves.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about 2 months now. I have used Panasonic, Braun, and Remington shavers in the past. I find this shaver gives me the smoothest shave of all the shavers I have used. I believe it is due to the 4 blades and the technology that goes with them. The only thing I do not like so far is that the display of power remaining only comes on briefly when the shaver is turned off. It then disappears until you turn it on and off again. I also bought the model without the cleaning machine. I prefer to rinse it off with water after each use and then do a high speed cleaning with soap and water about once a week. The ongoing cost of the cleaning cartridges, etc. I find prohibitive. This is a great shaver - it is light, fits well in my hand, the charge lasts more than a week for me, and it gives a really comfortable and close shave.</li>
    <li> I saw the shaver ad on TV and decided to get it after reading some of the reviews online.  After using it,I am honestly very surprised by the high rating that this product has so far.  The shaver cannot cut the hair from neck-chin junction point. If you don&#x27;t grow any hair there it will do.  I tried to go over that a few times, and still need a blade to cut the hair that it leaves behind, which causes discomfort and irritation. The shaver is also quite noisy.  The Shaver ended up giving me a horrible irritation all over my neck and even cuts under my chin.   I called Panasonic customer care and they made my experience even worse They treated me like some idiot customer. I even send them the pictures and they said that the pictures don&#x27;t prove that the irritation and cuts were caused by a bad shaver. They got one thing correct which is that it wasn&#x27;t a bad unit,it&#x27;s just a bad product and service!   I send it back to Amazon for a refund I &#x27;m back using my quite and safe Norelco.</li>
    <li> To put this review in perspective, my previous shaver that I owned for over 5 years was a Norelco 6885XL Quadra Shaver. My Norelco gave excellent shaves but the battery was dying and the head shell and blades needed replacement. So after reading all the stellar reviews on the Panasonic ES8243K, I decided to give it a whirl. [My shaver is identical to the ES8243A but in black. It was originally offered without the HydraClean system, which I think is unnecessary.] When it arrived in the mail, I was happy to see Panasonic is using eco-friendly all cardboard packaging.     Both my old Norelco and the Panasonic are very ergonomic. I decided to use the ES8243K dry for the first couple week to be able to compare apples to apples. The Norelco gave me a close shave but the Panasonic was even closer and more consistent over all parts of the face and neck. And each day during the first three days of use, it seemed to shave a little closer. I didn&#x27;t find it to be any quieter than the Norelco, just a different sound. The Norelco left my face just mildly irritated but the Panasonic was considerably more irritating for the first three days. After my skin adjusted to the change, I found it to be less irritating than the Norelco. I have a thick beard but sensitive combination (normal/oily) skin.    The second week I tried using shaving cream. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used shaving cream with an electric razor. It seems to shave slightly closer than when I shaved dry. But the main benefit is no irritation at all after shaving. No need to use an after-shave anymore--just a good organic moisturizer. What works best for my skin and beard is to first shower, then wash my face with a good quality organic facial wash or exfoliant. Then I pour hot water into my shaving scuttle I bought from Dirty Bird Pottery. Next, I create a lather with Classic Shaving Cream (unscented) and a Rooney best quality badger brush. These products are relatively expensive when compared to drug store brands, but they last quite a while because I have to use only a small amount each time. Plus they&#x27;re hypoallergenic, the shave is very close, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel irritated afterwards. The shaving head has a locked and unlocked position. I really don&#x27;t notice a difference in the shave. I just leave it unlocked and the head flexes slightly. I like to shave once, not going over the same area a lot. Then I re-lather and go over my face and neck a second time. Now the trick to a really close shave is to shave the neck and chin in a direction 90º from how you shaved before re-lathering. After shaving, I rinse with warm, then cold water to close the pores. And I apply an organic moisturizer. The last step is very important to protect the skin and I have no idea why a lot of men don&#x27;t use a moisturizer.    Cleaning is easy and just takes a little over a minute. Apologies, I can&#x27;t compare the shave to a safety razor since I don&#x27;t use one. I doubt that it&#x27;s quite as close as a Feather single edge double-blade but there&#x27;s always trade-offs. I paid $200 because I bought it when it first came out--no complaints. It&#x27;s a bargain at it&#x27;s current price.    Cons: There is no stand for the razor so that it can rest vertically and take up less shelf space. It would also look nicer on the shelf.  Panasonic should design and offer a stand with a clip or something to hold the outer foil shell while it&#x27;s drying after cleaning. The other problem is that the lighted read-out for minutes shaved and percentage of charge left should be brighter to be able to read it in a brightly lit room. It&#x27;s a little hard to read because my bathroom has a skylight.</li>
    <li> This razor replaces a Braun that I had for years, and really liked .  After searching on line, I liked the sound of this Panasonic. Received it in short order and the first shave was terrific, easy, smooth and felt good. I&#x27;m a little hesitant to rinse it under water, but I will attempt that soon...I have no problem cleaning it dry.  Another thing, no more prolonged blood thinner bleeding from nicks.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> I had been using Remington for a while and was little concerned for brand and style change. Now after several month, I find this shaver very good for a nice close shave. It does get the job done without making several passes and battery does last longer. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving. I have tried all kinds of razors, creams, aftershaves, lotions, etc., but each of them have come up short. It seemed irritation after shaving was simply a fact of life. Even expensive electric razors have caused horrible irritation, not to mention the lack of a close shave. This Panasonic, however, is completely different. It really does get as close as a blade, at least for me. Moreover, I have not once experienced any irritation from it, not even right out of the box. I purchased it for convenience intending to use it only occasionally. I don&#x27;t always have time to stand in front of a mirror. Since I opened the box, though, I haven&#x27;t used a blade once. It&#x27;s a wonderful little device, and it&#x27;s affordable and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> I bought this item back in December 2011 and the current price is thirty dollars highter now!  Rediculous increase.  Was planning to buy one, but not at this price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this rechargeable razor to replace my Norelco. It gives good service, but is a little loud. The shave does not compare to a Gillette Mach 3 disposable razor. If you hear that, or read a review clamming it, it&#x27;s not true. I still like the razor. It gives me the shave and convenience I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I give it 4 stars for performance and 2 stars for reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Panasonic ES8243 shaver in April of 2011.  At first, it worked great!  Provided a close shave, closer than my Braun, and functioned wet or dry. (You call really use it in the shower!)  However, about 3 months into use the LED panel on the front started to malfunction. First some of the numbers were slightly unreadable when the battery power was low. Fully charge it was fine.  Then it was unreadable all the time (all numbers read as \\&quot;888\\&quot;) and all warning signals (time to clean, change foil, low battery) were on all the time.  It still functioned well, i just couldn&#x27;t tell when to charge it or clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Panasonic and they told me there was no \\&quot;reset\\&quot; code for \\&quot;fix\\&quot; it.  So they instructed me to send it back to the Panasonic factory in TX(2 year warranty).  Had to use my old shaver for 2 weeks.  Got the Panasonic back two weeks later (factory refurbished and without the nice accessories) and it worked well for 1-2 months and then THE SAME PROBLEMS RECURRED.  The LED display went haywire and was unreadable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll just keep sending it back whenever the LED goes bad and that way i won&#x27;t have to buy new shaver blades and foils!</li>
    <li> I have used a Remington Microscreen for years and didn&#x27;t want to change brands because of \\&quot;loyalty\\&quot; to Remington.  I read review after review and every one said that this Panasonic was good.  If you have irritable skin and are sick of the painfull rash that comes from shaving then this is the razor you should try!  Everything I was looking for and more.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This thing is awful. It literally won&#x27;t even cut the hair on my arm, let alone my face. I tried 10+ passes and it cut maybe 20% of the hairs on my face. I can&#x27;t believe anyone has EVER had success with it. Returned immediately.</li>
    <li> my husband just doesn&#x27;t shave much - i did lots of research and this one is great for really thick hairs, and sensitive skin.  We pair it with my handmade shave lotion or shaving soap and it works great.  He has shaved in the car with it a handfull of times, and it was ok on his skin then too.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews, I was hoping to get a really good shave from this razor.  However, I can&#x27;t say that it does any better than my old Braun electric razor that was less than half the price.  I still have problems getting a close shave under my jaw line.  Because of this, it takes a long time to shave and I only get 3 shaves per charge.  I have only used it dry.</li>
    <li> I really love this shaver; it has served me well and I continue to enjoy it after almost 2 years.  It is powerful and delivers a close comfortable shave.  It is wet capable for those so inclined however I only shave dry and it performs well even with no shave gel or moisturizer.  With a shave gel it gives results similar to a blade.  The only two negatives are relatively low battery capacity ( I get only 3-4 shaves out of a charge) and the shaver does throw out stubble when used dry.  Even so, I highly recommend and give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use an electric razor before.  My skin is too sensitive.  However I decided to buy this one to see how it would work out since the reviews were good.  I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> best purchase i ever made i hate shaving this makes a fast job of it&lt;br /&gt;it would have been nice to have a charging stand but i still wouldnt trade&lt;br /&gt;it for another</li>
    <li> I loved it immediately upon first use, and it provides the closest and easiest shave of any electric that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> so far no problems at all,  purchesed about year ago, it really works well and have no complains.&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> this razor works well. on the whole i am happy with it.  but it will not work while plugged in. that said, you can charge it enough for a single use in just a few minutes so that is probably not a big deal. also, it stays charged for a long time so you don&#x27;t need to plug it in every day.  it works much better for me on a dry face.  however, i have never used any other wet/dry shaver, so i maybe wet shaving is just more difficult in general. there are a few spots on my face that i have to go over a bunch of times to get them smooth, but that was true with my last shaver too.  i did find this shaver did a good job with 5-day scruff where other foil razors fall down.  i think because of the trimmer blade down the center i don&#x27;t need to use a trimmer first.  even with the trimmer blade, it has never nicked me, and i am really cavalier with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent initial performance</li>
    <li> After flopping back and forth between my old electric shaver and a conventional blade, I bought this shaver based on others reviews.  And they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an electric shaver that rivals a blade&#x27;s performance, this is a good one to choose.  Each morning I&#x27;m still impressed with the closeness of the shave, as it leaves very smooth skin without stubbles and no hair left behind.  This is my experience with dry shaving, never tried using it with shaving foam (although it can be used as a wet shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon featured this shaver one day as their gold box deal of the day and I bought it using that deal.  Not sure if the &#x27;normal&#x27; pricing is considered expensive for a 4 blade shaver but it&#x27;s worth the price if you want effortless, close-as-a-blade shave without the chance of knicking your skin on occasion.</li>
    <li> Well made Panasonic I keep in the shower for a quick shave. Does an ok job but not as close as norelco. Great for shower shave. Will make u presentable</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in years because I never knew one that could shave as close as a blade.  I finally found what I was looking for with this Panasonic.  Shaving is easy, fast and there is no irritation to my skin.  I like a close shave, and to obtain that with a blade, I would often suffer small cuts, especially if the blade was a few days old.  Not so with this Panasonic, which effortlessly glides over my skin and produces a close shave, whether I shave wet or dry.  I have only used this for a week, so I can&#x27;t speak to this product&#x27;s reliability.  My beard is average in thickness and growth, so I also can&#x27;t gauge how this razor would work on someone with a different thickness of beard.  I also have not used the trimmer.  But I am extremely pleased with the shave I get and the way it leaves me feeling smooth and pain free following my daily shave.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and was happy to see that this razor fared very well. However, upon purchasing it I found that it was very loud. I was even concerned about my own hearing when shaving close to the ears. As far as I can tell, it shaves fine, but I&#x27;m returning it to protect my hearing.</li>
    <li> It shaves close and is very quiet. The trimmer is excellent. It cleans easily with a squirt of soft soap and water</li>
    <li> This was my first electric shaver, so I don&#x27;t have a point of comparison. Overall, the quality of shave is very good. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with wet shave but the dry shave is great.  Also it takes a bit of effort to shave the neck area. The digital display feature, cleaning and charging efficiency is all very good.</li>
    <li> The higher vibration rate is awsome... makes for a very close shave. I really like the wet/dry option, although the wet seems to shave closer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on the basis of the many other positive comments and it turns out they are pretty close to the mark.&lt;br /&gt;My old Braun fell off the dressing table just after I was browsing for a replacement and smashed the foil!!&lt;br /&gt;That prompted me to go for the Panny :)&lt;br /&gt;Its lightweight and does a good job I think and I am also impressed by the ability to use in shower etc.&lt;br /&gt;The motor does sound a tad different to the Braun - its a higher pitch but its not overly intrusive for my ears:)&lt;br /&gt;As I am outside of USA so I guess the guarantee is no longer valid which is a shame but hopefully it wont be required.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how/if other more costly alternatives could better this shaver for the price I paid $99.99</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse facial hair I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Norelco for about 10 years in preference to razors. I was pleasantly surprised when I got the Panasonic shaver. It&#x27;s both more comfortable and gets a closer shave than my Norelco. It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as a razor blade but damn near and well worth the added comfort and convince of an electric. I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that it holds up and isn&#x27;t broken a year from now but otherwise a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned pretty much every electic razor that has been made. By far this razor does the closest shave I have ever had in an electric.  The blades are sharp and do not drag like my Remington did. Quick, clean and fast, finally!  Finally, I tried to find a better price on Ebay, but didn&#x27;t and you get free shipping at Amazon and good return policy. Well worth it, even if I did find a cheaper price on Ebay!</li>
    <li> Closest shave after 64 years!  Have used all types of electric razors.  Heavy beard removed quickly.  Closest shave to a blade ever.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because my facial hair is coarse, but it did not give anything resembling a close shave using either wet or dry shaving. After trying for a while, all I was left with was stubble and irritated skin. I was excited about it and wanted to like it but it proved pretty much useless to me.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is definitely worth the money! You could use it either dry or wet. It is very easy to take apart to clean with a little soap and water. The screen even tells you when it is time to clean your shaver and when you should charge it. It only takes about 1 hour to charge and that will last you about 5 or 6 shaves.</li>
    <li> Over the years (76 so far) I have had several electric shavers. This is by far the best. I had not shaved for more than a week prior to getting this so I could give it a good test. I was clean shaven in less than 2 minutes. The smoothest electric shave ever. I&#x27;m getting one for my son who hates to shave.</li>
    <li> For the closest of close shaves without skin irritation it would be difficult to find a better shaver,i would highly recommend this shaver,thank you Panasonic and Amazon for a great price.</li>
    <li> Powerful razor and an extremely close shave compared to the more expensive yet slightly dated Braun I&#x27;ve used for years.  Works wet and dry like a charm as advertised and has a slightly unnecessary LCD screen that shows the battery charge level.  It cleans itself too!</li>
    <li> Very good shaved. It really gets after those unwanted hairs and makes it smooth!!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic ES8243A shaver. I was very happy with the first shaver. Got a few years use just with replacing blades on regular basis. Eventually the battery stopped recharging. I found the same shaver again on Amazon at a slightly lower price. Purchased it again. This time it seems the battery does not last as long before requiring charging. Certainly not as long as my first shaver. Still happy with the shave, just wonder if this shaver has been sitting on a shelf for an extended time before purchase?</li>
    <li> Best shaver my husband has ever had. He loves it. Nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I bought it based on the number of excellent reviews. They were right. Much more effective for me than Phillips Norelco on neck and a faster shave overall.</li>
    <li> Easy-to-use great razor does an  incredible job</li>
    <li> Works well,gives a very close shave. I travel and it holds a charge for at least two weeks.</li>
    <li> This razor gave me an excellent shave.  However, after about six months the video display became unreliable. In time, there was no video display at all, so I had to guess on when to recharge. After a year and a half, the razor would switch to clean mode while I was shaving for no reason.  It even did this when fully charged.  (Clean mode isn&#x27;t fast enough to cut anything.)  Shortly after that, it would sometimes fail to come on when fully charged.  I paid over $100 and should be able to expect more than a year and a half out of this product. I emailed Panasonic about this and received no reply.  I can only assume that they don&#x27;t stand behind their product.</li>
    <li> I could not be more happy with the shaver. Very close shave, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small negative would be the battery life is not long, but enough for 3 shaves. I would expect more. However the indicator is great, so as long as you pay attention there are no issues. Like me though, that had a Norelco that lasted many shaves(even with each one being twice as long due to the quality of the shaver), you may get caught without juice. Hopefully at that point you are with charger and near a power source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go buy one for yourself, NOW !!</li>
    <li> Great Product. I loved it so much, I bought a second. One for home and one for my Travel Suitcase. Shave is good. Not a blade shave, but a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve had so far. Easy to clean and battery life is very good.</li>
    <li> tried this after 10 years using electric razors--(mostly Braun models)--in dry shave mode.  wanted a cleaner, closer shave without the nicks/cuts...which is the reason I went electric in the first place.  this model is not perfect--(still some areas on the neck that are tough to get close)--but by and large it works well.  battery life is decent, and only requires an hour for a full charge.  cleaning is easy.  only 5 weeks in, but so far I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This razor is well made and seems to hold a charge quite well. It does provide a close shave. However it does not get everything no matter how long and how hard I try. It will get you by in a quit fix however it does not give you a good finished look like using the manual razor. I find more often than not that I will grab it a not everything down quickly and then use my manual razor to finish the job. As for pulling your hairs like the old rotary that I owned.....it has not once pulled. I do like this product, however I can not say that it is the answer to not having to shave with a manual razor.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have never enjoyed an electric shaver this much, especially on business trips or vacations. When time and accuracy is of essence when rushing out of the home and out to this office, I put this electric shaver against a razor any day.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. The only improvement I would like to see is a wider trimmer. Otherwise this is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 8595 electric razor for the past 10 or so years and thought I would always be a Braun user.  I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on the Panasonic razor when my Braun shaver finally died.  This razor gives a really close comfortable shave, it&#x27;s must faster, I don&#x27;t have to constantly buy cleaning solution and new foil/cutters every couple months.  Another nice feature is that I don&#x27;t have to clean up a mess on the bathroom counter every time I use this Panasonic razor.  I would definitely recommend this razor to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have many high end shavers. The quality if the shave outstanding with great ease and no facial burning. Blade shavers do not believe that an electric can shave close. The truth is some shave too close and cause skin burning from too close of a shave. A quality shave needs to have a balance - this one hits the mark - Close and comfortable, and fast.    I only wish they would go back to the induction chargers. They are those will pay the additional on a high end product.</li>
    <li> The best of the many recent wiz bang models I tried. The 4 blade thing really does cut faster and closer. And I don&#x27;t bother with all the prep work of lotion. No razor burn. Clean it dry for 2 or 3 shaves and then a soapy rinse under water gets any buildup. But using soap and water will dull the blades faster.    Pros:  Much lighter than the older inductively charged shavers.  4 blade foil cuts more and easier.  Holds its charge for many days.  Charges before I leave for work.  Under $100.    Cons:  Won&#x27;t work while charging.  Charging without a stand.(but there are more expensive models that do this.)  Cost of replacement blades and foils are high.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband to replace his old Panasonic shaver that he used over eight years. This new one is more pricy. But it works really well. The cut is close and clean. His face is very smooth after shaving. He loves it. He uses it dry most of the time.</li>
    <li> Have used various Norelco shavers all my life, except for a time with a Braun.  This Panasonic far outperforms them in comfort and closeness of shave.    Bought same for my grandson, whose face breaks out using other shavers.  He loves the Panasonic, because it does not cause the skin problem that other shavers do.</li>
    <li> I brought home Braun, Remmington razors but took them back almost immediately...I finally went to amazon and found  the Panasonic Arc IV Nano razor.  There is the difference of night and day.  Wet or dry it is fantastic.  Best Buy wanted $180.00 but I got it thru Amazon for 99.00.Great deal. The first time you use shaving cream with the electric razor is a hoot...Give it a try...you can always send it back if you don&#x27;t  like it!</li>
    <li> This razor is simply the best electric razor I have owned. My previous razor, a two year old Philips Norelco arcitec, while still functioning fine it is underpowered and unable to keep up with my shaving needs. With longer periods of time in-between shaving the arcitech lagged behind and would end up taking forever to shave while pulling way too many hairs.   The Panasonic Arc IV is a wonderful razor that was able to keep up with my shaving needs whether wet or dry. I am very happy with this purchase and plan on buying Panasonic from now on for all of my electric razor needs.</li>
    <li> Piece of art and beautiful color. Simple to use, charges well and in an hour. Easy to clean and wet and dry. BUT leaves hair in spite of repeat shave having to use razor...however, I am keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have always had sensitive skin, my neck particularly. Ever razor I&#x27;ve previously owned has irritated my neck and I&#x27;ve had to resort to using the pop-up trimmer to shave my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with this razor! The pop-up trimmer is not necessary for me. I consistently get very close shaves that leave me skin feeling fine. I keep waiting for the skin on my neck to start burning but it hasn&#x27;t happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaves are also extremely quick compared to what I&#x27;m used to. Two and half to three minutes and I&#x27;m done which for me is lightning fast. It also has a long lasting charge, right at 13-14 shaves per charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic shaver about 10 days now and I like it a lot.  It has a little timer on it so I can see that it takes only about a minute and a half to get a complete, close shave.  I&#x27;m an older guy with a light-average beard.  My only complaint is the location of the trimmer in the middle of the back of the shaver (not shown in the photos).  Hard to see what you&#x27;re doing in use.  OK for sideburns, but trimming a mustache would be very difficult as the trimmer would be hidden as you looked in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a loyal Braun user for 20-25 years.  I even replaced the batteries in my 7505 when they finally wore out.  The new batteries were weaker than the originals.  I read and read on all the current Braun models, but was overwhelmed by too many choices and high prices.  I decided to give this Panasonic a try at half the price of the top Braun and no sloppy liquid base to carry around while traveling.  I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
    <li> I will start this off with saying that I have a beard and only use this to touch up my neck, so I really don&#x27;t have much experience on how it works on your face.  So long as I go sideways on my neck I get a pretty close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I finally threw in the towel on baldness and just shaved my head and using a razor on my head that frequently wasn&#x27;t going to happen.  I&#x27;m still amazed to this day how well this works for a shaved head.  I can shave my head everyday without any sort of irritation.  I use it in the shower with Shave Secret oil and I can have my whole head shaved in under 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the battery went pretty quickly from about 5 shaves per charges to about 3.  That&#x27;s not really that big of a deal, though.</li>
    <li> I have been using it daily for over 4 years and it has proven itself to be reliable and very user friendly. I have the original heads/ battery still installed and both work very well. The only change I have made is removing the head cover to clean the blades, I found the blades can come off during the daily cleaning. I used a flexible glue and put enough to hold the bottom of the cutting heads to the clips. They have not accidentally come off in over 3 years and they function perfectly well.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! I used to buy Braun but they&#x27;ve started cutting corners on their cheaper shavers. I was pretty unhappy with my last one. This Panasonic got great marks in some recent reviews and costs a third of what a high end Braun does. Comfortable, gives a great shave and is reasonably priced. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8243A to shave my head on the fly between razor blade shaves.  Not as close as a lather and Schick shave, but good enough.</li>
    <li> this is a great razor i have had it for years works great cuts real close never have had a problem, now i need to order some new blades for it.</li>
    <li> Got it for my husband.  He says \\&quot;Exceeded expectations. Absolutely love the Nano.  Haven&#x27;t used a razor since I started using the Nano.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great price for great razor. Got it for my Dad for his bday &amp; he loves it!!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in about 10 years. I decided to try it out again, before they never impressed me much. I&#x27;ll have to say I really love this one! After reading other reviews, I decided to go with one with the higher rpm&#x27;s and 4 blades. No regrets. It actually gets closer that a straight razor, specially on my neck, right below my chin.</li>
    <li> Finally found a suitable replacement for my 10 year old Grundig German shaver. I&#x27;ve had it 2 years now and highly recommend for a good clean shave. I can get a satisfactory shave in 2 minutes. Replaced cutting blades after 1 year of daily shaves.  Good well designed flex head follows contours of my face. Works well wet or dry. Has a nice feature of reminding you to put a few drops of dishwasher detergent on the blades and by holding the on/ off switch down a few seconds, shaver completes cleaning the head in about 15 seconds.  Neat!</li>
    <li> This shaver lives up to all of its positive reviews and fulfilled all my expectations. Clean and smooth shave that&#x27;s extremely close to the skin. I have pretty sensitive skin and this product works great. Wish it had a different color option then dark navy blue.</li>
    <li> both my son and my dad have very sensitive skin so this is perfect for them</li>
    <li> works great.  A little disappointed with the cleaning or lack there of.  But I shave my whole head and I can get 3 shaves out of it before it needs recharging.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.  I am in the military and I have PT in the morning.  If I use a razor before a shower I get razor burn.  I use this in the morning and then after PT I shower and finish with a razor for a perfect face.  My razors last twice as long too.  Easy to clean, water proof, and great for on the go when you forget to shave.</li>
    <li> my  husband has a tough rough beard and he says he just loves it,. uses it every day. actually this is a man that hated shaving its quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;some days he shaves in the morning  and if we have an evening engagement he shaves again.  I like it to no more whisker burns. His cheeks are as smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
    <li> This shaver has broken twice since I purchased it less than 2 years ago.(it is still under warranty) For warranty service I sent it to Panasonic Exchange center in Mc Allen,TX at a cost of $12. The first time it broke at 10 months after purchase it took about a week to get a new one(I think).I of course had to buy a replacement shaver.( since most men have to shave daily). It broke again recently and another $12 to send it in.(only 11 months after getting a new one). After 3 weeks of hearing nothing I called yesterday and I was told there was a new policy of not keeping shavers there for exchange and they were waiting for a replacement to come in. I could not get a straight answer of when that would be.They refused to notify me by email or otherwise when it was shipped. Needless to say I voiced my dissatisfaction with their customer service which got me nothing. So I guess I need to call everyday to find out when I get MY shaver back? Add about $50 to the price of the shaver for shipping and a cheap replacement while yours is being fixed to get two years of use. I was also informed that when I get my replacement(if ever) the warranty on the replacement was only 90 days! (I guess that shows Panasonic&#x27;s confidence in their own product) I definitely would look for a different shaver!</li>
    <li> I can use it for about a week without recharging. (2.5-3 minutes a morning) I&#x27;ve never had a wet/dry razor before and it&#x27;s cool to be able to just wash it out in the sink. I haven&#x27;t tried using it in the shower or anything though. Does a good job on my stubble as long as you&#x27;re persistent and go each direction with it so you get all the hair that&#x27;s this way and that.</li>
    <li> Others have reviewed this item in great detail.  I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It runs hyper -fast&lt;br /&gt;-very quiet with a hypersonic type buzz&lt;br /&gt;-Made in Japan&lt;br /&gt;-Flexhead with lock feature&lt;br /&gt;-yes it has the flip up thingy in the back, not a slide up version&lt;br /&gt;- 5.4volt 1.2 amp charger</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my husband. He was skeptical at first, having used a razor for some time. He has dark coarse, fast growing facial hair. His concern was based on the razor smoothness and comparable results from the Panasonic Electric Shaver. After a week of use he would recommend the shaver for no more cuts, ease of use, and quick shaving. He said he gets a closer shave when used with soap and water.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I think I was expecting too much, you still have to go over the same spot several times, as with any electric, but the more I used this, the more I liked it. It gives a closer shave than my old Norelco in less time. The flexible head works good and is also lockable. The pop up trimmer works good. The charge lasts for multiple shaves, I can travel for several days and not even bring the charger. Plus it mows off pretty long stubble with out pulling. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Luxembourg and the shipping time was great and it was much cheaper on the US site than on the uk site even once I paid the import tax. So no grumbles from a price perspective. Product is good, it does what it says on the tin, shaves!</li>
    <li> Works well enough, but catches my beard alot if I don&#x27;t shave every day or two. But it is hard to fault the shaver. It was my first electric shaver, so I don&#x27;t know i that&#x27;s how they all work...</li>
    <li> I have a rough tough beard, and sensitive skin. I have finally found an electric razor. The Panasonic is easy to use, cuts baby close, and I can finally shave every day without irritation. No aftershave needed. Easy to clean. Charges quickly. A great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Second Panasonic shaver and works well. Gives nice shave. It is four head while first shaver was only 3 head. The current shaver seems quieter. It does not irritate my skim like other dielectric shavers have in the past..  Good choice as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver. I have had it for quite some time now and it still works well. I recently had to change the inner blades because they were not cutting as closely and as well as I wanted, and it works perfectly once again. I shave about 3-4 times a week and the battery still lasts about that amount of time. Charges very quickly. Easy to clean. I haven&#x27;t had a 3 headed shaver in a while, so I don&#x27;t remember the difference, but I like this shaver very much. Need to change the blades at least once on year depending on use.</li>
    <li> I needed to switch to an electric shaver after a hospital stay with 5 days beard growth.  I had tried an Norelco several years ago because of their money-back guarantee and it was in the return mail the next day after giving me a poor and uncomfortable shave.  So I was skeptical about trying an electric again.&lt;br /&gt;But what a surprise.  This Panasonic ES8243A removed that 5 day beard like nothing with no skin irritation, quickly, and left a shave comparable to my blade.  I should have done this earlier!!  I used it dry......Can&#x27;t see the need for a wet shave, but it will be interesting to see how well that works for curiosity&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;Also impressed with the info screen and one hour charging.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best performing products that I&#x27;ve purchased in a very long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, works great, travels great, after two years still love it, would like to be able to lock out the sideburn trimmer for knocking down the beard after not shaving for a while.  Really like the wet ability for days when running behind and cleaning.  Had a Norelco before, this does a much better job of getting my beard where it changes direction and lays down.</li>
    <li> have delicate skin but this shaves closely without the irritation of a traditional razor shave. easy to clean, holds a charge for a while.  Am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  That was the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  I LOVE that I won&#x27;t have to buy a cleaning solution for the blades!</li>
    <li> The shaver is great, take it in the shower with you the hot steam and a fog free mirror and you will get the closest shave possible. The shaver is smooth with no pull at all. Completely water proof shaving in the shower saves time and mess.</li>
    <li> I really like this Shaver! It has been my experience with this shaver, it holds charge for ten shaves for me. Nice trimmer attached, easy to clean and seems to stay sharp. Handy little carry case, nice LCD keeps you up to date.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and dreaded shaving.  No matter what razor, gel, cream or wash I sued my face would always get red from razor burn after I finished shaving.  Although this electric shaver did not completely eliminate my problem it did reduce the irritation considerably.  Also provides a pretty close shave.  I believe it to be an excellent value for the money and would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used mid-priced Braun razors for 25 years.  I never had a great shave, but could not see myself spending two hundred plus dollars for the top of the line Braun.  Needing a new razor I read many reviews and the Panasonic E8243A kept showing up with very positive reviews with a very reasonable price.  I decided to give it a try and am very glad I did.  My morning shave time is cut in half compared to a 5000 series Braun and my afternoon shadow arrives much later in the day.  Great razor, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The razor is nice, holds good charge, and has a nice LCD display to show discharge and run time on each shave. I have been using  high quality blades for a long time. Those blades lasted me at least a month each. yep, they are sharp, and very durable. I wanted to try an electric, and iI don&#x27;t think any electric can do what a good blade can do for a clean shave that feels clean as well as looks clean.  The two biggest complaints I have read about this shaver as both true. The first is technology based, and I trusted it was true even before I got it. LCD&#x27;s do not do well in heat, so being a wet and dry shaver presents a problem for guys who like hot showers.  The heat from the hot shower destroys the LCD display. It does not hurt the razor in any other way. the newest model of this is said to have gone back to LED displays.  LEDs do well in hot environments, but they are limited in what information that can give you.  This razor is very nice as far as the display goes, and charge time versus usable time.  The other complaint was that they do not supply a stand to allow the razor to be taken from the shower, or after rinsing in the sink and let it stand up to dry. Some wanted a ultraviolet disinfectant lit holder, but that would drive the cost up, and I could do without it. Just keep the razor clean.  I sometimes use the razor when I want a closer shave, but I use the electric first.  It does come with a travel zippered pouch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought five assorted models of Panasonic wet/dry shavers over the years, and they all have given me good shower shaves.  Why five?  The first lasted 4 years; the second three; and you get the picture.  The latest, this model, lasted only a year before the digital display went wacky, wacky to the point of being useless.  After two years, I had a similar problem with its predecessor.  In a headline: the quality of Panasonic wet/dry shavers has reduced to the point that they are now great throwaway razors.</li>
    <li> Excellant wet and dry shaver . It is easy to clean and easy to handle and when washing the foil it very easy.</li>
    <li> Battery life over stated.  I am getting 10- 2.5 minute shaves.  Good shaves, however.  I would not reccomend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Lasted for 2 years and 5 months now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does excellent job on the face when you don&#x27;t have a strong beard but poor job under the chin</li>
    <li> This thing actually does what it says it can do.  Closest shave I have ever experienced with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. Shaves his bald head with it and his head looks great.</li>
    <li> I shave both my head and my face, every day, dry (and only dry).  This razor gives me the closest non-blade shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten and I&#x27;ve been shaving my whole head for more than ten years now and my face for about 25 years.  I started out with a Remington foil razor (close as a blade or your money back); when I first shaved my head I moved to Norelco three blade razors and I&#x27;ve used three-blade Remingtons, Panasonics, and various Norelcos all of which I&#x27;ve been happy with, with the exception of the most recent Norelco/Philips which did not work and which was a huge, expensive pain to return (I&#x27;m still waiting for my money).  I&#x27;ve never used a better electric razor, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak to how well it would do with lather/wet but here is a summary of the pros and cons of using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really close, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to charge and to see how much charge is left.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes me a little longer than the three-circular-blade type.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t trap the hair quite as well and the cuts are finer so the hair gets scattered about a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Took some getting used to after a decade of using three-blade types--had to find the right method/pattern.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing well on my bumpy head (but it does!).&lt;br /&gt;Has to be cleaned every day (IMO--the instructions say you can wait until it tells you to clean it but I&#x27;ve found it drops less hair on me if I clean it every day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like more CONS than PROS but, really, seriously, the Cons are quibbles.  The fact that it shaves so closely really does outweigh everything else.</li>
    <li> somehow it doesnt shave at all, my good old machine is way better than this one, its a waste of money....</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shaver for my boyfriend.  He absolutely loves it! He always complains that he cuts himself with disposable razors, so I did my research and when I saw that this shaver had a lot of positive reviews, I purchased it.  He loves that he can&#x27;t cut himself and that it&#x27;s waterproof, so he can still shave in the shower.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone who is considering it.</li>
    <li> Husband thinks it the best &amp; it is water proof.  This is his third one-one for each house. Everyone we have purchased have just gotten better</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve owned every brand over the years and had settled on the German ones as giving the fastest best shave, and lasting more than a few years. I bought this one based on reviews and couldn&#x27;t believe how much better it was vrs any other shaver I had ever tried. Its been running strong for more than a year without issues. Buy it, you&#x27;ll never buy anything but Panasonic again.</li>
    <li> I shave everyday for that clean, neat look for the corporate jungle. I&#x27;ve been searching for a shaver that doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve tried conventional shavers, and philips and braun electric shavers in the past and they have always irritated my skin, which at times caused acne breakouts. This Panasonic shaver is gives such a close shave but it&#x27;s so gentle on my skin. If the one I had broke, I&#x27;ll most probably get the same one.</li>
    <li> This is a fine razor . . . but don&#x27;t buy it if you intend to use it to shave your head, as I did.  A couple of the reviews indicated that it was a good razor for that but it isn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t know what planet these guys are living on but when I used it (on this planet) on my head it didn&#x27;t do anything close to what a razor blade does.  TOTALLY UNSATISFACTORY FOR HEAD SHAVING!  But . . . why can&#x27;t someone make an electric razor for shaving men&#x27;s heads?  How hard can it  be?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOD</li>
    <li> Replaced a Braun 7550 with this razor. It works great, pretty quiet, and seems  to hold a charge pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though if you are using the razor to shave some delicate areas. The inner blades might catch the wrinkly bits and nick the skin. Just tilt it back and use the outer blades instead of the full face of the razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s $40 to replace the outer foil and it&#x27;s been only 4 months.  I joined the Razor Shave Club instead.</li>
    <li> The shave was a good close shave and when I was finished I could tell this was a quality product that was very satisfying and well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I found my teenager being a little hesitant to shave as frequently as he should be with a regular disposable razor. Since he is just learning what his beard is all about at this age, I thought I would do him the favor of adding this high tech option for him. He is happy as all get out. ;)</li>
    <li> I have had 4 electric razors before this one. I have only had it for one weeks worth of shaves.This by far has exceeded any idea of what an electric razor can do. It takes me less then 2 minutes to shave completely and my skin is baby soft.  I am still at 80% of full charge. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does with shaving gel. If you want a GREAT razor at a good price look no further..</li>
    <li> I have a very thick beard and have always had to resort to shaving with a blade.  Over the years, I have tried various electric razors without much success, including the Norelco rotary types.  They worked OK, but after just a few months, I needed to replace the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product daily for about a month and am favorably impressed, so far.  It comes close to the smooth shave of a razor and takes less than 3 min to accomplish the task.  My only skin prep is William&amp;#34;s Lectric shave.  Shaving the neck and under the jaw takes the most effort and time.  I can get about 10-12 shaves per charge and cleaning is a snap.......just run the foil and blades under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, it comes pretty darn close.  I would have liked to have had this product come with a stand in addition to the travel case.  So far, I am favorably impressed with the purchase and hope the blades live up to their 18 month time life.</li>
    <li> The good:  wet/dry functionality is nice.&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  very high pitched sound when operating...certainly can&#x27;t be discrete when using this device.&lt;br /&gt;The inconvenient:  when it&#x27;s out of &amp;#34;juice,&amp;#34; you&#x27;re just done for a while; the device will not operate on the power cord.&lt;br /&gt;The performance:  I have not discovered any closer shave then what cheaper models provide.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. Easy to clean. Close shave for an electric. The trimmer attachment on the back could be better though.</li>
    <li> It produces a very close shave, better than my previous Panasonic shaver. I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;4 heads&amp;#34; razor business. I can only see 2 blades system. The head is a little too big and obstruct the view of what I want to trim. I would probably not buy it again. There are cheaper models that may do as well.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on his head in the shower. It took a couple of days for his skin to get used to it, but he uses it every day and loves it.</li>
    <li> Ok before I bought this and I read the reviews good and bad ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets just as close as a blade. Yes it will take more than one pass, but even with a razor you cant get it on just one pass. I&#x27;ve always had to spend 15 min shaving before cause my facial hair grows in every direction possible. I prefer using it wet not dry found it did a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only day 1 and I&#x27;m in love</li>
    <li> You have to go over and over and over it so many time to cut. These are trash, really. I have had for over a year. Red flag is when they say, &amp;#34;It takes a month to work&amp;#34;. BS. Don&#x27;t get fooled.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for his birthay in June.  He LOVED it right out of the box and two months later he still thinks it&#x27;s awesome!! He has a heavy beard and sensitive skin and has had a hard time finding a shaver that will work for him.  This one seems to have the perfect combo of close shave without irritating his skin.</li>
    <li> Was between this and the Braun 790cc. This was almost half the price and reviewed just as well. I have in the past hated electric shavers. Not anymore. I love this shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a longtime wetshaver. I have sensitive acne prone skin that&#x27;s treated with topical medications. I also have a thick beard. As a result, it used to take me a long time to wetshave. I used to use an old fashioned italian barber&#x27;s shave cream that I lathered up in my hands, and used a Gillette Sensor XL. I lathered up twice, shaving once with the grain, and a second time across. I never shaved against the grain so despite my routine, a lot of hair on my cheek wouldn&#x27;t get cut short enough but I lived with it. For whatever reason, I decided to try electric. I was skeptical.     I started with the Braun Series 5 I got from Costco. Although the box said series five, I found out a few days later that it was actually the old 360 Complete in a Series 5 box. Anyway, after a couple of days the shave wasn&#x27;t bad. It was close enough to where I decided never to go back to wetshaving. I could shave in 2 minutes instead of 10! Plus it had the cool auto-clean system.     Well I read a few more reviews, and found that 99% of people preferred the Panasonic &#x27;Arc IV&#x27; over anything else. With nothing to lose, I bought the Panasonic and decided between the two, I&#x27;d return the weaker link. I really did NOT want to like the panasonic. It didn&#x27;t come with a cleaning stand, and above all, I couldn&#x27;t use it while plugged into the wall. Nevertheless, I tried the Panasonic this morning with a DRY shave, and decided I&#x27;m returning the Braun. The Panasonic cut CLOSER than I could get with my blade, with no burn (I had some slight skin sensitivity/discomfort after using the Braun 5). It was also much quicker. It curves around my jawline where the Braun would not (The Braun left enough hairs straggling to where my wife noticed them). I had to go at them with my blade. Not so with the Panasonic. I would say once every few days I&#x27;ll use the blade around the neck because no electric will do that well in that area.    I considered the Braun Series 7 but the Panasonic cost me $115 or so from Bed Bathand Beyond with their ubiquitous 20% off coupons ++plus a return policy that can&#x27;t be beat---no limit to when you can return. So if this thing craps out, guess where it&#x27;s going back to for an exchange?    Bottom Line: despite a major boneheaded design flaw (can&#x27;t use while plugged in) this thing makes up for it with the quality of the shave. When comparing to a traditional wetshave with a blade going with and across the grain, the Panasonic will be the same if not marginally closer. Nothing will cut closer than a blade going against the grain, though, but do you really need to go that close and get bumps?    As far as the cleaning stand, I&#x27;ll order one from Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this electric razor for two months.  It is without doubt the best I have ever used.  One gets a close shave without nicks and cuts; it&#x27;s fast and easy to use.  At first I was a little uncomfortable using water to clean the razor, but my trepidation was quickly dispelled by the efficiency of the cleaning cycle.  The only suggestion I would make to Panasonic regarding this excellent razor is to consider making the trimmer a little smaller.  In this way, it would be easier to trim my mustache.  The current trimmer makes that process more complicated.  Thank you Panasonic for an excellent razor.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun (Synchro) and Norelco (Arcitec) shavers for the last few years and haven&#x27;t tried a Panasonic for at least 10 years. I always liked the Panasonic Linear shavers except for their battery life.  This one is a bit better with respect to battery life getting about 12-14 shaves per charge where past experience would have me charging at least once a week.    The most noticeable difference between this shaver and the others is the speed. It takes less time to get a good shave with this razor than with any other razor I have tried. It shaves as close as any other but most times I can shave in under 3 minutes even after a full weekend&#x27;s growth. The Norelco Arcitec in contrast takes me over 6 minutes of going over and over my beard to get a full shave.    The Norelco&#x27;s battery life is at least 3 to 4 times the Panasonic, going over a month between charges. This is little consolation when spending more than twice as much time shaving.    All in all this Arc IV is the best shave I have tried to date. My time (especially in the morning before work) is very valuable to me and this razor shave close, fast and without the irritation of going over and over the same areas.</li>
    <li> Update  October 1st, 20010- second time I am shipping razor to repair center. First go round; shaver (3 months old)) display and functions erratic, turned on and off on its own. Repair center never acknowledges receipt of razor, no viable e-mail or phone contact for status. Razor returned 5 weeks later, working with no communication enclosed at all.  Four months later (razor now 10 months old) entire unit  dies completely, I ship razor back to repair center limbo and wait for its return.  Terrible customer service and product quality, works  well when it is functioning which is infrequent.    I bought this shaver as a result of the recommendations posted on Amazon. I was tired of paying Gillette a small fortune for blades. I must admit that the first week my shaves were less than close and I was skeptical about the manufacturers advise to wait for my face and beard to adapt. I have owned the shaver for 30+ days; the shaves improved as time went on (maybe I just learned how to use the device better)but IT IS NOT as close as a blade shave. The big advantage is speed and lower use cost, I will recoup my investment in a little less than a year. I tried using the shaver \\&quot;dry\\&quot; with very bad results and find it works best with a thin layer of good soap on my face and frequent rinsing of the razor. I shave in the shower and clean-up is easy, it holds a charge for a week with each shave lasting ~3 minutes. It charges quickly and is compact for travel even if  you bring along the charger. It would be nice if the charger was mini USB but it is unique to the device. Do not be confused by the various models of Panasonic with comparable features; shop by price and use the comparison chart published by Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about 3 weeks.  The shaver is much quieter than my older triple foil Remington.    The Panasonic also gives a very close shave.  In the past I had to go over my beard about 3-5 times, now only twice.  The digital timer is an interesting feature.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my shaving time is cut in half and that I had very few problems with skin irritation.  This is one product that really is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the second review of this magnificent razor.The first I wrote after a short while, now I &#x27;ve had it for a while and my thoughts are the same. I had norelco top of the lihne for thirty years with a brief stop at braun. This one right out of the box gave the perfect shave and ahas continued to do so wet or dry(I do dry except weekends).What I am adding here is how well it does the neck. No more regular razor touch up and I have a tough beard!Easy cleaning too.[[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue]]update at 9 mos the cleaning button became difficult to work. so I&#x27;ve gojne back to Norelco</li>
    <li> I have had electric for 35 years.  My last one was a Braun and while it was a reliable good razor this Panasonic beats it.  I like that I can take it in the shower and it is fast and easy to clean.  It might be a touch closer of a shave than my Braun but both are good.  What I really like is that it is FAST and that the stubble stays in the razor and not all over the counter.      Great Razor</li>
    <li> Have used wet with shaving cream, without shaving cream, and dry. I got a close shave every time.  I recommend this shaver for everybody.</li>
    <li> I got this after reading the reviews here. I have had it for three or four months, using it daily.    It&#x27;s fine. However, previously I was using the power version of the Gilette Fusion.    The Gillette Fusion is    Faster    Lighter    Cheaper    Less trouble    and does at least as good a job.    So, I&#x27;m going back to it, at least for an extended test.    I haven&#x27;t used the Fusion AT ALL since I bought this, so I think I&#x27;ve given it a fair test.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used that truly does shave as close as a blade.      I have used several in the past with mixed results.  This is far superior to anything I&#x27;ve ever used previously as it shaves close and it is fast!  I can obtain a completely satisfactorily dry shave in about two minutes.  Working up a decent lather takes almost that long and always required two or three additional latherings and shaves to achieve a totally smooth job with any blade I&#x27;ve ever tried.      This is a great product; I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for twenty years. This is the third shaver I&#x27;ve had and it is the best. Ive had it for three weeks and the more I use it the better I like it. The other shavers I&#x27;ve had have been rotary shavers and they cannot compare to this one. It gives a much closer shave without irrating the skin. It is easier to clean and recharges in less than an hour. It seems to run at the same rpms when it has 20% charge left as it does at 100%. It was awkward to hold the first few times I used it but now it is like 2nd nature.I am completely satisified with it and would buy it again and reccomend it to anyone that is thinking about getting a shaver. This shaver was listed at 198.00 at the panasonic web site and I purchased it at Amazon for 119.00 no tax and free shipping.One of the best deals I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  And it charges so fast and lets you know the status while it&#x27;s charging</li>
    <li> I was strictly a double edge razor user (try to find those at your local retail store--you can&#x27;t!) until I had a bout with neck cancer two years ago and the doctor said to use electric for a number of reasons. Got a Norelco and it was so-so.    Bought this based on reviews and it is 1000% better. Will not go back...</li>
    <li> After two weeks using this shaver, I truly love it.  It is the best shaver that I have ever had.  It is a wet/dry shaver, and as a dry shaver it is very good, but wet your face and add some shaving cream and it becomes spectalular.  The smoothest shave I have ever had short of having a barber use a straight razor on me (if they still do that). It is fast, very close, and all this without any razor burn.</li>
    <li> This is a great wet/dry shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver can not be used while charging.  This is a huge negative for me.  Second after about a year of use, a chunk of the screen fell out making shaving painful.  Replacement screens and blades are silly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nanotech blades?  Gives me a vision of millions of micro robots running around my face eating hair.  I guess that would be MEMStech.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get a clean shave from this. I have gone back to blades until I figure out how to get a clean shave</li>
    <li> I had another Panasonic, the Panasonic ES8249S, for 7 or more years. It finally broke after I dropped it and had to be replaced. I tried a cheaper shaver, the Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver, but was unhappy with it. I ordered this shaver because it is virtually identical to the ES8249S. The only real difference is that this shaver does not come with the vortex cleaning system. NOTE: If you want to replace a Panasonic ES8249S with the hope that this shaver will work in the Vortex cleaning pod, the metal contacts are missing, so there&#x27;s no way I can see to make contact with the sensors. The 3 &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; on the back (not shown in the pic) are covered with plastic on this unit and have no exposed metal for contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit shaves as well as my old Panasonic, but it&#x27;s quieter. It also shaves much closer than the Braun. It would have been great if it worked with the old Vortex pod, but it wasn&#x27;t really supposed to. So no complaints.</li>
    <li> this  shaver  work  great</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  Closest shave ever!  Better than any other razor or blade that I have used.  Use with Edge shave cream for best results.  Shave in the show or tub.</li>
    <li> It provides a closer shave than my Norelco.  So far I am very pleased with the ease of cleaning it and the shave it delivers.</li>
    <li> a top quality product! Exceptional shave. Long lasting charge. Easy clean up and very well made.</li>
    <li> my previous panasonic razor might have been 10 years old, maybe more. i wanted the same one but it was no longer was in production. this was very close though. i am very pleased with the shave it gives. even after a few days of not shaving, it will still cut good.</li>
    <li> My first electric razor and I like it</li>
    <li> If you have a friend that travels a lot this is certainly one of the best gift ideas you can get them. The reviews are spot on. I&#x27;ve also googled best electric razor and this panasonic appears on every list as best in value. Many reviews point out key features like &amp;#34;shaves like a blade&amp;#34; &amp;#34;okay to use wet or in the shower&amp;#34; &amp;#34;good for sensitive skin&amp;#34; if you ever used an electric razor you would understand that these features are often advertised but rarely delivered by electric razors. My friend has stubborn facial hair, very sensitive skin, and is always on the go. He was very surprised when the panasonic delivered an awesome close shave like a blade, with no razor burn or irritation. Now I hear him using it everyday. No more 10:00, 2:00, and five o clock shadows for him. He also was amazed at how easy it was to use and clean while in the shower. Based on how happy he was and. Onto use to be I would highly recommend you buy this for a good friend, coworker, or husband.</li>
    <li> Most shavers (electric, razor, you name it) give me red marks or they don&#x27;t shave my neckbeard well. This does. Battery life is great (5-6 shaves at least), though it loses charge if not used for a week or so. It can be used in the shower or at the sink, whatever. Very easy to clean with running water and hand soap. Don&#x27;t buy a bunch of cheap shavers that don&#x27;t work - just buy one that does and it&#x27;ll be cheaper in the long term.</li>
    <li> Purchased for Christmas present for myself :)&lt;br /&gt;Nice and smooth. Shaving time much less than used to be. Fit to face, chin and cheek pretty well. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great shaver! Before I purchased this razor I was only able to shave about every three days. What can I say, I have always had sensitive skin, but this razor is amazing! I can shave every day! Not that I do, but I could if I wanted to.  I cannot say enough positive things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, its design is very Quad friendly.</li>
    <li> Very good products, good quality, very fast delivery speed, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> To begin  on a positive note charged well but as for shaving terrible I bought it for my son he&#x27;s 18 yr old young man not much hair on his face I thought it would be great shaver instead of him using Mach 3 blade guess what your better off with Mach 3 it&#x27;s half price of this shaver &amp; worked great I was disappointed its Panasonic a brand I would trust  don&#x27;t spend the money get the Mach3 it&#x27;s excellent</li>
    <li> Does a great job without the irritation. Provides a smooth and cut free shave. I am happy that I bought this item</li>
    <li> Great! Best shave ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use on the weekends.  It does a pretty good job of getting a close shave, and works well for trimming his neck between hair cuts.</li>
    <li> I used my son&#x27;s, this Summer and had to have one of my own!  I found the best deals to be had, was on Amazon...it&#x27;s a great shaver!!</li>
    <li> This shaver gives me a good shave, and I like the waterproof build of Panasonic shavers.  However, there is one thing missing that makes this shaver unacceptable to me.  The shaver does not come with any kind of stand or holder, so what do you do with a wet shaver?  If you leave it on a shelf, or in a medicine cabinet, it could be damaged easily (an odd shape for laying around).  If you install the protective cap, will it dry?  All of my other shavers have come with stands, or holders.  I will look at other models.</li>
    <li> Quality of the product and the material is super. And for the first time using the machine for the first time, but advancing my face when I got used to irritate. The only downside is cutting hard after a 2-day beard. Süper.Şarjı quickly running out for the day for me will be shaved. This device is a super price. I would not recommend any other brand :))ES8243A</li>
    <li> Performed up to expectations. Shave was almost as good as blade razor but did not.last as long. Good for quickie shave or for doing out for short time. Have not yet tried wet mode.&lt;br /&gt;Was better than my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really shave as closely as I would have hoped. It&#x27;s OK, but not great</li>
    <li> Leaves spots. Hardly shaves at all. The thing good about it is it&#x27;s life of the battery. Shaving abilities sucked.</li>
    <li> Bought as a present for my husband.  Researched all the reviews and this one looked the best.  Turned out to be exactly as described.  Postage was super fast and arrived on time.  Only disappointment was that it came with an American plug which&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting, fortunately, I had a spare adaptor.</li>
    <li> I bought the ES8243A to replace a seven year old model. The older model still works fine, I just wanted to upgrade to the newer technology. After the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it I&#x27;m very pleased. It seems to shave closer and faster, holds a charge longer, charges faster, and is a little more quite. I also like the pivoting head that my older model did not have.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun before, but the Panasonic is much better.  It is easy to clean, shaves well, and holds its charge for a sufficient time.  The only complaint is the high cost of replacement screen/blades, but that applies to all brands.</li>
    <li> Best and closest shave I have gotten from any of my former razors.  Light weight and easy to handle while shaving.  Cleans easy.</li>
    <li> This replaced my Norelco of about 3 years that needed new cutters. The replacement cost for new cutters was almost as much as a new shaver of the same model.  I thought I would give a screen type a try.  No regrets the Panasonic Arc IV Nano is a great improvement.  The lithium battery goes from 10% to full charge in about an hour. It shaves much faster, which means I make fewer passes, fewer passes means less irritation.  It also gives a closer, smother shave.</li>
    <li> My previous razor was the Norelco 7735X Cool Skin. I had 2 of them, and liked them ok; they were relatively inexpensive, but the battery dies after about 16 months, no matter how careful I was to charge it for only the manufacturer-recommended 8 hours or less. I though the shave was fine, but not that close, and there were often stray hairs left on my neck despite trying pretty hard to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arc IV is a _much_ better shave. The charge indicator is very nice, as is the timer, so you know how long your shave took! My cheeks are a lot smoother than they ever were with the Norelco. And my neck is virtually hair-free. Don&#x27;t expect any miracles -- you still have to work at the shave to get all the hair, and pull your skin this way and that. But in 4-5 minutes, I get a great shave that I&#x27;m quite happy with. I really like shaving in the shower with a good low-foam shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer is very easy to use. I didn&#x27;t think I would bother with it, but it was pretty handy to trim my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated over the price before I ordered this, but I&#x27;m glad I took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**:&lt;br /&gt;The display breaks easily if you drop the razor. I keep the razor in a shower caddy, and I&#x27;ve gone through two of these: After just one fall, the display was rendered completely unreadable. I think the product should be sturdier than that. I&#x27;ve dropped an iPhone from similar heights (accidentally!) and had no damage at all. I&#x27;m docking 1 star from my original review because it&#x27;s so fragile.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I switched from a Braun 7540(3 of them over a 4 year period...too many repairs, virbrations, etc.) to a panasonic 8077. It shaved as close as the Braun, no vibrations or repairs or anything for the past 3 years except a very close shave with no irritations. The linear motion cannot be compared to any of the standard battery configurations. It really does hold a full powered charge to the end....it does not weaken as it is being used.  After reading about the Panasonic 8243A with the 4 blades and Arc(convex)shaped foils, I decided to see if the claims were true.  They were. It shaves even closer (didn&#x27;t think it was possible)than the 8077. By the way, I am in early 60&#x27;s, my beard grows quite wiry, dense, and in several directions. The shaver handles it all very easily, even after not shaving for a day or two.  I would recommend any linear Panasonic to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my Norelco 6885XL rotary razor. This is also my first foil razor. I enjoyed the ease of the shave. Yes, the neck area took longer as usual, but if you don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to go over it a few times, use a blade! Overall a pretty good shave. Quicker than my Norelco. I shave only about twice a week so I&#x27;ll see how fast the hairs grow back using this foil compared to my rotary. As a side note, I&#x27;ve noticed throughout my life using an electric razor my hair grew back at a MUCH slower pace than if I used my blade. Not sure if all people are like this, but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m able to shave only twice a week.    But what really stood out was the fact that when I was done, my face &amp; neck didn&#x27;t burn like it did after my Norelco shave. I&#x27;d have to splash cold water and then use a cooling aftershave balm and even then it still burned a little. With this Panasonic, my face felt 90% less razor burn after my 4 minute shave (3 minutes on the neck--LOL!) and just a little cool water did the trick. I heard people say your face takes time to get use to any new razor. Not me. Switched from rotary to a foil and didn&#x27;t feel any major difference. Shaves a lot nicer than my rotary; didn&#x27;t pull at all.    Plus, the deal I found on Amazon a couple weeks ago was outstanding. I was Googling this razor to find a good deal and a couple sites showed it for $79.99. They were actually links to Amazon. I thought OK, you have to sign up for Amazon prime to get the 30% discount but no---the price at the final step was actually $79.99!! What a great deal! It&#x27;s not advertised; not even on the product page, so I suggest you search around and maybe you&#x27;ll get as lucky as I did and end up getting a great deal here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic wet dry shaver.  The ES8243A is much quieter than my old panasonic which is nice.  Very close shave.  Can handle several days growth without any trouble.  One charge has been good for about two weeks of shaves so far.  Only negative is it seems a little plasticky.  Whereas my old Panasnic had a metal head this one is plastic.  Other than that, top marks!</li>
    <li> This shaver is by far the best I have ever used. I have sensitive skin and had a Braun series 5 for a couple years and thought it was nice, but after trying the Panasonic it is no contest. The Panasonic is quieter, faster, and shaves closer. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face is! Clean up is awesome.....just a little soap and water and you are done. I use it dry, but it can be used wet.</li>
    <li> My husband just got this because his old electric razor (a Norelco) gave out on him. Well, he&#x27;s had it for two days and he absolutely loves it. Here&#x27;s a synopsis of what he told me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Much closer shave than his old Norelco&lt;br /&gt;2) Get&#x27;s a clean shave in less than half the time&lt;br /&gt;3) Doesn&#x27;t leave pesky individual hairs on his neck&lt;br /&gt;4) The wet/dry function allows him to use shaving cream which helps with the closer, cleaner shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His only gripes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The shaver is very loud&lt;br /&gt;2) Takes a while to get the shaving cream out of the razor when rinsing it</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver so far!I use it wet and it works as well as my Fusion blades plus it won&#x27;t be as expensive as those damn blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall a great buy!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I had written an excellent review of this electric shaver, but I now take it back. It sucks! Without warning about two months ago, the shaver just stopped working -- just completely stopped. I thought it was the battery, so I unplugged it overnight. When I plugged it in the next morning, the unit showed the battery had a 100-percent charge. I dug out the warranty card -- two years. I e-mailed Panasonic, and I got a b.s. automated reply telling me that my shaver only has a one-year warranty. I have the documentation that it&#x27;s two years! Shortly after I bought the shaver, by the way, I also got a brand-new Panasonic TV that had bad parts right from the factory. What this shows me is that Panasonic has quality issues. I&#x27;ll have Panasonic fix their crummy shaver before the two-year warranty expires, but I now avoid the brand.    After the shaver died, I bought a Norelco -- they are much more reliable.</li>
    <li> I used Braun shavers for years, but the quality of their lower-end shavers has declined considerably in recent years so I decided to switch brands.  This Panasonic provides a much closer shave than any Braun I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean and even tells you when it&#x27;s time for that.  My only complaints are that it doesn&#x27;t hold its charge for very long, you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (so you have to make sure, each time, that there&#x27;s enough charge left to do the job), and the carrying case for the shaver has no room for the bulky power cord so you have to store that somewhere else.  All in all, a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in September, primary to trim my chin beard and mustache. It was never very good at beard trimming but was pretty good for shaving.  After about 3 months it just stopped working. I wasted over $100. I would not purchase this again but would buy something else.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this razor. It charges very quickly,gives a close shave in about 4 minutes and is very easy to clean. It is also light in weight and less noisy than my old shaver. All in all I would say I am quite pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic razor for a few weeks now and I like the razor.  I was using a Norelco Spectra for a few years but finding replacement blades wasn&#x27;t easy anymore.  Anyways, this razor seems to cut closer although my previous razors blades were dull.  One thing that I do like about it is that you can shave in the shower.  I have tried shaving out of the shower and it does a good job also, but the blades/foil do get hot since they do move very quickly.  Panasonic advertises this razor as a 1 pass shaver.  I&#x27;d say it takes at least 3 passes to get a close shave.  They also say it takes 3 minutes to shave.  I have finished in 3 minutes when I was in a hurry and it does do a decent job in that time.  But for those who want a really close shave it takes around 5 minutes to do a proper job.  The trimmer is of good quality also.  At about 5 minutes a shave you get about 10 shaves per charge.  There is a charge indicator that tells keeps you advised to how much power is left.  The batteries are li-ion and you can charge them whenever without fear of shortening the life prematurely.  After looking at and using this razor for a while I think that the 2 main blades do most of the cutting so the 3 blade foil/razor probably is more than adequate to do the same job.  The 2 inner blades don&#x27;t look like they do much but I haven&#x27;t tried using the lower priced models to tell for sure.  Over all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I think I&#x27;ll be buying a Panasonic razor again as long as I get a good few years use out of this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers exclusively for the last 20 years. Mostly the triple rotary head Norelco shavers. When my last Norelco shaver&#x27;s battery died, I was going to buy the latest triple rotary head model.  I went to amazon like I usually do for most of my stuff and saw the Panasonic ES8243A and read the customer reviews.  The reviews were so good that I hesitantly ordered a ES8243A hoping that I wasn&#x27;t making a mistake by switching from a triple head rotary form factor to the ES8243A form factor.    After using the ES8243A for two weeks in dry mode (I always shaved in dry mode) I&#x27;m so very pleased with this shaver. In fact I love this shaver.  It shaves closer and faster than all of my previous Norelcos and is comparable to a blade.  The cutting heads vibrate so fast that is more like a fast hum than a vibration so is a pleasure to use.  This model has 4 rows of cutting heads.  The two outer rows are the foil cutters and the two inner rows have openings that differ from each other. The entire head assembly is spring loaded to allow the optimum pressure on the face, not too soft, not too hard.  But the head assembly can be locked if you prefer a stationary head.    The rounded edges on all four sides make the shaving very comfortable no matter what angle or direction the shaver is moved. I plan to buy some gel or other liquid to see how wet shaving feels like, but I&#x27;ll probably just continue with dry shaving since it&#x27;s fast and what I&#x27;m used to.    I highly recommend this shaver.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry if you buy one.  I&#x27;m really happy that I decided to take a chance and switch from triple head rotary to this shaver. I love this shaver so much that I felt compelled to post a review in spite of the large number of positive reviews already posted.</li>
    <li> I have never found an electric razor that can give my heavy beard the close shave that I would like to have.  I had been using a Remington MS3 1000 for a long time and thought the Panasonic might be better but so far it has been about the same.  I have tried blades but they don&#x27;t treat my skin very well and are more expensive.  I will keep the Panasonic in hopes that it will be satisfactory over time.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I owned a Panasonic linear motor shaver 5 years ago, then switched to Norelco and now switched back to Panasonic. I love the ease of shave, floating heads, and almost everything about this shaver - except the trimmer, which is kinda small. Overall great product and 100% worth the money.</li>
    <li> Before I decided to purchase this shaver, I read all the reviews on Amazon and I was pleased to see all the very positive reviews. So, I jumped on it. I like the fact that this shaver gives me a very close shave. However, in order to get this close shave, it takes me at least 20 minutes and not the \\&quot;advertised\\&quot; 3-5 minutes. But the real problem I have with this shaver is that the foil and blades (I have submitted a separate review on this) only last 2-3 months. Beyond this time frame, I start to get cuts on my face. That&#x27;s pretty disgusting in my opinion. This also becomes quite an expense since these things are by no means cheap. I have yet to try wet shaving and perhaps I will get close shaves in much less time and hopefully the cutters and foil will last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving electric since I was 16 and this is my fourth electric shaver.  I believe I can provide a unique perspective since my first three were one each of the three major brands, as follows:    1.  Braun - Paid: $80. Duration: eight years. Demise: battery.  Shave: decent, not great but it was also 1989 when I bought it (it was a single foil).  Build quality: amazing, a brick, solid.    2. Panasonic (can&#x27;t recall model, but it was a mid-upper model, I think it was a three blade). Paid: $70. Duration: five years. Demise: foil (didn&#x27;t replace since cost was about 1/2 a new shaver).  Shave: dry-excellent wet-unbelievably close.  Build quality: good overall, but excellent in that it was truly water proof.  This was a true winner.  I loved this shaver.  One might question the duration but I also took it to three continents on multiple trips, it had a hard life.    and for some reason I ventured away from Panasonic to buy a Norelco...    3. Norelco 6891XL. Paid: $95. Duration: seven and a half years.  Demise: foil (again, almost 8-yrs old, didn&#x27;t want to drop $35 on new blades, etc).  Shave: mediocre - I always struggled getting a decent shave from this razor, I pretty much hated it from day one wishing I bought another panasonic.  Build: Very good.  Not bad, but not impressive.    So given my experience, I decided to repurchase a Panasonic, the ES8243a.  Paid: $75 (ebay NIB).  I am in disbelief as to how good this shaver is.  Yes, there&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect shaver (no such thing as a one pass shaver on the neck), but it&#x27;s amazingly good.  And it&#x27;s as good as a dry shaver as my first Panasonic used as a wet shaver.  I haven&#x27;t tried this one as a wet shaver at this time.  The raise clippers are about average but do the job (i.e., trimming gotee or what have you).  With minor technique, you can edge hair lines (side burns, gotee, etc) quite well.  It could use a stand, would be handy on the counter, but not a big deal.  This really is an impressive razor.I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I stopped using electric razors about four years ago because of the irritation it was causing on my face and the inability to achieve a nice close shave. I recently decided to research to try an electric razor again and my criteria was simply an affordable razor that gave a close shave without irritation. I also refused to buy an electric razor that was going to require me to spend more money for cartridges to maintain it. After about one week of shaving with this razor I found it hard to find very much difference between a shave with this and my straight razor and cleaning is as simple as a little soap and water.     I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase and I would suggest this razor to anyone who is looking for a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Several months ago I began a quest to find the best electric razor under about $150. I had a Norelco and it was pretty good, but for some reason I started to get very particular about the closeness of the shave, which, frankly, is odd for me, because I&#x27;ve never been very good at maintaining a clean shave. However, using an electric razor is kind of fun compared to a blade.   First I tried the highest end Norelco. I was suprised that actually it was no better than the mid range Norelco. One thing to say about the Norelcos is that they are exceedingly quiet. I shaved with this in a hotel room while my toddler was sleeping and she didn&#x27;t even stir. But it didn&#x27;t get that close, especially on the neck. And over time, it started to make my skin feel raw after using it, much like after using a dry blade.   I decided to try a foil type electric. I got a Braun 370. I immediately noticed that it gave a closer shave. It was slightly louder than the Norelcos. But the shave still wasn&#x27;t perfect. I had to go over and over the same areas and ultimately couldn&#x27;t get a perfectly clean shave. Everyone I talked to said a really clean shave is impossible with an electric, but I wanted to keep trying. One thing about the Braun is that of the three brands I tried, the clipper on the back (long hair trimmer) was by far the best. The thing was like a laser. It cut very well.   Finally, I got this razor, after reading Consumer Reports and lots and lots of reviews. Actually, Consumer Reports gave the highest award to the top of the line Braun, which is also much more expensive than this Panasonic, so I can&#x27;t say how that razor might compare to this one. But the Panasonic was a close second. When I first tried the Panasonic I knew immediately that it was the best razor I&#x27;d tried so far, in terms of the closeness of the cut. It is actually possible with this razor for me to get a completely clean shave -- to rub my hand up and down my cheek and neck, in all directions, and not feel any stubble! Previously only a blade could do that. Mind you, to achieve that with this razor does take quite a few passes, and you have to learn how to pull your skin to get those tricky hairs, but it can be accomplished in about 3 minutes or less.   As for the wet shaving thing, eh... as far as I can tell it&#x27;s mostly a gimmick. I can understand if you&#x27;re taking a shower, you could save time shaving while you&#x27;re in there, but why would you bother to use shaving cream? It just obscures the job. To me, the point of having an electric is that you can do it without having to lather up your face. I did try it once with shaving cream, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work any better, and possibly worked slightly less well.   The long hair clipper is ok. Not wonderful like on the Braun, and a bit short - would be handy if it were a little easier to see.  Like the digital screen too. It&#x27;s the most useful of the three razors.   Not easy with this razor to get close to my mustache/goatee. Some reviewer said something like it&#x27;s more like a lawnmower than a weed trimmer, and that&#x27;s true. The margin of my facial hair has become slightly less clean because of this.   However, it&#x27;s still my favorite electric razor ever.</li>
    <li> This razor definitely gave me the best shave of any other brand I have tried. It is expensive - but it performs!</li>
    <li> A well constructed and designed shaver.   It provides a smooth an comfortable shave</li>
    <li> So far, I am enjoying the Panasonic razor very much.  I especially like it when I&#x27;ve been working outside, and therefore perspiring.  I use lather; get a good shave that feels good.  I&#x27;m still in the transition stage from my long-term using of Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> Just used it on four days of neck beard. First thoughts: wow this thing is loud. It emits a high pitched whine.   Otherwise, the shave is good. It cuts close and leaves very little irritation, but (on a dry shave at least) didnt  pick up every hair exactly. Some hairs I ran the shaver over like ten times and it didn&#x27;t catch it.  Efficient and cheaper than a Braun, but the king of shavers this is not. Temper your excitement people, a step up this may be  but don&#x27;t believe all the hype.     Now I personally hate reviews that leave me unsure, so let me say: buy if you need a step up from a Norelco. If you have  a Braun you love, save your money.</li>
    <li> Just bought the panasonic es8243a yesterday.  It was on sale from $150 to $100 at Bed, Bath, Beyond (last one they had too...)  I have been shaving my head w a razor now for over 4 years and was tired of the whole time-consuming process.  I was using the fusion blades which are excellent razors, but wanted a quicker easier process.  Ive tried an old remington (three wheel kind) and it tore up my neck, front and the back.  This wonderful blue ES8243 wet/dry shaver works great.  I can do my head, face, and it does great on the neck w/o making it raw, red and inflamed.  This is great, this is the bees knees item 9.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor over a year and am on my 4th unit.  The first razor never shaved very well and the screen died w/in about 6 months.  The second one didn&#x27;t shave many spots on my face after repeated attempts &amp; was sent back w/ a note requesting either a refund, or an upgraded model (I volunteered to pay the difference), but was sent the same unit again.  After spending weeks trying to get someone in customer service to correctly send me a shipping label as they promised, I shipped the 3rd unit back.  After waiting 3 weeks, they shipped me the exact same model number AGAIN!  I&#x27;ve always bought Norelco units over the past 15 years and never had an issue w/ the units like this.  I guess spending more on something doesn&#x27;t always get you a better product....</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver because of the overwhelming total number of reviews on Amazon. Figured so many people bought it for a reason and they were right. This is a great product. Replaced my old Braun. This unit is easy to use and maintain, and it provides a quick, close shave.</li>
    <li> I hate traditional shaving especially the foaming up of your face part. I was hoping this is going to be no different than how the traditional blades slides on the skin. Not only that you have to go back and forth to get every hair, push hard down on your skin to make sure no spot is left the end result is not as smooth a shave as you get from the traditional shaving method. It was hard to even get all the spots under the chin towards your neck. Last but not least, I had reaction (not sure from what probably hair follicle infection) on my skin with visible reddish spots.    I am a big fan of Panasonic products but this is not for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, well made, no irritation, much better than my old Norelco in terms of closeness and works equally well wet or dry.  Charges VERY fast and charge lasts about 5-7 shaves.  Only wish it had a charging cradle to rest it in to keep the sink more organized.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver to shave my head and it is as close as a razor.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It does a good job, but not as close as a razor, but it is faster.  Battery last two weeks plus!  Best with cool water and not hot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Still holds up.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive, requires annual replacements of the foil (which is costly) plus irritates my facial skin. Please see my review of the Norelco PT730. I&#x27;d strongly recommend the Norelco instead.</li>
    <li> My husband would have no other razor. He loves shaving while showering. Panasonic razors give him a good close shave and use shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and gives a clean shave.</li>
    <li> No complaints it works well.  This is my third company and I think Panasonic does it best.  Brand N never got very close.  Brand B was pricy but the unit seemed to lose close shave after 3 or 4 months.  I have the counter part to this shaver with the cleaning stand.  I got this shaver to put into my travel kit as I am on the road half the time.  I like how it cleans up with water and a drop of soap.  The newest panasonic shavers are almost double but I don;t think they really provide twice as good of a shave.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality. My husband loves it, gives a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Because of the price, I decided to try this modern day electric shaver after years of giving up on the ones in the past. My beard is really tough to cut. I was surprised at how fast this one would whittle it down. I can still feel sand paper when I rub my face, but it looks good enough in the mirror for a 5 minute shave.  The instructions said wait till after a month for closer shaves.  I guess the wiskers have to become trained to the way the shaver cuts. Anyway, quick and easy .. that&#x27;s what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last that well. Won&#x27;t run while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;Does deal with longer hair reasonable well.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try because my old Philips rotary 3 needed new blades, and wanted to get a waterproof for in-shower.&lt;br /&gt;Ulitmately peferred that much older model for ease of use and equality of effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for two weeks but I&#x27;m impressed. The first 2-3 shaves were disappointing and I almost sent it right back. I know they say it takes weeks or a month for your face to adapt but I wasn&#x27;t hopeful about this working out the first few tries. But, then something changed - maybe I got better at using it - maybe my face adapted. I&#x27;m not sure but I like this thing and it really is about as close to a blade shave as I can imagine. So, I&#x27;m a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was probably just technique and I needed more practice time. Anyway, this is the first electric I&#x27;ve used in 20 years and I&#x27;m impressed. I wanted to try an electric out for travel. It&#x27;s a winner and I recommend.</li>
    <li> This is something that is better bought new rather than just replacing the blades and foils.  Not much more money to buy the whole thing new at about one years intervals.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.</li>
    <li> Works great, this is second one I have had</li>
    <li> Solid, easy to clean, shaves great, the trimmer is good. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for quite some time now. The blades and the screen are still the ones that came with it. I really need to replace them, but the shaver still works great.</li>
    <li> I hoped this would be an improvement to my old elector shaver. What a disappointment. The blades are abrasive and do not cut very well. I believe this is due to the lack of angles the blades are able to achieve. Some parts of the face are difficult to shave without leaving the skin raw. Such a waste of time and money here.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver, I shave my head with this every 1-2 days, it doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation, shave extremely close, not razor close, but close, cleans up with a quick rinse, and last 3-4 shaves before requiring a charge.</li>
    <li> I found it good but takes a few passes to get a smooth finish. I use it as a travel item or if I&#x27;m stuck in the mornings as my skin is too sensitive to wet shave everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also when you use it when wet it is very difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion you&#x27;re better off having this as a travel item or as a stop gap between proper wet shaves and using it dry rather than a substitute for proper wet blade shaves.</li>
    <li> Best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had in the last 20 plus years of shaving. I&#x27;ve recently been having issue with my blade razor (use quality ones that are very expensive to buy) that have resulted in razor bumps around my jaw and neck line. This was never the case before, but has been an ongoing problem over the last couple of months during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shaved with this razor once and can already tell a difference with how my skin feels after shaving. There is no burning or tugging from this appliance and I found it very quick and efficient to use.  Based on my limited experience with use, I feel this razor can give as close a shave as the blade razor that I was using and feel that it will ultimately produce better results at a cheaper cost. I shaved \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with a small amount of shave cream. If you&#x27;re looking for something based on skin issues created by blade shaving, I&#x27;d suggest this and feel it is well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to update after the 30 day period that you&#x27;re to allow for with respect to changing shaving methods, but expect that I&#x27;ll be even happier at that point.</li>
    <li> I have always used rotary shavers and decided to buy this. After 7 months of use, I am disappointed with this product. The trimmer has quit working. On the shaving front it does go at a great pace compared to Braun rotary Shavers. However, it does not give me a close shave, especially in the neck area. Luckily, I still have my rotary Braun shave that I purchased for $20 and does a bang up clean up job after I run through with the Panasonic. The only problem with the Braun is that it is slow, Will probably plunk more money and get a faster rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day.  He is 91  and he never used a electric shaver before.  We thought we better get rid of the razor blades..</li>
    <li> Best razor foe the price!</li>
    <li> Shaver arrived on time and does a great job - better than the Panasonic it replaced.  Especially appreciated the quick response in shipping as old shaver quit at inopportune time (but I used it for many years).  I&#x27;ve use wet electric shave for a long time and recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but Panasonic has other 4 and 5 blade shavers that put this one to shame.  I guess I am spoiled.  I think Panasonic is the best as far as shavers go... I have been using them for over 30 years.  I will keep this one but maybe spend more on the next one to get a better one!</li>
    <li> A great shaver with a choice between wet or dry in or out of the shower. I love it yeah</li>
    <li> My Norelco wasn&#x27;t cutting it, so I looked into Panasonic .I glad I did. Best shaver I have ever had. shaving couldn&#x27; be closer or more comfortable. I would recommend this razor to anyone</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this over a year ago and loved it. I bought the same one for my father for Father&#x27;s Day. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic Shaver.  They get better with each generation.  This one gives the best shave yet.  I like the battery status monitor.</li>
    <li> This razor is pretty awesome although my skin is still getting used to it. It does not shave as clean as a straight razor but pretty close if you dry shave. If you wet shave, it shaves as close as a straight edge. The only issue I have is that you have to figure out the direction to move depending on where you are shaving or it does not seem to shave at all. For instance, down on chin works but I have to shave backwards and sideways on my neck before it catches the whiskers. Aside from that, it is a solid and advanced little machine.....almost futuristic. Hopefully after a month of shaving, I&#x27;ll figure out how to get my entire face clean shaved.</li>
    <li> Nothing&#x27;s perfect which is why this gets a 4 from me. I also am being cautious because I&#x27;ve only had this for barely a month. So far it holds a charge excellently and is so simple to clean it&#x27;s childish. I shave somewhat unconsciously now, multi-tasking, at odd times during the day, usually at my desk, at home. Is that a plus or a minus? Mindless self-grooming?   The shave, as many have noted, is less precise than a razor but acceptable (at least for me). And now, when I do use a razor on some occasions, the experience is pleasurable, a change in sensations...mindful grooming at its best.</li>
    <li> best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. works great every time no matter how long my scruff is. I always break out when I shave to much but it hasn&#x27;t happened since I bought it, 2 months.</li>
    <li> I been using norelco 3 head razors for 20+ years now. this is my first foil razor, its the best i have ever used period. less irration on the neck... the wet feature is great also never had a wet shave before.. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great razor...</li>
    <li> I almost NEVER write a review of ANY product on Amazon or anywhere else, but having used this razor just a couple of days, I had to write.  I have been using electric shavers all my adult life (I&#x27;m 53) and always had left over stubble (not visible, just a \\&quot;high grit sandpaper\\&quot; feel) that I thought was just the price of convenience.  As my old Braun started failing to hold a charge for more than about three shaves, plus the rubber on the side was separating, I shopped Amazon for new electrics.  I saw a Norelco video on one of their products which we bought for our son (he&#x27;s a rotary guy), and the guy was using shaving cream and talked about getting a closer shave, etc.  I had heard about \\&quot;wet\\&quot; electric shavers and thought \\&quot;what&#x27;s the use\\&quot; since again, I was concerned more over convenience, and dry electric seemed the best option, especially since I didn&#x27;t think there would be much difference.    Reading the reviews, I narrowed my choices down to the Panasonic ES8103 and the newer Panasonic ES 8243A (Arc IV Nano).  After checking out a couple of other review sites, I opted to spring for the extra $20 to get the Arc IV Nano.  I used it dry the first two days and was very pleased.  I still found just a little \\&quot;sandpaper\\&quot; feel in spots (mainly neck), but still WAY better results than any electric I&#x27;d ever used, and frankly better than most blade shaves as well.      This morning, I decided to try out the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; approach with Nivea shaving cream.  WHOA!  No sandpaper feel AT ALL - ANYWHERE!  I have NEVER had a shave like this!  I didn&#x27;t know a shave this close was possible.  When I shave with a regular blade, I virtually always come away bleeding, and even then, had \\&quot;sandpaper\\&quot; spots.  Seven or eight hours later, it still feels better than it ever felt RIGHT AFTER I had shaved.  This is incredible.    The \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave technique may actually help shorten the time - certainly not take longer - since I can see clearly where I&#x27;ve shaved without constantly running my left hand all over my face to feel where I haven&#x27;t shaved.  Cleaning is easy as well.  If it takes me an extra minute or two, it will be well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several other brands and styles of electric shaver and recently I&#x27;ve switched to the Gillette Fusion razor, but nothing has compared to the Arc IV Nano. This is the closest and smoothest shave that I ever had bar none. It is also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My beard grows in all directions, and all too often laying pretty flat against my skin. My previous Braun shaver just didn&#x27;t get those, so I&#x27;d use the Braun to get the first 80% and a Mach-III blade to get close and catch the bunch that the electric missed. Yes, two shaves each morning.    I asked Santa for this Panasonic after reading other reviews, and in hopes of getting a close shave in one try.  I can&#x27;t be happier, and can hardly believe that an electric razor can actually shave so close.    The special blades that pick-up the hairs laying flat works great.   I&#x27;ve tried it dry (pre-shower) and wet after stepping out of the shower, and while it performs well dry, my best shave is wet using Billy Jealousy Hydroplane Shave Cream. The combo is nothing short of amazing.  I get NO shaver irritation, a nice clean shave, and my face feels great.    While it&#x27;s not *quite* as close as that of a straight blade razor, no electric can do that with the mesh between cutting blades and your face, this Panasonic gets as close, well closer, than I thought possible.    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor that shaves nice and close. I got it for my husband for Christmas. He hasn&#x27;t used it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; yet. It holds a charge for several days. Super fast shipping from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was one of those that got suckered into using the latest and greatest leading-brand razor with the EXPENSIVE refills that would last me no more than a week before have to change the blade. I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors in the past, but nothing really worked on my beard that has to be shaved every day.  That is until I tried this Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV. I had always shaved in the shower and desperately wanted to try an electric wet/dry razor. So after working out how much money I would be saving yearly on disposable blades I decided to part with my hard earned money to give this one a try. I am glad to say that it&#x27;s been a year and a half now and just getting to where I need to replace the foil and blade. I use it almost EVERY day so I would say that I&#x27;ve definitely got my money&#x27;s worth already! All I do at the end of my shower is take a bar of Dove soap, glide it across my face and then shave. The soap helps glide the razor across the face and I can&#x27;t believe how close of a shave it give&#x27;s me. I have never had this close a shave with an electric razor before. The charge lasts at least a week, maybe a bit longer, even when I use it every day. When it&#x27;s time to recharge it, it finishes very quickly... maybe an hour. The razor also doesn&#x27;t start to \\&quot;wind\\&quot; down near the end of the charge either, which sometimes can be a pain if I let it go to long before charging since it will just quit on ya. Usually you can still get another 30 seconds or so out of it by turning it back on after it stops. But that is the only negative thing I can say about this thing. It is very durable. I&#x27;ve dropped it several times in the shower and still works.  However, the last time I did drop it, it must have hit to tub just right and now the lcd screen is jumbled and it is difficult sometimes to make out what % of charge is left. Oh well, that&#x27;s about par for my clumsiness though.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and are tired of being ripped off buying disposable blades, then I recommend you give this shaver a try.  I like it because I can use it with lather, in the shower, or if I am in a hurry, use it dry. I like this model because it can be cleaned with a little liquid soap, after a dry shave, and you do not have to buy any cleaning cartridges. My previous electric shaver was a Braun. I would not go back to the Braun.  This shaver is a great product and a good value.</li>
    <li> Been using this for almost a month now. I got it to replace my old Braun 3612 razor. I&#x27;ve used two different Brauns for probably 20 years and generally liked them, but had to work at getting a good shave. For example, I could only use the Braun for a few days before needing to shave with a blade because there were places it would miss no matter what I did. Plus, if I missed a day (which happened frequently) the Braun would take a lot of work to handle the 2 days&#x27; growth. I liked the Panasonic immediately--it was quiet and it gave me a good shave from day one (no \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period for my face). It was easy to clean. Unlike the Braun, whose screen could be irritating to my skin, it felt very smooth on my face--and left my face very smooth--and felt good in my hand. After using it for several days straight I looked for the telltale \\&quot;always miss\\&quot; spots that my Braun would leave. Instead of several spots, I found only one, and it was quickly and easily addressed. I&#x27;ve so enjoyed using this shaver that I&#x27;ve rarely missed a day, but on a few occasions it handled 2 days&#x27; growth nicely. And after one long weekend it even handled 4 days&#x27; growth very nicely.    On the downside, it sometimes vibrates strangely (and loudly) after having replaced the cover, even sometimes when I&#x27;ve carefully and firmly snapped everything back in place. But then it goes back to normal. This is why I&#x27;m giving it only 4 stars. Also, I was puzzled by how, in the pictorial instructions for cleaning the razor, they get so much foam from a little bit of hand soap. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re assuming you&#x27;ve used it wet and already have water inside the head to begin with.  I shall have to try wet shaving with it sometime just for the experience.    Bottom line, this is a great razor so far (1 month). It surpasses my old Braun in every criteria.</li>
    <li> Simply put, the best electric razor i have ever owned.  I searched around on the internet and the reviews for this razor were all good.  And those reviews did not let me down.  Best part, it&#x27;s not the most expensive but it&#x27;s definitely the best.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been around since before there were cell phones and been shaving since 16.  Blades, then Braun razors then back to blades, then latest version of Braun, then razor stubble, then blades, then the hell with it just grow a beard then keep beard for 13 years, then shave and back the most expensive Braun I could find. Drop out of rat race for a while, move to Costa Rica, start jeep safari business, not shaving is part of the gig, love it. Get back into Corp America so have to start shaving again.  So buy electric razor.    For those of you that have been away from electric razor advances like I had, you will be AMAZED! Sounds like an ad but the damn thing shaves as close as my Gillette Mach 3 Turbo - and I used to blade shave against the grain!  This Panasonic razor shaves close and it shaves fast. No razor stubble and I&#x27;ve had the thing for about a month now.  Cleaning?  Just pop off top and shake it out and blow a bit - takes 45 seconds and anyone can do it.      Not sure of the latest Braun&#x27;s which I almost bought - but this thing does the job BETTER than advertised. And I thought Japanese engineers wouldn&#x27;t know how to design such a decent product since they don&#x27;t have tough beards. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Replaces my 6 year old Panasonic. Impressed with the closeness of the shave with just light pressure. I like how quiet it is. Once in a while if I don&#x27;t shave for 3 days it will have trouble with some of the long hairs but I think any razor does.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for almost a month now and it works like it should.  There is a \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period for you face to get used to the device.  I switched from a Norelco rotary shaver and am very glad I did.  I recommend this product for the function and the value.</li>
    <li> This is still my favorite razor.  I have changed blades 2 times, but otherwise I have used it almost daily for 2.5 years.  Battery is still fine.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers since I was 15 and have a very heavy beard and somewhat sensitive skin.  Past shavers included Remington, Braun, Sunbeam, Norelco and others.  None of them are as good as my new Panasonic.  It zooms through my beard, even with several days growth to remove.  I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot again and again to get all the stray hairs or ones going in odd directions.  In 50 years, this is the BEST shave I ever got, and it only takes me about 3 minutes for a terrific shave.</li>
    <li> Got this as a birthday present for my husband.  He says the shave is much nicer than any other electric razor he has used.</li>
    <li> Ive been an electric shaver user for 20 years now and I was very impressed with this product. Over all those years Ive essentially only owned the Norelco rotation shavers and every time I bought a new one, I really felt that the shave wasnt any closer with the newer technology.     I shave my head too, so put this Panasonic to the test. First thing I did was shave my head (I felt I could get a more accurate sensation of the closeness)as close as I could, with my Norelco triple head, then went over it with my new Panasonic. The difference was very obvious and I could hear it shaving the hair the Norelco could not get to and left me with a much closer shave. This is about as good as it gets in comparison to an actual blade and am extremely happy.</li>
    <li> I liked this electric razor more than any other I&#x27;ve tried. Granted, that&#x27;s not saying much because I&#x27;ve never found one that I like much...until this one. Good job, Panasonic. I much prefer using it wet with shaving soap on my face, and the moving parts rinse out easily.</li>
    <li> This is kind of funny writing a review about a shaver. None the less there could be a few people out there really wanting to put their money to better use than buying the expensive razor blades and having razor burn from them. This beast gives a REALLY REALLY close shave! Dont be fooled by stupid amazon picture. In real life the razor is really well put together and on the back it has a little beard trimmer that works very well. For people that are not use to shaving with electric razors your skin might get a little irritated but that will soon go away. A good companion with this razor would be afta shave or electric shave balm.  It only takes about 1hr to charge. Overall im really happy i finally bought this. Highly recommend buying from amazon because everywhere else does sell this for $200.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for just over a month, and so far it&#x27;s lived up to my expectations. I&#x27;ve always been a blade user, so the shave isn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;m used too, but acceptable. It&#x27;s convenient, easy to clean, and does what I expected.Don&#x27;t know how durable this razor will be, but it should last for years.</li>
    <li> This razor is light, cuts very close and cleans very easily.  I have only ever used electric and this is the best I have ever owned in 32 years of shaving.  It does not  shave completely in one pass but then again, I never believed it or any other electric razor could but it does do a great job in fewer passes than I am used to.  Only complaint is that the one/off switch is right where my thumb rests so I accidentaly turn off the razor once or twice per shave.   Digital read out is nice and makes sure I charge it in time.  It also tells me when it&#x27;s time to clean it.</li>
    <li> My experience with this shaver has been the absolute worse. I wasn&#x27;t one of the lucky customers who got really great shaves and wrote glowing reviews, unfortunately. If you have fine/sensitive skin, especially under the chin/neck, this shaver will mutilate you! Not a close shave at all either. Didn&#x27;t see a difference between shaving wet or dry. Same bad result. I&#x27;ve written to Panasonic about it, but I don&#x27;t expect any redeeming response. I&#x27;m back to using the trusted traditional razors.  This is a great example of BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES8243A Nano Mens Wet/Dry Rechargeable shaver gave a close shave.  It is loud but was comfortable to use.   I used other electric shavers in the past.  I would say I would recommend this shaver to my friends</li>
    <li> Been using a Remington MS2-390 and the screen went bad. Rather than buy a screen and blades I usually get new. The Remingtons have always given me a close and fast shave but have often been difficult to clean, the blades fall off, sometimes getting dinged. I&#x27;ve had Brauns in the past but eventually figured out that they don&#x27;t shave near as close or fast. Accordingly I researched razors and this one has excellent reviews. I can see why, it shaves as close and fast as a Remington without the noise and easy to clean. The first day I shaved 1/2 of my face with the Remington and the other 1/2 with the Panasonic and couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in speed or closeness. The Panasonice ArcIV is as quiet as a Braun, which isn&#x27;t critical to me but nice and gives a fast, close shave. It&#x27;s also comfortable to hold securely and holds a charge good for 7-10 shaves. Probably the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.    To clean it you wet the head, rub a drop of soap on the screens with your finger, hold ON for a couple seconds and it goes to Turbo mode, let it run for 10 seconds and then rinse for about 10 seconds. Clean as a whistle! This thing operates at a very high speed, turbo is even higher and they say that&#x27;s why it cleans so well and easy. Very cool.    The only thing that I dislike a bit is that it won&#x27;t run while charging so if you accidentally run it all the way down and aren&#x27;t finished you need to wait a few minutes for it to get a quick charge so that you can finish.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. I was please with the quality of the shave. I have never used this brand before and was very happy with how smooth it shaved.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for about six months now. I transitioned from those expensive disposable multi-blade razors... At first it was rough, I have a very thick beard that grows quickly. The manual states that you can shave in 3 minutes using this shaver. At first that was not possible, but as I have gotten used to shaver and learned how to use it I can shave in 3 to 4 minutes (there is a time display in the unit, very nice!). I do have to shave daily to accomplish this though. If I skip a day or two it is more like 5 minutes.  The battery life has been great. I would readily take this shaver fully charged on a short business trip with no worries about bringing the charger.  I find that the quickest shave is dry. I have used it with water or even shaving cream. I would not recommend the shaving cream, but with water seems to make things smoother and was necessary when I was first getting used to it.  Cleaning is simple and the display informs you when it is needed.  I would agree that it does take about a month to get used to, don&#x27;t give up though! I love it now and have absolutely no plans of going back. I would happily buy another and I have probably already made up my cost when compared to the major brand disposables.</li>
    <li> To start off with, I am in my 60s, so this is not my first electric shaver.  It is however the first electric shaver that I have ever liked, no, loved.  I bought it primarily because it is easy to clean.  My last shaver required a cleaning station and special liquids and was a real pain.  It also never actually cleaned very well either.  With this shaver you just put a little liquid soapon the head, turn it on and put it under a running facet.  Easy.  Takes about 20 seconds and competely clean.  What I did not expect was the quality of the shave.  With my old shavers I always finished with a wet safety razor to get a close shave.  This it the first shaver I have ever used that gave me a closer shave than a safety razor.  I have read that there is sometimes a problem with the display going dead.  If it does, I will buy another.  I love it.</li>
    <li> i have 2 teenage boys who have just started shaving...and they have the dreaded teenage acne skin...this razor is very gentle on their skin but also gives a nice close shave....no shaving irritation afterwards either....very easy to clean as well</li>
    <li> Shaving wet or dry (I prefer wet-in the shower) with this razor is really a pleasure.   I use some Kiss my Face shaving cream and that helps, but haven&#x27;t tried anything else yet - since that works so well (a little is all that&#x27;s needed).   I remove the shaving outer screen and rinse the blades and screen after each use.   I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now.   I got used to it right away, switching from a safety razor.  In past, I tried Norelco razor (about 8-10 years ago) again after a long gap between trying electric razors prior.  Other razors (Norelco, and a Braun)  irritated my face and I gave up on each after about three months.  This razor holds a charge pretty well (five to six days for me).  Prior to this Panasonic electric razor, I  shaved with the Gillette latest high-end razor, but that scraped me up too and it just wasn&#x27;t pleasant no matter what shaving cream I used (I tried many).   I&#x27;m hoping this will last a long time and I&#x27;m willing to replace blades and outer screen in a year if I need to.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: almost two years later (2.5 total ownership years) I still use this regularly and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  My one major complaint is that shortly after my last review water got inside the display circuitry, causing all of its lights to be on or off pretty much at random (or sometimes even halfway in between being on and off).  This is after normal use, and is a pretty big issue for a device that&#x27;s supposed to be used in your shower - so I&#x27;m changing my review from 5 to 4 stars.  I can&#x27;t tell if I need new blades, or if the unit needs washing, or even how much power is left; I just have to sort of guess.  Nonetheless the unit has otherwise functioned quite well, and continues to shave and self-clean without issue.  I have only needed to replace the foil once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always used disposable straight edge razor blades before I bought this.  I  hated it it so much I was always scruffy, shaving once every few days or less.  There would always be a mess in the sink, it would take 20 minutes, and even going very slowly I would get all sorts of cuts.  I tried different blades, different shaving creme, everything; no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my ES8243 last August.  I take it into the shower every day; there&#x27;s no cleanup!  No shaving creme needed!  I think it has cut me once the entire year.  It did take a lot longer than claimed to shave at first, but I&#x27;ve got it down to five minutes - the trick for people used to straight edge is that you have to go back and forth pretty quickly (but not pressing hard) in a way that would bloody your face with a normal shaver.  The shave is far closer than I have ever been able to manage with a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, I think it&#x27;s cheaper.  I was worried I&#x27;d need new blades after 3 months.  The \\&quot;replace blades\\&quot; signal has only just come on after 11 months of use.  As such, it was better to pay the $100 or so up front for this, than to keep buying new straight edge blades every few weeks.</li>
    <li> Have used electric shavers for over 60 years, and this is, without a doubt, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It shaves closer and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any neck hairs. Used Braun for many years and was reasonably satisfied until the latest model I bought which was not as good as previous ones.  That is why I decided to try a different brand. I&#x27;m glad I did. I shave dry.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If you want a really close shave, stick with blades.  Pimply face that gets shredded by blades?  Electric is a face-saver.    This razor works fine, but still can&#x27;t match a blade.  These people that suggest \\&quot;one pass\\&quot; efficiency have been smoking whisker dust.  I&#x27;m likely the poster child for using electric.  I&#x27;m light-haired with a fairly light beard, but even still I&#x27;ve got to make multiple passes to get a close shave.  Average shave time 3 to 4 minutes      On the other hand, dry shaving can be convenient.  And not having to belt a bath towel to your face after some errant &#x27;blading&#x27; is definitely a plus.  All in all a nice razor for convenience, safety, and close-enough shaving,  but if you&#x27;ve got to come with your \\&quot;A\\&quot; game I&#x27;d advise going with the blade.</li>
    <li> I started using this shaver 8 months ago and today I noticed a hole in the foil. I am using Panasonic shavers for years and in all other shavers foils lasted much longer. The foil for this product is pretty expensive too ($35). I would recommend while considering this product factoring in a frequent foil replacement cost. With an exception of the mentioned above issue I am happy with shaver&#x27;s performance overall.</li>
    <li> I normally dont write a review, but this product requires one. For the first 3-4 months this has been  the best shaver i have had. close shave easy cleaning. Now for the bad, After 3 - 4 months the quality of shave degrades quickly,in fact, right now, the cutter has become so dull that it barely is able to shave. I have never had a shaver degrade this fast. ive owned norelco, braun, and remington, There cutters and foils dont degrade as fast as this panasonic. Also, the foil does not latch to the main body like the beginning. This makes cleaning a big pain in the ##@. Now, i could replace both, cutter and foil. but im not going to start and pay 40-45 every 3 to 4 months to maintain this shaver, the ugly. i plan to replace this with a braun or norelco.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned.  After over forty years of various models of Braun shavers I switched to this shaver.  This Panasonic shaver is technologically superior to other shavers and is also less costly to operate and maintain.</li>
    <li> I have been using this model for about seven months so far, after using various Gillette razors for many years. My face was covered in blood during the first use because I pressed too hard. After I adjusted my approach and I became accustomed (after a few uses) and merely &amp;#34;rubbed&amp;#34; the foil head against my face in various directions, I end up with a near-perfect shave every time, with relatively low effort. I have extremely sensitive skin and this leaves virtually no irritation. This is easily one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> Well packaged and quick response. Good Product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good shave, comfortable, quiet, excellent battery life, easy to clean.  My husband has been using this for 15 months now and still loves it.</li>
    <li> Quiet. Holds long charge.  Gives close shave.  Can be used wet or dry.  Easy to clean.  Have no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Shaves closer than my Norelco but takes longer</li>
    <li> The lightest touch on the skin ever.....and a very good shave</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT....I have had other Panasonic shaver and this one is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Super easy to clean, no buying special stuff to wash this razor, simple apply some soap turn it on till the soap has worked itself in to a nice lather and then rinse. Gives him a super smooth shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked at quite a few shavers and tested several of them.  The fact is, for the price and performance, I find Panasonic foil shavers serve my needs best.  Electric will never be as close as a blade razor but this style is easiest on my neck.  Most others will irritate my neck to point of red blotches.  The ES8243A is quieter than my previous Panasonic and the battery life is quite good so far.  I&#x27;ve gone about 2 weeks between charges.  With the LCD readout there are no surprises when the shaver needs charging.  Cleanup is easy by rinsing under water.  I occasionally go for the wet shave with gel foam, but really either dry or wet provides a pretty good shave.  The head is rather bulky but it is manageable.  My shaver came with a decent pouch for travel, something not always included on the lower end razors.</li>
    <li> Really nice shaver. My husband seems to really like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor every single day for 5 months now!  I use it to maintain a baldy.  Absoulutely no issues and cuts close everytime!  I highly recommend this razor for face and head!!</li>
    <li> Excellent close shave for when you&#x27;re too lazy to get the blade out or you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
    <li> Husband likes it so far.</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8243A Electric Shaver Wet/Dry almost five years ago and it is still going strong. I was initially hesitant to spend so much on a shaver when there are many other cheaper options, but I feel like I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth. Was recently on a trip and the battery lasted the entire 11 days and then a day or two after I got home which I consider good considering how many charging cycles it has been through.  I find that it provides a close shave, and I periodically use the trimmer as well. I don&#x27;t use it as a wet shaver so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it performs that way.  I&#x27;ve replaced the blades and foil once in the five years although they recommend that they be replaced yearly, and the shaver provides a short reminder once a year.  Maybe next year I&#x27;ll replace the blades and foil again.  All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with the shaver.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my husband and he loves it. The shaver was easy to charge and use. I highly recommend this shaver</li>
    <li> Super close shave and easy to clean.  I bought one, had it stolen in Barcelona, Spain, bought a new one when I got home, and bought one for my 89 year old Dad.  Dad and I are delighted with the performance and I imagine the thief in Barcelona is as well.</li>
    <li> I have had Braun shavers for years.  When it came time to buy a new razor, I thought I would try something new.  I did some research, and decided on this Panasonic.  I have had this shaver for about 9 months.  I wanted to give it a fair eval before I posted a review.  The bottom line is, this razor shaves close, but it takes forever to shave and get that close shave.  I have tried all kinds of pre shave lotions, powders and balms and it still didn&#x27;t help.  I ended up giving the razor to my son and went back to the Braun system.  I gave it 4 stars because it works good.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  My son loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old and have been mostly a blade shaver.  I&#x27;ve tried a few electric razors over the years, but none have given me a close enough shave to give up the blade.  This Panansonic Arc 4 has changed that.  I&#x27;ve given up the blade and am totally satisfied with this razor.  The shave is close and comfortable.  I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 10 days and have only used it \\&quot;dry\\&quot;, but plan to try it out in the shower soon.  I&#x27;m using the Afta Pre-Electric before and the other Afta lotion after I shave and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  If you are looking for a really great electric razor, I&#x27;d sure recommend this one.  I&#x27;m also happy with it being a Panasonic as I&#x27;ve had good reliability and success with other Panasonic products over the years.</li>
    <li> I was able to get a close shave everytime, the only downside is that a lot of excesss hair falls out of the case somewhere and i get hair everywhere. but the presion side was useful and I would buy another if this one were to ever fail.</li>
    <li> I love this electric shaver. I have very sensitive skin so regular razors and most low end electric shavers irritate my skin. This thing is the best though. I barely feel it going across my skin and it cuts very close. With two passes you get just as close as a regular razor. Battery life is good, I get 10 full shaves per charge. The screen that tells you how long the shave was, how much battery you have left, when it needs to be washed, and others, is also a cool feature.</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old and have owned quite a few shavers in my day, and this shaver does a better job by far then any other previous shaver. Its small and comfortable to use. Its easy to clean, its not noisey and most of all it does a great job and i felt the price was resonable. The digital screen is also very imformative.</li>
    <li> Oh boy , the amount of time that it took me to make a decision.... i was tired of using cartridges for shaving and just didnt enjoy it at all, it was more of a chore and i wanted to enjoy shaving, more importantly enjoy the result. After watching a thousand videos on youtube i came to the conclusion that a foil shaver would be the way to go if youre looking for closeness in shave which im assuming everyone is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, i wanted a shaver that could shave in the shower and use it wet incase i wanted to use it with shaving cream, which i wanted. The final came down between the braun series 7 and this, the braun is not a wet shaver and also i came across a few reviews which didnt rate it too highly, finally got this and im so glad, its so close i dont know how people can even say that it doesnt shave as close as a razor, in my opinion it shaves closer!! i dont feel a thing, where as with the razor i had to shave with the grain, sideways and against the grain to get the same result as this... i will admit that it takes getting used to as my skin was red the first time i used it and a couple of times after as well which is why i recommend using it with shaving cream as it isnt too harsh on the skin and your skin wont be as red..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this shaver and would recommend it anyone, so easy to shave now in the shower at your own pace and in peace...</li>
    <li> Wasted a lot of money on this crap, it only works if you hardly have any beard. You need a regular razor or a trimmer and then use this at the end, does not replace a razor.</li>
    <li> Had an older 3 head.  This blows that one away.  Super smooth shave.  Charge lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s a wet/dry product.  I have not tried it in the shower.  Super easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Highly rated and good value. Shaves very well and this is my first experience with an electric shaver. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I just switched from a DE razor (Merkur Classic, Israeli Personna blades) to electric, and bought both the Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D 1250X and the Panasonic ES8243A. I&#x27;ve spent a few weeks with both, and here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the &amp;#34;try it for 3 weeks&amp;#34; thing is REAL. The first two weeks were terrible. Shaves were not close, I had irritation, redness and ingrown hairs. I tried shaving wet and dry, with similar results. Then, miraculously, halfway through Week 3, everything cleared up. Once that happened, the electric shaves were closer than my DE (or closer than I was willing to go with my DE).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For background: my beard is fairly thick, and has a few regions that grow in different directions. The hair on my neck is all over the place. My hair is straight and black, my skin is brown and rather delicate, and I used to shave 2-3 times a week because it would take 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to compare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness: both shavers are closer than doing a single with-the-grain pass of a DE razor. The Panasonic was noticeably (to the touch) closer on my face and chin, and the Norelco was possibly slightly closer on my jawline and neck. Both shavers also miss the same areas, creating consistently longer zones into two spots on my neck. My wife says she doesn&#x27;t notice, but I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed: average shave time with Panasonic was 4&#x27;15&amp;#34;. Average shave time with Norelco was 5&#x27;30&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number of passes: on straight surfaces, the Panasonic needed just a few passes to cover the area. On curved areas, the Panasonic needed a lot of angling and back and forth, but it was a precise operation. The Norelco always needed a long random walk with lots and lots of passes, I think because the ratio of cutting surface to contact surface is much lower. The one exception is that flat-lying hairs would get picked up more quickly by the Norelco (though they wouldn&#x27;t get cut as short).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: both were very comfortable to shave with. After the 3-week adjustment, both caused no irritation or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup: easy on both. Though average cleanup time was about 0&#x27;40&amp;#34; with the Panasonic, and 0&#x27;30&amp;#34; with the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coolness: The Norelco is SO COOL. It looks amazing, and feels like robot kisses when you shave with it. The Panasonic is not beautiful, and the Black/Orange display screams &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34;. The Norelco is a gadget, while the Panasonic is just a tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: current pricing and coupons at the time I bought these put them pretty close together. $100 for the 1250X, and $85 for the 8243A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I love the Norelco so much. It is so, so cool. But it takes an extra minute, and is not quite as close. So I&#x27;m returning the Norelco and keeping the Panasonic. I have agonized over this decision way more than I intended, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s over. I also have to shout out to Philips customer service. Getting an RMA number was really easy and took less than 5 minutes.o shave with. After the 3-week adjustment, both caused no irritation or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup: easy on both. Though average cleanup time was about 0&#x27;40&amp;#34; with the Panasonic, and 0&#x27;30&amp;#34; with the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coolness: The Norelco is SO COOL. It looks amazing, and feels like robot kisses when you shave with it. The Panasonic is not beautiful, and the Black/Orange display screams &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34;.

It is so, so cool. But it takes an extra minute, and is not quite as close. So I&#x27;m returning the Norelco and keeping the Panasonic. I have agonized over this decision way more than I intended, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s over. I also have to shout out to Philips customer service. Getting an RMA number was really easy and took less than 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I had the last version of this razor that had fewer blades and it was very good but not always close. I got this one thinking more blades equal closer shave. It was a little better initially but not spectacular. But then after using Panasonic shavers for over a year I decided to finally follow the directions and press LIGHTY. What I learned was the lighter you push the closer the shave. End of story. It&#x27;s counter intuitive but this now offers me a very close and quick shave. Great product if used according to manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic Electric Razor, and I love this one even better then the last one.&lt;br /&gt;It provides a great, close shave and seems to hold a charge for awhile.</li>
    <li> I have the hardest time getting him to buy a new razor.  I think in 43 years, he has had maybe three.  So, he was complaining about the one he had last year, and I saw this one and got it for him for Christmas.  He loves it.  It holds a charge well, is quiet and shaves just the way he likes.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic shavers for 15 plus years and have yet to be disappointed. This particular model is durable, reliable and reasonably priced. Very smooth shaver with plenty of power. Easy to clean! I certainly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for about a month now. It does a good job of smooth shaving. The battery lasts about 10 days while shaving every day. It is nice to be able to wash the shaver. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My hubby&#x27;s been using this for over a year now, and he loves it. It also makes his face super smooth, super fast.</li>
    <li> Sharp, smooth, charges in full by minutes, easy to clean. Overall awesome product.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver ever!  This has really helped my husband&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> So far the first shaver I have found that gives me a close shave without going over it several times.</li>
    <li> Slightly disappointed with this electric razor.  My son purchased one for half the price and it does a better job.  The shave is not very close at all.  Back in my Army days, I would have had to shave with a razor after uasing this one.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  It is the best cordless electric shaver  I have ever had.  It is smooth shaving and easy to use.  It is easy to clean.  I clean it after every use just to keep it shining and sharp and looking good.  You will never go back to two or three blade shavers again once you use this baby!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son as his first shaver.</li>
    <li> probably wouldnn&#x27;t have purchased if not at such a great price.  shaver does the job but is fairly loud. .</li>
    <li> My 11 year old Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver finally died., This unit actually cost less than old faithful and what a difference a decade makes. Smooth, quiet, and barely any pressure required to get a great shave.</li>
    <li> I wanted a man&#x27;s shaver because woman&#x27;s shavers are pretty wimpy.  This fits my needs wonderfully.  I am more than pleased with its performance.  Glad that I spent the money.</li>
    <li> There are many things I like about this shaver. Perfect shave, Its size, how it fits in the hand, and the carrying case. After owning many different electric shavers, this is certainly my favorite.</li>
    <li> Nothing can replace shaving with a Gillete Pro Fusion Glide.  But the downfall to that is I have very sensitive skin so I alway nick myself and it&#x27;s expensive to constantly change out the cartridge.  I was destined to use an electric razor.  After intensive research I bought this one for $100 on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It shaves as close and smooth as a manual razor and I no longer cut myself.  Not only that it is a lot faster and less mess.  Thank you Panasonic!</li>
    <li> i did alot of research due to my sensitive skin and the panasonic modes with the Arc system were highly rated.  i have been using for over 2 weeks now and if you have sensitive skin this is the shaver for you!  however, depending on how fast your hair grows you may want to consider sticking with a straight razor.  i have found that shaving daily with this razor is not enough due to how fast my hair grows - i am still cleaning up with a straight razor after using the Panasonic.  this is the first electric shaver that I have used so I don&#x27;t know what to expect from competitors.  i bought the new gillette straight razor last night and loved it.  just my 2 cents.</li>
    <li> I was a staunch believer in disposable razors ever since I started shaving several decades ago.  That is, until I tried this Panasonic razor.  The shave I get with the Panasonic is just as close as with a disposable but in about half the time.  I recharges quickly, too, and it couldn&#x27;t be easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Prior to this shaver, I have always gotten bad razor burn from any electric razor I have ever tried, regardless of style or brand.  My face is also sensitive to any scented aftershave, so I have to use an unscented moisturizer.  I have been using a 11 year old Remington that worked just fine (except for the razor burn).  But I started wondering if 10 years had produced any better shavers.  I read some reviews and decided to give the Panasonic ES8243A a try.      I loved it from the first shave.  Shave time dropped from almost 10 minutes to 4-6 minutes, depending on whether I shave every day or every other day.  My face is far less iritated than with any other shave I have tried over the years.  The shave is just as close, and it deals with longer hairs much more reliably than other shavers.  The only complaint I have is with the documentation.  The instructions on cleaning are unclear and contradictory.  But I was able to figure it out on my own without too much trouble so that isn&#x27;t too big a deal.  It is certainly easier to clean than any of my other shavers.    I would recommend this shaver to anyone with or without a sensitive face.</li>
    <li> Ok so I never write reviews of products, but I just want to say that this razor is amazing.  Now i&#x27;m not one of the guys who bought this razor because I have sensitive skin or because I cut my skin all the time.  Honestly, I can shave with just a little bit of water on my face and that&#x27;s it.  For my first shave, I had a about 2 days growth...not much but enough to be a good challenge for my first electric shave.  Now I have to admit, it will probably take getting used to the feel of getting shaved by an electric, but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as thought it was going to be.  There are some tough place on my face that i had to go over more than once, but then again, i have to go over those places more than once with my other razor.  This thing really does give an extremely close shave.  I thought people were stretching the truth a little when they said it&#x27;s as close as blade...and i&#x27;m here to confirm that it truly does give a razor close shave... I am so impressed.  I love this thing.</li>
    <li> I really wanted it to work, so I could ditch the razor, but it just would not cut the hair on my face.  Even if I used my Panasonic trimmer to get my beard nice and short (which I love, and have used for years).  It would cut some, but leave even more.  No matter how many passes, how hard I pressed, wet or dry, it just wouldn&#x27;t do it.  I suspect I am one of those people for whom an electric shaver will never work.  No, I&#x27;m not some hairy beast with a brillo pad face.  Perhaps some of my facial hair is thicker than can pass through the foil.    On the construction and ergonomics of the shaver, I would say that Panasonic hit another home run.  It&#x27;s well made, easy to hold, and I like the floating head design.  I wish it came with a base instead of just a cord, however, so you could just drop it in.  Panasonic makes a great variety of fantastic gear.  But this one is going back.</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver I bought myself as a Christmas present during one of the special pricing opportunities here on Amazon. I was leery of trying another electric shaver, but so far so good after several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is easy to grip, it follows facial contours closely, it holds its charge quite well, and the wet/dry capability is great. And though the color has nothing to do with function, I like this shade of blue. This razor seems more durable and well-crafted than other electric razors I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main con could be labeled as operator error, but sometimes I cut too closely and abrade the skin. Learning how to apply the correct pressure seems to be the key, and using this razor with a bit of soap or oil works best for me.</li>
    <li> Wanted an alternative to safety-razor for those days when either time constraints or just laziness would make electric razor desirable. Been only a week but the ES8243A performs higher than I anticipated; very high quality close shave. Near safety-razor close shave over entire face and neck without irritation. Still require a blade/foam to properly trim sideburns but I expected that as pop-up trimmers generally are adequate for only a so-so job. Have only used as a dry shave and results are excellent. If I&#x27;m going to take the time for a wet shave I&#x27;ll likely just use the safety razor, as for me the purpose of the ES8243A for me in the first place is a quick no fuss close shave.&lt;br /&gt;This model fulfills my preference for a cord charger versus a docking station battery charging setup; really didn&#x27;t want the permanent clutter on the counter considering infrequent need to charge. Cleaning as simple as tapping unit over the sink or a quick exposure to running warm water. Carrying case is sturdy enough although I wish it had been designed to also hold the cord but I&#x27;ll use a zip-lock bag to carry both shaver and cord when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I could not be happier with this choice. Performance is outstanding, made in Japan and quality appears first rate, plus price was attractive.</li>
    <li> I get a closer shave with this Panasonic when I use it dry, especially when I rub a few drops of Pjur Original over my stubble. Then the cut is as close as a blade. Amazing. No need to press hard, in fact the cut is worse if I do.    I bought it to shave in the shower, which I do a couple of times a week -- when I also use the opportunity to rinse out the razor, so it&#x27;s very easy to keep clean.    My beard is soft and slow growing -- I&#x27;m not a heavy weight shaver. I had been a Braun user up to now. Each time the old shaver wore out I reverted to blades for a couple of years, hankering after a closer shave. This time I&#x27;ll be inclined to replace my Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have had almost all other razors on the market it seams. This is by far the best. The only com plant I have is not with panasonic but with amazon itself. The week I purchased the razor the price droped $20 fallers and I requested a price correction 3time and never received a replay. So think twice befor you buy through amazon. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this shaver but...do I buy a brand new shaver for $100 or a new foil/cutter for $50? What&#x27;s up, Panasonic? Think I&#x27;ll shape up some flint and shave with that for free.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I had been using an older norelco with the nivea dispenser. This shave much closer, cleans easier and is much better around the sideburns. I like the flip up groomer for the sideburns, very easy to keep them neat. It takes about 3 minutes to shave in the shower, I use keils brushless shave cream and the combination is terrific. It.  Took a week or two for the shave to get really close, but is very close every day. Great value at amazon for $90. P</li>
    <li> Great Electric Shaver, Been using it for about a month...I\\&quot;m in The Military and Shaving everyday or every other day really Irritates my face. I needed something that could get close and Not Leave Noticiable Stuble. I have very Coarse hair and this did the trick No Problem. Also used in the Shower and with shaving gel for less irritation and works beautiful I reecommnd a buy. I only Shave about once a week now as appose to 5.</li>
    <li> Reasonably quiet and very smooth shave.  Excellent feel and touch to someone who has never used electric shavers before.</li>
    <li> I have been real impressed with this shaver since day one. I work as a Police Officer and have to shave every morning before I go to work. I was looking for something that gives me a close enough shave that wont irritate my skin, and this shaver does the trick. There are a few hairs at time that I cant get but thats just my face in general. Over all a great product.</li>
    <li> Best Electric Shaver in the world. Had one, bought another one for my brother. Comfort and ease of use, in and out of shower..</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It provides a very close shave for an electric shaver in 1-2 passes, cleans extremely easily, trimmer blade works great, holds charge well, and charges quickly when needed. The only negatives are that the four blade design that provides the close shave makes the shaving head extremely bulky. This can make it awkward to shave certain portions of the face. The shaver is also much louder than previous electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> On the rare occasion I have had to replace my electric shaver I always go back to Panasonic.    I have tried all the major brands over my many years of shaving and we know what they are, but they they never live up to what Panasonic delivers.     Go Panasonic,  Stilt Walker</li>
    <li> I put it up against my Gillette Fusion Proglide and ... First some setup, I&#x27;m mid 50&#x27;s, white, Scandinavian type, takes me 3 weeks to grow a complete, full beard. I started my shaving life with a Norelco rotary, I shaved dry before I showered (I didn&#x27;t know better) and then 15 years later moved to an Eltron Universal and then after a couple more years switched to a dual blade manual. From there it was 24 more years of manuals moving up the line to the 5 blade Fusion. I wanted to try an electric again purely for the days I needed to shave dry. Some mornings I go out kayaking or surfing and the stubble on my neck gets irritated by my wetsuit or paddle jacket if I haven&#x27;t shaved or if I didn&#x27;t shower before shaving. The neck hairs are mostly why I stopped shaving with an electric because it left too many. I&#x27;ve now got 10 days of use on the Panasonic. My very first impression was that it did the job but wasn&#x27;t as close as I was use to. That thought persisted over the next few days as I shaved in the shower using my usual Neutrogena shave cream to ease my way thru the break-in period. BTW, no skin irritation so far. I also thought that by 5 pm I had more stubble. BUT, then after a week I shaved half my face and neck with the Fusion, and half with the Pani. I was surprised, the Pani shaved closer and by the next day I had less stubble. The difference was minor but even my wife felt it. A few days later I repeated the test but switched halves to be fair and while still in the shower I could feel the Pani side was smoother. The morning after my wife once again picked the Pani side. Also, I&#x27;ve done a dry shave using a Remington FaceSaver stick and still no skin irritation from the shaver or paddling jacket. I&#x27;m loving this whole rinse with water cleaning process. No more cleaning mess with those darn little brushes. I opted not to get the cleaning station because I really didn&#x27;t believe this was going to be a daily shaver, but now that it is I still don&#x27;t have any regrets because of the simplicity of this cleaning process. I also think this model will be more travel worthy. The sideburn trimmer seems okay but I already own a Wahl beard trimmer so its not a concern for me. Recharge time is quick! At first I also thought the unit was a bit bulky but I&#x27;ve easily adjusted and the rubbery grip is secure in the shower (BTW, those shaves are without the water running). Lastly a few words on neck hairs, mine grow in many different directions and I&#x27;ve never gotten a perfectly smooth shave with anything. That said, this is as good as a manual for me.</li>
    <li> not even close to being as close as a blade and some spots just get outright missed. it takes longer than regular shaving and does a worse job, especially if you have a small bump on your face or it&#x27;s not smooth. neck &amp; chin are almost worthless. i&#x27;m amazed that people feel like this works b/c it&#x27;s no where near as good as a razor blade.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a great job of cutting my beard hairs in a fast and pain-free manner. This is the best shaver&lt;br /&gt;I have owned. It is very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I am updating my review because I bought this just over 14 months ago, and for the last several months the shaver&#x27;s display has lost its function.  So I now have a display that doesn&#x27;t show the power bars or time expended.  It now ALWAYS says I need to clean the shaver, replace the cutting head, and there are other displays I have never seen before.  So,now I am writing an update so people who do buy this knows that you are going to spend $10/mth for the shaver and an additional $10/mth for replacement heads.. or about $1 per day..  so, here is my original review.. and I suggest if you write a review early after purchase, you calendar yourself for 9 mths after your purchase and see if you would keep this review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Age 57, I have tried many an electric shaver since Nixon was president.  If you are like me, who has tried blade, remington, braun, and norelco; your journey should end at this shaver. I now shave wet, not dry, and that is so huge for comfort and closeness.  I am writing because my shaver died, after being on a plane over three years jostled by carry on baggage.  It&#x27;s battery is remarkable, lasting over a week when the battery is trained to last that long.  With sensitive skin, and a number of bumps on my face, this shaver has reduced the pain and suffering I have had using the other shavers.  In addition, the other electric shavers, for the price, are not as close cutting.  If you do buy this shaver, make sure you buy additional blades/foil to replace every 3 months.  You can last 6 months if you don&#x27;t travel, but if you do.. go 3 months.. the jostling does impact the cut, and I use oil of olay body lotion as my shaving foam/soap.</li>
    <li> Is the third Panasonic shaver I bought, before I had other electric rotative blades shavers but this system shaves better, the only problem I had is that the metallic perforated screen is very delicate and you have to take special care with it or it could become deformed or Brooke, also the spare parts are too expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it well enough, but he still uses the traditional razor to get the hair the electric shaver missed.</li>
    <li> Product performs well and is easy to clean up.  It holds it&#x27;s charge well and I&#x27;m am very happy so far.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for well over a year now. (I guess I could check my order and see exactly how long I&#x27;ve had it...)  I have been through three Braun shavers prior to this (two went dead after the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold charges, somebody who works at the airport in Mexico decided they liked my third one more than me) and after using this shaver, I found that it shaves just as close, but doesn&#x27;t pull at whiskers like my Braun&#x27;s would (occasionally).  I like this shaver much more and it was less expensive than my Braun. Win/Win.  I would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> The best shaver we have found....excellent!!  My husband has tried several but this one gives the closest shave.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a comfortable shave. It charges very quickly and is easy to glide around the contours of my face.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in years, but due to an injury I had to give it a try.  It did an excellent job and it was far better than the ones used may years ago.  I an contemplating changing to the electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave T</li>
    <li> My husband is so happy with this razor that he wants to get one for every man in both families. He tells everyone about it. Good clean, super smooth shave, no irritation.</li>
    <li> I thought I swore-off Foil Shavers after a really bad experience with a previous Remington.  But I realize now, that the Remington just was horribly made.  This electric razor even shaves better than my last Rotary electric razor.  I have a pretty narrow, angular face that does not make it easy to get a close shave with an electric razor.  However, the Panasonic Arc 4 gets a closer shave than anything I&#x27;ve used short of a bladed razor.  If you are in the market for a very good electric razor, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have doubts about there not being and &amp;#34;auto-clean&amp;#34; base, don&#x27;t feel like you are losing out.  My old Remington had one, and rusted out after a year (again could have been poor design).  This panasonic can be easily cleaned in under a minute.  Put a drop of liquid hand soap on the foil, turn the razor on to lather it up a bit, then hold down the power button to activate the Ultrasonic mode.  Just wait until the razor stops automatically after 30 seconds, then repeat the Ultrasonic mode under running water.  Remove the foil and clean off the inner blades under running water once more.  Dry off the razor and it&#x27;s just like new.  It&#x27;s simple and quick.  All in all, it&#x27;s been the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver and I got impressed how fast it was to me get used to that.</li>
    <li> I have used a razor to shave for 50 years and was starting to get razor burn with the blade. I decided to give an electric shaver a try. I researched the available shavers and chose the Panasonic. It is great. I can shave as fast and as closely as with the blade and no razor burn. It took about a week to get used to the new shaver but every shave has been close and smooth. I would definitely recommend this shaver to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned this shaver for a little over a month but so far I can say it&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned (Remington, Norelco, Braun). The motor is powerful, it gives a very clean shave and I don&#x27;t get the redness or rash on my neck I did with some other shavers (especially when using Billy Jealousy Shaving Cream or just a wet face). It also holds a good charge for about a week of shaving daily and very easy to clean. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good electric shaver for sometime now and I think I&#x27;ve found it. By the way, in one of the other reviews someone suggested soaking the blades overnight in rubbing alcohol to keep them nice and sharp.....that really works. Thanks for the tip.</li>
    <li> It takes me more than just a few minutes to get a decent shave from this. Being able to use this wet or dry is great but it&#x27;s still pretty difficult to get a close shave. And the trimmer is not recommended for the entire beard area, more like the mustache or chin. If it were only used dry it&#x27;d get a lower rating</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas.  He&#x27;s always used electric shavers, but only the tri-blade kind, not ones with this blade.  He says this has given him the closest electric shave he&#x27;s ever had.  He&#x27;s face definitely looks more clean cut after a shave with this.  He also likes that you can see the charge levels.  It was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money</li>
    <li> My husband says this razor is the best he has every had.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. Easy to use and shaves as close as a razor. And I got a great deal on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Through the years I have own about six different electric Shavers. The Panasonic Arc 4 is by far best yet. I like that I can shave using shaving cream. It does a super job on my face and neck. The shaver charges quickly and charge last for about two weeks of shaving. The shaver is very easy to clean after each use by a simple hot water rinse.</li>
    <li> I just used this shaver for the first time this morning, so I don&#x27;t have any opinion yet as to how well it holds up over time.  However, this shaver is amazing.  I was previously using a Norelco 8250 XL shaver which worked fine, but was still forcing me to press down hard against my face to get a close shave and cut ingrown hairs.  It also required a few passes that resulted in shaves lasting 7-9 minutes at times.    This Panasonic ES8243A is the first foil shaver I have used and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to go back to rotary shavers again.  I had 2-3 days growth and it took me 3 minutes to get a very close shave this morning with this shaver after splashing a little &#x27;Lectric Shave on my face. I could immediately tell this was a more powerful shaver than the Norelco I had been using.  Yet, no cuts or nicks.  No irritation at all.  Power was at 90% charge after the shave, tending to indicate that all that power does use a good bit of juice.  However, this shaver was completely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have confedence when I shop at nerds, they have met all of my expectations and.i will surely shop with them in the future, they are the real thing.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 2 weeks.  Prompt delivery and great results.  It blew away my previous Norelco electric shaver. It gives a very close shave which hardly took couple of minutes and left no skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about one and half years, it is working great.  But after one of overseas trip I found a hole in the foil.  Replacing the foil is expensive (half the price of the shaver). So I have been using a tape to cover the hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arun</li>
    <li> This thing is a beast. I use it to shave my clients head smooth really fast. It&#x27;s easy to clean and battery life is good . Best investment</li>
    <li> Great shaver that does what it is supposed to do.  I used blades for years and was hesitant to change to an electric shaver but was getting tired of the cost blades.  This shaver is just as close as the blades and no more nice and cuts.  Did take a couple of weeks for my face to adjust to the shaver.</li>
    <li> I cant quite give this razor 5 stars yet, but I will say, so far, it&#x27;s over delivered on my expectations. I bought this when Amazon had it on sale for Black Friday for under $80.00.  I&#x27;m a long timeblade man, I Haven&#x27;t used an electrick since high school when I got a Eltron (now Braun)for graduation in 1980.  Since then, I&#x27;ve sadly developed a pretty heavy beard, and gave up long ago on the convenience of an electric for a good close shave with a blade.  However, with all the constant technological improvements we enjoyed in the last 30 years, I figured they must have made some progress in this department.  After spending a good amount of time checking the reviews for a bunch of electrics on Amazon , I settled on the this model and I bought this on a lark for a Christmas present to myself.  Although I have not quit the blade 100%, I think since Christmas, I&#x27;ve only used one a few times. I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic quite a bit, and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found.  1. Love the wet / dry option. For best results, I&#x27;ve found shaving in the shower with some good gel provides the best shave.    2. It&#x27;s not perfect...there are times I have to do some spot clean up in the tough spots with a blade, but that&#x27;s usually only having skipped shaving a day or two.  3. Does NOT work on a weekends growth, or anything more than day or two max. You have to keep up on the shaving every day for best results.  4. Not necessarily a time saver. I find I have to pretty much use the electric shaver exactly as I would a blade, going over the tough spots ( jaw line, neck, etc...) multiple times to get acceptable closeness.    5. Works for last minute touch ups before an evening out. I get a good shadow by 5pm, and if we have a night time function, I can get a decent, passable touch up with the Panasonic, even using dry to save time.   6. I agree that you have to use the electrice for a week or so to adjust for best results. I dont think your beard necessarily &#x27;adjusts&#x27; as some have speculated, but you learn how to use it for best results.  7. Best of all, for the first time in my adult life, I do not have those ugly nasty red shaving irritation bumps on my neck from using a blade.  It&#x27;s still only been a few weeks, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed. Now the big question is how long will the blades and screen last. 1 review said 1 year.  if so, that&#x27;s a great value. I wonder if that&#x27;s really accurate.</li>
    <li> Works very nicely as a cordless Wet/Dry razor and I wanted to try the newer technology from my old 3 circular blade rotary Norelco.  I shave my head as well as my face and wanted this for the in between shaves to save time rather than lathering up and using the straight razors every day.  It works great on one or two day growth but past that it takes 2 or 3 passes and pressing harder to get the equivalent job of a 5 balde Gillette Fusion straight razor.  And when pressing harder on the neck area it tends to leave a little razor burn but still overall, a great razor for the money as compared to $200 + for the Norelco high end model I was considering.  Good one to have but don&#x27;t throw out your old standby straight razors.  It runs fairly quiet, holds the charge well and is easy to clean by just running it under warm water.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver have been using it for over a year on same blades. Still gives a good shave</li>
    <li> Nice product...Good build quality, close shave with quick charging...&lt;br /&gt;Though new user should bear in mind that it takes 1-2 weeks to get use to it...</li>
    <li> fuinctions very well...does what it says it will do. closest,fastist shave I&#x27;ve found. Quick easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver very much. It shaves closely and comfortably. I&#x27;ve had trouble getting close shaves with electric shavers before, so I was very glad that this shaver exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had--wet or dry.</li>
    <li> It works great -- for a while and then it will quit within two years.&lt;br /&gt;I maintained charge as recommended and it just stopped working one day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  I love that I can rinse it clean under running water or use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The charge doesn&#x27;t last very long and the pop up trimmer is terribly weak.  In fact, the pop up trimmer only works when I take the cover off the nanotech blades...otherwise it snags and doesn&#x27;t cut anything.  Not cool.  Now I&#x27;ve been growing beard since the 1st of October...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous razor was a Braun that I spent $130 on and it worked well for 11 years.  I only had to change the blades.  I guess I&#x27;m going back to Braun...</li>
    <li> Easy to unbox/Use, Never used a electric razor and when it comes to people&#x27;s skin some just can&#x27;t take it but from a person with very fare skin this razor did a great shave on its first time and it&#x27;s easy and fast to charge and got a super smooth shave.</li>
    <li> The display stopped working after just a couple of years, and then the battery finally wore out, but while it worked it was a decent shaver.  Provided a fairly close and well-controlled shave for such a bulky electric razor.  Never had issues with razor burn or much pulling (unless it snagged a really-long hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up replacing it with the supposedly-superior (and quite expensive) Panasonic Arc4 shaver, but I hated it.  The display failed after a few months, and it gave me terrible razor burn on my neck.  I ended up getting a Norelco shaver that isn&#x27;t much better in that regard, but since I wear a short beard these days it doesn&#x27;t really matter - I just use my trimmer to keep my neck a bit stubbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I go back to being beardless I&#x27;d consider buying this model again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, looks great, shaves close by not as close as a blade razor however the shave is satisfactory and the cost savings and hassle of buying blades, more than makes up for it.  30 shaves and liking it more each time.</li>
    <li> Awful trimmer, doesn&#x27;t work wet or dry.</li>
    <li> IT IS A VERY POOR PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. He generally hates razors. But he is loving this one and all the great features.</li>
    <li> Am using this for years now. Perfect wet-o-dryshaver, shaves very easy,clean and short, also when used dry.&lt;br /&gt;No rashes, which is a big advantage. Even better when used with a preshave lotion like Lab Series.&lt;br /&gt;Always protect the shaving foil with the protective hood after use because the foil is super thin.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let it decharge completely to prevent battery damage.</li>
    <li> This is my second ES8243 in 4 years.  I do shave with different Panasonic shavers for 15-18 years already.  Found it much better than Braun, Remington or Norelco.  Was always happy with them, but not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;My 3.5 year old ES8243 is significantly better.  I was just slightly worried that it is getting old and started looking for something better.  I tried Panasonic ES-LV61-A hoping that it is improved model. Nah, it was so much worse that I returned it after 10 days of hope and torture.  Then I decided that at least I need to grab ES8243 while they are still in production.  The result was a disappointment.  I don&#x27;t know what happened - maybe cheaper metal made in China or something else, but I can&#x27;t get the same closeness I am getting with my old one.  Yeah, guys at Panasonic, cutting corners doesn&#x27;t work for customers.  My next shaver might be from Braun.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for 11 months. With new blades and screen, it is awesome. However, I found that I had to replace the blades and screen about every 2 months -- and they are very expensive. This could be due to the fact that I have very thick whiskers. The other thing that was really bad is that the battery now completely dies when the battery indicator reaches 50%.</li>
    <li> It is very quiet and smooth and easy to operate. It gives a clean close shave. The trimmer is an added benefit. No complaints.</li>
    <li> The razor was the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  The first for my husband a year or so ago.  My son saw it and loved it so I purchased a second razor for him to take to Afghanistan.  Marine&#x27;s need to be clean shaven at all times so a good quality razor is a must.  I also purchased the protection plan and received an email from Square Trade to complete my protection plan.  When I clicked on the link, it took me directly to a create account page which populated my email automatically.  I proceeded to enter a password and confirm it only to get a message that my email address isn&#x27;t the one that purchased the item.  Really?  I purchased it and the protection plan came to me through that same email address.  So tell me, how can my email address be different than who purchased it?  When I called Trade Square, the representative apologized and said it was a glitch on their end.  However, it was very hard to get her to understand what the issue was and I was told to complete the warranty online.  Did you not hear me?  I can&#x27;t finish the protection plan online.  Finally, the representative took down my item information and emailed me the protection plan.  Meanwhile, she never ended the call so I was left hanging to hear a bunch of ladies laughing in the background.  I had to ask if the representative needed any additional information from me.  She said no and I ended the call.  oh yeah!  My protection plan didn&#x27;t say what I actually had protection for so before i could save the email, I had to add the item information into the subject line before I could file it.  Really, is there any company out there that has good customer service anymore?  Thinking NOT!</li>
    <li> I think my skin is still getting used to this razor and blades.  I don&#x27;t feel my shave is as close as with my old razor, and I did get irritation early on (though, I tried a new lotion and that may have contributed to the chaffing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a few months (I&#x27;ve only had the razor for about a month) but right now I would not recommend this model.</li>
    <li> Thought my Braun did a good job until I bought this razor.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this shaver. The reviews I read here and else where are correct.  This is a great machine! So great in fact, that a fellow coworker also decided to get one as well... Needless to say, he too loves his too!</li>
    <li> so far, everything works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I like it and find it easy to use;however, I would like it to shave a little closer on my neck.</li>
    <li> shaves close without pulling and its close too</li>
    <li> Husband absolutely loves it, he can do so much more &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; than he could with his old Braun one.  His only complaint is that he has a hard time just trimming his hair, so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s only a 4 star.</li>
    <li> I cannot attest to longevity, but as for effectiveness, this razor is very good.  I had the So much better than the Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 Blade Electric Razor -- which was barely effective even when it was working.  It died before the one year mark.  This 4 blade razor must have a totally different shaving design.  It&#x27;s smooth and effective.  If it lasts, I&#x27;ll be very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Something to note if you travel.  The on/off switch is a button on the front that toggles on and off simply by pressing it.  The button is easy to press and to activate accidentally -- unlike a slider switch.  I recently traveled with this razor stored in checked baggage.  When I retrieved the baggage, the razor was on, and nearly depleted.  At some point during the flight or afterwards, the button had been pressed.  This is a design flaw that needs to be addressed in the next version of this razor.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son for Christmas - recently noticed his face was broken out and he told me he had to stop using the shaver because it tore the hairs out of his face and caused the breakout.  He&#x27;s long past the acne stage and I hoped this would enable him to shave in the shower.  How wrong I was.  I&#x27;m returning the shaver but it&#x27;s past 30 days so I have no hope of a refund or replacement (useless anyway).</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this Panasonic shaver. I&#x27;m amazed at the closeness of shave. Would I buy another- absolutely. Only concern is lack of battery life but hey-The outlet is close buy so no whining from me!</li>
    <li> Have been using this shaver for a month now, and found it as the good reviews I read before purchasing the shaver. Is more comfortable to hold and use then the picture indicates, using the average shave time of 3 minutes as stated I am getting 2 weeks per charge and the charge only takes 1 hour as stated. I use the shaver dry as I have always shaved this way but impressed by the ability to wash under running water to clean it after 2 or 3 days use. The shaver is also smart enough to stop when I have not cleaned it under water after 4 or 5 days and show the tap symbol, then once rinsed it carries on as usual. Great clean smooth shave, only took me few days to get the firmness of use against my skin and to this day have only used the soft setting as my face is getting that wrinkled texture after so many years on this planet. Great product and would recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as razor</li>
    <li> UPDATE - I have lowered my rating to 4 stars.  The battery life of this shaver is very poor.  I get about 5 shaves per charge, probably half of what I got with previous shavers.  It&#x27;s a great shaver otherwise.    I have been shaving for many years and have purchased and been disappointed by many electrics but after 3 days of use this is clearly the best. For the first time ever I have a shaver that shaves as close as a blade without the cuts or irritation.  The trimmer is effective and overall this shaver is easy to hold, use and clean.    I&#x27;m a little concerned about reviews that talk about failures and the high cost of replacement foils and cutters, but for now this product is worth 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I got share this it&#x27;s been a couple months now....here it goes! OK got my shaver in so I sat on the side of the bed and opened the box and unzipped the leather case and took the cap off the razor and.......ugh ewe!! It was full of hair! I dropped it as a reaction on the floor and it was DISGUSTING! I was brushing hair off my lap and it was on the carpet ewe! I washed up and CALLED AMAZON !! I DIDN&#x27;T get irate the CS reo listened and then told me to dispose of the razor and refunded me plus another $150 credit ! Which was nice of them ..</li>
    <li> Buy it you want regret it. I can&#x27;t say enough about this razor</li>
    <li> Good razor as I have only had ones that pull out whiskers in the past. This one does not and leaves a smooth face. But, I must use it twice a day to keep up otherwise the stubble gets too long for the razor to manage. I have a heavy beard and skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Hate shaving but not so much with this.  Takes maybe 3 minutes every morning while im in the shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Panasonic ES8243A wet/dry because my old corded electric just was not doing the job anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Man, I should have purchased this thing a long time ago !! Smooth, fast shaves,I do my head too.&lt;br /&gt;I read most of the reviews before I bought this thing - good and bad.&lt;br /&gt;There is &#x27;nothing&#x27; negative about this shaver that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;I can shave the back of my head with no problem. If I wait more than two or three days, I have my wife do the back - much faster and easier.&lt;br /&gt;Charges in an hour. I don&#x27;t think this thing can be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed in Iowa</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver based on the reviews at this site. At 1st I was pretty satisfied but quickly became disenchanted with the product. When I charged it for the 1st time and shaved it worked very well, however it quickly became dull, even after a few shaves and failed miserably on the neck hairs and other harder to shave areas. As for the product itself I was also disappointed to find that I rarely was able to shave effectively more than 4 or 5 times a charge. Each time it is charged it seems to last a shorter period. I would not recommend this shaver to anyone. I will continue to look as the Braun&#x27;s and Remingtons I have bought in the last few years also fail miserably.</li>
    <li> Simply put, best shaver I ever used.  Easy on the face, cuts fast, close and clean.  I shave dry, so if you use it wet, even better.  I have had 5 different electric razors of different brands over the past 15 years, most in the $100.00 price range. They have performed OK but have always left me wanting more.  This is the one I have been looking for. Good luck.</li>
    <li> My new Panasonic wet / dry electric razor does the job. Mostly, after I workout, I do a wet shave and I&#x27;m feeling great with a close and clean shave. I also have most of by &#x27;bald&#x27; head. Great razor; and it&#x27;s quiet (quieter than my previous Panasonic wet/dry electric razor.)</li>
    <li> Very close shave without any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that you can not shave while it is charging. However, it only takes about an hour to recharge.</li>
    <li> I followed all instructions and shaved areas of my neck and face I normally shave with a triple-edge blade.  I used a good gel.  The shave was really nice and close, so I was initially very happy; however, there were two problems.  Problem number one was that in an area of looser skin, the shaver \\&quot;bit\\&quot; me, I don&#x27;t know how (I know, it seems impossible for a shaver that has no exposed blades... but it really happened).  It left parallel bleeding cuts, about 9 or 10 of them, on the underside of my neck.  Problem #2 came in 3 days when the shaved areas became red and covered with swellings from ingrown hairs.  3 of these turned into abscesses and required minor surgery and antibiotics, leaving what will certainly be permanent scars.  So... no, not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this worse for me is that this shaver has a 30 day money back guarantee, but there was a sheet of paper included that practically begs you to use it for 30 days, despite any \\&quot;discomfort\\&quot; it might cause, and not return it without giving it a chance.  Well, this makes me think they knew there is a likelihood of ingrown hairs.  Maybe the shaver just works too well and shaves too close?  I don&#x27;t know.  Still, I think it would have been more appropriate to warn of the possible side effects.</li>
    <li> This product does not perform like it does in the commercial at all! its extremely loud so loud in fact I don&#x27;t like using it in the morning because I&#x27;m afraid I will disturb the neighbors. It takes me at least 20-30mins of going over hairs on my neck before I get a decent shave (not cool) it charges pretty quickly its durable and its cool that it can wash off in water and soap but that&#x27;s just a few pros to tons of cons I don&#x27;t recommend this shaver at all.</li>
    <li> Nice easy shaver - second one purchased</li>
    <li> not completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not shaving close enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;always leaving too much stubble of the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing like the Gillette razor...</li>
    <li> great razor right out of the box. shaves great from full charge to low charge, unlike other brands of razors I have owned. I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this shaver for Christmas and it is a very good product. On a recent trip I lost the charging cord. When I went to Panasonic to try and order a replacement charger in June I was told that the charger was on back order until early July. It is now the wend of July and when I contacted Panasonic again I was told the charger was discontinued and no replacement was available rendering the shaver unusable. The people at Panasonic offered no alternative charger. When I told them they are still selling this shaver to the public they informed me that I was correct. They will continue to sell the shaver to the public but are not able to supply a replacement charger if it is lost or defective. They should be ashamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unhappy in Hawaii</li>
    <li> I have had this razor now for four months and man am I impressed. It gets like a blade close, it charges from 0 to 100% in literally an hour and holds a charge...I honestly don&#x27;t think ive charged it yet. I&#x27;m Law Enforcment so I have to shave every morning. This thing is purely amazing in performance way better than a 600$ variant!</li>
    <li> I needed an electric razor that would shave my head as close as a blade.  This electric razor is the right one for the job.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Blue]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using rechargeable razors from other manufacturers for the past 25 years or so, I became unhappy with the new razor I purchased just last year.  After some research, I decided to go Panasonic.  Based on another review, I went with a water clean model.  Result is the greatest, most comfortable shave I have had in years.  And I don&#x27;t have to skip a shave day.  I am now a daily shaver.  Thanks Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This seems to be an excellent shaver for me.  I have been using it for about two weeks and have tried both wet and dry shave options.  The shave is much closer than I anticipated, particularly when using a thin coating of a good shaving cream or gel.  As recommended, give it a week or so for your beard and skin to \\&quot;settle in\\&quot; and I suspect you will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES8243 is THE BEST ever shaver introduced! I just bought my panasonic a couple of weeks back after getting frustrated with Phillips Norelco 1150x 2D. The quality of shave was much superior using the panasonic, not to mention the ease of cleaning and use. Guys, don&#x27;t think twice..just go for this one...you&#x27;ll not regret.!</li>
    <li> I bought my ES8243A shaver on Amazon.com 3 years ago.  It is STILL the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I am just now getting around to replacing the original blades and foil.  (My beard is very tough.  Other shavers I&#x27;ve owned needed replacements a lot sooner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in many reviews here, the Panasonic shavers that are made in Japan are amazing and the Panasonic shavers made in China just aren&#x27;t as good.  I&#x27;ve owned both; it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the ES8243A is trivial.  Just apply a bit of hand soap and rinse.  I owned a Braun shaver with a cleaning system once.  I&#x27;ll never do that again.  It dulls the blades faster, the cleaning cartridges are not cheap, the shaver isn&#x27;t any more clean that it would be otherwise, and it&#x27;s noisy - for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note for cleaning the ES8243A - make sure you rinse the trimmer too and leave it open to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned shavers by Norelco, Remington, Braun, and Panasonic.  The ES8243A is significantly better than any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned - except an earlier Panasonic, which was also made in Japan.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave wet or dry. Easy to clean And the battery lasts about 2 weeks between charges.  I don&#x27;t find any difference in the shaving quality when using a pre-shave lotion as has been recommended in other reviews.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Works great. Only thing is that I wished it came with some sort of stand, but in any case works fantastic.</li>
    <li> works great  economical  love it</li>
    <li> I am happy to have found this shaver on the Internet. For some reason you cannot find it in some of the large Shops in Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;They told me the factory was in the area of the Zunami and is not producing this Model any more. What is true?</li>
    <li> I decided to switch to electric because it seemed like a good way to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; a few minutes off of my morning routine and I have not been disappointed so far.  I&#x27;ve used this for the past month for a dry shave, and although it is not quite as close a shave as using a safety razor (particularly under my jaw/around my neck) I find that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much either.  Because I have sensitive skin &amp; typically buy high-end shaving cream/razor blades, I figure this will save a little $$ in the long run as well.  Best of all though is that it only takes about two minutes to shave tops w/no mess.  Cleaning is very easy too, I just clean the screen &amp; blades with a little antibacterial soap once a week and it&#x27;s good to go.  Have used a safety razor for 25-30 years &amp; I am much happier with this &amp; am only sorry I didn&#x27;t switch sooner!</li>
    <li> Good unit. Easy to use &amp; clean. Fair price</li>
    <li> Best electric shave I&#x27;ve had in 41 years and many other brands/models.</li>
    <li> The best shaver I ever bought. Seriously, I&#x27;ve been using electrics for 20 years and never was totally happy. This one is the best. Worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Superb! My best and most reliable Shaver ever - even after many years of use. Battery and blades are still the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 1/2 years will get the same for my older son!</li>
    <li> Great shaver! The only complaint I could think of would be that it is noisier than other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a blade man but this is the best backup I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Great shaver easy too use great price john tinley park</li>
    <li> Really don&#x27;t like a dry shave, so I went looking for a wet/dry electric option. A little over a year ago I bought the Panasonic ES8168. It gave a good shave on the face but I needed to go over the neck several times for the closeness I wanted. All in all a good shave...but not great. Also, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the cleaning/drying/charging station - I didn&#x27;t like having to buy the refillable cleaning units and it took almost four hours to complete all cycles.    Recently I picked up the ES8243A and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Firstly, the shaver&#x27;s appearance is much nicer than the online photos... the blue on the front is dark and the sides and back are slightly rubberized black (I think it is black). So if you are holding out for the black model  ES8243K (with the cleaning unit) don&#x27;t bother. The 8243A is the new \\&quot;four blade\\&quot; technology - purported to be a faster, closer shave. I have found it is what has been advertized - a faster and closer shave! The \\&quot;four blades\\&quot; actually refers to the outer foil, a \\&quot;squarer\\&quot; design than the 8168. There are still two inner blades, but spaced farther apart than the 8168. For me, the new head design touches more of my face than the 8168 and therefore cuts faster. I have read on other sites that the foil is a thinner steel, allowing the inner blades more access to the skin. The shave has been fast, gliding easily and for the most part needs only one pass for the reults I want. Big improvement!    Ergonomically the shaver is easier to hold than the 8168 and the head design hits all of the hard to reach areas of the neck.     Have been using it with Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shave cream, a great product. Because you only need to apply a very thin layer it is perfect for an electric shaver. The ES8243 glides effortlessly over it and the build-up on the razor is minimal. I usually rinse it 3 -4 times during each shave.    Until this shaver I have been of the opinion the electrics couldn&#x27;t compare to the closeness of the Gillette Fusion (my previous fav), but all that has changed with the ES8243A. For the first time I can say the shave is as close as the non-electric options, and with no razor burn. IMO Panasonic has hit the bullseye with this product.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve searched for the perfect electric shaver.  I have a tough beard and very sensitive skin, so a straight razor is out of the question. To get a smooth shave from any top brand electric shaver takes 20 minutes, and the abrasions are a killer, not to mention the red face for most of the day. So I once again  entered the new razor arena, recently trying the top brand shavers including the newest Braun Pulsonic 9585 and the latest Norelco Arcitec, and was left unsatisfied with 20 minute painful and irritating shaves, until using the Panasonic Arc 4 ES8243A.     I&#x27;ve never been inspired to comment on any product of any kind like this, but I would like to spare others the hours of surfing online for the perfect shaver. The Panasonic Arc 4 actually delivers as claimed. I can shave comfortably and even more smoothly in literally half the time compared to my previous 20 minute ordeals.  I&#x27;m also experiencing an unexpected bonus: even after only a few days, each shave has taken less time than the day before. My last shave this morning was only 8 minutes. My skin is consistently left smooth and comfortable. So far, I&#x27;ve only used this shaver dry. When I&#x27;m not rushed in the morning I may try it wet to see if I can lessen my shaving time even more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying quite a few brands and models of shavers for the past couple of months, then I bought this model.  This has to be the best I have tried.      Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it gives one of the closest shaves, specially if wet-shaving.  Very easy maintenance, no special detergents or fluids required.  Somebody had pointed out that it was noisy.  I don&#x27;t find it noisy but it is louder than a Norelco I was using.    I recently bought the ES8249K, same model, in black and with a cleaning/drying/charging station, mainly because I wanted some kind of station where it could rest &amp; charge automatically (I wasn&#x27;t interested in the cleaning portion).</li>
    <li> Excellent! My fiance is more than pleased! He&#x27;s showed his father and best friend...who both now want the same one.</li>
    <li> First off, I don&#x27;t use cheap razors. Learned that lesson a long time ago, when it comes to placing a sharp cutting edge on your face, saving a few bucks isn&#x27;t worthwhile. So I have experience with a lot of high-end razors over the years, and originally didn&#x27;t consider this one because it was so inexpensive. I bought this shaver about a month and a half ago, and have used it steadily since then. I like it, but it&#x27;s not the perfect shaver. A very good shaver, but not perfect.    Pros - This is the closest to a true single-pass shaver that I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to use. The documentation cautions you not to apply a lot of pressure which means you might have a habit to break there; applying too much pressure will give you razor burn, and with shaver, you simply don&#x27;t need to press hard. Even if you need a few &#x27;scrubs&#x27; across an area, minimal pressure works great. I use this to not only shave my face, but the top of my head as well, every morning. It works even better on the dome than it does on the face, giving me the closest shave that an electric has ever offered. The wet-shave option just makes the experience nicer, and you can actually use a light layer of shaving cream with this razor.    Cons - Battery life isn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped. This isn&#x27;t a show stopper, just something to be aware of it; it won&#x27;t last as long as many other electric razors out there. Probably due to the higher cutting speed. This razor has a big head which makes it fine for large areas, like the top of your head, and it covers your cheeks pretty fast, but I sport a goatee and moustache too. That&#x27;s where this razor really shows it&#x27;s limitations, the shaving head is too big to do anything approaching detail work. I shave the upper part of my moustache and this razor is just too big to even see what I&#x27;m doing in that area, let alone do fine work like shaping a moustache and goatee. On the flip side side of the razor is the obligatory push-up trimmer, and yes, it works, but you&#x27;re taking achance very time you use it. That big shaving head once again gets in the way of being able to see what you&#x27;re doing with that little trimmer and you&#x27;re just as likely to trim off half your moustache if you insist on trying to use it.    Bottom line - The Arc 4 is what it is; a superb shaver of broad, open areas. But if you have a moustache or goatee, don&#x27;t be so fast to get rid of your other shaving options because the Arc 4 can&#x27;t do it alone.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Get good shave without pressing hard against skin</li>
    <li> mom &amp; i bought this for dad for his 88th birthday. he says he has never had a better shave in his life using this razor! mom &amp; i are so happy we bought it for him now. at first we were skeptical because of the new technology and i will say that if there was anything bad about this purchase it would be the instructions are a bit overwhelming for older folks. however, once he had it charged and ready, he says its the greatest! he loves the optional wet/dry features and he says its really easy on his face...easier than anything he has ever used. it has been a perfect gift for him!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue]]    I have been shaving with electric shavers for over 40 years because I never found a blade system that was comfortable for my skin. During those years I have owned almost every conceivable shaver made by either Braun or Norelco. Once my Braun died recently I decided to do some reviews and was about to settle on either another top of the line Braun or Norelco until I saw the written reviews for the Panasonic Wet/Dry electric shaver. I was impressed by the almost uniform raves and at about half the price I took a chance and bought one together with Billy Jealousy shave cream. As with all electric shavers the insert cautioned that it might take around 30 days for my beard to adjust. News Flash - it was immediate. I have never had such a close, smooth and irritation free shave in my life. The neat thing is that you can shave in the shower, rinse off the shaver as you use it and be done in a very short time. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. If you are on the fence in making a decision about your next purchase, give this one a try. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> i had an older panasonic shaver upgraded to this model and what a difference ,shaves very close , i tried a norelco and a braun,could not even come close th this panasonic. try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I have an extremely heavy and stubborn beard.  Think \\&quot;5 O&#x27;Clock Forest\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;5 O&#x27;Clock Shadow\\&quot;.  If I don&#x27;t shave for 2 days, little old ladies hurry across the street and cops follow me around.  While I used a Panasonic ES 8092 regularly, I was never satisfied since it took repeated passes to get the heaviest areas and the neck clean.  Even then, when I got into work I&#x27;d see bits that hadn&#x27;t been properly cleared and the overall look was still a bit \\&quot;shadowy\\&quot;.  If I didn&#x27;t use the electric for 2 days in a row - forget it.  Only a Fusion FIVE BLADE would really clean things up.  In fact, when I really needed a clean look - meetings, dates, DMV pictures - I would use the blade.    So I decided to retire the old 8092 and give electrics one last chance.  When I saw the specs and the price on the 8243A, I figured this was it.  I waited a day and a half before using it for the first time.  Wow!  In literally 1 minute (yes, I timed it), my beard was gone, my neck was clear and my skin clear.  It still stung a bit (skin not used to 4 blades and a 13k rpm motor), but it didn&#x27;t feel anywhere near as bad as a blade.  This thing is amazing.  It blows regular blades, including the Mach3, out of the water and I suspect it could match the Fusion.  Need to do a few more test shaves before I can be sure.    Effortless shaving, incredibly clear results, fast shaves and quick recharges.  What&#x27;s not to like ????    Update: I can now report that I have used this shaver regularly for weeks on a SINGLE charge.  That&#x27;s how effective it is.  Shaving barely takes 2 minutes.  I even look forward to it since it provides a \\&quot;clean look\\&quot;.  Truly exceptional.    Update 2: Six months and still going strong!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver about a month ago. Before that I was using Mac3. When I switched, I expected some irritation in the first few days. The shaver is very smooth and to my surprise my skin did not have virtually any problems adjusting. The coolest feature of the ES8243A is Wet/Dry function. The shave is close in dry mode or with shaving cream. I suggest using shaving cream only when your face is moist (right after the shower). Otherwise, Dry shave is the way to go. It usually takes me 3-4 min. to shave in the morning. Charging is fast and battery lasts for 10 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the shaver does not do a good job on the neck. It seems it is unable to grab all the hair. The neck requires 3-4 passes before I can get a somewhat close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic man for over 15 years. I buy the newest model when it comes out and by far this is the best shaver that Panasonic has produced to date. This particular packaging is one off the top of the line. The only difference is the top model comes with a self cleaning bath system. I prefer to clean my shaver with liquid dish soap myself. I have tried the Bruan with the solvent auto cleaning system and its just a toy, and the refill cartridges are pricey.Obiously I&#x27;m the husband of Nurse Nancy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, it&#x27;s the closest shave he has ever had next to a blade.</li>
    <li> The last shaver I purchased was one of the Norelco rotary head ones, and I had begun to regret it shortly afterwards, but since I&#x27;m not one to want to waste money, I vowed to use it until either the unit itself was dead, or the blades I bought with it got too dull for effective use.  My cats finally decided that enough was enough, and they sent my old Norelco crashing to the floor perhaps one too many times, and it finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began the search for a good foil shaver, and at first was dismayed that I couldn&#x27;t find a decent plug in unit.  It seemed most of them were battery powered and came with some kind of giant cleaning apparatus which I would inevitably use until the initial cleaning solution was gone...and then I would abandon.  I then found this an ad for this Panasonic, and reading some of the reviews, I figured it was worth a shot, no matter what, it had to be better than the last one I used for almost 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I made that decision, this thing shaves much closer, and due to the very high speed motor, cuts through my extra coarse beard without practically plucking each of my hairs, like my old Rotary did from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only annoyance with the unit is that you can&#x27;t run it plugged in, it has to be charged, and then used off the battery, meaning that if the battery dies, the shaver is toast, as it doesn&#x27;t appear to be easily replaceable, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I ponder why no one makes a good plug in foil shaver any more, I will settle on this Panasonic as an excellent second choice.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaver. Spend the extra $30 and get the Panasonic ES-LA63-S. It&#x27;s much better and is the closest electric shaver I have used. They LOOK the same but the ES-LA63-S is a better unit.</li>
    <li> was getting tire of using my clippers to try to shave my head.. it was hard to do and missed many spots and even cut my head sometimes... Got the panasonic es 8243a  and used it and i thought my head was shaved with straight razor. Baby butt smooth... As long as you dont let it grow to long.. its very easy- 3-5 min-- and easy to clean as well..</li>
    <li> Powerful and excellent product, Panasonic is the best for shave.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything on Amazon before and probably have not even though I make most of my purchases for everything on Amazon now of days.  I came on here today just to recommend this razor.  Ever since I can remember shaving, I always got razor burn on my neck.  These of course were the times of the dispensable Bic razors.  I eventually upgraded to Mach 3 blades and eventually electric razors all with the same razor burn result.  I tried different creams, aftershaves, balms, ice on neck... everything.  So, for the last 10 years, I&#x27;ve pretty much shaved with a beard trimmer that would get close to the skin, but not as close as a shave.  During the 10 years, I bought and tried other expensive electric razors such as panasonic and norelco thinking that eventually they might develop one that was good for me.  Still the same razor burn result and so I stuck with my trusty beard trimmer.  Until now.  Just recently purchased this razor.  Was a little optimistic after reading reviews.  I also purchased the Billy Jealously Hydroplane shaving cream and bought an after shave cream.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the shaving cream or the razor... but 10 shaves in now... closest shave I&#x27;ve had in forever and no razor burn.  Now I&#x27;m sure others have done extensive tests on other comparable razors like the Braun 7 or other panasonic razors and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re just as good... maybe better.  I just wanted to come on here to say that this razor is the best I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m extremely happy I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m an acne sufferer, nothing severe but shaving causes me lots of grief and I was hoping this product would help.  It does a great job with a close shave! But does miss some hairs on my neck, which can be annoying.  My skin didn&#x27;t react as badly as I thought it might, but I do have more, it seems, more pimples... But they may have just been hiding in the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s really loud! But not to big of a deal. It&#x27;s just me, so there is no one to disturb .  I hope my skin gets more comfortable with the time with this product!</li>
    <li> Nice price &amp; good delivery time (free). Works way better than my rotory 3 head. Trimmer has a little to be desired but works ok.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about Panasonic for a shaver but this was a great decision, best one I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Panasonic claims its a 4 blade system, yet when I opened the cover it had only 2 blades. The noise is annoying. Shaver is OK. Noise level is very  high compared to other models.</li>
    <li> I am a long time blade user (20+ years) because I never felt that electrics gave a good shave.  Although I still think the blade shave is supperior, the quick convenience of this shaver and the acceptable shave that this shaver provides more than makes up for the lack of absolute closeness.  Also, I have a rather tough, thick beard, so I would bet people with more fine hair would have an even better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is incredibly easy to keep clean, compared to my last try at electric and I think this will be my method of choice here on out.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. I&#x27;ve tried other foil razors and none of them compare to the comfort and closeness of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good buy - i definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Close shave, the charge last for at least a week and cleaning is a breeze. Great little item.</li>
    <li> My absolutely favorite shaver to date. Easy to use and clean, good shave, wet/dry worry free device. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I&#x27;ve had it for 3+ years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. Works great whether using it for wet or dry shaves. The battery is still giving good, long charges. Haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet.</li>
    <li> Bought this instead of a replacement head due to cost. Cheaper to buy the new one and get the extended warranty.</li>
    <li> I love almost everything about this shaver, including the wet/dry flexibility, the closeness of the shave, the battery life and particularly the cleaning.  I love that it&#x27;s intended to be cleaned with regular soap under the faucet without some complicated and expensive cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s quite annoying to not be able to use it while charging, and the beard trimmer is painfully ineffective.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this device! Especially when I am doing wet shaving with foam. Shaves all very clean and very fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband 2 years ago, and before that, he was struggling with really bad red bumps/ingrown hairs from shaving. He tried all sorts of different razors, skin products, and methods of shaving, but he could never get rid of the bumps, and a lot of the time, he&#x27;d end up with a shave that wasn&#x27;t very nice and clean. This shaver has been great for him. He doesn&#x27;t have any red bumps at all, and he gets a very nice, close shave. It&#x27;s good quality, and he hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it. He hasn&#x27;t ever replaced the blade or anything like that (and now that I&#x27;m thinking about it, he probably should...) but it&#x27;s still going strong! Great product! This had good reviews when I first bought it, but now it has almost 1,000 good reviews... definitely a testament to its quality!</li>
    <li> My husband says it is the best razor he has ever had!</li>
    <li> I have had it for 2 weeks now.  The first 2 shaves were rough, as can be expected, because it&#x27;s been months since I had a working electric razor.  Once my extremely sensitive skin became desensitized to it, the irritation and itching went away.  The shave is close and comfortable.  The battery lasts a REALLY long time.  I charged it up when I got it, it&#x27;s currently at around 60% after 2 weeks, shaving every other day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I would have is that the charging cord doesn&#x27;t fit in the carrying case.</li>
    <li> June 22, 2012 update: my original reviews stand - this razor is AWESOME!  I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for the last 2 years and I&#x27;m *incredibly* satisfied and pleased with the purchase.  I haven&#x27;t replaced the blades yet, and it&#x27;s still chomping through my stubble like a champ.  A great buy, and if this razor ever dies I&#x27;ll definitely buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 25, 2010 update: as stated in the instructions, stick with it for at least a month.  This is probably the best electic razor I&#x27;ve owned, as long as I don&#x27;t press too hard and keep the head perpendicular to the skin.  Also, I dropped it on concrete from about 3 feet and everything came apart. I thought \\&quot;great, now I have to buy another one\\&quot;. But instead, everything popped back together and worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: I&#x27;ve owned quite a few $60 electric razors, but I read about 20 reviews on this unit and decided to give it a shot.  Arrived quickly, charged it for about an hour, read the instructions, and decided to give it a go dry on about 3mm of growth.  Took about 20 mins, but holy cow, the result is as good as a regular razor. I&#x27;ll write another update in a few days, but coming from a person who&#x27;s pretty particular about their electronics and their shave, this razor is amazing.</li>
    <li> I just charged up my new Panasonic razor and shaved off a 3 day beard in 2.5 min. Ultra smooth shave. No pulling. Felt like velvet sliding across my face. Reasonably quiet razor. Easy as \\&quot;pie\\&quot;. This would have taken my Remington \\&quot;piece of junk\\&quot; razor about 10 min and involved using the beard trimmer to take care of longer whiskers. I&#x27;m very very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> As a shaver it&#x27;s neither great nor awful -- it&#x27;s somewhere in the middle. It&#x27;s been about 8 months since I bought it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as quickly as it used to, but eventually it does the job. I&#x27;m also not crazy about the high-pitched whine -- I guess I&#x27;m used to Braun shavers that have a lower, deeper buzz, which is more pleasing to my ear -- not a small matter considering I use this thing every morning at a time when I&#x27;m not always in the best of moods. But the main reason I&#x27;m giving this product two stars is that it doesn&#x27;t work when you plug it in! So you have to unplug it to use it. Then, when you&#x27;re done, you forget to plug it back in again...and then right in the middle of your next shave it quits on you! You then have to plug it back in, wait at least a couple minutes for it to get up to at least 10% so you can finish the job -- then you better remember to plug it back in or you&#x27;re doomed to repeat history. The Braun shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past never had this problem -- I could use them while plugged in -- which is why I&#x27;m planning on getting a Braun -- not in a few months or a few years when this Panasonic dies on me, but NOW.</li>
    <li> I can shave every day with this shaver and not have any irritation whatsoever. I&#x27;m so happy with it. I got it for doing a show on Broadway that I had to be clean shaven every performance and it worked like a charm!</li>
    <li> I have always used an electric shaver.  For the last 10 years I&#x27;ve used a Norelco rotary shaver, but lately have been very disappointed with its performance.  So, I have now tried the Panasonic ES8243A for over a month.  I only use it dry, no shave cream.  I can certainly say it gives a closer shave than the Norelco.  I still have 5-o&#x27;clock shadow by mid-afternoon, but my skin feels much smoother.  But, don&#x27;t let them fool you.  It still takes me close to 10 minutes to shave which is no faster than the Norelco.  Also, I only get 3-4 shaves on a charge.  But, cleaning is easy - just use liquid hand soap and run it under water in the sink.  I am enjoying the shaver so far, I just wish I could get more shaves per charge.</li>
    <li> another hassle free purchase from amazon /i am very pleased with the shaver much better than my old one,have not tried the wet shave</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun high end shaver with the cleaning device for 4 years. First the cleaning device leaked all over the place and needed to be thrown away.  Then within days the shaver started having major problems also. (it&#x27;s like it had a 4 year fall apart timer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went to Amazon which is the first and best place to research items and found this Panasonic very quickly.  The reviews were overwhelmingly good and people recommended buying it without the cleaning device (even though it was a small price difference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had spent quite a bit of money on the cleaning of the old razor and I liked the look of this shaver (nice blue) I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way it was around $100 bucks on sale - which was fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Goatee and trim it with another device bought here.  For the rest of my face my hair is very thick and goes in every direction so it always takes a long time.  My neck hairs are particularly hard to shave and regardless of the shaver need several passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave with the Panasonic was fantastic.  It took 9 minutes which is close to what I&#x27;m used to, however when I felt my face I had never had a closer shave ever.  I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 30 years and this is by far the closest I&#x27;ve ever felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, the shave lasted a few more days without shaving and looked good proving that it really shaved much closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was the second time and it took about 7 minutes and I got just as close a shave. I didn&#x27;t clean it the first time since I figured it could go a few without cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got just as close a shave - I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the pop out trimmer which I need since I use it to trim the sides of the goatee it works very well.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews that it&#x27;s not that good but I have to say it&#x27;s much better than any other pop out trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  The only downside to it is that you do have to hold the shaver at an unnatural angle to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also today I decided to clean it.  I imagined a horror of steps and time to clean this since I&#x27;d been spoiled by the automatic cleaner for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is put some hand liquid soap on the shaver and press down for a 2 second turbo clean.  I found it worked like a charm and literally took less than a minute including rinsing it for a while longer. The next step which is to take off the top and run the blades under water could not be easier.  The top pops off VERY easily and running the blades through the water was 10 seconds.  Then you are supposed to lay both out to dry.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier.  I&#x27;ll put them back on later tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy not to be paying for the cleaner cartridges and yet still have a great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.  It&#x27;s by far the best you will find and you will not be disappointed.ral angle to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also today I decided to clean it.  I imagined a horror of steps and time to clean this since I&#x27;d been spoiled by the automatic cleaner for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is put some hand liquid soap on the shaver and press down for a 2 second turbo clean.  I found it worked like a charm and literally took less than a minute including rinsing it for a while longer.

    <li> I took a chance on this razor because my primary use was supposed to be for the top of my head, and not my face and I couldn&#x27;t find any reviews that addressed that application. I have had it for a week now and I absolutely love it. I take it into the shower with me and when I come out, all the hair that is left on my head are my eyebrows. Absolutely no irritation and I have a heavy beard, along with sensitive skin. Throw in the added bonus of my wife&#x27;s comment that likes to kiss me now because there is no \\&quot;pokey\\&quot; stubble on my upper lip and this razor is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This shaver for the money is the best value out there.  I contemplated buying the Braun but it was more than double the price.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one!</li>
    <li> I have tried many, 3 , electric razors in the past 15 years trying to get away from the expensive worsening quality blades.  This is by far the best and so far I think this will be a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have tried both electronic razors and the good old fashioned kinds over the years. I used a Norelco Advantage for the longest time but went back to blades a few years ago because it kept irritating my neck and never gave me a close shave in that area. Lately my skin has become really sensitive and it seems like Ive been cutting myself all the time with my Mach 20 or whatever the things called now. I decided to do some research on Amazon and see if I could find another electronic razor I might try out. After much debate I went with the Panasonic and after just the first shave I am certain I made the right choice! Never had a electronic razor give me this close a shave as this one does. Does a amazing job on the neck and under the chin.I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet but I was so impressed I wanted to go ahead and leave a review. Took less than an hour to get a full charge too! Give it a try if your on the fence. From someone who is very critical about products this ones a clear winner!</li>
    <li> excellent product. I had my first Panasonic for over 10 years, and it was still working when I bought this one. This is quieter and I receive just as good a shave. The only down side is that the case is a cheaper plastic. The older model was mostly metal, so you have to be a little careful handling it. I love being able to shave in the shower wet or dry with a pre electric lotion. The shave is as close as a blade with no real irritation. and I can just rinse the blades clean. I hope that I can get another 10 years from this razor. Also there is no reason to buy the mre expensive models with the self cleaning system, just an added unnecessary expense.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after my girlfriend bought me a Norelco three head shaver to keep at her house. I had never used an electric shaver before and the Norelco works pretty good but after reading reviews I thought I&#x27;d try the Panasonic to keep at home. I like it. I like that it&#x27;s waterproof and can be used in the shower. I think it does as good if not better job than the Norelco. The instructions for both say that it takes a while to get used to an electric and I&#x27;ve found that to be true. The Panasonic is easy to clean, a nice size and shape and it&#x27;s cool that it tells you the % of charge left and how long you&#x27;ve used it each time. I also prefer the shape of the head better than the three head type. I admittedly have limited experience with electric shavers but I&#x27;d highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I used to like Braun shavers up until their later 7000 and 8000 series shavers.  As a result, I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement shaver that does as well as Braun used to.  I purchased a [[ASIN:B00176V2SK Panasonic ES8228S Men&#x27;s Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Shaving System, Silver]] last year with two foils and an &#x27;A&#x27; outer foil design. Then I saw that this one was on the deal of the day.  So, I ordered.  While I like this shaver better than another Panasonic that I have for the shave quality, I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s noisier than the other Panasonic.  Basically, the A7 design isn&#x27;t that great on this razor.  The back of the shaver design pushes down and rattles against itself. However, barring this annoying noise, the shaver does work well and, in fact, works better than the previous Panasonic I bought.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the best Braun that I&#x27;ve owned.  Except that Braun&#x27;s new razor designs now are far worse than this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my previous Panasonic shaver, I have a cleaning system base.  I was hoping that this razor would at least charge and/or clean in that existing base.  Nope.  It doesn&#x27;t.  That said, you can at least put the razor in the base with the dryer setting.  So, you can wash the razor by hand and put it into the base and set it to dry.  I wish these razor manufacturers would realize that offering a separate cleaning system base (that&#x27;s compatible with all of their razors) is something that makes sense financially (an upsell option) and let&#x27;s consumers replace a broken base or buy a better razor.  Basically, they should make one style cleaning base that fits all razors even if the base design and features itself changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good shave, easy to use, three foils, trimmer, long battery life, wet/dry, can be washed easily&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Noisy, rattles (bad head design), no cleaning system  included (won&#x27;t even charge in one you may already own), doesn&#x27;t fit existing clean systems</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a long string of Braun shavers that I liked pretty well over the years. When it came time to replace the latest Braun, I naturally looked to get another one. However, the new models seem to get mediocre to mixed reviews, since being absorbed by P&amp;G.   Decided to try this Norelco based on mostly positive reviews. It has not disappointed. It&#x27;s less expensive than current Braun models, and works much better for me than my Braun&#x27;s ever did. I decided to forgo the cleaning and drying station, since this is a wet/dry shaver, so I can clean it under running water for free.  I wish the trimmer was a \\&quot;pop up\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;pop out\\&quot;, and I wish it was not on the \\&quot;back\\&quot; side of the unit. Aside from that minor quibble, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Stylish and functional. Reminds user to clean with dripping faucet symbol after many shaves. Charge lasts for many shaves. Close shave.</li>
    <li> Great product. This is my first shaver and it is great. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I think the battery should last a little longer. I dont shave everyday but for someone who does I can see how this would be a problem. Since I don;t shave everyday the battery isn&#x27;t a big issue for me. LOve the product, worth the money.</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing this model, I purchased a Panasonic ES8103 for about half the price.  I decided to purchase this one and keep the other in my travel bag and for back-up.  I thought this model  would be faster for shaving my face and head on an everyday basis.  This unit is more bulky and I feel like there is more plastic and other protrusions that feel like they are scratching my head as I shave.  I see marks on my shaven head as I use the shaver but they are temporary when they do occur.  All in all, I wish I had purchased a second ES8103.  Lower cost, shaves just as well for me and it&#x27;s actually lighter and easier to get behind the ears, etc.  Battery life is disappointing on both.  Prior to the Panasonic products I used a Philips / Norelco Rotary head razor.  They were great razors with better battery life but once I began shaving my head each day, the razor rash on my neck was just too much.  I thought my neck would get used to the triple header Norelco but it did not.  Both Panasonic models do not and never did bother my neck.  I&#x27;ll take having to charge the Panasonic units at least every week over the neck burn.  So now it&#x27;s now one year after purchase and the head on this unit broke.  The shaver foil on one end of one side of the head will no longer stay down.  The design on this shaver head is very flimsy.  In an attempt to to make a wider shaver head, Panasonic failed on this one.  In addition, it&#x27;s much too clumsy to be effective.  Amazon was very supportive in helping me take care of this as it has a two year warranty.  Today my second ES103 arrived.  It is actually called an ES103S now but is essentially the same model.  This will be my daily shaver and the older one will be for travel and backup.  My recommendation is now even stronger to avoid this model and go for the ES103S.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have been on a mission to find a great electric shaver for the past 6 months to replace norelco shavers that I have been using for years. Hated the norelcos as razor burn on the neck was the norm. Have trialed multiple shavers during the last few months (norelco 2d, braun 790cc) and even a few panasonics (ES LA63, ES8103). Hands down I have found the es8243 to be the best razor for my skin type (have been using now for about 4 months). I only use it wet with gillette sensitive skin shave gel but the shave is fantastic. Zero razor burn on neck. Misses a few spots under the jaw upon first past, but I have learned to get around that. I just bought a second shaver (on sale) as a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know they say it takes 2 weeks or so to adjust to a new razor. It took my one shave with this razor to know it was something special. Four months later, I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 1/24/13: Down grading review to 4 starts (more like 3.5 stars). After 6 months the shaver stopped shaving close and the display indicated I needed to replace the foil and blades. I had already ordered a second unit as a back up so I have been using the back up shaver for the past month. The second unit shaves close but is causing razor burn on my neck (the first unit never caused any burn). Very dissapointed that foil/blades only lasted 6 months and second unit does not shave with the same comfort as the first unit. I have since ordered replacement blades and foil to try. If this does not work I am planning to downgrade review more and switch to another shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 4/4/13: Will upgrade back to 4 stars for now. Bought a new foil and blades and it took about 1 month for my skin to adapt. Now getting a good shave with decent comfort. Still misses quite a few spots around the jawline. Im going to try the ESla93 again to see if it can give me a better shaver.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best shaver I ever used so far, close comfortable shave, quick charge of li battery, easy to clean and maintenance, esp. at attractive price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs at 13000 rpm vs ES-LA63 14000 rpm, the only difference I noted ES8243 is a bit noisy. what&#x27;s more, it has smaller shaver head for accurate shave.</li>
    <li> The razor does a great job. I had always used manual razors in the past because I could never find an electric that worked as well and that did not cost a great deal. I purchased this during the cyber Monday sale at a ridiculously low price of 74.99. It works better than any manual razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my last Baun but it&#x27;s lasted five years so far. Razor stubble falls out the razor during operation and blades are expensive-foil included. It does not operate with the cord attached to the razor which the Braun did. The Braun lasted ten years - just to give a reference.</li>
    <li> As an industrial designer I can appreciate quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purposefully bought one that didn&#x27;t have this complete 360 flex head as these break easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize that this one though had a durable, flex head that just flexes right/left but not 360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is amazing on it, instead of having some complicate color bars, it tells you with LED the exact amount of batter life left, tells you how many minutes you&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it has four blades, and the one in the middle is equivalent to using a razer.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me this as a gift. I started using electric razors in the early 1960&#x27;s, and have gone through many, many brands. I always felt that an electric would never equal the closeness of a blade razor, until I started using this Panasonic. It is truly a great machine. It shaves as close as a blade without the irritation. I would have to nitpick to find a negative, but if you must have one it would be the time between charges. My old Norelco held a charge of about 100 minutes, when fully charged the Panasonic holds a charge of about 50 minutes.</li>
    <li> love this shaver very easy to use and recharge and clean I have had many shavers and this is my favorite</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and they were right. Clean shave and easy to clean.  Had it for over a year now and no problems and close and better shave than the cheaper ones out there.</li>
    <li> It is working excellently. The only hitch I had was with the extra customs charge I had to pay on the item when it was delivered.</li>
    <li> My husband begged me to order this for him and he loves it. It recharges perfectly and he gets a close shave. He uses it to shave his head and his face.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a foil shaver for 40 years. I started with a Remington then an Abercrombie. This was a shaver sold by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch when it really meant something. I then moved on to a couple of different Eltrons, great razors in their time, well before Braun dominated the market. The last 3 or 4 have been Brauns. Good razors but my experience has been that the blades are pricey and I go through them faster than I would like. In addition a major complaint is I have had the trimmer break on the last three. Note that the trimmers get very little use in my case but are fragile and therefore problematic none the less. The two Brauns that I am comparing to this Panasonic are the Series 5 that I am confident is a huge seller. I bought it 2-3 years ago through Costco and it is still sold there today. The other one is an 8975 that is about 5 years old. I change the blades every 90 days and always use the cleaning system. I am a huge fan of the cleaning system. This Panasonic blows away the Brauns. If the more expensive Panasonics are better than this one then I will graduate at some point. This razor shaves FASTER, CLOSER and with GREATER COMFORT. It seems that the blades are sharper but maybe it is the higher RPM or greater torque I have no idea. The location of the trimmer is not as good as the Braun but who cares, the trimmers on both Brauns are broken just like on previous ones that I have owned. I have fairly heavy beard but certainly not the heaviest. Probably about a 3.5-4.0 on a 1-5 scale. Again in closing: Faster, closer and more comfort. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this razor, it cuts very close and is easy to clean.  He tried lots of razors and this is the best.</li>
    <li> I never liked regular blades, and I used a shaver like this one once 25+ years ago and hated it (pulled my hair, poor shave, terrible experience) Back then I used a Norelco rotary and the experience was much better. So for 25 years I have continued to use Norelco (up to my last the arcitec 1050). After continued frustration about shaving my neck, hair falling all over the place, and the blades getting dull, I decided it was time to look at the competition. This Panasonic had great reviews and so did the Braun series 7. This Panasonic was available for $95 on amazon with a coupon so I went with it (slickdeals has shown it with the cleaning kit for $70 once) but I didn&#x27;t want to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I charged it up right away (and like promised it was done in an hour). I then tried it and 24 hours later my beard is still very short (almost invisible) Normally with the rotary blade I show by end of day so 24 hours is quite an improvement. The areas this shaver was much better in (neck by far, not dropping all the hair, and easily clipping the extra long hairs that always show up in various spots). Also there was no pain or at least no more irritation than the rotary which was really good since I have very sensitive skin. Overall it was a great experience and Panasonic says I should wait 30 days for best results as it may take that long for the face to learn the new razor (it will be amazing if shaving improves from here). Well my 30 days are up after 1, I&#x27;m keeping what I&#x27;ve got, this Panasonic is the shaver for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver was much cleaner, easier to use, got all the tough spots especially my neck. The best shaver I have ever used. Another thing to note is that i have always shaved dry (just don&#x27;t like the mess of using shaving cream/gels, and this review is only about using the dry option. It&#x27;s great to know I can shave in the shower and with products as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric shaver for about 20 years and was on my second Braun when I decided it was time for a change.  I hadn&#x27;t realized what shaving my light-to-medium beard had become - a combination of the Braun electric shaver AND a blade to get the difficult areas as well as the close shave I desired.  Sometimes when I used the blade I ended up with nicks.  Suddenly it dawned on me that there surely must be a better way in the 21st century so I set off to find a reasonably priced wet/dry shaver that would do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews for the Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade shaver were overwhelmingly good so I took the plunge.  Having never used a wet rechargeable shaver before, I was intrigued.  My first shave was a dry one and it certainly outperformed my old Braun.  This morning I decided to give it a try on the wet shave and let me tell you - I got the MOST INCREDIBLE, CLOSEST SHAVE that I&#x27;ve had in years!!!!!  As smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and it handled my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas around the corner of my mouth and immediately under my nose.  I decided to use a clear shaving gel so I purchased Gillette Fusion ProGlide clear gel and followed the directions.  Rather than shaving in the shower, I shaved before getting in the shower.  I then just rinsed the shaving head and was done. This was at 9 a.m. and it is now almost 5 pm and I can&#x27;t feel any whiskers poking up yet. Still very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic shaver is relatively quiet (as compared to my previous Braun shavers) and is lightweight and easy to use.  The travel pouch looks useful and handy to have rather than rattling around in one&#x27;s sponge bag.  I know - after TWO shaves I&#x27;m completely sold.  I got an excellent dry shave and an OUTSTANDING wet shave with this shaver.  I&#x27;m sure results will differ dependant upon beard type, etc.  I would recommend this shaver without hesitation.</li>
    <li> My Norelco was dying on me so I was giving thought to switching.  Actually I was agonizing over it.  The fear of the unknown.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco rotary razors for that past 30 years or more.  Tried blade shaving a few years ago and just seemed to cut myself almost every time. Invested in good blades, brushes and creams but still couldn&#x27;t get the blade thing down without cuts.  My new Panasonic is quicker and closer than the Norelco.  Darned near as close as I could get with the blade.  Although it is a bit louder than the Norelco it isn&#x27;t really annoying.  Clean up is quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a tough, quick growing beard. This mows through it and I am finishing my shave in, usually, under 3 minutes.  Have used is with some of my shave cream as a wet shaver and those shaves have been very close. Obviously takes longer but was very happy with the results.  Also, going a week or more between charges.  Would recommend this for sure.</li>
    <li> I am in my sixties, have been a professional soldier and police officer, many fights, many scars.&lt;br /&gt;Past electric razors have never cut my beard growth close enough to \\&quot;pass muster\\&quot;, and blades always cut my many scars,(LOL)..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic cuts my beard growth in three minutes as close as a blade, without cutting my face!! I am amazed and pleased to have found this great little friend..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot go wrong with this razor for yourself, or as a gift..</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  I would recommend to anyone interested in a quality wet/dry electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Has a nice close shave and it works in the shower as advertised. Very happy with this purchase. Would Recommend.</li>
    <li> Having dealt with Remingtion and Norelco for many many years, I had come to expect the same old same old from shavers.  I took a chance on this new technology from Panasonic.  And I could not have been more pleased.  It would appear to me that R and N are milking their old technology and customers for as much as they can get, without innovating.  This Panasonic shaver is truly new and much better.  I believe this arises from the faster motor and linear technology.  The difference is that R and N are like a lawnmower, and the Panasonic is like a fine cutting instrument.  The most significant improvement for me arises from:  relief from razor burn, fast shave, cuts tough beard, charges fast, cutters last a long time, much easier to clean.  In all of these areas, the Panasonic outshines N and R.  I have also tried Braun.  But this technology is superior.  The cutting head is also a new technology.  It is as if Panasonic has left the others behind in the dust, almost like Apple versus the PC world.  We need to encourage such innovation in a field that has been dominated by laggards for over half a century.  Best of luck to you.</li>
    <li> Been shaving with the standard safety razor for 50 years.  After much comparison shopping, I selected the Panasonic ES8243A.  I just love the wet shave feature.  It may take a little longer to get a complete shave but the wear and tear of the safety razor on my face is eliminated.  It&#x27;s a breeze to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> I had the earlier version of this and it was fine but finally wore it out.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this one and the difference is amazing.  I shave with it dry and it&#x27;s very close to shaving with a blade. Quick and clean and painless.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really a great shaver!</li>
    <li> It takes several good minutes until it shaves away all the hair. Battery lasts for about 4-5 shaves at most.</li>
    <li> This is the second electric shaver I started using after many years of using a blade.  I use it exclusively dry.  This gives me a good close shave, even around the bottem of my chin which has always been a problem spot.  The spacing of the blades on the head of the shaver are a little to far apart to work on problems areas like the jaw, so you are really relying on one blade for these places, otherwise on the large areas it works well.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t work which it is being charged.  Also, when you clean it in water (which is the only way to clean it since the blade cannot be removed) you still have to run a Q-Tip around the base of the blades, and you have to let it dry overnight.  I suppose I don&#x27;t really have to let it dry all the way since it is a wet shaver too, but I tried using the shaver wet and didn&#x27;t like the feel.  Picky me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco for over 15 years and thought new technology would have come along to improve the shave so I hunted and after reading about this one I was sure it would be better. Wrong!!! I have had it for months and my Norelco shave faster. They all shave as close but I like faster and less effort. This shaver is not worth buying. I will dig my Norelco out of the going to Goodwill box and continue to use that. This one will be my back-up. I just wish they would all make the batteries easier to replace. I don&#x27;t like soldering in new ones but they last for years so I will still do that.</li>
    <li> I chose this item from the internet survey of the best shaver to purchase and the best place to buy it from - Amazon .com,  Everything was as expected - the merchandise is superb, delivered on time and the price was the best anywhere.  I will definitely use Amazon.com for further purchases.  This was my first experience.</li>
    <li> I have been electric shaving for forty years and this without doubt is the best shaver I have ever owned.  Over the years I have tried them all, the floating heads,  the rotary three blade system, even the much vaunted German models but none of them are a comparison to this model.  Totally recommended my model is two years old now and still shaves close and with minimum of fuss and at speed.  Closest thing to a wet shave and so good I&#x27;m planning on buying a second for that day when my current shaver finally fails!  Five Stars!  Seriously!</li>
    <li> The delivery was really quick.  The shaver works really well and leaves a nice close shave.  On sale it is a great deal.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I came from a rotary shaver, always a bit skeptical of this type. WOW should have made the switch years ago ! Meets all my expectations and then some.</li>
    <li> This shaver is excellent!!! My shave time is about 7 minutes. You do have to work problem areas like your neck and below your nose, but with No Irritation to my skin. Bottom line, I actually like shaving with this electric shaver and the end results is a Great Close Shave. Will never go back to shaving cream and old hand razors.I paid $98.00 and consider it money well spent. Never thought I would look forward to shaving, but with this shaver I do. Thanks Amazon and Panasonic for a Great deal.</li>
    <li> Seems to be perfect for my beard. would recommend to anyone wishing a smooth shave and the handiness of use</li>
    <li> Not satisfied, never got a good shave, wet nor dry.</li>
    <li> Guys, I purchased this Pani Wet/Dry ES8243 in September of 2011 and it is still running strong.  Right now, with daily facial use it will still go over week before needing to be recharged. I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in the battery life since I&#x27;ve owned it. In the past I&#x27;ve had some frustrating situations with electric shavers that would die during the middle of a business trip, etc. many of them just a year old. So far so good with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thicker than normal hair. I don&#x27;t think it is the thickest, but every hair stylist I go to comments on how thick my hair is. Last Christmas my mother-in-law commented to my wife about how thick my son&#x27;s hair was and my wife had to assure her that it was normal and he gets it from me. Before purchasing this shaver I used Gillette Mach 3s and would run through replacement packs frequently because it was the only way I could actually go through the day and have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow not show up early. Other electric shavers would never get close enough to give me that truly &amp;#34;clean shaven&amp;#34; look. This shaver is the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to a straight razor or a manual razor like the Mach 3. It really is a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shaver in both wet and dry conditions and in both it works really well, most of the time though I&#x27;m shaving dry. The shaver itself is a great machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screen read out is orange (kind of an odd color), but it is clear and tells you the battery life, time used for the shave, and a heads up when it needs to be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the shaving head is really just two shaving foils (you can see the picture on the amazon product images) which catch and cut the hairs that fall through the outer two &amp;#34;blades.&amp;#34;  Attached to the two internal foils are two arms which engage the two inner &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; when it turns on.  The lower inner blade (nearer to the face with on/off buttom) is designed to catch finer hair and the upper inner blade is designed for the thicker, longer stubble (nearer to the back where the flip-up long hair trimmer is). The flip-up trimmer has worked great for cleaning up hair around/on ears and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging cable is pretty basic straight cable. I wish it was more of a sturdy coil style with a thicker gauge wire, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been an issue and continues to work fine. That is just me being picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that it was coming up on the Black Friday deals and figured I&#x27;d do a write up in case any of you were looking at it. It is a worth while purchase if you are in the market or are looking to take a break from doing the longer routine of a razor. It would be a great Christmas present for a wife to get her husband too.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for three years and have bought them for my 2 boys two years ago and their razors, and they love it too.  I have had Norelco, Remmington and Braun razors, (before Braun was bought by Remmy).  Simply put you will be happy with this razor.  I will buy this model for my 85 year old Dad this year a product of quality that has not changed. That alone is hard to find these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits are topped by a 13k rpm for less pulling, (the #1 reason to buy),  also it&#x27;s easy to clean, blades and screen seem to last longer, quality, good ergo dynamics, simple rinse to clean, nothing extra to buy. Quality you don&#x27;t find in others.</li>
    <li> Wet shave w/ shaving cream tears up the skin and leaves red rash and soreness.  Hopefully dry shave will be better, however I bought this for the fact that it shaves wet and am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used previous generations of Panasonic electric shavers that were good.  This one is better.  I think it is as good as the best safety razors.  I haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving with it because I am totally satisfied with the quality of the dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for one month and am very happy with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that the older models had a charging dock which I liked better than the plug used by this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye to the ripoff that Gillette cartridges have become.</li>
    <li> If you want a great shave then buy one of these. It really is the best electric shaver I have owned in 36 years !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco triple head rotary razor for years and it finally died. Picked this one up and wonder why I didn&#x27;t do it a long time ago. Smoother, closer, quicker, quieter.....all around a great tool.</li>
    <li> I had an electric shaver 40 years ago and disliked it: poor shave and irritated skin. I finally decided to try a new one. This model was recommended by a web site dedicated to the posters to ten electric shaver. While near the bottom of the pack, it made the cut and was affordable. It shaves well with or without shaving cream and does not irritate. How times have changed. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. There are much more expensive shavers out there but this one does the job for me.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old Braun Shaver with the Panasonic ES8243A &amp; was pleasantly surprised by the faster shave plus smoother results.  The larger shaving head seems to have no problems getting to some of the hard to shave areas of my 70 year old face of tender skin.&lt;br /&gt;It charges quickly &amp; gives me 7 days of operation @ 1shave/day  of about 3.5 minutes. The shavers digital display leaves no doubt about the batteries freshness &amp; the shaver service interval which means cleaner heads &amp; fresher shaves.  I&#x27;m pleased I made the change from Braun to Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Wet or dry option is a nice feature at this price range.&lt;br /&gt;It good for travelling since it&#x27;s possible to shave multiple times before recharging (remaining battery % is displayed at end of each shave). Blade replacement is pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> So the picture here is a pair of shoes, a little concerned spending 100+ dollars buying this while the image is a pair of shoes!!!!</li>
    <li> Having had the shaver since January, I am very pleased with it.  Everything  said in reviews is true, so there&#x27;s no reason to repeat.  My only  minor carp is that I do not agree with those who said that there is no need for a second go-round. I have a light beard,  but I still have to go over parts a second time.  This is not necessary with my razor. Therefore, I&#x27;m reducing the rating to  4 1/2 stars for an othrewise superb shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the last Panasonic shaver I had that lasted about 15years! I never even replaced the blades in it but the battery finally reached a point that it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge very long. You pay for these shavers but it&#x27;s worth every penny given their lifespan and the smooth shave they provide.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ! Big improvement over my last electric razor. Faster, closer shave, quicker to charge and clean. What&#x27;s not to like? The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m sure there is better out there, but for the money I&#x27;m satisfied. i hope it has long life and not just another piece of planned obsolescence crap. I hate stuff that is designed to break down. Those foils are expensive to replace and I&#x27;m hoping these last for a decade or two.&lt;br /&gt;Con- feels like a cold wet tongue licking your face but I can deal with that. Maybe on future models they could incorporate a foil warmer?</li>
    <li> had two blade panasonic but due to beard courseness couldn&#x27;t get many shaves on one charge. the new four blade from panasonic is great along with head slick as the best alternative to shave cream. no irritation, as my wife says my new razor leaves my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> 20 years ago I decided not to try electric razors again. They were too painful and the shaving process was too slow. I decided to give it one more try after a long evaluation and having friends assuring the technology had improved. After a long research I selected the Panasonic ES8243A. I have to say that I am really impressed with this razor. When I was using manual razors I had to shave, at the most, twice per week due to my very sensitive skin. With the ES8243A I&#x27;m shaving every day. The shaver produces a very smooth and close shave with no irritation. I went from hating shaving to loving it and actually looking forward for a clean and shaved face every day of my life. I  have recommended  this shaver to my coworkers and friends. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best shaving results, I use the following shaving process:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face with Aveeno Face Wash (cost about $5 the tube, lasts a long time)&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply Electric Razor Pre-Shave solution to face. I use the one Walgreens sells, which compares to Williams Lectric Shave ($5 the bottle)&lt;br /&gt;3. Shave using the Panasonic ES8243A&lt;br /&gt;4. Wash face with water and apply Aveeno After Shave Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;5. Clean the shaver when it tells you to do it (around once per week, carefully follow the shaver instructions to properly clean it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested other methods and products (e.g. Baby powder, gels, dry, wet, other face wash brands, other pre-shave lotions, etc, etc..) but this is absolutely the best that worked for me. Note: I am an engineer so testing and evaluating is part of my DNA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final thing, any electric razor will produce irritation if you don&#x27;t follow the correct shaving process. This one is no exception. So follow the steps listed above and clean your shaver regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy a clean shaven face as much as I am enjoying mine now.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th electric razor.  I have extremely coarse hair and when I shave in the AM I have a &amp;#34;12 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.  Unlike most people&#x27;s descriptions, this did not get anywhere near &amp;#34;1 pass shave&amp;#34;.  I usually had to make many passes before  I didn&#x27;t feel any stubble.  The wet-dry feature is nice.  After almost 2 years of operation the back-side trimmer stopped working.  I have been shaving only once a week because I don&#x27;t like the irritation.  I use the back-trimmer first then the razor.  So this got low-to-moderate usage.  Still, 2 years is longer than any other electric razor has lasted me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because it did its job, not 4 or 5 because it did not do as good a job as claimed and took me about 10-15 minutes to get a good shave with this thing shaving once a week (it only takes 2-5 minutes with a straight-razor).  I don&#x27;t use shaving cream ever so I don&#x27;t know if that had any effect on the duration/effectiveness of this razor, I just use water when the razor permits.</li>
    <li> After using Norelco razors for about 15 years, i decided to try a different type razor. After a great of research I purchased this Panasonic razor and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It did take a couple of weeks for my beard to adjust to this razor, but shaves are close without pain.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the investment. I use it for my head - not my face - and it performs favorably. Whereas I used a regular razor and HeadBlade previously, both products often resulted in cuts that were annoying to say the least. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this electric shaver for my head, as it gets as close as blade without leaving cuts. Great product.</li>
    <li> hope they never stop making it.  I buy new blades about every 6 months because my beard is exceptionally heavy.  the high speed makes a great difference and makes it stand out from others</li>
    <li> I bought this because Panasonic has always been a reputable name brand in small appliances.  I love every bit of the razor, only if the rechargeable battery could last a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Bought this last year after being dissatisfied with two previous rotary razors.  The suggestion in the package is that you stop using your old razor until you&#x27;re accustomed to this one. Good suggestion because you hold this at a different angle than a rotary, more like a traditional (non-electric). In my book, this is a far superior shave to the rotary &amp; worth the money.</li>
    <li> Only two actual cutter blades on the body itself, not three. they count the cover as one of the blades, which for me, is a bit deceptive, but still, the razor does a good job of shaving my face. Leaves my skin pretty smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 4 electric shavers &amp; this one is the best by far. It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and it&#x27;s great that you can get it wet. I prefer to shave with a razor every 3 or 4 days but on the days that I have to shave every day, this works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my ES8068 (8+ years old) which was a fantastic shaver and as close as a razor, but no longer gives as close a shave, I think the head springs are tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver gives as good a shave as the ES8068, really is as close as a razor. (5 stars), however the construction, materials and design are only a 2 star compared to the ES8068.  This one has no charging stand, whereas the ES8068 had a induction (no chords) charging stand.  Also this feels flimsy, light and cheap.  I suspect it won&#x27;t last more than 2 years.  Wish I could find a way to replace the head springs on my old shaver, which BTW still holds a full charge.</li>
    <li> My hubby is bananas about this shaver. For years he struggled with razor burn and this, his first foray into electric shavers, has blown him away. Clean, close shave with no burn. Super easy to clean too. He shaves every day now and that works for me :)</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever had... of any kind.</li>
    <li> Great shave, have just about set my other razors aside.</li>
    <li> Husband getting used to using electric shaver... so far, so good</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for my son and he has enjoy it and will upgrade to this brand when the time comes.</li>
    <li> This razor is great.  To use it I wet down my face good with hot water, and then it glides smoothly and easily over my skin.  As soon as my skin dries out a bit, I add a bit more water, and continue on.  It&#x27;s fast, easy to use, pain free (unlike a blade, which is what I was using for years), doesn&#x27;t need messy shaving cream or pre shave lotions, lets me get close to my lips without fear of nicks, and overall is a great product.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, if I want to touch up my shave at the end of the day before going out, no problem, and no worries about shaving over skin still irritated from a shave earlier in the day.  It is also easy to clean.  I just pop off the top and run hot water over the blades at the end of every shave, and shake off the excess water.</li>
    <li> I have now owned this razor for over a year and have absolutely zero complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Even when shaving every three days or so (I grow a substantial Irish ginger beard) the Arc4 leaves my face smooth, with very few straggler hairs. Even better is the shave you get when pre-wetting your face and using a little foam (standard or gel) which I never used to do, but if I have time this is my current standard operating procedure.&lt;br /&gt;The razor charges quickly, holds a charge well, and washes easily. Also, I have sampled razors of twice the cost (Braun&#x27;s latest) and did not feel that the Arc 4 was inferior.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to anyone looking for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I bought an electric razor because I shave my face and head everyday and was tired of paying for disposable razors.  I was skeptical at how well an electric would do.  While it does not shave as close as a razor, I was surprised at how close it could shave.  It does a good enough job that I&#x27;ve made it my everyday razor.  One nice benefit is no razor burn!  I rinse/clean it often, which could be a concern if you travel and pack it away in a suitcase while wet.  It will start to get a little stinky.  So when I travel, I typically don&#x27;t rinse/clean it.  I bought it about 1 year ago and the razor function still performs well.  The sideburn trimmer is starting to wear out though.  The drive mechanism for it can jump out of alignment and thus not power the sideburn blades.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed in that function wearing out, but it probably won&#x27;t stop me from buying another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 2.5 years, and at first, it was giving me the greatest shave I had ever had. However, I am noticing that the replacement blade and foil packs I have been buying, don&#x27;t give as good as a shave, and do not last that long, as well as they are very costly, and not available at most retail outlets that sell shavers. I think I will go back to Braun, which is the brand I had been using for 10 years, prior to this purchase, simply because the replacement foil packs are less money, easier to find, and tend to last longer.</li>
    <li> It was easy to give this shaver a 5 star rating, for it truely exceded my expectations. I haev a very heavy beard and with the Panasonic shaver it was no problem.  My first shave with it was just good.  Every shave after that was fantastic.  My face was smooth and soft after the shave.  My wife enjoyed feeling how smooth my face was.  I can take into the shower with me and get a great shave too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The only negative is that it only holds a charge about half as long as my previous Panasonic razor, but then it charges back up about 100 times faster. So I guess the trade off is pretty good actually. Shaves very well and is easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I have tried several electric shavers and I was convinced that no electric shaver would ever come close to shaving with a blade until I bought the Panasonic. I previousely had to use a blade to finish my shave, but the panasonic gives me a close shave in comfort. I can throw my blade shaver away now.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun for years BUT this Panasonic is positively incredible. Braun never really worked, not on this wire cutting mission. In fact blades did okay but always irritated the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that Braun is a poor shaver, it&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t measure up, especially since it cannot get wet. The Panasonic excels in water and great out of it also. It pulsates at 13,000 beats per second and whiskers don&#x27;t stand a chance. In fact, l used my Son&#x27;s Pan, the much more ecpensive one at 14,000 rpm and this one, other than a fancier name and bling performs identically.&lt;br /&gt;Cherish your face, treat it kindly, reward it with this Panasonic. It will, really, astound you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver about 3 years ago.  It had great reviews.  I still use it everyday.  I am still on original blades and foil but have purchased them for when I need them.  It works very well with no pulling and cuts smooth.  Not as close as a razor but no cuts or abrasions.  I get about 10 shaves per charge and use it wet,dry and with either edge gel or with Williams electric shave.  It takes me 3 minutes per shave and an hour to fully charge it.  It has been dropped in the shower but nodamage was done.  They have a newer model now with more horsepower.  I am very happy with mine and much better than the NorelcoI had before.  The main difference is cleaning is a breeze in comparison and it has a stronger motor.  Never had Braun but it must be the closest competitor.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver several times a week and almost always in the shower. I have just passed the one year mark with it and am still as pleased as day one. The battery holds a charge for a long time and it is still going strong with no noticeable degradation of longevity. The manual says to replace the outer foil every year and the blade every two years. I am due for a foil replacement but I can&#x27;t tell based on shave quality. I would absolutely recommend this shaver to others in the market for a wet/dry.</li>
    <li> After years of shaving with Norelcos, I decided to try something different.  This razor is so much closer and faster it&#x27;s truly unbelievable. I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an Xmas present for my husband, and he loves it. He is VERY particular about razors, as to this day he has never found a brand that works for him - either electric, disposable or regular. Hubby has a very thick beard, and this razor actually works for him. He was very much amazed, and is a Panasonic believer now.</li>
    <li> My past shavers have all been 2 or 3 head Remington Titanium or Braun (or a razor blade for days I let it grow out).  This was my first Panasonic.  Like the Titanium best.  I bought this one because of the great reviews and I naively thought that buying a shaver over $100 would give me significant improvement over my others which all fell in the $50-75 range.  I was wrong.  I dry shave in the morning and sometimes at night as well.  I like a real close smooth shave.  Have had the new Panasonic for a month.  Used it only.  Brush cleaned it after each shave.  So far no major issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;Attractive looks and color&lt;br /&gt;Controls easy to use and understand&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics good for hand holding&lt;br /&gt;Fairly close shave, not many stray hairs&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Lights on front panel are entertaining, power level light is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;A little bit bigger than I expected, my others have the same shape but are smaller in overall size&lt;br /&gt;Takes twice the time to shave now - must go slow and repeat previously shaved areas (lengthy process)&lt;br /&gt;High pitch whine that can be irritating at times as you shave&lt;br /&gt;Screen can be a little rough, not as smooth feeling to the skin as my Titanium ones&lt;br /&gt;Head gets a little hot after awhile, so that is noticeable and sometimes uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;Areas shaved come back out real fast&lt;br /&gt;Areas shaved come back in mid afternoon very rough &amp; sharp feeling (scratchy stubble as if I razor shaved), my Titanium ones round the hair stubble when they cut and the hairs feel much softer with it at the end of the day (pleasant feel when rubbed) - with the Panasonic the stubble felt like sand paper by afternoon&lt;br /&gt;On/off button in the wrong location, right where I normally hold my thumb, have to be careful holding it&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the plastic protector and screen difficult to snap back on w/o a little force&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Okay shaver.  Would I buy it again?  No.  The Remington Titaniums are much better and are less expensive.  Maybe I&#x27;ll experiment with another brand next year.  BUT the price of a shaver is NOT a good indicator of the quality of shave.  Stick to what works best for your face and style.</li>
    <li> The shave is not quite as close as with a non-electric razor, but still very good.  It is so easy to use that I am done shaving by the time it would have taken to get my face prepared with a non-electric. Very easy to clean.  Charges very quickly and the charge last a long time. Lastly. the price through Amazon was terrific.</li>
    <li> Hubs loves this thing and his skin looks so much better.  Great purchase and I highly recommend it.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Have been spending a ton on Gilette Fusion blades. Have not used an electric shaver in 20+ years. My Dad called me to order this Panasonic for him. He was hearing good things about it. I ordered one for myself. Used it dry on a 5 day growth and wet in the shower with fantastic results.</li>
    <li> My beloved Norelco 3 head shaver died after 11 years, so it was time to purchase a new one. I suffer from sensitive skin and break out easily, so I had to put in the effort to find a replacement. My research led to this shaver and I have had nothing but a great experience. I rarely get nicked, the blades live up to the average of 3-4 months, battery life is still strong and my skin stays in shape.  My only complaint would be the trimmer. My previous Norelco had a solid sturdy pop-out trimmer. The other reviews of this product mentioned the same flaw: weak trimmer. However, since I do not need a trimmer that often, the razor gets a 5 star review from my end.  I can only hope this razor lasts as long as my other Norelco.</li>
    <li> While I imagine that this is a great shaver for anyone with coarse or bristle hair, for all you blondes - choose something else. Some of my facial hair, like on my sideburns, is bristly, and this shaver gets it just fine. However, any hair that is softer and more bendable, this shaver is fairly useless. I&#x27;ve had much better results shaving that type of hair with a regular razor or my friends shaver, one that has those 3 round rotating blade things.   TL;DR If you have soft facial hair, get something else.</li>
    <li> Like many, I&#x27;m always open to a better razor. Okay, not \\&quot;always\\&quot; since I don&#x27;t like spending money on a razor, but in general, I will buy a better razor if I think it will give me a closer shave.  For this review I&#x27;m going to try and be brief (for comparison see my review of the Norelco SpeedXL where I also mention my older Norelco just to put this review in context).  I&#x27;ve had an old Norelco for years (I&#x27;ve lost count). In that time I&#x27;ve bought and returned 3 electric razors. Two of them didn&#x27;t shave any better (both were newer Norelcos) than my old Norelco, and the other had some other annoyance I can no longer remember. Well I finally found a better shave in the form of this Panasonic!  It shaves closer and faster than my current Norelco! Now I dry shave, so I haven&#x27;t tried the wet-shave capability of this razor.  I have only one negative to say about this razor (otherwise I would call it a 4.5 star razor): it is messy! This thing does NOT capture the trimmed stubble like my Norelco. In fact, I&#x27;d venture to say that it captures maybe 20% of the stuble it shaves. What this means is that I&#x27;m regularly doing a quick rinse of my bathroom sink after every shave (yes I clean this razor, no its not full, and yes with my old norelco I almost never had to clean the sink). Because of this it is not a \\&quot;on the go\\&quot; shaver. For those of you that walk around (or drive) shaving, or bring it with you when you already have your nice clothes on, beware. Lean over a sink and be prepared to leave a little stubble mess to clean--or not, up to you :D  That said, I&#x27;m glad I bought this razor and my old norelco sits in a drawer as an emergency backup!</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Panasonic wet-dry shaver I have owned over the past 20 years or more. Without question, this is the closest shaving razor yet. I shave wet with gel and this razor skims across my face with less resistant than my six year old model that recently died. It is also a bit more quiet than precious models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism, and this is my fault for not reading the description more closely, is that this is a direct plug-in model. My last model had a drop-in charging base that charged though conduction and did not need a direct connection. Plugging in is a bit less convenient but the new batteries last longer so charging is less frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with the model.</li>
    <li> i had always used norelco shavers. ithought i would try something else. i read all the reviews on amazon and picked the panasohic 243a arc 4 and glad i did. best razor ive had.thinks amazon for the reviews. pw</li>
    <li> Genius! It removes the finest stubble down to an astounding level of smoothness.  The kind of shave that would be an achievement with any manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But... doesn&#x27;t work on anything more than the finest stubble. If you&#x27;ve forgotten a day or two, it&#x27;s doomed.  For whatever reason, some fraction of hairs over a certain length are just never cut by the thing.  So you think: hey! I&#x27;ll activate the beard trimmer. Big mistake: the beard trimmer will grab and pull (but not cut) any and all hairs if you attempt to do anything other than &amp;#34;square off the end of my sideburns&amp;#34; .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the extra-special joy of it:  the note from the manufacturer telling you that it&#x27;ll take 30 days for your beard to get used to an electric shaver. 30 days. Exactly off the end of the ability to return the damn thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d much much rather have an electric shaver that always delivers a B-minus shave instead of this one that sometimes gives an A+ shave (mostly when you don&#x27;t need a shave) , but fails if you actually need a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It fails miserably when there&#x27;s anything more than the finest stubble to remove.</li>
    <li> Bad razor for men with thick or heavy facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works OK; I have used panasonic&#x27;s electric razors for years, but this one never gave me a close shave.  If I had an evening event, I would not shave until noon, so I would look presentable at 6.  My older Panasonic razors did a better job.  This is definitely a middle of the road level razor; not worth more than $80 IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last Panasonic lasted 3-4 years, this one only lasted about 1yr. My thick whiskers against the cheap foil, equals big holes in the foil.  I just upgraded to the Braun 960cc-4 ($145) and you can tell the quality difference in manufacturing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Panasonic shaver for a steal during the black friday sales on amazon. What a deal!! Charges quick and holds a charge for a weeks worth of daily shaving or more! I prefer to use the wet option, using shave gel just give your skin that little extra moisturizing and smoothness. Love the pop out sideburn trimmer too! Sleek styling and fits nicely in your hand and is super easy to use! There&#x27;s a reason this shaver has over 1,200 reviews and a near perfect rating!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This is easily the best electric shaver I have owned.  It works great both wet or dry, holds its charge very well and produces a good shave.  I don&#x27;t always shave electric, but when I do its with my Panasonic ES8243A.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, works extremely well wet or dry.  I have difficulty with my neck and throat area due to a number of surgeries which left uneven surfaces, other unnamed wet and/or dry razors were nowhere near as comfortable.  Several other reviewers mentioned the Billy J products for shaving and moisturizers, they work extremely well for me with this razor.  It&#x27;s actually a pleasure to shave.</li>
    <li> Switched from a rotary razor to this Panasonic.  Very close shave.  Works great as a dry shaver.  Highly recommended razor.</li>
    <li> Kind of pricey for the job it does. I hate shaving so I wanted to get something electric rather than blades but it never shaves a close as the blade and does not seem to shave if the hair is a little longer than normal.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shaver for about one year and am very pleased.  My personal experience is that it shaves closely without skin irritation, cleans easily, the shaver has a battery power level indicator, is light to hold, small enough to store conveniently, the battery lasts and recharges relatively quickly.  No breakdowns thus far.  Keeping the razor clean will enhance your experience with this and similar shavers.  Good company with parts and supplies readily available.</li>
    <li> The razor died on me after three years of consistent use. I call it a good run given how harsh I am on them.  Far and away, this is the best electric shaver I have ever used. I have used every brand but Braun - too expensive for me. I have very thick facial hair and the Panasonic razor sliced right through it.  I averaged about 4 minutes for my shave and I always shaved wet (using just hot tap water - no lotion or cream).  I get razor burn very easy but never from this product. No problem giving it 5 stars.  I have already bought the next generation Panasonic razor. I am sold on this brand.  Thanks Amazon reviewers for guiding me to this product.</li>
    <li> Following a heart attack, my husband was told to give up a safety razors (because of bleeding).  He has been through  countless electric razors which has been a pretty costly experience.  I think he has finally found a winner.  What&#x27;s left behind is the pulling, missed spots, and chafing to say nothing of the accompanying complaints.  So glad to have my happy husband again with smooth, kissable cheeks.  Anther marriage saved!</li>
    <li> I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars. Every once in a while it grabs onto my hairs and pulls on them which is fairly painful. I have to use it in an awkward manner in order to avoid this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a problem with other shavers pinching and pulling switch to this one as it does it less.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best electric razor I have ever used in my life. very smooth and sharp blades, great lighting indicators (charge level, etc).</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my husband.  He is very pleased with it and uses it all of the time.  He likes that he can quickly have a close shave using this razor.</li>
    <li> Bought the razor in April 2011 for my son. It appeared to miss spots so I tried it myself and found the same problem. I thought I was buying a good shaver because of the reviews but for a dry shave it did not perform. This is a late review because the foil needed replacement after two holes formed. Panasonic charges sixty dollars plus shipping and tax and twenty dollars for blades. Razor is expensive to operate.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin on my neck.  Many top named electric razors left a slight rash an irritation.  The Panasonic ES8243A is a great close cut and no irritation on my neck.  Really love it.</li>
    <li> Great product, however not the best as I struggled a bit to get a clean shave on neck and under chin area. I grow very thick beard and suffer from skin irritation from Mach 3 use everyday. This shaver is certainly good for those who do not grow a thick beard and the skin sensitivity issues, but may not be worth for some.</li>
    <li> I have never had an electric razor I liked as much as this one. I have tried many; corded, rotary, battery operated, wet/dry, pretty much any configuration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have to go through a “transition”phase for a week or two, where my skin is irritated when switching from a blade to the electric. Not so with this Panasonic. From the very first shave, no irritation at all, just a smooth, clean, close, comfortable shave. I may have to buy stock in Panasonic  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave both my face and my head with it ... Usually in the shower, sometimes over the sink for a quick touchup. Always happy with the effortless result.  It is also the first wet/dry shaver that shaves my skull totally smooth, without the need to tweak the shave here and there with a blade.  That, to me, tells me I made a good choice. I may be getting smarter as I age!  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the trimmer pop-out on the back works well. Sometimes I sport a mustache and goatee. The trimmer is a great tool for creating a nice straight line on the bottom of the mustache, getting rid of the little, straggly hairs. And, completely off topic ... why does white hair in my beard grow faster than the dark hair? Never understood that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think anyone would be happy with this fine grooming tool. It is of a decent weight, and is easy to hold and use, even in the shower, and easy to clean. One caveat; won’t run when plugged in to recharge, which, by the way is very fast. Nothing is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope your experience with it is as positive as mine is.</li>
    <li> Bought this item as a replacement for  Braun shaver that conveniently died (literally, the motor stopped working) two months after the two-year warranty period ended. I have been using it for three weeks and I am very satisfied with its performance. The cut is close and stays close all day. The head is versatile enough to handle both the mustache area and the neck with ease.</li>
    <li> Worth way more than I bought it for....</li>
    <li> great shaver, I use it in the shower. For me it is less irritating wet</li>
    <li> Works well, I prefer this to norelco rotary units.</li>
    <li> It is the 2nd one I have purchased for my husband. He really like it. Says he doesn&#x27;t need anything else.</li>
    <li> (I am not Linda, I bought this under my wife&#x27;s account.)&lt;br /&gt;This razor does a fine job of giving a smooth shave.  It&#x27;s not a one pass clean shave though, I need a good 5 or 6 passes to get that last stubborn hair. I was worried because one reviewer said it couldn&#x27;t get close under the nose, but I have found it does a very good job under the nose; a lot better than my rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is the best I have ever had and does a good job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write a review often, but i must for this shaver, i was using norelco 3D sensor for about a year and it wasn&#x27;t giving me a close shave on my neck,  my face was good, i thought trying a different shaver, i started reviewing different shavers, i tried the Braun 5 series, it was ruff on my face, then i tried the panasonic E8243A and i was very impress with the way it shaves, smooth and very close, hands down the best shaver out there, one advise you have to give it 2 to 3 weeks to get use to your skin. i&#x27;m using Williams Lectric Shave lotion.</li>
    <li> My entire adult life I used Braun shavers, and always loved their effectiveness.  They were designed intelligently and I had no difficulties with them, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tempted by the 14,000 RPM linear motor I decided to give Panasonic a try.  Sorry I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fancy shaver with its sophisticated display fails in its basic function - shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It can&#x27;t trim any hair that is not absolutely perpendicular to the skin.  My $20 battery operated el-cheapo Braun is called more often than not to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;*  The side trimmer is designed by a novice and must be used in only one direction to not fold back on itself while grinding the gears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that fancy display?  Not very smartly done either, showing charge level and other indicators for only a few seconds then shutting itself off, and blinking incessantly when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor can it operate while plugged in, so if your battery is down you are out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general this is an example of engineers not thinking problems through to design a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Brauns.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic shavers for 12 years.  Of all the electric shavers I have ever owned this is by far the best one.  It nicely fits in my hand and gives the smoothest shave.  Also, Amazon offered the best deal on the internet.  I am very pleased to have purchased this item.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for almost 50 years (I&#x27;m 80 now). I think they all have been NORELCO&#x27;S and they do a so-so job. But this Panasonic is fabulous. I got it about one month ago. It&#x27;s vastly superior and most important - it does everything the ad promises. I&#x27;m sure glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of electric shavers over the years and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. Feels very good in the hand, charges quickly, comes with a nice travel case and is perfect for life on the road--Super soft on the face too with a lock in mode my hard to reach places. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> By far, this is the best shaver I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 years with no issues. I paid $96 back then and it&#x27;s now about 10 bucks more. For half price I can get the inner blades and outer foil, basically will return this shaver to it&#x27;s original glory for 50% off! What a deal! Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my Panasonic ES8243 and I&#x27;d buy it again without hesitation and research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I purhased the Panasonic ES8243A. For travel it proforms as advised, easy to clean and pack for travel. It holds stronge againist the Norelco SenoToch.</li>
    <li> I recommed this product. Great product for the price and quality.....Shaves as good as you can get for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for slightly over a year and it&#x27;s by far and away the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. It is very comfortable to use, creates a very close shave, whether wet or dry; and is effective and painless whether used for half a day&#x27;s growth or 4 days&#x27; worth. I should add that before using this, I had a beard for several years ,mainly because I didn&#x27;t like shaving. When the facial hair started making me look a bit old (64 at the time) I looked around and discovered this. I would give it 4 1/2 stars rather than 5 if I could, for a couple of small reasons. Although it charges fast, it doesn&#x27;t really last a week, let alone 14 shaves and the case doesn&#x27;t have room for the charger, which is needed for any trip over a couple of days. Not very serious. I just purchased a replacement outer foil, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to need it yet after a year. My previous Braun needed this changed every 6 months. It&#x27;s easy to find them at a reasonable price, too. Some extra pluses are the notifications of the need to clean (very easy and fast), change blades, % charged, etc. A first rate product!!!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would discover an electric shaver that would actually do a good job on my neck. The previous electric shaver I had was good for shaving a maximum of three days before I had to use a conventional razor to get the fine hairs off my neck. Since buying this shaver, I have yet to used a standard razor. Happy camper.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, and the effect is great. It is my best shaver than before, I am very glad to have it</li>
    <li> Smooth, quieter and holds a charge better than the last one I bought. This is the 3rd Panasonic shaver I have purchased over the last 15 years and it is the best, by far. Good shave, comfortable to hold also.</li>
    <li> My husband and son really like this shaver. Easy to hold and works well with heavy beards. Nice case and charger included.</li>
    <li> First time using an electric razor, I have a thick beard and this shaver works just as good as my mach 3 razors with no pain.</li>
    <li> I wish I had purchased this much sooner. It provides a very close, comfortable shave with no facial irritation at all. It is somewhat louder than other electric shavers because the speed of the shaver is very fast, but isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me. Overall, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Is this razor a joke because i totally wasted my money on this one . it doesn&#x27;t even shave light hair it&#x27;s terrible!</li>
    <li> I had been using the Remington Titanium MS3 series razors for the past 20 years. The shaver was good but the trimmer was a poor design and always breaking. I decided to try something different and was encouraged by some of the reviews on the Panasonic. They were spot on. The shaver with it&#x27;s pivoting head was fantastic. It gave a great close shave without any razor/skin irritation. Very ergonomic handle, easy to use and clean. Trimmer is a much better and sturdier design. The blades work well enough that you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area six times to get it very close. I shave strictly dry so can&#x27;t comment about the wet function. I have seen the light and been converted. Panasonic RULES!!!</li>
    <li> I have been dry shaving using Remington triple foil shavers for the past 20+ years. Have tried others, but always went back to the triple foil (MS3) type as it gave me the best dry shave. As far as I can tell, Remington no longer manufactures the MS3 model, so it was a choice between buying a refurbished model on eBay or trying something new. I did try 2 models of rotary shavers (Norelco and Remington) and neither one gave a close or comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES8243A came up for sale and decided to give it a try knowing that there was a Panasonic \\&quot;good shave\\&quot; guarantee for 30 days. There was no need to worry. The first couple shaves wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked the trimmer or the feel of the shave, but as I got used to the shaver over the first week found that it was giving a faster and closer dry shave than I&#x27;d had in a long while. It charges fast (1 hour) and am getting appx 5 days of shaving from a charge. Love the timer and the \\&quot;percent of charge\\&quot; indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 5 star shaver. Am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have found that I prefer the shave and quality of panasonic electric razors.  The rotary (circle head) types don&#x27;t work well for me.  This one is similar to my last two razors, but it is more expensive.  I was hesitant to spend this much because last time I bought an expensive razor like this the head was so &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; and wobbly I hated it.  Also the shave it gave was not great.  This shaves nearly as close as a razor blade.  I have pseudo foliculitus barbae and this razor has not caused me problems desipite its very close shave.  Also it does not irritate my skin.  At less than half it&#x27;s retail price I feel it is a good value.  If you are new to electric razors vs conventional &amp;#34;triple blade&amp;#34; type shaves you might not love it.  Electric razors take a bit more time going over areas to get all the hairs if your beard is course and lays down in places.  Also the shave is not quite as close as a blade.  So don&#x27;t blame my opinion if you switch from a blade and don&#x27;t like this razor.  But if you have PFB or are used to an electric I think you will also like this product.</li>
    <li> After using a little more than a month,  this is the best electric razor that I have ever owned. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This uses proven technology 4 blade wet and dry, is quite small for travel and does not have a bulky charger.&lt;br /&gt;It charges from 110 to 240 v. Sale price at US$80 was great and didn&#x27;t last long. Performs well.</li>
    <li> panasonic shaver works very well and have no complaints. will probably purchase a another if anything should happen to this one.</li>
    <li> More pleased with this razor than I even expected.  If it has the endurance to last a couple years, it will be worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> Good. it is very good so far. I use it regularly. I love it. I definitely recommend it. Worth it..</li>
    <li> My husband really loves this razor.  It gives him a quick, smooth shave, especially wet.  He doesn&#x27;t get quite as good a shave dry.</li>
    <li> Very close shave (nearly as good as a blade), long battery (14 shaves / charge) and lightweight. Big improvement over last model.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and this shaver does a wonderful job. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean. I use Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shave cream with it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Closest, most comfortable shave I have ever gotten from an electric. Very happy with this product. Since I am allergic to shaving cream, I have used it dry only, but it works great. Cannot not be used while charging, however, it charges up unusually quickly--only 10 minutes for enough charge for a single shave, only about an hour for full charge. Got a great deal on Amazon during Black Friday sales. Had been using a cheap Braun. The Panasonic is infinitely superior and worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> If I could rate it higher, I would. I use it in the shower with shaving gel and it&#x27;s smooth and the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> My husband finds this a good razor.  I thought it reasonably priced in a very very costly market. He has used it several years.  But razors are one of those things that different individuals make different demands on...so I can not really opine.</li>
    <li> Simply a great shaver in all aspects</li>
    <li> Not for me I can use single blades...</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco electric shaver at one time and then switched to the new vibrating Gillette triple blade shaver. I main bought this to complement the Panasonic body groomer. This shaver gives a closer shave than a blade shaver. It&#x27;s very convenient to shave in the shower given the wet/dry capability. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> On the basis of decades of experience using various electric shavers it is clear that this is one of the very best available. It is quiet, sharp, and works very well. I would gladly buy another one today.  I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who appreciates great electric shavers!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco (various models) and Braun during the last 20 years.  I was never pleased with Braun.  So I was debating whether to go for another foil type shaver.  Having read review about Panasonic, I thought I will give a try.  This unit works really well, much better than Braun.  I still have a Norelco.  The main drawback of Panasonic shaver is the battery dies with no warning.  Well the previous reviewers had written about it.  That is when my Norelco comes handy.  All in all,three months of use, and I would say I am reasonably satisfied.</li>
    <li> Generally I hate shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to spend as little time shaving as I can ... and my old electric razer really hurt and it was a chore just to shave. Especally if I had gone some time between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this I can quickly and easily shave. It does not hurt &amp; I don&#x27;t mind a quick one minute shave each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it because I am acctually keeping  myself facial hair free now.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving so i need it to be fast and good. whether i wait one day or five, this can handle it. And I love how I can use it wet or dry depending on how sensitive my skin is feeling. i do need to flip out the trimmer to get some stubborn neck hairs, but all in all it&#x27;s a great shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first electronic shaver I have purchased and its great! It used to take me about 15 minutes to shave with a traditional razor but now it only takes about 5 min with this one and I still get the same close shave. I now have the option of shaving wet or dry which I enjoy greatly. It takes about a month for your facial hair to get used to this shaver but its totally worth it and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Panasonic 8243 Electric Razor. Love this razor. I only wish the head and blades sharpness lasted longer. The replacement head and blades cost about $50.00 I purchased a second 8243 razor. I have had my first one for a couple of years. Works great especially when the head and blades are brand new. The purchase of two sets of head and blades cost almost as much as the razor new.I use this razor to shave my head and beard. It gets just as close as a blade in my opinion. Have recommended this razor to friends.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in years but with the cost of blades there is no match today. Clean smooth shave, wet or dry. Long battery life and the sideburns trimmer is a must.</li>
    <li> I use it for shaving my head plus my face it handles both areas well. It charges fast and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Nozzle gets hot quickly, but provides a good shave.</li>
    <li> Very happy with shaver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through all the brands searching for the perfect electric shaver. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever used. This is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used. Quiet, lasting charge and very good shave.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of this shaver, including a gift. It is the quietest, closest-shaving, fastest-shaving shaver I have used, and I&#x27;ve been using electrics since 1970. Usually I replace the cutters and foil head (which also contains cutters) about every two years. Expensive, but cheaper than a new shaver and the unit then runs like new. Eventually the shaver will get &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; and begin making more noise and lasting a shorter time on a charge - signs to start thinking about replacement. Although I don&#x27;t shave wet, that feature makes the shaver really easy to clean, which I do once a week before charging. I draw the line at having to store a shaver in a stand, and this unit is the best available on this side of that line.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. If it ever wears out I&#x27;ll get another.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME, I USE IT DAILY AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY AND EVERYONE. THIS PRODUCT WAS ALL IT CLAIMED TO BE AND MORE !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> He LOVES this shaver!  And I love the results!  I purchased it because of the reviews I read and am glad I choose this one.</li>
    <li> I just love my shaver. In 3 minutes ready to go. Cleaned in a few seconds, even with water ....</li>
    <li> I highly recommend purchasing this shaver. My face usually hurts after shaving with a rotary shaver or a blade.  I have been using the Panasonic for a month and shaving daily has become a pleasure.  Battery life is good and cleaning is quite simple.</li>
    <li> If I&#x27;d known how much better this is than my old razor, I would have bought it years ago. My old shaver was a P.O.S., but I was too cheap to upgrade, so I only shaved a couple times a week. The motor on this is so much faster, and I can&#x27;t feel any irritation at all when using it. I have used it wet and dry, and although the wet shave (with water, soap or shave cream) is smoother and more comfortable, it takes about twice as long. A dry shave, or with just a little water on my face, works well enough to get me out the door, and I get no irritation that way. I had my dad use it to compare to his rotary, and he loved it too. The battery lasts a long time, and it charges quick. I used to have to keep my old shaver plugged in the whole time because it got noticeably slower as I used it. Not true with this guy. I will probably stick with Panasonic for all future shaver purchases.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do--good shaves, day after day and year after year. It&#x27;s not quite as close as a razor but it is close.</li>
    <li> As a blade user for over 50 years, I tired of the mess and the nicks and read the reviews on this Panasonic Shaver. I&#x27;ve used it over a month now and love it and have absolutely no negative comments. It gives a good shave, is easy to use either dry or in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;It will go about 8 days with a single charging and I like that it totally recharges in about an hour. Comfortable to hold in my hand and is far superior in all respects to the few lower-priced Norelco shavers that I&#x27;ve had over the years (only used once a week or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend for a quick and good shave.</li>
    <li> let me just say that I am a person who has very sensitive skin and every time i used to shave with a razor, my face (especially the neck area) would look like a bloody mess. it was so bad that i stopped shaving and grew a beard which i then used a trimmer to keep it clean. after reading all the reviews on amazon i thought i should give this shaver a try. let me tell you something before you buy this... PATIENCE IS KEY!!!! i cant stress enough! they tell you that your skin will need a couple of weeks for it to get used to, well since my neck was so sensitive it took me about two months which is why i waited so long to write the review. I kept seeing improvement but not dramatically so i said to my self what have i got to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so to summarize it all, if you have bad or sensitive skin, hate using the razor, and want the whole shaving experience to be over quick then i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Electric Shaver works great.  Clean shave with no nicks or cuts.  Only problem, minor problem, is battery life.  I need to recharge after 7 or 8 days, not the 14 in the docs.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical, since I normally wet shave and haven&#x27;t used an electric for many years. The last electric shaver I tried was something cheap, with the three circular blade form factor. I went with this shaver due to the reviews, and wow I am glad that I did. Shaving dry was super comfortable, and pretty well on par with when I wet shave. This absolutely will replace the need to wet shave with a razor - it will change your life (as much as making shaving quick and enjoyable can).</li>
    <li> bought this shaver to replace another panasonic i had for a few years.  similar type shaver.  linear motor.  provides a great shave, almost as good as a real razor, but without the irritation.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the many reviews.My husband likes it  and he has a clean shave after every shave</li>
    <li> I recommend it, so far its great. It has the horsepower, the right size head, and the ease of cleaning, and half the price of the next highest rated shaver.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is great for in between shaves wouldn&#x27;t use this for regular shaving but its great for the a little clean up.</li>
    <li> Previously, I always used Braun electric razors.  I was hesistant about buying this, but the reviews were pretty good.  After using this for about 2 years or so, I can give you my review.&lt;br /&gt;As far as cutting and using the razor, I think it works just as good as a Braun.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have 2 complaints about it.  For one, it is VERY noisy.  This is by far the loudest razor I have ever owned.  Second, because the motor spins so fast, I find that I can only get about 2 uses out of it before the battery is almost completely drained.  As long as you know this, it&#x27;s not a big deal I guess.  The digital display tells you how much battery life (in percentage) is left, so you can keep an eye on it.  Also, my previous Braun razor allowed me to still use the razor when the battery was dead as long as I plugged it in.  This one does not do that.  So, if the battery dies and you are in the middle of shaving, you have to wait for it to charge up.  In it&#x27;s defense, it does charge up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this as a wet shaver, but it is easy to clean because of the way the head is all sealed up under the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent razor.  Would I buy it again?  Probably not.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to Braun.  I like my quiet razor.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver. I use it both wet and dry. Leaves my face very smooth. Holds charge for about 5 shaves.</li>
    <li> This product has been beyond my expectations in regard to the closeness of shave and the easy use procedures. I have been extremely satisfied with the product and will recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Having tried all the main brands of shaver this is my second Panasonic! As far as electric shavers go this is strides ahead!</li>
    <li> This is the second electric razor I have purchased for my guy.  The first was a very expensive Norelco that he really disliked.  It didn&#x27;t cut the beard and he could never get it cleaned.  The Panasonic cuts the beard and around the mustache and can be cleaned.  It also cost a lot less money than the  other piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying the Panasonic ES8243A shaver.  I used a little Afta pre-shave lotion (I highly recommend this also)and I must say I was very impressed with the closeness of my shave.  I really believe it is the closest shave and also in the quickest time ever, less than four minutes!!</li>
    <li> Extremely Noisy and mediocre shaver. I have used it for over six months now, and I found it to be very annoying.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor. This is the best electric razor I have owned and I feel it is a bargain for about $100 (I paid $104).  It provides an extremely close shave (far superior to my previous Norelco and Braun shavers).  I like the fact there is no need for a separate charging station/cleaning unit, the supplied power cord charges the razor and you use liquid soap to clean it... really simple.  I don&#x27;t have anything negative so say about this razor.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve dabbled with electric shavers and have never been satisfied enough to make a permanent switch to them, but this Christmas I received a Phillips Sensotouch 3D as a gift and it really surprised me. This immediately got me to thinking about picking up a new top of the line foil razor since I&#x27;ve always gotten better results from them than I ever got from a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic arc IV was highly regarded and it has a price that simply can&#x27;t be beat, if you get a Braun 7 Series you&#x27;ll be spending twice as much for, in my opinion, an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shave itself was magical, the first use was a dry shave with Afta pre-electric (strongly recommend it) and it obliterated whiskers so quick I was shocked, even on my neck where foil shavers usually struggle it handled it all with ease. The result was a baby butt smooth shave that took 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this thing really shines though is using it wet with a low lather shaving gel. Then it gets moved into a whole different realm of smoothness, it literally feels like you&#x27;re not even removing hair. Using it wet also makes the shaves last longer, nearly as long as a blade shave. The only downside is it takes about twice as long once you factor in clean up and prep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your trying to decide between the Series 7 and the Panasonic, go with the Panasonic. You&#x27;ll save money and get great shaves.</li>
    <li> Not cracked up to be all that good.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty noisey, and has fine hair clippings&lt;br /&gt;that come out on your face as your shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this in May of 2013 (from Amazon.) In early January 2014 it gave up. It started switching between regular speed, ultrasonic, and off in half second or so intervals. The display shows gibberish. Normally this would be a one star, but I have to admit I liked it when it did work. It is too pricey to replace every seven or eight months so I won&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
    <li> I have not used the wet shave..doesn&#x27;t appeal to me. I use it with a dry shave and it is pretty good.  I wanted something I could use quickly and not have to buy razors anymore.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Had old rotary shaver (not Panasonic), worked ok for a while. This shaves closer and faster than others I have owned and is easy to clean plus charges fast.</li>
    <li> Very surprised with the Panasonic Arc 4 shaver&lt;br /&gt;I should have tried this shaver long before. I have a very sensitive skin and had a bad experience decades ago. The head is such that the surface which has a contact with the skin is almost entirely the blades, hence causing no drag. To me it is the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> Not an electric shaver guy at all. Actually bought this for my 93 yr old so he wouldn&#x27;t cut himself so much. He didn&#x27;t like it--&amp;#34;old habits are hard to break&amp;#34;.  So, I took it home and am very impressed with it.  Still use my normal razor but, when I&#x27;m in a hurry or lazy the Panasonic is great. Charge lasts quite awhile and every easy to clean.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The Razor is fantastic! I was using the old shaving cream and razor for 20 yrs, I decided to give this a try because I was tried of t spending $$ on razors and shaving cream as well as razor rash. I gave my face a month to adjust to the razor like the manual stated. I had to send it back to Panasonic to repair the trimmer, and have had to switch back to the old razor and shaving cream for 2 weeks now. I cant wait to get it back!</li>
    <li> As the review title says, I shave my head as well as my face with this little gem.  In the shower with some body wash, dry, with some Lectric Shave pre-shave conditioner, doesn&#x27;t matter.  Takes a week or two for your skin to adjust, but when it does this thing is awesome.</li>
    <li> On the many days when I no longer choose to blade shave, this Panasonic electric model does a better job at providing an acceptably close, clean, and certainly convenient shave than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  It works just like it is supposed to, seems durable, holds a charge well, cuts close, easy to clean, the blades are sharp and you have to be careful and not too rambunctious when you shave or you can pinch skin and cut yourself.  This shaver works much better than my Braun, and I specifically bought this because it is made in Japan, not China.  I prefer made in USA but there is not much made here any more, and made in Japan is a far better choice than made in China.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. I had the predecessor Panasonic product for the past 10 years and loved it. Other than the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; cleaning mode and improvements in the shave head this version of the product looks and feels like it&#x27;s predecessor and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> The panasonic shaver charges quickly and holds a charge longer than any electric shaver that i&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> This is my first Panasonic shaver, and it is close to perfect.  Less expensive than Braun (a lot), no pricey cleaning solution to buy, and the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years, with no skin irritation.  I liked it so well that I bought another, more expernsive Panasonic model shaver for my son, which is just as good. Goodbye forever, Braun.</li>
    <li> Have been Remington user for years.  This shaver gives better cut, easier to use and clean.  Much faster charge.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best alternative for guys (Like me) who have bald heads. I simply got tired of using a razor. I found it to be too time consuming and dangerous (cuts and nicks) during early morning shaving. This shaver is simply the best. It gives the same feel of a razor without the nicks and cuts. I have tried to use it wet but it works best for me using it dry! Give it a try and I promise you you wont go back to using a razor. It is expensive but have you seen the cost of razors lately!!!!  Worth every penny. Im writing this review because reviews of this product was the deciding factor during my quest to find the best electric shaver. Needless to say I have found it. Feels great to find something that works as described!! Five Stars</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father for xmas last year. He loves it and to this day uses it. Got this and extra accessories for it</li>
    <li> The product is a bit less than what I expected from an electric shaver, but my expectations were as clean a cut as a razor blade so doesn&#x27;t mean much. I was getting small cuts initially during my first several uses, as the blades began to dull out slightly that problem went away. Takes about 3 minutes for a decent to good shave 5 minutes for and excellent shave.</li>
    <li> This is an above average shaver/trimmer, but for what I payed I expected better. Good battery life, and nice that it is waterproof, but it is difficult to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> I got a terrible skin irritation after using this product. It also didn&#x27;t catch all of the hairs. They allowed me to return no problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about as good as any electric. The linear blades are so much better than the rotary ones. If you need to use an electric razor because your skin is too sensitive to use a blade this is the one to use.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this razor to anyone.  It failed to work in about 16 months.  I have sent in for repair within the warranty period and with my proof of purchase.  They sent it back to me with instructions to return with proof of purchase (which I had done).  I called customer service and they asked me to send back and to send an email telling them that I had sent back. Under warranty.  I can’t believe that they send me another email asking me to send back with proof of purchase.  Their left hand does not know what their right hand is doing.  In the meantime, I have purchased a Norelco shaver.  The shave it gives is exceptional and much much better than the Panasonic.  Please don’t not purchase this item.</li>
    <li> this is my second purchase of this style razor. the first one lasted several years. i did have to replace the foil and blades once. other than that it performed flawlessly. when the time comes i&#x27;ll buy another as no others come close. Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Blue</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband in Christmas 2010. It does a great job. Just getting ready to order the replacement parts. The recommendation is to replace the inner cartridge and foil every year. Since both together cost over $40, he is stretching it out a bit. However, while it&#x27;s not as smooth a shave as a year ago, it&#x27;s still fairly smooth.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t remove any hair from under my chin, at all, thus leaving me with an almost neckbeard. Seriously you can go over the same area a hundred times a hundred ways and it will never shave there. I was forced to also use a regular razor every day in addition to this, and then just gave up and just used the razor. I have yet to ever have an electric razor work for me though, and this one (apparently) works for other people. But just so just know, your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 56 and had owned Remington all my life that I always find on sale. From $35 to $65 dollars. It was time for a new shaver and I wanted better so I went with this Panasonic because of the reviews. You know what... Its the same shave. So I say to you save money and get a Remington on sale.</li>
    <li> A gift for my dad. He&#x27;s thrilled! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is , without any doubt,  the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m happy to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years ago and still going strong.  Quick charging and easy cleaning.  Great for traveling with the universal plug.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his Christmas gift.  Easy to use and to clean</li>
    <li> Still using this thing years later.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. It never disappoints. Wanted a good shaver without having to mess with all the special liquids needed for&lt;br /&gt;the really high end ones. This one does the trick.</li>
    <li> Took a little while to get used to it but after a few times it shaved so much better than my ordinary blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for less than two months.  In that time, rather than my beard \\&quot;getting used to\\&quot; being shaved with an electric, I&#x27;ve seen a degradation in the quality of the shave I receive.  I now spend twice as long shaving, and still have razor stubble within a few hours.  Motor speed and battery life are excellent, but the longevity of the supplied blades appears to be lacking.  Thinking that possibly the blades were from a bad manufacturing batch, I called Panasonic to ask about why this has happened in less than 60 days.  They refused to send a replacement set, and wanted me to pack it up and send it in.  This would be far more expensive for them, and certainly inconvenient for me.  With all the good reviews, I had hopes that this razor was a keeper but it certainly is not.</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVER I HAVE EVER HAD. I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN USE THIS DRY OR WET AND CHARGES QUICKLY</li>
    <li> Had used two shavers in the past. This one blows them away. I did&#x27;nt know this is what a shaver was supposed to feel like. No nicks or cuts. best shaver I have ever used. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have always used electric shavers. For many years I used the Norelco models, but they just were not working well for my beard anymore. I then tried a Braun Series 3 for several years. It worked good in the beginning, but the replacement blades were awful. I am now using the Panasonic shaver and love it. It shaves quicker and cleaner than any electric shaver that I have ever used. It is a bit louder than other shavers, but who cares when it does its job so well and so quickly. I don&#x27;t know how long the blades will last, but right now, I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> In my experience this is a one great shaver. However the life of this shaver is about 13 months! I checked my past orders and found I actually have had 3 in the past 5 years.</li>
    <li> best screen razor that I have ever used for its price range</li>
    <li> Gift for hubby, he is in love with it... I&#x27;ve even used it (shhh don&#x27;t tell him) cuts close no grabbing n pulling, REALLY holds a charge well!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the razor and bought it for my husband to help him get a closer shave. Unfortunately, it does not give a close shave. Disappointing product.</li>
    <li> I use it in the shower every morning. My experience is that only the Panasonics seem to take the everyday shower use torture test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first wet/dry was a Panasonic, my next one was a Panasonic, then I goofed and bought a Braun, which died after 5 months, and a Norelco that died after 10 months. The Braun gave me a good shave... when it worked. The Norelco was just terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic runs rings around them. I get the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten so far, it&#x27;s easy to clean (unlike the Norelco), tells you exactly how much charge you have left, and it can take the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor gripe: the grip feels a little slippery. Make sure you don&#x27;t drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It&#x27;s 4 years later, and it&#x27;s finally dying. The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well anymore, and it makes weird noises when it gets wet. (As in, the blade speed changes drastically.) 4 years isn&#x27;t bad for a rechargeable wet/dry shaver. These aren&#x27;t refrigerators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also add that this shaver is prone to give me razor burn if I overdo it. But it gave me a lot of good shaves!</li>
    <li> great stuff. i use this everyday. works great</li>
    <li> Does not shave well on curves and took longer to repeat on same spot several times.</li>
    <li> Its worth buying this! I got it for my husband for christmas and he loves it! He uses it even when driving to work!</li>
    <li> One of the best shaves I&#x27;ve had!</li>
    <li> Husband loved this as a gift!!!</li>
    <li> Stuff some toilet paper in your ears and trim that beard! This trimmer replaced a much older version of WAHL groomsman that I finally wore out. Nice sharp blades and lots of cutting guides. I like it.</li>
    <li> I used it for over two years without changing any parts and it was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Bought a new one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for over 40 years but when I recently purchased a replacement foil and cutter block assembly for my Braun Series 5, I realized that the quality of Braun replacement parts have declined significantly. I can only get about three months of good shaving from a replacement foil and cutter block assembly, even though I got over one year of good shaving from the original shaver. And these replacement parts are expensive!! So I bit the bullet and bought a Panasonic.    I really, really like the product so far.  The shaver is much quieter than the Braun, and it shaves faster and smoother. I like the way it fits in my hand, and that it can be cleaned by holding it under the faucet. It has a very solid feel, imparting the idea of high quality. Hopefully replacement parts are of the same quality as the original.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shaver I have ever had, have another previous Panasonic model with 3 heads, 4th head with new model not a gimimick. Very smooth quick and comfortable. End of Story!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;ve been a pretty loyal Mach 3 guy for a long time now.  I tried a Norelco wet/dry shaver a few years back, but I dropped it in the shower and that was all she wrote.  I was fairly satisfied with that unit, but man, did it tear up my neck.    I had been wanting to try another electric shaver again, but couldn&#x27;t really see dropping $150-250 for some of the better ones.  Then I saw this Panasonic with the nano-tech blades, and tons of great reviews.  I couldn&#x27;t beat the $99 price tag, either.  I spend that a year in Mach 3 blades easily.    By the way, the shipping was quick.  I ordered it on 1/15, and it arrived by USPS on 1/20.  Another good job by Amazon.      Anyways...  I had to check it out.  It&#x27;s much smaller, lighter, and less bulky than it appeared in the pictures.  Feels nice in the hand, too.  It comes slightly charged in the box, as I found out by hitting the power button.  It is a lot quieter than the Norelco I had, too.  A mild buzzing.  I went ahead and charged it up.    About an hour later, it was flashing 100% charged.  Pretty fast, in my opinion.  I hadn&#x27;t shaved since Friday night, so I figured why not?  I didn&#x27;t use any shaving cream or wet my face down.  Just went right for the dry shave.  It tackled my beard with no problems, other than some hairs on my neck.    I usually shave twice with my Mach 3.  Once to get it close, and then a second time against the grain to make it baby smooth.  The Panasonic didn&#x27;t quite get it to that baby smooth closeness, but it&#x27;s somewhere in between.  It&#x27;s at least as good as the first pass with the Mach 3.  Add in that I was shaving *dry* and there&#x27;s the \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor.  I can&#x27;t wait to try this with a little shaving gel.    The negative?  The neck hairs that lay flat on the neck.  It took a few passes and a little more pressure to get them.  Even then, I didn&#x27;t get them all.  But it was very few, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to how to get them.  But even this negative has a bright side.  Even though I putpressure on my neck, it never \\&quot;bit\\&quot; me.  The Norelco with any extra force applied made you feel like it was peeling skin off.  That was with the Nivia lotion, too.  I am really amazed that the Panasonic gave me a good shave, dry, with no irritation or nicks.</li>
    <li> Probably the finest shaver I have owned and I am 79 years old.  Got a great sale price from Amazon and received shaver within 4 days from order.Could not be more pleased with both Panasonic and Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES8243 A Arc IV Nano is without a doubt the best electric shaver on the market.  I have used this shave consistently now for about two weeks.  A couple of advantages that this shaver has over the Braun Pulsonic is that the liner motor moves at a faster speed, the pop-up trimmer is more convenient and easier to use, and this shaver can be used wet/dry.  While I haven&#x27;t used it dry, I can say that using the shaver wet has provided me with amazing results.  One thing that I&#x27;m not to happy with about this shaver is the battery life.  A full charge is only good for about 10 three minute shaves.  My pulsonic lasted much longer.  Other than the battery life, I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  I purchased this shaver because I have sensitive skin that is prone to ingrown hairs and I have thick coarse facial hair.  The motor in this razor has no problem cutting my hair and I&#x27;m left with smooth skin and zero irritation.  I highly recommend the shaver.</li>
    <li> Shaves close, cleans easy, charges fast, fairly silent (compared to my very old one different brand though). only thing left to see is the durability of the blades</li>
    <li> +this is the quietest and best body razor I have ever used, after using for a week my skin is soft and smooth as if I had no body hair at all.  The only draw back is after giving myself each total body shave I have to recharge it, but that only takes a short time so it isn&#x27;t a biggy.  I would rate it a 9.97 out of 10.</li>
    <li> this razor has a very strong motor; even after 4 days of not shaving it never struggles. works especially well (at least for me) with neutogena shave cream as a wet shaver. i have had a panasonic shaver before which i was quite pleased with; it just got a bit old.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for over 20 years.  I found them to be slow and caused skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this thing came on sale...I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use this almost every day.  It holds the charge really well.  It is very fast...and I find myself enjoying the shave.  It is no longer a chore or ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that it has a hard time cutting the area under my jaw.  But that can easily be rectified by dragging my razor across the beard area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts very close and does not irritate my skin.  There is no mess, and clean is is easy.  What else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Am 76 years young.  Have had three other brands of electric shavers.  This one is the best by far.  Purchased a second one for my 46 year old son, and he is super pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  He prefers the wet mode, I like the dry mode.  I get a close, comfortable shave within three minutes tops.  Quick charges within an hour as advertised, and cleaning is a snap. I clean mine in less than a minute using a couple shots of compressed air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found the best price through Amazon.  Thanks, Panasonic for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, and the foil lasts much longer than the other shavers I have used.  I have not changed the foil yet, and I have used it for over a year.</li>
    <li> Have been a Norelco shaver user for over 40 years. Read the review on the Panasonic and ordered it. Love it way better than Norelco and am getting another for traveling.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use electric shavers before so this was my first experience and I don&#x27;t really have any comparatives.&lt;br /&gt;At first, it took a while for my skin to get used to it but after a month&#x27;s use everything is fine.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made out of high quality material, charges within an hour and you I can use it for almost 30&#x27; after a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very efficient when it comes to shaving and it&#x27;s also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Finally it&#x27;s made in Japan (except from the charger).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase so far and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just got this Panasonic Shaver. In the past, I had never paid so much for a shaver before but after using it, I realized it was worth every penny. I highly recommend this Panasonic Shaver.</li>
    <li> Whether wet or dry this electric shaver glistens as it performs bigger and smoother than expected. I&#x27;ve been a Braun pulsonic 9595 user for the last 5 years and decided to give the Panasonic ES8243A a trial figuring it would cost me the same amount of money to repair and replace worn Braun parts as it would to purchase new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered in less than 2 minutes that you don&#x27;t have to spend $249 for a Braun when a $104 Panasonic will indulge you for less. I have a thick recalcitrant beard. My previous shaving routine began with a hot towel, shave cream, single blade manual, triple blade manual then an electric shaver. Braun never had enough power to tug my buttons. The Panasonic is quiet and about as ergonomically discreet as they come. It cut through my dry beard faster than any manual I&#x27;ve owned over the years. I experienced some razor burn on the dry shave so I decided to give a weekend&#x27;s worth of growth a trial wet/cream shave. The comparison confirmed for me that a wet/cream shave with the Panasonic 8243A gives as close a shave as my manual razors without the usual razor nicks I experienced on a needless daily basis for decades. I can finally dump the styptic pencil from my morning bloodletting practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gripes: The power on/off button is problematic. In the short time I&#x27;ve owned this shaver, I&#x27;ve accidentally turned the unit off in the middle of a shave more than I care to report. The button should be located at the base of the unit -- far from busy fingers. And unless you are sporting a Pug nose this shaver does a mediocre job under my prominent Streisand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise: I&#x27;m a believer in the 8243A. I no longer own a manual razor and hope to  never revisit one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been about 6 months of daily use and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve discovered that by rubbing a bar of soap in my wet beard I can achieve the same close shave had I used an expensive cream. I&#x27;ve now eliminated bloodletting manual shavers and shave cream making this purchase all the more practical. Now I have one less item to pack in my travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The blades are beginning to show signs of wear. Getting more tugging and skipping through my beard. No longer the glide through from day one. I can hear the motor struggle now when the cutting head hits a thick patch. Might be time for a new blade replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m 7 months in on this shaver and the blades are badly in need of replacement -- one of the downsides to having a heavy beard. Replacement part: Panasonic WES9068PC Men&#x27;s Shaver Replacement Inner Blade www.amazon.com/Panasonic-WES9068PC-Shaver-Replacement-Inner/dp/B001159UMM/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic recommends inner blade replacement every 2 years -- more realistic for a light to medium beard. But at $15 for new inner blades on 7 months of use versus purchasing a manual razor, I&#x27;m still ahead in terms of cost/consumables and blood loss from dreaded nicks. Remain happy with my purchase. Only negative is poor performance under my massive proboscis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Sincere regrets for downgrading to 4 stars today. The LED is reporting gibberish. No way to tell if the unit is functioning properly. Will contact customer service for warranty repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: December 31, 2013...Upgraded to 5 stars since Panasonic customer service was exceptional on the warranty. I received a brand new unit expedited from their Texas facility and packaged impeccably. So happy to have this shaver back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: February 14, 2015...At the 2 year 4 month mark. I&#x27;ve downgraded to 4 stars. The LED is reporting gibberish once again after the replacement unit shipped a year ago. I have no idea how much shaving time I have left in the unit. 4 shaves is about average on a full charge. Still the best $100 I&#x27;ve spent for a shaver. Their LED is problematic. Perhaps they&#x27;ll get it right on the next iteration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: At nearly the 3 year mark of ownership this device failed to recharge. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> We found each other.  After years of electrical shaving that has been just ok my shaver&#x27;s battery stopped charging.  I know that finding a personal item for shaving is a matter of luck.  Well, I am very excited to say that this shaver does a great job shaving my neck; I have a beard.  It is a bit noisy but the cutting speed and power is incomparable with the old shaver.  Bravo Panasonic.  I have been using the machine for one week and I am looking forward to the daily process and a clean shaved neck and chin.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband hoping that he would shave on a regular basis and so far he has been using it.  This shave is not as smooth as a razor but is great for everyday use.  I searched online to find the best one for the best price and felt this onfists the best. He has used it in the shower and it works great but now I need to get a mirror for the shower.  You can lock the head from pivoting while using it or allow it to pivot, your choice.  The carrying case is great but I am not sure if it can hold the charger.  This is the first electric razor he has ever used and he likes it.</li>
    <li> does not shave well at all,leaves a lot of hairs behind and cleaning system has failed within the first 3months of use,clearly not a good shaver,ill do better research next time we buy one of these.</li>
    <li> I felt the shaver did not live up to the description.  I own a prior model and there was not that much improvement.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband 2.5 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.  He uses it every day and loves it.</li>
    <li> super close shave, easy cleaning, better than the older models.  This is the 3rd Panasonic shaver that I have owned, and the best so far</li>
    <li> Far superior shaver to my old one.  Very close shave and easy to clean in either wet or dry mode.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth shave.  With either wet or dry shave options it seems very versatile Very easy to clean with water.</li>
    <li> Very nice and smooth.  If you use it slowly and in all directions like you should all electric shavers, it&#x27;s quite close without pulling hairs or chafing.  The only problem with it is that the head is a little large for shaving under the nose above thin mustaches. There is one line in the head that can and does shave longer hairs... and it will shorten your mustache!  lol.  But, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this per recommendation from my brother. I use this not to shave my face but to shave my head. It works extremely well when ones hair is always kept short. I use it every 2-4 days. It cuts really smooth and really fast. Only a few minutes to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a hard time cutting sometimes if I grow out my hair for a week or so. I usually have to cut it down a little using traditional hair clippers at a number 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does great for the purpose with which I use it. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this razor,I have had electric razors in the past that I liked but none of them compared to this one.</li>
    <li> My husband has never used an electric rasor but a few times before.  He really prefers this one now over a manuel shaver.  Much easier and quicker for him to shave.  It reallly gives him a close shave!  The reviews we read for this Panasonic convinced him to give it a try&amp; he is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is a fine razor.  It really doesn&#x27;t have four blades.  The outer two blades do the work.  The inner two seem like minor blades that do very little.  But the thing does cut hair very well.  It has a very high RPM and does not bog down when shaving.  I like it and would get another if I lost this one.</li>
    <li> I have found this shaver to be the best I have ever owned. My last three have been Norelcos, and never again. This cuts all of the long whiskers that my old shaver would leave behind. Smooth and excellent from the first shave.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair from bottom and you will have hard time to shave your neck and under chin, you will need to replace the blade after 3 months!!</li>
    <li> *** UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I sent a written letter to Panasonic&#x27;s Customer Service division outlining the issue below.  I received a call back 3 days later.  They offered to do exactly what I had originally suggested and a new shaver is on the way.  It would have been nice if it hadn&#x27;t taken two phone calls and a letter, but they did do the right thing in the end.  I do really enjoy the shaver itself, and with the service issue fixed can recommend it. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;Shaver worked fine for 11 months, then developed a problem where every light on the LCD screen stays lit all the time, so I can&#x27;t tell the charge level, blade status, etc.  I contacted Panasonic customer service, who said they would happily replace the unit if I shipped it to their repair facility in Texas, with an estimated turn around time of 10 business days.  I explained that I kind of actually need the shaver on a day to day basis, and I asked them to send me a new unit first, following which I would return mine, which at least still shaves.  I offered to give them my credit card number so that they could charge me for the new unit if my old one didn&#x27;t make it back to them as promised.  This procedure is common enough in business (I&#x27;ve done it multiple times with things like computer components) and I think was an entirely reasonable request on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s official response, in essence was, \\&quot;Sorry sucker.  Grow a beard.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a pretty lousy attitude given that the unit went bad well within the two year warranty period.  I told the customer service supervisor as such, and mentioned that in the days of social media and online reviews, it perhaps was not a wise decision to tick off a customer over a shaver that retails for $122.33 that he offered to guarantee payment for anyway.  The \\&quot;Grow a Beard\\&quot; response was still the only one available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does shave well, but now it&#x27;s my personal mission to keep as many people as possible from buying one.  Through the miracle of copy and paste I can post this review for all of their other models as well.  Maybe some Panasonic representative with a longer-term outlook will see this review and be appropriately horrified that their customer service department couldn&#x27;t do just one small thing to keep a customer happy.  Remember, I offered my credit card number - it would have been exactly zero risk on their part.  So buy this unit if you feel lucky, or if you just look really good with a ten day beard.  Otherwise look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have always suffered from sensitive skin and shaving every day wasn&#x27;t an option. I had tried a couple of electrics a few years ago and hadn&#x27;t had much luck. I like to shave in the shower and this offered that option. I also started using the shave secret oil with this instead of shave gel. I&#x27;m at the end of my first week and I cant tell you how happy I am with this product. My face is still getting used to using an electric and I know its only going to get better. I actually look forward to shaving now. No bumps, ingrowing hairs or razor burn. Buy this product along with Shave Secret and you will never shave with a razor again.</li>
    <li> works great wet and dry. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t do too well with the whiskers on my neck.</li>
    <li> I did the research and I did the &amp;#34;hold in my hand&amp;#34; test prior purchasing this shaver. Once I received and reviewed the instructions, it was fully charged in about 1.5 hours. I can shave @13 times prior recharging. Wet/Dry, can be rinsed and cleaned easily. Simply said, it is the best shaver I have ever had and it puts every other shaver I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; &amp;#34;in the trash&amp;#34;. Panasonic is a superior product. Baby face smooth! and...the case will be handy for traveling. Enjoy a clean easy shave!</li>
    <li> This is one review that I wanted to write about the Panasonic electric shaver. It replaced an old Remington electric shaver I&#x27;ve had 1985, and yes it still worked, but I needed something NEWER since cut what remaining hair cut off &amp;#34;balded.&amp;#34; Panasonic electric shaver shaves as good as a razor blade on my head and face. I LOVE this electric shaver so much, I been thinking getting another Panasonic electric shaver. And, it is easy to clean, it&#x27;s waterproof, and it rechargest in about 45 minutes. What more could one ask for ! A great electric shaver!</li>
    <li> Great buy, great shaver and good price compared to local retails outlets.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, clean. Fast charge and lasts 2 weeks with a daily 3 min. shave.</li>
    <li> Do not hesitate this is a very good Electric Razor from a top Japanese brand. You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on advanced Alzheimer&#x27;s patient that fights for everything he&#x27;s worth when trying to shave him.  It worked GREAT!  He even seemed to enjoy the &amp;#34;buzzing&amp;#34; on his face and it cleaned him up without any cuts and nicks.  Thanks...awesome product!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor in 40 years and I was pleasantly surprised, its great. It arrived when it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> Although it came with warnings, I tried it on and found it very easy to use and the shaving was great!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for is often people&#x27;s motto, but in this razor you ge more! Very nice, power razor that shaves smooth and irritation free! Great product!</li>
    <li> Good value and I have used this product before although a different model.  I have used Braun also; seems like this&lt;br /&gt;lasts longer and gives a better shave.  Recommded!</li>
    <li> I switched from blades to this electric and am very happy with it. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it has virtually eliminated ingrown hairs that I got from a blade. No nicks or cuts. Good battery life. Charges very quickly, and shaves a close as a razor. I love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  It seems to be faster than my old triple-action shaver.  It&#x27;s a little louder, but I still think it does a better job.  The pop-up trimmer is really good as well.</li>
    <li> Very powerful Razor, and sounds quite loud.  It does a nice job on my face, but I can&#x27;t get a proper shave on my neck.  The trimmer helps, and works well that problem.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that electric razors had advanced in the 10 years since I last used one. Perhaps they have, but they&#x27;re still no match for my stubbly neck. While this does a fine job on my face, it&#x27;s essentially powerless on my neck, where hairs grow simultaneously in all possible directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike electric razors of the past, this one actually can give me a mostly clean-shaven neck, but for the time and effort it takes to get a not-so-perfect shave, it makes more sense to get a perfect shave with a razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver comes as close to a blade shave as anything I have ever used.  It was worth a little extra, and after owning it for a year, I am very pleased with it.  Nice not having nicks and cuts from a blade, too.  I would definitely recommend this shaver to friends, and especially those who haven&#x27;t tried an electric for quite some time.</li>
    <li> After my wife lost the charger for my old pany shaver in a trip, I had to find a replacement. The feedback for this one seemed good, and my experience with this shaver is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-LED indicator: nice to see how long you take for this shave, and percentage left for the battery;&lt;br /&gt;-battery: charge takes one hour which is quicker than my old one, lasted about 45 minutes matching the ads said&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-when the shaver reached chin curve, I can feel tiny jitter, I thought it should be smooth transition, not big deal though</li>
    <li> So far, I have only used this shaver dry and I&#x27;m quite happy. It shaves close enough for me with no irritation and shaving takes me about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes (I have a mustache and goatee type facial hair). The pop up trimmer is not that useful to me because of the obstruction of the large shaver head mechanism doesn&#x27;t always allow me to see exactly where I&#x27;m trimming but no worries, I have a trimmer for that. It takes a little get used to shaving close to my mustache and goatee because of the large surface of the razor head but turning the shaver 90 degrees allows me to shave those areas. Cleaning is easy, and the cleaning base unit to me, is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how this lasts but so far so good.</li>
    <li> It has been three weeks and it works better than the Braun or Norelcos I&#x27;ve had in the past. Close shave, no ingrown hairs. Works well for me. I dry shave with this every day and am not having any issues.</li>
    <li> I had not had an electric shaver for about 20 years.  I thought the tech probably had gotten better and it has.  I am quite pleased with this razor.  It only cost me about $100 and it gives me a great shave.  It even works in the shower, which works the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t quite get under the nose as well as I had hoped, but a does a decent job for that tough area.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it,,,it worked great for about 9 months,then the power switch quit working..except by itself..would come on in middle of night,,the worst experience is the service ..shipped in for repair on Feb 22..it is now March 12..was told at service center parts on back order..warranty said it was to be repaired or replaced in 10 days..the only way I would buy it would be if I bought local and paid extra for instore warranty,,if available ,,</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used in 30 years. I shave in about three minutes with a completely smooth shave with no burns or any skin irritation.  I cannot recommend this Panasonic any higher than 5 stars but would rate it higher if I could.</li>
    <li> I have used several Electric Shavers over the years, this was by far my best purchase across brands. Have been using this one for several months now, get the closest shave ever, no burns at all. Having used it for a few months, now I need to rub some areas couple of times to get the same fine shave, but still works great.</li>
    <li> Almost a keeper. Just returned the Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver. Why? I broke out in a rash (mostly bumps) after each use. Yes, I gave my face plenty of time to adjust(about 3-4 weeks of shaving) to this new sensation - after 30 years of the blade. But subsequent shaves increased the rash area. I tried various wet/dry combos of shaving creams and lotions - no go.That&#x27;s unfortunate. I really wanted it to work. I hate spending $3.25 each for my Fusion replacement blades. And yes, this electric shaver got pretty darn close. Maybe I can stretch my Fusion blade to 3 weeks each to save money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this razor. I am completely happy with it. My experience with Panasonic electric razor in the past has been very positive. This razor is no exception. Good battery life and a very close shave. I have been meaning to try it in the shower for a wet shave to see how that feels. So far dry shaving has been fast and close with no razor burn.</li>
    <li> I have not tried using it as a \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; yet but just use it in the typical way I did 25 years ago when I stopped using an electric razor.  No, this does not give as close a shave as a true razor but plenty close for me.  My shave time went from 6-8 minutes to about 2 minutes.  I am thoroughly impressed.  When I retired, I decided to shave every other day (have a light beard) and I continue to do that with this razor.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research and this looked like the best purchase. I rarely use it now. Back to manual razors. This razor did not give me a close or even shave. It is not very comfortable either. Don&#x27;t waste your money. All that said, I have a thick beard.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best shaver I know. Smooth shave, just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one issue can be the difficulty in shaving near the neck area (or where it gets too curved). Otherwise, I use it daily and so love this product. Best shave ever! I even bought one for a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because of some major flaws discovered after using it for almost a year:&lt;br /&gt;1. When I&#x27;m shaving all of my hair is usually end up on my shirt instead of inside this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s quite noisy when shaving - much worse than some other shavers i had used.&lt;br /&gt;3. The battery runs out pretty fast and it asks you about cleaning quite often too.</li>
    <li> works very well i would recommend to a friend to purchase. esp if you get it cheap.  i wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy more.  Doesn&#x27;t capture the cut beard hairs well.&lt;br /&gt;i was not impressed with the trimmer feature.  doesn&#x27;t cut well at all.  luckily  i rarely need it. happy to get rid of  my old shaving cream and razor.  charges very fast and gives u ample warning that u need to plug it in or else</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a Braun (dry only) shaver I bought about 4 years ago.  I figured if it wasn&#x27;t any good I would return it after thirty days.  My main reason for trying something new was I always get razor burn and ingrown hairs after shaving and I was tired of buying the cleaning solution.  I figured if it was decent, it would pay for itself over about a year.  I also missed shaving cream, but each time I try a real razor, even a really expensive one, I would pay the price with my skin feeling eaten up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my new razor.  It shaves nearly as close as a real razor and I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn or ingrown hairs.  It recommends 30 days for your face to adjust.  Mine was good from day one, probably because I was already using an electric.  I have only used it with a good quality shaving gel and the shave is great.  I have used an electric razor for the past 15 years + (all dry only) and just know there are always \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; on your face like the neck.  I would say it gets these areas as well as any other electric I have tried.  I might have to use the side burn trimmers to get 2 or 3 strays each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, this is the only wet electric shaver I have tried, but I am extremely pleased so far.  Had it about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver 14 months ago and it&#x27;s by far the best shaver I have ever had. Way better then the more expensive ones. Just replaced the blades after 14 months. Should have done it earlier as there only $14.  The shavers with the electric cleaners are a joke. It&#x27;s so easy to clean by hand with no fancy expensive solutions. Battery life is great. I recharge once every 2 weeks and it could almost go 3. If you don&#x27;t like it I will buy it from you. lol  Paul</li>
    <li> Works well for my grandson who has a heavy beard,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver for years and find this model to be the best yet. It&#x27;s quiet and gives a close comfortable shave every time. I also like the one hour quick charge feature.</li>
    <li> Coming from two Phillips, this was my first foil shaver, and I&#x27;m amazed! Much better. Much closer. Much easier. Obviously better for my skin type. Glad I took the chance!</li>
    <li> After a while water gets into the display and you are unable to determine how much charge is left.</li>
    <li> This is my second time I purchased this Razor. Having owned others I was expectiong it to Die, Well...&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 years with the old one and have yet to open this razor yet. Thought the blades or battery would go by now, but still going Strong! Best used wet with a little soap</li>
    <li> OK but not really great in shower.&lt;br /&gt;I have gone back to blades as this is way too slow for me</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  Had it for almost a year and no problems.  One charge lasts me about a month, and I shave every day.  I am glad that i didn&#x27;t buy the version that washes itself.  This one is very easy to wash and I didn&#x27;t pay extra.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Works well, but is very loud.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this because shaving with the cheap ones wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. He has sensitive skin and this one is gentle and doesn&#x27;t pull or cut him.</li>
    <li> Purchased this beast back in 2010 and it&#x27;s still going strong.  Please dont waste your time with the garbage shavers you find in your local Fred Meyer / Walmart.  This thing is a daily deal (only 80 bucks) today and you simply wont find a better shave in that price range.  Heck, you wont find a better shave under 150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to people saying you need to replace the foil every year and the inner blades every 6 months...No, you don&#x27;t.  My first outer foil lasted 2 years before I noticed any dulling.  Inner foil was about a year in.  I just now purchased my second outer foil and 4th inner blade set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR; Buy it.</li>
    <li> For me, this is the best razor I’ve used.  I have always had soft facial skin and a blade was always too abrasive, no matter what brand or how new/sharp.  There are plenty of opinions on foil razors; IMHO, the foil razor is the best razor available.  The method I use is that I basically &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; my face with it, passing over and over again on the same area for a couple of minutes to achieve a super close shave.  This is my first Panasonic.  It is a really great razor... the ONLY reason that I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because you cannot use it while it is plugged/recharging.  At times, this has been a huge inconvenience.  Once the battery dies, you need to wait for it to at least partially recharge before you can again begin to shave.  I&#x27;ve had razors in the past that I could use while plugged and if this one had that feature, it would get 5 stars.  The razor has worked flawlessly for over three years, so I have no other complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a similar model Panasonic for 4yrs but this one is by far a superior shave. It&#x27;s very smooth feeling, less drag and  shaves closer. I only wish it utilized a cleaning station.</li>
    <li> I have had electric shavers before but was never quite satisfied with them until I got this one. The fact that it can be used wet is great. I have even used it in the shower but prefer in front of a mirror at the sink. With or without soap, it works perfectly. An added bonus is the ease of cleaning. Just put the shaving head under a faucet while the shaver is on and voila, you are done. I am very happy with this shaver and highly recommend it to anyone interested in an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Working good. But you have to charge it after every 2-3 shaves. My old philips i can do at least 5-6 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product wise it is fine.</li>
    <li> works pretty well, 45 minutes to charge and lasts all week in the shower</li>
    <li> Good deal, works well, really like the easy cleaning process...soap and water.</li>
    <li> Like the wet shave feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Remington that I had for nearly 10-year.  I still liked the Remington but it was getting too difficult to find replacement blades and foils, plus, I figured the technology should have improved over the decade.  I selected this shaver based on reviews.  Good: it charges WAY faster than my old shaver; I think 0 to 100% charge in 4-hours.  That is about it for the good.  Bad: The shave is not as good.  I find I have to go over-and-over the same area to get a reasonable shave.  I don&#x27;t see that the high speed head does anything to improve the shave or comfort over my old Remington.  Though it charges quickly, I get far fewer shaves per charge; like 5-days now compared to 3-weeks with the old Remington. I never use it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, so can not write to that.</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric razor in over 10 years. Gillette razors are excellent and give an outstanding shave. I recently retired and have gotten out of certain routines including shaving every day. My wife started complaining so I ordered this razor based on the reviews. I am extremely impressed after 2 weeks. It is extremely easy to get a comfortable shave without any preparation. In fact, I get better results shaving dry than wet. Battery life is excellent and care and maintenance is a breeze. This unit is light years ahead of the old Braun&#x27;s and Norlecos I used in the past 40 years.</li>
    <li> I can always trust Panasonic products. Bought as a gift and he loves it. Also bought a replacement head since those seem to wear out in a few years and you can&#x27;t always find parts later. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas it is now May and he still talks about what a great job it does.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this based on other reviews. I was hoping to find an easy way to shave my head instead of using razor blades all of the time. This turned out to be the absolutely best thing I could have done. This razor works absolutely great if you&#x27;re somebody who shaves their head. It manages to get into all the divots and hard-to-reach places and it&#x27;s easily washable and has a sonic cleaning built-in.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who shaves his head. He usually uses a regular razor but has started using this every day and I can not believe how closely it shaves. I really didn&#x27;t think an electric razor could do that. It is worth every dime!</li>
    <li> This Razor is a great! I been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 14 years, one Norelco lasted me 9 years. Last one was Norelco Arctic it was ok for 2 years then the blade went dull, replacement blade didn’t do justice so I did my research and bought this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Powerful and fast, charges quickly, shave in &amp;#60;5minutes,&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Charge lasts only about 5-6 shaves due to the power, cannot plug-in and shave (may be due to safety reason)  cleaning is not that fast you have to rise it out, I’m used to brushing it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 70 yrs old with a heavy beard and extremely sensitive skin.  In all the shavers that I&#x27;ve purchased and/or tried over the years, I&#x27;ve NEVER found one that did the job.  I did my homework on this one spending hours reading customer reviews from all different sites. I decided to purchase it when I read all these wonderful reviews.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I used it for the first time right out of the box. Even with a three day beard, it shaved me perfectly in about 5 minutes with no pulls, cuts or face irritations.  I&#x27;m like a kid with a new toy.  Now I can&#x27;t wait to shave and use this amazing shaver.  All I can say is buy it, buy it, buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend hates this razor. It doesn&#x27;t really get the job done. He just uses it now to spot shave what his regular razor doesn&#x27;t cover.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a Christmas present to my boyfriend. He likes the way it shaves as a dry shaver. He is disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a wet shaver.</li>
    <li> I do not feel it shaves as close as my old braun shaver.  I used it for three weeks now and it is no better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine a month.  I bought the Panasonic ES8243A primarily for shaving my head.  I was in awe at how close of a shave I&#x27;ve gotten with it.  Before I was using single and double blade razors to help prevent any razor burn.  This shaver gets closer than those razors, and no razor burn.  I shave my head in the shower, with shaving gel and it takes me 6 minutes and I&#x27;m finished.  It took me 3 or 4 shaves to get used to the length of hair that it works best on.  It takes about twice as long with 4 days growth vs 3 days growth, so I have to shave my head more often, but at 6 minutes to perfectly smooth, I don&#x27;t have any problems with it.  2 small complaints.  1, the head is a little bulky, so it&#x27;s tough to get around my ears, but is fine on everything else.  2, the instructions say that you can get a 3 minute shave off of 10% of the battery life.  The panel on the front indicates battery life, and my 6 minute shaves use about 30%, so it&#x27;s not very accurate.  So 3 shaves and I have to re-charge, but it charges in an hour.  Great shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic shaver&#x27;s for over 20 years. I previously used an 8249. I just bought the 8243 and thought I was going down a model. I do not know how Panasonic names the shavers as this new one (8243), is 6-7 years newer than my previous model. Bottom line: I was hesitant to go Panasonic again since the 8249 had all sorts of problems with biting my skin. This 8243 is as smooth as they come! Quiet, easy to handle and the smoothest shave!!!! I am pleased and relieved I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting bitten by the shaver. Shaving is once again stress free! It does a great job!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband. He loves this shaver. It works perfect for the face and the head as well. It holds the charge for a few days. No cuts and irritation. Works the best if use for dry hear. It can work in the shower as well, but my husband says it makes it longer if shave wet hair.</li>
    <li> I tried going electric in the late 90&#x27;s and quickly gave up. They have come a long way and after a year I can say I&#x27;m very happy with this razor. Gives a good fast shave, charges quickly, and is light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says wet/dry but I would recommend KEEPING IT DRY! Water is what degrades razor blades, not your stubble. After a year of using it only dry, and cleaning it off with compressed air, it runs like a dream still.</li>
    <li> bought for my 94 year old father who has low vision and he is able to use and to charge.  great product</li>
    <li> Takes too long to shave under the shower. Shave is not comparable to a razor shave and takes much longer. It was an interesting gadget for a while, but even after a month it&#x27;s rough on the skin and it&#x27;s easy to miss spots. In the end, the fact that it takes so long and so many passes is a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> this shaver has surpassed my expections. It provides a smooth shave and non irritating, since I have very sensitive skin. Easy to clean and I enjoy the ability to use either wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever owned.  Got rid of my ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> Easy to operate and maintain.  Gives a good clean smooth shave.  The Wet/Dry feature makes for a quick and easy clean up without  having to take the shaver apart.</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to use and clean. Durable my last one last over 3 years. I completely recommend for male and female use.</li>
    <li> Ok, I had some acne and this helped out reducing it significantly. Cleaning is easy with hot water and strong enough for thick heavy hair. It also charges quickly. It took me around couple of weeks though to understand how to use it properly close to curves under the chin. Closeness is competent to many razor blades.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Shaves close. Quick and easy to clean under running water. Comfortable. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the angled head but it&#x27;s a lot more comfortable to use under my chin when flipped over. I&#x27;ve used rotary shavers and other foil razors and none of them cut as close, even when brand new.</li>
    <li> The best wet/dry shaver</li>
    <li> fantastic!  a car charger would be nice</li>
    <li> I used another name brand electric shaver for 30 years; however, this time I decided to do a little research and found the Panasonic.  What a difference!  When used with the Billy Jealousy Super-Slick Shave Cream,  you would think that you shaved with a blade; it&#x27;s that good!</li>
    <li> This was highly recommended so I purchased it for my husband for Christmas. Results highly disappointing, not a very close shave. Only positive is that it&#x27;s relatively easy to clean</li>
    <li> I love the feature showing me how much charge is left and how long I used it. Charges quickly, and the charge lasts a while. It will loose the charge over time w/o use but that should be expected. I also like the wet use feature as I can just rinse it our regularly. I am still using it stock after 2yrs and it still works as well as the day I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re tired of comparing razors and this is your price range, then just go ahead and buy this one. you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just replaced my 5-6 year old Panasonic Linear shaver.  I didn&#x27;t expect but more of the same high quality from Panasonic, yet I was actually surprised by just how much better this was over my old ES8028.  It is at least 50% quieter and shaves my face a lot quicker and smoother than my old Panny.  Very impressed.  I was a little worried about some of the reviews that said the 4 blade version was too large/wide for their face, but for the life of me don&#x27;t understand how anyone could say that after receiving my unit and using it for myself.</li>
    <li> i give it 4 stars because the only 5 star shave is using Fusion with hot water and a good shaving gel/cream.  i&#x27;d actually give the panasonic 4.5 stars if the option existed.  Relative to the triple blade disposable razors i use in the shower, the panasonic shave is 95% as close.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used if for a week and it is really easy to use- incredibly smooth going over your skin. I&#x27;ve only used it as a dry shaver at this point.  I normally use a blade so i might actually get closer shave as my beard adjusts.  I had been using a braun rechargable (about 6 years old) and this blow it away.  the braun would always leave a stubbly feeling on the sides of my cheeks where my beard is toughest.  The panasonic leaves it feeling completely smooth and clean-shaven.  Shave takes about 3 minutes and probably could be efficiently done in 2 minutes.  Razor is very comfortable in your hand and absolutely glides over your face.  The very fast RPM of the razor is quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried as wet shaver yet, will see if that gets even closer.&lt;br /&gt;very pleased with the purchase- great price.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin.  Since day one I love this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It just feels great on my face.</li>
    <li> This unit is well deserving of it&#x27;s good reviews. I&#x27;ve had mine since Nov 2010. Despite getting the &#x27;blade change&#x27; warning, I haven&#x27;t done so yet and am still getting a good shave. (I will be ordering replacements soon). The battery is only showing a slight degradation, requiring a charge every 4 shaves instead of 6. Cleaning is a snap. A rinse and with soap on the cleaning cycle for 25 seconds every few days.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used. I have tried many electric razors but none have given as close a shave as this one. The fact that I can use it with shaving cream is great. So I would say if you are thinking about an electric razor this one is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> Works really well, and holds a charge for several shaves.</li>
    <li> Used this razor for a few times and am extremely satisfied with the results. Haven&#x27;t tried the wet shave option, but got a very close and smooth dry shave, and that too without any irritation. The only thing that I didnt find very impressive was that I had to go over the same area for a few times to get an extremely close shave...But overall I am very satisfied with the result. Will definitely recommend this to others who are looking for an electric shaver...</li>
    <li> My parents bought me this razor for Christmas. I have always used Norelco (with the three round circles) before and was a little worried I wouldn&#x27;t like the foil razor as much. In short, I love it. I have used for about a month now and it is the best shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Battery&lt;br /&gt;First off, the battery life is great. I am in my mid-20&#x27;s and shave every day. My average shave time is about 2.5 minutes. I can go a full two weeks without having to charge it. And I love how it displays battery level after every shave so I know how much I have left. My old razors would last a little over a week. I am sure this one will get worse over time but right now it seems great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Closeness &amp; Quality&lt;br /&gt;I have heard people argue that the foil shavers get a much closer shave than the round ones. I think it may be a little closer but not a huge difference. I have also heard that it is hard to adjust to one type of razor if you have been using the other. This may be true if you are switching from blade to electric but I had no problems at all. No irritation with this bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t think I have to go over each spot as much as with my old razor. One or two passes and I usually get a very smooth clean finish. It handles my jawline very well also. The \\&quot;tilt\\&quot; head on the shaver follows the curves of my jaw and chin and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Side burn trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Seems small but this is one of my favorite things. It works so much better than my old razors. Clean and crisp line. Don&#x27;t have to keep going over it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Case and Cord&lt;br /&gt;I like the case (nice leather pouch) but the cord is a little bulky. Not sure why it needs to be so big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Display&lt;br /&gt;It seems nonimportant but the display is very nice. It tells you how long you have been shaving. What your battery level is, and when it needs to be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Cleaning vibration mode&lt;br /&gt;If you hold the button it goes into \\&quot;clean mode\\&quot; which apparently means it just vibrates a bunch. I don&#x27;t know if I can tell that it works that great but I do that and rinse it under some water and it cleans very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Overall&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic makes nice razors! I love it</li>
    <li> So far, so good. It does a great job shaving. Although I have only used it dry shaving it gives me a very close, smooth shave. I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because there seems to be an adjustment period. I normally use an electric razor but this one left my skin somewhat sensitive for the first couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Have bought several electric razors in the past and was very disappointed with them. I usually bought the three rotary blade ones because they were recommended by friends. I have very sensitive skin under by chin and that caused a lot of irritation. I have used this razor without any issues at all. I don&#x27;t get the skin burn and I use it almost everyday without a problem. I recommend this razor to you guys that have that soft sensitive skin issue. Very nice razor and easy to use it.</li>
    <li> Good quality and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> The slim design and style of razor is great. I love the close shaves it gives. The quality stands out, very dependable..</li>
    <li> My husband has a very tough beard and this has been the best electric shaver that I have found for him.  He has always prefered to use straight edge, but with his Alzheimer&#x27;s I was afraid to let him contune to use that.  This does a pretty good job except for his neck which I use the side burn cutter and then razor.  Over all It surpasses my expectations.</li>
    <li> This shaver is all that it&#x27;s said to be, works very well. Best when used wet with gel, shaving cream etc.</li>
    <li> This is the worst razor I have ever used, it just doesn&#x27;t shave, leaves a lot of stubble, back to my norelco.</li>
    <li> After not having an electric shaver, and the cost of most shavers out there today are really expensive, this shaver works great and the price was right too!</li>
    <li> I treated myself to a new electric shaver after many years and am very happy with this model. Reviews were mostly favorable and the price was right at the time. I like that after every use the LED battery indicator let&#x27;s you know how much charge is left.</li>
    <li> I was going to wait to write a review until I had this for at least 6 months, but I am just to thrilled to wait. I have very sensitive skin with fine, straight, relatively thick hair that is now about 40% gray. If you have coarse hair or curly hair, your results might differ. I also have a mustache and goatee, so I can&#x27;t say how well it would work on the hair in that area. This is the fourth model of electric shaver I have owned. I started 15 years ago with a rotary Norelco that worked pretty well but caused serious razor burn. I then bought a two-bladed Remington that worked pretty well, but died with no warning after 2 years, as did its replacement. I then purchased a cheaper 2 headed Panasonic that shaved about as well as the Remingtons while causing slightly less irritation. However, as my hair got gray it struggled to cut it. I have wanted to buy the ES8243 for years but could not justify the expense when my other Panasonic was still going strong and I did not think there would be a massive improvement. However, after about 7 years the battery gradually started discharging more rapidly and had finally gotten to the point where it would only last for 3 shaves, and when the price on this shaver fell suddenly to seventy five dollars I jumped on it. I just wish I had bought it years ago! It is absolutely fantastic. It gives me a shave that is 95% as close as a bladed razor, with much less skin irritation. It does irritate me a bit more than the previous, lower RPM Panasonic, but that is because it shaves much closer. As others have noted, it works best if you do not press hard. My only complaint is that unlike my previous shavers, it will not operate while plugged in. I have bought several electronic items and other &amp;#34;man toys&amp;#34; in the last few months, and yet the item that has thrilled me the most is this shaver! I never would have expected that.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave. nice  razor - with all the bells and whislles.&lt;br /&gt;iWould  call it a good buy. might even be a 5 star</li>
    <li> When I have not shaved for a while it takes a few passes to get the job done I must say I am disappointed. My old 7 yr old electric razor was much closer and better preforming!</li>
    <li> Great shaver! Don&#x27;t think, I could get anything better than this one, especially for this money (74.99$). Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband had used a safety razor for the past 50 years.  Because he is on blood thinners, he thought an electric razor would avoid the nicks and bleeding.  He likes the shaver; but feels that it may not shave as close as he wants.  He sometimes misses some areas.  He suggested that he might just need more time to get used to using it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this around 2 years back and its still working great, of course i had to replace blade once. But this is so far best shaver i have come across. Once to figure out how to use it properly then you only need 90 sec to shave. I always use it during shower with little shaving foam and it works just great.</li>
    <li> Excellent, but doesn&#x27;t work that well on the neck as compared to a traditional razor. Smooth and really precise and the extension to trim side burns is good too.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying what a lot of people already have: we all have different beards, so the results will clearly be different for everyone. However I still have not met anyone with a tougher beard than mine, not because I have too much hair but rather because they lie flat, grow in many different directions, and are very thick, so my only option when shaving has always been to use an electric to avoid the nicks, cuts, and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had always used Braun before, as a matter of fact I got my first one second hand from my dad who got a newer model and gave me his - by the way, this shaver still runs and is probably from the 80&#x27;s - it was a single blade shaver but with a very strong trimmer that worked like a charm. Shaving would take forever since I had to do my first pass with the hair trimmer to lift off / cut longer hair, and then shave with the foil which was a bit irritating (no pivoting head or anything). If I didn&#x27;t I would end up with patches of unshaved hair and with LOTS of ingrown hair all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I stayed loyal to the brand since my dad always used them, and since he got a decent shave I thought it must have been me then! I got yet another one from him (don&#x27;t even know the model), and then upgraded to the 8995 activator in &#x27;04. This one again gave me a decent shave, provided I used the trimmer first but was a very long shave of around 7 min - it did seem that the blades would wear out way faster than my old Braun shavers though (had to replace once a year or more often). Used it for five years and decided to upgrade when it would bug down while shaving, and due to the unavailability and price of the proper foil + cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the new Pulsonic and even though it did give me a somewhat faster shave, I still had to use the hair trimmer (very flimsy by the way), and performance seemed to drop dramatically after the 2-3 week of use. I hated the fact that I couldn&#x27;t hear the hairs being cut (call me crazy), and even though it felt &#x60;softer&#x27; to the face due to the pivoting + spring action, I had to pass through the same area so many times I ended up with extreme irritation and ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not being able to take it anymore, I decided to go with the competition mainly based on Amazon&#x27;s reviews and I am sure glad I did! For all of you Braun users, and I&#x27;m not talking Pulsonic only but also those that have tried older Brauns with success: this is the shaver for you. Think of a redesigned Braun that maintained old foil quality + performance, added multiple blades, faster motor and you can wet shave as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver works extremely well, especially when shaving wet with some shave cream or gel (I use Target&#x27;s brand @ $1.90 per can, works great!). It just glides effortlessly and leaves you with a very smooth shave I had never experienced from an electric shaver before. I have finally been able to reduce the need of the trimmer to a minimum and generally shave in about 3-4 min (I know this is long for some of you but it is heaven for me) - no irritation, and ingrown hairs are for the most part gone. The shaves are so close I still look decent after 5pm and have even been able to skip a day every now and then; I must say I&#x27;m doing it less and less since shaving is no longer a nightmare for me. Another interesting point is that even though it seems loud, I would say it is as loud as the Pulsonic but obviously with a higher pitch noise from the higher frequency motor, you can still hear the hairs being cut! It has not bugged down on me yet but I will keep you posted as I use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am submitting this review after a year and a half of owning the shaver. I had to return it for warranty to Panasonic and they sent me a brand new LA-63 - review for that one will follow (outstanding customer service by the way). I must say even with its short &#x27;life&#x27; I am extremely satisfied with this shaver and would buy it again. Amazon constantly has it for sale at under $90 price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very effective, fast shaver&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced ingrown hair&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely close shave comparable to blade shaving&lt;br /&gt;- Wet shaving option (excellent) - you can use this shave in the shower if you&#x27;d like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Battery time&lt;br /&gt;- A bit loud - I am already used to it&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive replacement blades&lt;br /&gt;- Durability: mine failed after just one and a half years of use. Great customer service though.</li>
    <li> I was the owner of Braun shaving products for years. My latest was the very pricey Braun 760. I dutifully bought and used the Braun proprietary cleaning solutions (an annoying, recurring expense). I changed the screen and blades as directed. Nevertheless, it did a crummy job, particularly with neck whiskers. I had to go over the same facial areas at least twice for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally started shopping for another shaver after the plastic side trimmer broke, and I was directed to mail the Braun to a San Francisco repair shop who would quote me the repair cost after examination of the product. Riiiight! I went shopping on Amazon and found the Panasonic shavers. I read the reviews and settled on the ES8243A. I particularly like that I can clean it with soap and water and use it wet or dry. I don&#x27;t have to buy a special, proprietary cleaning fluid as I did with the Braun 760. Also, this shaver delivers a much closer and faster shave than the Braun. There was no \\&quot;break in\\&quot; period for my beard; I noticed the difference immediately. This shaver was less than half the cost of a new 700 series Braun. I&#x27;m sticking with Panasonic from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Braun shavers for about the last 15 years.  Lately, it seems like nearly every \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the latest model has resulted in longer shaving times to get the same level of closeness.  A few weeks ago, I decided to risk 100 bucks, and give Panasonic a try...specifically the 4 blade ES8243A. I must say, I&#x27;m really impressed!  While it was taking me 15-20 minutes to shave with my latest Braun (even after replacing the foil and blades), this new Panasonic gives me an even closer shave in less than 5 minutes.  This is like an hour of my life back every week...or about two full days less time wasted on shaving every year.  Hummm...I wonder what I can do with all that new-found time.?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is thick, and grows very fast.  I&#x27;ve never been able to use a blade because of skin iritation problems.  I&#x27;ve never used any of my shavers wet, I only shave dry.  I&#x27;ve tried both before, and after my showers, and the results don&#x27;t seem to change much for me.  Braun users, do yourself a favor, and risk the $100, and give this Panasonic a try. If your beard is anything like mine, you will be amazed at how close and fast it is!</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver as a gift for my husband almost 2 years ago. As a long time mach 3 blade user with sensitive neck skin, it took him 3 weeks to adapt to the new shaver. Using the shaver wet with billy jealousy shave cream he found the shaves to be very good requiring just a small amount of razor clean up in order to achieve a great shave.    The display stopped working properly after approximately one year. Not a huge deal as the shaver still worked for its intended purpose. However, a bit of a pain to try and figure out when the unit needed a charge. The difficulty ranged from intermittent black-out giving no info to all LED indicators lighting up at the same time.    Then, after 22 months of use it just quit. Very disappointing for a $100 appliance to stop working completely. Likely  just a battery replacement is needed. But sadly, Panasonic does not sell replacement batteries. Hence the 4 star rating.    2015 update to review:  Very happy with Panasonic&#x27;s handling of the warranty. Mailed shaver to them and they replaced with a brand new unit within 2 weeks. Very surprised by the rapid turn-around.</li>
    <li> I must admit that in the past and with limited funds, I broke down and purchased a lesser brand of shaver. After three months it bit me! Twice! I finally purchased the Panasonic ES8243A without all the bells and whistles and have found it to be wonderful. Buy it! You won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added review 3 weeks later. I am more pleased with this shaver after three weeks have passed. the smoothness of the cutting heads is fabulous. No more razor burns, no more cuts on the jaw line and the smoothness and quietness of the unit is a great experience. You can actually feel the quality of the product in the balance of the shaver; how it feels in your hand. It even has a sleek trim look of being a great product. In this shaver, you definitely \\&quot;get what you pay for\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful note: I also use a razor clean and lube spray that is sold on line as well. At least twice a week, I pull the head, brush off the deposit of whiskers, spray the cutters, return the head and run for a few seconds and have found the to be of great help. It leaves the unit nice and clean.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor that I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I usually bought Norelco, but gavee this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;Closest shave ever and worth the money. $110</li>
    <li> I have had many Norelco shavers and finally I thought I get this one. By far this is the best electric shaver I have ever had ! It shaves like a regular Razor ! Amazing product. I would never go back to Norelco again.</li>
    <li> Shaves as smooth as a blade! Wet dry option is great</li>
    <li> All razors, electric and manual, irritate my face.  Before buying the Panasonic, I used a Norelco rotary old type (not close shave, because that irritated more). It was slow and did not shave close, but caused the least irritation.  The Panasonic ES8243A is great!  It not only shaves very, very fast, but causes zero irritation.  For a closer, smoother shave, use it with lather.  I rarely do, because the dry shave is completely satisfactory.  Recharging takes about an hour and it holds a charge for 8 to 10 days.</li>
    <li> Replaced my Braun 340 - incredible shaver.  I did not think this shaver would do better than my Braun but given the reviews I decided to give it a shot.  My shave is closer and faster than my Braun!  I am a believer of all the positive reviews!</li>
    <li> Great shave. Well made. Recommended</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could get excited about an electric razor, but after several sub-par razors I am so happy I finally tried Panasonic.  I had to loyal to Braun for over a decade and their quality seems to have dropped off over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most impressive thing about the Panasonic ES8243 is the efficiency of the shave on your entire face.  I used to have to go over my neck and chin several times to get a close shave, but now I get a close shave in one pass.  The result is a cleaner, close shave in less time.  The battery holds a charge for what seems like a dozen or more saves and it is easy to clean.  A better travel case is the only thing different I could wish for.  I will buy again once this one wears out!</li>
    <li> Well constructed . Good shave but nothing beats Norelco.</li>
    <li> This product was good for the price. I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He&#x27;s always running short on time, like most people in this busy world. Definitely has a close shave. Battery life is long in between charges. I do like that the digital display had the percentage of battery left. It also has a trimmer to get those edges shaped nicely. Comes with a nice case. Overall, good product without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Love it,  use it dry for convenience and there is no irritation,  cuts close and gets all the pain in the butt areas like the neck. 5 o clock shadow comes a little earlier than normal razors but that&#x27;s fine.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Thank you, it was as described.</li>
    <li> Did not work well.  Rough on the face, didn&#x27;t handle body hair well.  Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> This is the smoothest shaving electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is quick and easy. I like the wet/dry ability and the battery meter is nice. I would give it 41/2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The 1/2 star drop is only due to the positioning of the on/off button. I inadvertently push it while shaving once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Just how I hold it I guess. Overall I recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Use everyday for last 3 years.  Display went out after several months, difficult to tell when to charge.  It does charge quickly and keeps charge for unbelievable amount of time.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver, works better after a couple of weeks after your face has adapted to it.</li>
    <li> Close comfortable shave. I was surprised at how close it does shave. Easy to use and clean. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Works Great!  One of the best razors my husband has ever used (his opinion).  My husband shaves his head from partial hair loss at a young age.  He uses this razor twice a week (he has a duplicate of this razor that he uses on the road as well).  He has gone through many razors and out of all of them, he prefers this one.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Much better than my old Braun electric shaver. Close shave, fast, and it cleans easily with Palmolive dish soap and water. Works dry or with shaving cream. I like using it with shaving cream for more comfort, but if I&#x27;m in a rush I use it dry. Charges fast also, from 50% empty to full charge in about 1 hour.</li>
    <li> Well first of all the bad points - you will not shave in 3 minutes, you will take around 5 minutes for a 3 day worth of beard (not much), second and last bad point - sometimes there will be those very few points in your face were the shaver will not reach - very very few but there will be a couple hard ones. Now the good points - everything else in an excellent way.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a very fine shave.  Not too noisy.  Battery life is a bit short, at only 8 - 10 shaves per charge.  Cleanable with liquid soap under running water.</li>
    <li> I would have gave it five stars if the wet shave was a bit better and could be used when plugged in. Overall I am very pleased with the shave. It is my first foil shaver and performs well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Holds an excellent charge. I use it every other day. Usually only recharge it once a month.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent coverage with large shave head.&lt;br /&gt;Ability to lock the shave head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would be usable while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in the wet shave. Maybe I need to use a different shaving cream. It didnt get a closer shave than dry.</li>
    <li> The Arc 4 is good and smooth which shaved Easley ... The price is a letter bit high but surly it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I have had them a little over a month and am very happy with this. Love to get a close shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Still experimenting with gels and lotions. It does take me several passes before I get a very smooth result.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;mine ceased to work after just about a year of use. I mailed mine to them (my cost) and they returned a brand new one in a box to me almost over night. I am a happy customer again getting very good shaves</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this device.  I had no experience with electric shavers, but the outrageous price of razor cartridges led me to consider other options.  After extensive research, it seemed the Panasonic shavers were the best on the market.  I resisted buying the Arc 4 at $200, but when I saw on it Amazon for around $100 I decided it was time to try it and end the tyranny of disposable razor cartridges.  While it does not shave as close as a razor (Mach 3), it is still quite impressive at how close it shaves and gets to all dimensions of the face.  I love using it in the shower and actually makes shaving no longer feel like a dreaded chore.  It cleans easily and so far seems to last quite long on a charge.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get one sooner, as I could have saved so much money using the ARC 4 over razor cartridges.  I just hope the blades on this last awhile in order to judge the true cost of ownership.</li>
    <li> Perhaps my expectations were a little high but I really thought it would be a major improvement over my Norelco rotary shaver that I picked up at WalMart. It works fine on my face but it&#x27;s a workout to get my neck really smooth. It&#x27;s not bad but I probably wouldn&#x27;t pay that much for this razor again.</li>
    <li> .... It does what it is supposed to I guess, but never as nice as a shave with a real razor blade.</li>
    <li> Cuts well and the battery seems to hold a reasonable charge.  Sound level quieter than some other electric razors.  Shaves closer than any other razor I have owned in the past.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before buying this razor, and they said that this one was the best buy for the money, which I believe.. I get very good shaves with it, and have the option of wet or dry... Very nice!</li>
    <li> I use the top of the line Braun but I must say this is a very close shaving razor that is very easy to clean.  It is even quieter than my Braun and feels alot more solid.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver, I myself use the three blade Panasonic, my father asked me to find one for him and I recommended the Panasonic instantly. The shavers from Panasonic are the best value and from my experience last a long time and are the closest to a blade shave you can expect from an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We opted for the 4 blade version for my dad, and for someone who never used an electric razor before, at 57 he is a happy camper. I would recommend this shaver and will upgrade to a 4 blade model when mine is no longer useful.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves using this. It charges great, cuts great, cleans easily, and honestly the irritation is so minimal that I steal it on occassion!&lt;br /&gt;Safe to say two very happy customers.</li>
    <li> Recently I lost my Panasonic ES-LA63-S 4-Blade Electric Razor and decided to order a new one, but thought I would try a cheaper model. I ended up ordering this one, the ES8243A. I found that it would give a close shave; however I had to make multiple passes where as with my ES-LA63-S I got a close shave in just a couple of minutes. The whole purpose of me using a foil razor is because I get up early for work and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time shaving if I can avoid it. I figured all four blade Panasonics must be about the same, but I guess I was wrong. I bought this model for $94.99 trying to replace my other one and save some money. Yes, it gave me a close shave, but I could have gotten a quicker shave using a disposable razor (which defeated the purpose).&lt;br /&gt;  Today I sent it back and will likely get another Panasonic ES-LA63-S or I might try the new five blade. The Panasonic ES-LA63-S has a multi-flexible head which makes it pivot better to follow your contours while shaving, It also has a vibrating outer foil for one of the blades which is similar to the finishing foil on the model, just better. So, if your looking for a shave that is fast and close I would go with the Panasonic ES-LA63-S for an extra $25 dollars. If you don&#x27;t mind spending more time and want to save a little money, this model will do the trick. You will just have to spend an extra 3 or 4 minutes trying to get it.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and have used the waterproof Panasonic razor products for over 10 years. They deliver a close clean shave in the shower without the irritation. The recharge is fast and usually lasts a week. Just rinse shaver off with water and you&#x27;re good for the next shave. This unit features the remaining percentage of time available on the battery.</li>
    <li> not as good as older Panasonic  the washer charger on the older one lasted about a week before it quit altogrther too new to rate this one</li>
    <li> I have not seen him use a razor since I bought this for him at Xmas. NicIt gives a nice close shave</li>
    <li> Cuts close and good.  First battery charge lasted me about 15 shaves.  My beard isn&#x27;t too crazy thick so it takes me a short time to shave like 1.5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who was using disposable razors on his very course beard growth. (He gets a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow as soon as he is done shaving like Homer Simpson). He has used the shaver dry and wet and said the wet shave is easier. He said it does take a little longer than a regular razor, but, he supposes that with practice, the time it takes will shorten. Obviously, he has not cut or nicked his face using this, which is a plus. It cleans up easily. From my perspective, his face seems to be very smooth and hair free after using the shaver. Happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have used. I use it for shaving my head every morning. Love the display that tells you how long you shave for, remaining charge percentage and cleaning alert.</li>
    <li> Does not pull on hair like most electric shavers and gets very smooth. Still have to go over some areas with razor but overall good product</li>
    <li> I purchased this when it was a lightning deal.  I shave my head (and face) and have been considering an electric shaver for quite a while now.  I am very happy with this shaver and would purchase again.  It charges very quickly, shaves extremely close, is very easy to clean and is a quality product all around.</li>
    <li> My husband likes his new shaver.  I bought it for him for Christmas and so far so good.  He likes that it is waterproof and it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> After reading the great reviews about this product on Amazon.com, I decided to give it a try, and I really hoped this would work for me as well. I used it for a month. Initially it gave me a close shave, but it required several strokes to cut the neck area hairs. As the time went by, it started to leave more and more hair behind, and even after many strokes to the point of skin irritation, it was not able to cut many hairs. Bottom line, this could be a good shaver for many people, but for me, it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Very Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought my 1st panasonic wet dry about 16 yrs. ago, it was great in terms of shave, changed blades after a year or two, then about 8 yrs later handle started to unglue itself and I purchased a new one. 2nd one was just as good, loved the quality and ease of shave. about 8 years later just got bored with it and upgraded to the new model ES8243A which is blue in color. Not sure why but this razor does NOT produce the same quality shave, it claims to have 4 blades, but when the cover is removed it appears to have 2 blades like the previous models. The main issue with this shaver is the ingrown hairs it gives me on cheeks and sides of neck, had to discontinue use of this shaver and went back to hand shaving with soap after 16 yrs. Never had an ingrown hair with bumps ever, until I started using this razor. Now that I am bump free and no ingrown hairs for 2 months now, I went back to this razor for 3 days and sure enough, I have ingrown and bumps again. There has to be a flaw in the new blade design.. Dissapointed to say the least....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a few months and it is absolutely the greatest thing for shaving I have ever had.  Fabulous cutting, close, quick and I can use it anywhere.  Outstanding.</li>
    <li> I love it. Can go four days without charging or cleaning it. Best razor I have ever own.  I am 93 years old.</li>
    <li> I previously owned this very razor, except with a different model #.  I have had that one for over 5 years.  Finally, I decided I should get new blades, which I did but then it was still irritating my skin.  I looked and found this razor for just slightly more than the foil for my old one, which is identical to the foil on this one.  I recommend this shaver.  Five years before I needed blades or foil.  That&#x27;s good mileage.</li>
    <li> I have had my Panasonic for 3 years and it has worked great. Last night it started turning on and off by itself and displays some corrosion inside the unit. All in all I will just by a new one...</li>
    <li> I picked this up because after 10 years, my face is suddenly too sensitive for razors (not sure what happened). This thing comes with a slip of fluorescent paper with a big warning that begs you to try the product for 30 days before you return it. I thought that was probably a scam to trick you into going over the return policy, but it actually does take about a month to break it in real well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a piece of junk the first 2 weeks and I would have to keep touching my face up with a regular razor after to catch all the spots it couldn&#x27;t hit. However, after 2-3 weeks it started working really well and now I use it everyday for my face and head. It still has some trouble around my jawline but you get the hang of it after a while. The problem is that it has trouble over loose skin so you need to flex your face one way or the other to tighten it up. It&#x27;s definitely worth it thought because (after the first couple weeks) it leaves no irritation behind unless you really grind it into your face.</li>
    <li> It works well. My dad likes to use it.</li>
    <li> I compare this Panasonic vs mach3 blades. By price, I have savings considering 1 year in operation. It is practical to use. The duration of the recharge is good, I do not have to be recharging every moment.</li>
    <li> Panasonic&#x27;s shavers do a great job when it comes to shaving.  They&#x27;re fast, close, and minimal irritation compared to anything else I&#x27;ve used.  My facial hair is thick and grows fast, so the difference between shavers becomes apparent quickly.  I love the way Panasonic&#x27;s shavers do their job.&lt;br /&gt;BUT - and of course there&#x27;s a but - this one, like the others I&#x27;ve used - suffer from some sort of fatal flaw.  After several months of operation, the display will start to freak out and not function properly.  The button will randomly trigger on or off, especially while trying to use it.  Within a couple weeks, it&#x27;ll become inoperable.  This has happened to me with three Panasonic shavers now.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a matter of water getting into the circuitry, despite it being a &amp;#34;Wet/Dry&amp;#34; shaver, or just a run of bad luck, but I&#x27;ve switched to a Braun.  The shave isn&#x27;t quite as good, but it&#x27;s lasted a lot longer than any of my Panasonics ever did.</li>
    <li> my favorite razor. Second one i&#x27;ve owned</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best on the market. This is my third shaver over a 15 year period.</li>
    <li> There were times that I would look like a bloody mess days before a competition from shaving my legs with traditional razor. Once I purchased the Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) like became easy. No more choped legs and easy cleaning. If you cycle or run and compete this is your new best friend!</li>
    <li> This is perfect shaver, I have no complaints about it. Wet or dry - it shaves perfectly every time. Excellent value for its price.</li>
    <li> it is a great razor but it does snag up from time to time unless 100% charged.  i expected it to work better.  it is nice, holds charge but i have issues once in a while.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver, his beard is course like sandpaper, and this shaver has no trouble with course hair. He says that it doesn&#x27;t burn his face like a 2-5 blade razor, and shaves just as close. He is very impressed with it, and he uses it wet, as well as dry. I too was really impressed on his first shave, as his face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. When Poppy&#x27;s happy, Mimi&#x27;s happy!</li>
    <li> It started off as a very nice shaver. I have never gotten razor burn from it, which was especially a problem on my neck. It sometimes has difficulty getting some areas, or maybe I just need to replace the blades. I can&#x27;t say I have used it wet very often so I do not have much to say about that. It can sometimes start to smell quite bad, and when you do go to wash it out, make sure you leave it apart while you let it dry or it will smell similar to wet dog. Recently it has started to leak trimmings out while I am mid shave quite profusely, even right after cleaning. It still does a great job and is the best shaver I have owned thus far.</li>
    <li> Still can&#x27;t beat a blade. Don&#x27;t like 5 hat you have to wait for a charge if it runs out of juice.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 9 year old Panasonic of similar design but with only two foils. The batteries on the old shaver were not holding a very good charge, but did last 9 years!  This shaver uses LiIon batteries which are noticeably lighter than the NiMh batteries in my older shaver. The ES8243A does a better shaving job than my old Panasonic. I did find that I had to flip the shaver over when stroking in short movements because of the third &amp;#34;fininshing&amp;#34; screen.  On my old shaver it didn&#x27;t matter which way the shaver faced when stroking since both foils/cutters were the same - supposedly the angled head required you move &#x27;forward&#x27; only, but I found it didn&#x27;t matter much as long as you held the shaver perpendicular to the skin. The head/foil/cutter pivot on the new shaver was similar to my old one, but the Arc shape was new to me. The LED displays the time shaved, and after a few seconds after turning it off, the percentage of charge left. My old shaver just showed percentage of charge. I don&#x27;t know why the time is important. Cleaning this shaver is identical to the old one, but the ES8243A has a high-speed cleaning mode.  I use liquid hand soap which works just fine - no reason to buy a model with a self-cleaning device in a stand.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for my husband he loves using it</li>
    <li> I have had this product for nearly a year now. I use it in the shower daily and it still works great. I honestly think it works better on my mustache than a standard 3 or 4 blade manual razor. Also works decently on the rest of my face, but not as good on the neck.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son as a gift, and he uses it dry in the car between his home and work.  He&#x27;s really starved for free time, and he says it gives him a very smooth shave without the danger of a hand-held manual razor.  He&#x27;s really raved about how nice he finds the experience.</li>
    <li> Many of the reviews for this product talked about the razor being great for sensitive skin. I have not found this to be the case. It does give a really close shave when used with the Bill Jealousy Shave Cream, but it has the same irritation effect as many other razors. I found that I had less irritation without the shave cream, but removing all of the hair was a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, If you are looking for a razor that does not cause much irritation to sensitive skin then do not purchase this razor. If sensitivity is not an issue then it is a god product when coupled with the Billy Jealousy Shave Cream.</li>
    <li> This is indeed a great razor. I have tried many electric razors over my lifetime and have given up on them. This is the second Panasonic razor that I have had. The current model that I bought is much superior to the previous verson as well as all the others I have tried over the years.&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to clean and to use!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on its second-place finish in a razor comparison on Gizmodo, where this got second place, but has a much better price than the top finisher.  I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Cuts instead of pulling hairs, even with a few days growth&lt;br /&gt;* Less chance of razor burn than any other I&#x27;ve used over 25 years&lt;br /&gt;* Fast, doesn&#x27;t take many passes to get everything, maybe 4 minutes, plus another for getting where you missed?&lt;br /&gt;* Getting a clean, complete shave is pretty easy with little pressure&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;* Sideburn trimmer works well and isn&#x27;t louder than shaving&lt;br /&gt;* Sound isn&#x27;t annoying (to me)&lt;br /&gt;* Good carrying case for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Battery only good for 5-6 days of shaving&lt;br /&gt;* I wish the power cord was shorter and coiled, to take up less space (this is a personal preference, not a knock)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving yet since I don&#x27;t own shave cream, but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.</li>
    <li> This works really well and keeps a close shave without irritating my face.  If I let my beard grow out too long, though, I have to shave it down with a head trimmer (without a guard) first or this will pull your hair.  Still, it makes the process really fast.</li>
    <li> the best shaver i ever had. and iv&#x27;e had lots! primarily norelcos.</li>
    <li> I must say I am totally blown away on how good this shaver is. I keep my head bald and have been using manual razors for quite sometime now and I have used all sorts of electric shavers to shave my head. I must say that NO other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used has given me a smooth clean shave as this one has. When I received the shaver I immediately went to use it, at the time I had two days regrowth on my head and I was blown away by the closeness of the shave results. I will and must recommend this product to anyone out there who is bald and looking for alternative to using a manual razor. The shaver works great with shaving cream and under the shower head, I haven&#x27;t tried a dry shave yet and probably won&#x27;t because that&#x27;s not my thing. So far I&#x27;m extremely happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shaver.  I don&#x27;t think I ever got a closer shave from an electric razor.  As good as a razor.</li>
    <li> This razor works very well, the wet feature is awesome.</li>
    <li> With daily use and it shaves as well as the first time.  Cleaning is a snap.  I put a small amount of liquid soap and water on the foil while turned on, invert, place on hand in faucet stream to rinse.  Remove head, set aside to dry.  I use it dry, seems to work better on dry stubble.</li>
    <li> There is a lot to like about this shaver. First, it&#x27;s not made in China! It is well made, as are most Panasonic products. It&#x27;s also nice looking, and, for the most part, well designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I must compare it to a regular razor. The shave simply isn&#x27;t as good. (That said, it doesn&#x27;t cut you.) I find that it misses some hairs in depressions on my neck. I eventually use the clippers to get those. The shave is not bad, it&#x27;s just not as good as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design-wise, it&#x27;s very nice. My only complaint would be the location of the power button. I am continually turning it off while I shave. For me, it&#x27;s not in the best location.&lt;br /&gt;If you want an electric shaver, my guess is this is as good as any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 05/04/2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaver with a 24 month warranty is now about 1.5 months old. When I pulled the charging cord out of my suitcase I found the end of the cord, near the plug, had broken off. No problem, I called Panasonic. Their story is that the power cord is an &amp;#34;accessory&amp;#34; and not covered under warranty!</li>
    <li> Recommend it, very close shave. Cuts my shaving time to halve the time. Only comes with 2 blades not 4.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors for almost 50 years and this is by far the best shave I have ever gotten from one.  It is great in every way with the exception of its instruction pamphlet which is poor and although I have emailed Pansonic for clarification I have gotten no response</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT ONE FOR ME AND ONE FOR MY SON&amp;#62; WORKS GREA</li>
    <li> Excellent razor in this price range. Switched to Panasonic years ago and never looked back</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fairly old guy who has bought and used most every electric shaver on the market.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve used by far.  I like the wet/dry system.  Sometimes I use it wet with a gel or just grab it for a dry shave.  Either way, I get a good shave.  I like the readouts that tell me how much battery life remains and when to clean it.  I would not hesitate to buy another.</li>
    <li> I Love this Shaver it took a couple of shaves to get use to at first but the switch from safety razors to this is well worth it I like the fact that I can shave in the shower and cleaning it is easy just hold it under running water and turn it on :)</li>
    <li> It works good and charges quickly. I have since updated it with another newer model that works even better but costs more.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the Arc 4 electric shaver as a budget buy in comparison to the top Braun/Norelco shavers.  Let me cut to the chase and give you the pros and cons - which ultimately led me to return my shaver and buy a Braun Series 7:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice handle grip and evenly weighted&lt;br /&gt;- Not as loud as some reviews have led to believe&lt;br /&gt;- Efficient at cutting hair on face&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Horrible job on my neck including a few minor nicks&lt;br /&gt;- Head is too large for any detail work&lt;br /&gt;- The aesthetic design leaves a lot to be desired&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer is poorly designed&lt;br /&gt;- LCD screen feels like an after-thought&lt;br /&gt;- Foil replacements are very expensive compared to the competition&lt;br /&gt;- My shaves were not consistent&lt;br /&gt;- Wet shaving with lather was not as expected&lt;br /&gt;- Did not cut as close or consistently as Braun Series 7</li>
    <li> Great shaver to use on my head. Close and clean shave. I get about 5 shaves for every charge. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Works good. Best razor I&#x27;ve ever, ever owned!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor, the only complaint is that if I run out of battery while shaving, it isn&#x27;t possible to continue shaving while connected to the ac adapter. I would have to wait for the battery to charge enough and unplug it from the wall in order to finish shaving.</li>
    <li> Excellent Cordless Shaver.  Previously, for over 7 years had a Panasonic cordless shaver; close shave, charged quickly, and extremely durable. No surprise, my new Panasonic shaver is even better with the 4th blade.</li>
    <li> Terrible could not use it shaved very poorly. Used for a week and thru out.</li>
    <li> Does not work as good as advertised. Takes longer to charge, than others for same price. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic shaver for more than ten years. I switched to other shavers, but I always came back. There are two major reasons for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. wet/dry: I like to use shaving foam. It gives me a very nice and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. Linear motor: The speed maintains almost even the power is almost running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is one of the latest model. I am very happy with it except the charge won&#x27;t last long. For my last Panasonic shavers, one charge will last almost two weeks. With this one, I have to recharge in less than a week. I hope they can come up with a charging system as good as previous ones.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver, fast shipping and top quality materials.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been a Gillette  user for years...well NO MORE! this shaver gives me a CLOSER shave than any 5 blades razor and no cuts and bleeds. Not having to buy expensive replacement is a huge advantage, saves you time and money! Love the LCD screen and the fast charge...What a fine piece of technology you created PANASONIC! A BIG thank you from me!</li>
    <li> Received before stated delivery date. Gives very good dry shave, have not tried wet. Would recommend to buy.</li>
    <li> My third one. Enough said</li>
    <li> Got it because of my super sensitive skin. My first electric shaver. Gentle shave first time in ten years with no irritations, it does leave few hairs here and there behind but that&#x27;s not a problem, you&#x27;ll get them eventually. Clean up is fantastic with running water and little liquid soap. Smart and great quality machine. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have this one and ES-LA63-S.  This one is normally cheaper and even after having them both for more than a year and changing the blades and foils at the same time - this is the one I go to and get the hard to shave side neck hairs. So pretty much the only one that gets used; as for me its better in every way. I just drive shave with it and rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it still leaves a few behind.  I only use the ES-LA63-S when the ES8243A is dead.  Also my opinion is anyone on the fence about self cleaning or not - don&#x27;t bother.  I have had those also but they come clean in seconds with the cap off under the sink.  Save some cash for more Amazon stuff. Some times this one gets close enough to a full replacement foil and blades cost one might consider it as a hand me down or disposable..</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been 2 years and I still love this Shaver.</li>
    <li> Have been using Panasonic razors for many years and this is the best yet. Get a very close and comfortable shave and really appreciate how quickly the battery can be recharged. That said, I still need to use a blade razor to touch up some tight spots that the head can&#x27;t get to but don&#x27;t consider it to be a problem.</li>
    <li> Works great and holds charge forever when not used. Still not as close as razor.</li>
    <li> Some what disappointed, can not beat the manual shaving, although it is safer.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find a better trimmer for the money that works so well. Light and easy to use.great trimmer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco shavers for years but as my latest one started to die, I thought I&#x27;d try a change so I went with this Panasonic.  I&#x27;m generally happy with it but here are some additional thoughts if you&#x27;re deciding:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It seems well made and is comfortable in-hand.  It&#x27;s MUCH easier to clean than any Norelco.  It has a nice screen that tells you how much charge is left--also how long you just shaved (not sure the reason on that last one).  It shaves very close and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at hair like the Norelco does if you&#x27;ve skipped a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s a little louder and shriller than my last Norelco.  The trimmer is not well designed in that it&#x27;s short and narrow so it&#x27;s hard to see what you&#x27;re doing while using it.  The Norelco one is better designed.  Battery life seems relatively short, so expect to charge it at least once a week if you&#x27;re using it daily.  The power button is located right below where your thumb sits while you&#x27;re shaving so once you&#x27;ve powered it up it&#x27;s easy to accidentally turn it off.  There are some little dimples above the button and that seems to be where they want your thumb to end up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this dry, with a liquid pre-shave and with a gel, and it seems to do fine with all of these.  The gel is kind of messy and requires clean up right after you shave, so I&#x27;m still not sure how much I&#x27;ll do that--maybe there&#x27;s a better gel product to try.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the shaver is a good product but I&#x27;m not blown away.</li>
    <li> As a general razor its fine but if you want to have anything more then a weekly &amp;#34;once over&amp;#34; shave its not the best. I found that I had to go over again with a regular razor in order to get to clean shaven. Also, this thing cut up my adam&#x27;s apple area on my neck.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I have been told that it does a good job.</li>
    <li> Gives my husband a smooth shave.  Nice versatility.</li>
    <li> ***History***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a die-hard Panasonic razor user for many years.  My last non-Panasonic razor was purchased in the late 70&#x27;s and was an AC powered Norelco.  Yes at least some of you will remember the old Norelco ads during the holidays, where Santa was sledding on the Rotary Track razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of my last Panasonic razors has lasted a long time and I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied with them.  So, once my trusty Panasonic ES8067 started acting up (the trimmer stopped working and needed new blades), it was time to purchase yet another Panasonic razor (why wouldn&#x27;t I?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the ES8243A after carefully reviewing options and liking the price point and features.  It was purchased through Amazon and arrived ahead of the promised time (can&#x27;t hate that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********Review Conditions*********&lt;br /&gt;I tested this razor in three ways:&lt;br /&gt;1)  shaving 4 day&#x27;s growth&lt;br /&gt;2)  shaving 1 day&#x27;s growth&lt;br /&gt;3)  edging and trimming my goatee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All shaving was cool and dry (not steamed whiskers or with any electric shaving liquids).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we go…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********PROS*********&lt;br /&gt;+ Comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;+ Wet/dry so cleaning it is very nice&lt;br /&gt;+ Made in Japan (not China)&lt;br /&gt;+ An LCD shows battery and charging status&lt;br /&gt;+ It has a cord that can be plugged in and run even if the battery is dead&lt;br /&gt;+ The price was good (plus there was a $20 off coupon)&lt;br /&gt;+ It looks nice (well maybe it&#x27;s important to someone)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********CONS*********&lt;br /&gt;- Pulls whiskers when shaving longer growth (seriously ouch)&lt;br /&gt;- Has a cord to charge (yes it&#x27;s also a con) and not induction charging&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t edge a goatee very well&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer is difficult to use&lt;br /&gt;- Light weight (details later)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll start with the PROS…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Comfortable Shave***&lt;br /&gt;This razor does a great job, when shaving normal one-day growth (not long whiskers).  It was comfortable to use, didn&#x27;t irritate my face and provided a very close shave.  In comparison to my Panasonic ES8067, the result was somewhat closer/smoother overall.  It also seemed faster at completing the shave but this may not be fair since my older razor actually needs new blades (which I&#x27;m not buying just to do the review, lol).  It is fair to say that it obtained a good quality result quickly.  Please see the related &amp;#34;Pulls Whiskers!!!&amp;#34; con, later in this review for the full story on its shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Wet/Dry***&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that has a wet/dry razor will probably agree that it&#x27;s very handy to be able to clean them with water.  Pop it open and run it under hot water and set to dry (huge plus for me).  I don&#x27;t use the razor wet or with shaving gel but you can (a plus for someone out there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Made in Japan***&lt;br /&gt;My old Panasonic ES8067 lasted more than 16 years.  For something used every day and sometimes 2x a day, it&#x27;s hard to argue that their build quality is not great.  I did replace my foils and blades from time to time (twice that I can recall) but that is to be expected.  Foil+Blade cost is roughly the same for both of these models at around $50 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that my experience with this new (still made in Japan) model is similar.  We&#x27;ll see…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***LCD Display***&lt;br /&gt;The display shows status of the battery (bar display and % remaining), an indicator if it is plugged in and charging and the minutes/seconds it was used.  My old razor only had a couple LEDs that told when it was charging and when it needed charging.  The new detail is nice since I can gauge how much time I actually still have to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Price***&lt;br /&gt;The price was good and with the current coupon deal it was less than a hundred bucks. If I get another 16+ years on this one, that&#x27;s pretty darn cheap, even with a couple foil and blade replacements figured in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Looks Nice***&lt;br /&gt;For those that care a lot about aesthetics in their razor, I&#x27;m noting this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here is the entry that is a Pro and a Con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Cord to Charge*** (pro &amp; con)&lt;br /&gt;Here is the double edged sword.  It uses a cord to charge it, unlike the ES8067 that was induction charged.  I had always liked the induction charging but the only reason I&#x27;m listing this as a PRO is that you can run the razor plugged in.  The ES8067 required recharging when it was out of battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both models quote a 1hr charge time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the meat of what I didn&#x27;t like so much, the Cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Pulls Whiskers!!! ***&lt;br /&gt;First I just want to say, &amp;#34;OUCH!&amp;#34;  I tested this on about 4 day&#x27;s growth.  When I made my first pass, I went at the normal speed I would have used with the ES8067 and &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;... wow, not fun.  I experimented with it and through quite a few ouches later... I found that I needed to slow down about 50%.  At that speed I was getting pretty consistent results without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?  No idea really but my older ES8067 with &amp;#34;less powerful motor&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;less advanced blades&amp;#34; definitely handled the heavier growth at a faster pace without ouches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On shorter growth (normal 1 day growth) I had no experience with ouches.  This leads me to believe that the real issue is just with the foil/cutter that is handling the longer whiskers.  So if you are a disciplined every-day shaver, this may never be a CON for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edging***&lt;br /&gt;There is a distinct difference in the ES8243 vs the older ES8067.  I have been unable to just use the razor to shave the edges of my goatee.  I just can&#x27;t get it to shave up to that line and have a clean break between goatee and shaved face.  The older model did this well.  This is not long hair trimming but the actual short whiskers that are to be &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ll keep working on how I&#x27;m doing this but it is fair to say that it is harder to obtain the same results that I had with the ES8067.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Trimmer***&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a huge step back from myES8067.  The pop up trimmer is both narrower (22mm vs 30mm) and has finer teeth than the old model.  It also pops out away from the back of the razor (perpendicular) vs the old model which slid up to just above the foils.  This means that the razor body blocks you being able to see what you are doing.  The overall effect is that it is more work and much harder to use.  I&#x27;m unlikely to use the pop up trimmer at all and will stick with my Wahl clippers for this task.  That is unfortunate since it is far more work to go get another device for a task that my old razor handled well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Weight***&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is more of a nebulous topic in that I can&#x27;t say for sure that it is a con.  It is a difference that I infer something from.  The ES8243A (179g) is significantly lighter than the ES8067 (260g).  When you pick them up, the difference is striking, like picking up something with a metal frame vs one with plastic.  I don&#x27;t actually know what parts in the razor are lighter but 81g is a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some types of products lighter would be a great change, in others not.  My perception of a mechanical device (based on past experience) is that light means less robust build quality.  I have no facts or experience with this particular item to back up any claim of less quality.  This is just perception.  Time will tell the real story.  Remember my ES8067 lasted over 16yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Summary***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure yet what I really think of the razor, from the standpoint of overall satisfaction.  My experience and thoughts on it are definitely a mixed bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How you will feel about it is likely to depend on which of the above points are important to you and which are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for sure, when shaving normal one-day growth and not dealing with edging, trimming or shaving heavy multi-day growth, the razor does provide a very nice close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s it.  I hope you find this useful and good luck with your razor purchase!</li>
    <li> This replaced an older model Braun and is head and shoulders a better unit.  Very smooth shave and the built in ultrasonic cleaning system works great.  It is a little big pricy but worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband only dry shaves his face once a week and has issues with getting ingrown hairs and he loves this shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t grab his skin or nick him and leaves him with baby smooth skin.  It gives a close shave as good as any razor.</li>
    <li> best electric shave I have ever had</li>
    <li> I had been a Norelco rotary blades loyalist for the past 15 years, upgrading 3 times to their latest and greatest electric shaver.  I always had to make multiple passes (even with their improved 3 rows of cutters per rotary blade) over my beard.  I decided to give the Panasonic 4 rows of cutters a chance on the basis of reviews from users and it did not disappoint.  This shaver is an incredible value, as well as an incredible shaver.  I shave in half the time my Norelco used to take.  Finish shaving and put 1 drop of liquid soap on the cover, place under running tap water for 2 or 3 seconds and turn it on -- wait 15 or 20 seconds and rinse with tap water -- the cleaning process is complete.  No chemical washes to buy, no other rinsing necessary.  Smells fresh and is ready to go.  Charging is quick, though this shaver has to be recharged every 5 uses.  I find that does not pose a problem.</li>
    <li> I stopped using electric razors a very long time ago, due to burns and inefficiencies of the ones I had tried. Recently, I decided to sport the \\&quot;bald look\\&quot; and definitely did not want to trust my scalp to a traditional razor blade! Several folks recommended I try the Panasonic ES8243A, especially for head shaving. I took their advice and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor! It is absolutely amazing what a comfortable and close shave this razor is capable of producing! While I originally purchased this razor strictly for my head, I am now using the ES8243A for my head and my beard. If you are considering purchasing this product, stop wondering and researching, you can not beat the performance of this razor and especially at this price!</li>
    <li> I only use this razor for cleaning up my neck after trimming my beard. I like the way the head flexes, the way the razor feels in my hand, and the closeness of the shave (lower neck isn&#x27;t the easiest area to shave). It even does well with longer hairs without leaving me with the feeling they were yanked out (my older razor would really tug on longer hairs before they were cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges quickly and has great charge status indicators. One thing that put this at 4 and not 5 stars is that you cannot use it with the charger plugged in; I guess only the older razors had that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the cleaning steps and that the razor tracks when cleaning is needed. I have not tired using this razor \\&quot;wet\\&quot; (i.e. in the shower), in part because of reviews I&#x27;ve read on several wet razors about them failing after several months or a few years of shower use due to leaks.</li>
    <li> It has been a few years since I tried an electric shaver.  My experiences with electric shavers in the past has been mixed, so I wasn&#x27;t sure which shaver I should go with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say this Panasonic shaver exceeded my expectations.  It provides a smooth, close shave in a short amount of time.  I grow a thick beard seemingly overnight, so daily shaving is a must.  On a single charge, I will get 4+ days of shaving from this Panasonic.  So, for a short trip out of town, I don&#x27;t even bring the charging cord.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and no sign of shortened battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works in the shower, but I dry shaving with this razor and get a good shave without any kind of razor burn.</li>
    <li> My old Braun shaver finally burnt out and I purchased this Panasonic model after reading the reviews. i have to say that I have been very impressed, does the job: gives a close shave and is very quick, the two things that are important on any busy morning!</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Closer shave in less time than my previous electric razor. Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Have used it for almost two years now and it is still ticking. Very pleased with this product. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic gives the best shave of any shaver I have owned and my price paid was excellent; now I will wait and see if it&lt;br /&gt;stands the test of time.</li>
    <li> I wish I could use the main blades when my facial hair gets a bit on the long side, but the trimmer does a great job of cutting them down to the stubble the main blades handle very well. Still, I really like it and don&#x27;t regret getting it, my first electric razor in over 20 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 89 year old father. I had read the reviews about how this one did not pull the hairs when in use. The first time he tried it he was very pleased! This lived up to the reviews. It was extremely fast recharging and sooo easy to clean!  Very Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Best i have owned.  Nice fast close shave. Love the features and overall look and feel. Awesome. 5 stars all the way</li>
    <li> I use it with the face cream and it leaves a smooth feeling. I have never hand an electric cut this well. Hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> This is the best I have ever used. i i i love love love it it it it it it</li>
    <li> THE CHIN AND UNDER THE CHIN ARE THE HARD PARTS TO REMOVE</li>
    <li> I have been an electric razor user for more than 25 years and used Remington foil products 90% of the time with a brief excursion to a Norelco floating head type of electric razor. I always like the Remington foils and would just buy the newer model when my current one wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I read reviews both online and in Consumer Reports and decided to spend a little more money and try this Panasonic ES8243A. I was a little hesitant because Panasonic made OK TVs and mediocre electronic components, but what did they know about shaving? Turns out, quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shaving experience I have had in 25 years. It is very quiet compared to the Remington. It shaves close and does not miss neck hairs like my Remington did. It does not pull the occasional whisker out by the root. That in itself is a huge plus to me. I like the digital display informing me how much charge remains. The recharge is much quicker than the Remington. And it weighs less than my old Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn, I love this razor. Why did I wait so long to discover the Panasonic? Spend a few dollars more and invest in this razor.</li>
    <li> I use the razor to shave my head.  It does a great job - not quite as close as a razor - but never with any cuts or nicks. It holds a charge for a long time. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic wet-dry shavers on a daily basis since the 1990&#x27;s, and employed this particular model for three-and-a-half years (June 2009 to Jan 2013). I have a thick beard coupled with adult acne and sensitive skin, so shaving has always been a challenge.... Happiest day of my life was when I was able to combine an electric shave with hot, wet lather, a concept that Panasonic introduced. (Note: there&#x27;s really no need to spend a lot of money on a shaver if you can&#x27;t / aren&#x27;t going to wet-shave with it; a dry-electric shave will inevitably be inferior.) I agree with other reviewers that the design of, and results from, Panasonic&#x27;s earliest wet-dry&#x27;s were superior to the ES8243A (and similar high-end models of the past decade); nonetheless, I would still strongly recommend this shaver to anyone. It delivers a smooth face (even in the pesky spots under the chin and down the neck) with a minimum of irritation in under 4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the 4th or 5th Panasonic wet-dry I&#x27;ve owned, however, this model continues with what I have found to be a disappointing build quality. This shaver lasted 3.5 years before giving up the ghost; my previous Panasonic (earlier version of this model) lasted only about 3, as I recall. None have lasted more than 4 years. Granted, I provide regular, fairly hearty use, but I always scrupulously clean and air-dry the shavers - no dropping on the floor or tossing out of windows. This shaver failed in a manner identical to the previous one: one day it started activating randomly, without my touching the switch, and within a week it stopped responding to the switch entirely (i.e. wouldn&#x27;t turn on). During the previous 12 months, the battery life had decreased - down to about 16-20 minutes on a full charge - and the LED screen had ceased functioning, though the motor still provided full RPM and shave quality was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My buying habits tell the story: to replace my deceased ES8243A, I&#x27;m sticking with Panasonic, as I always do, and have purchased an ES-LF51, essentially the same shaver with a slightly stronger motor. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it. But I own a cheap backup, which I expect to have to use for a few days in about 3.5 years (give or take a few months) when my new Panasonic fails. 4 Stars, because any product that costs more than 100 dollars (as this model did in 2009) ought to last at least 5 years.ys do, and have purchased an ES-LF51, essentially the same shaver with a slightly stronger motor.

    <li> I have only had this razor for about 2 weeks. I am more than happy with the results. I have always had a problem with razor burn on my neck with an electric razor. About a year ago I began shaving my head and have the same problem with the neck area. I switched to the Gillette Power Fusion which I love but was looking to save some money on blades so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, a close shave and not a trace of razor burn. not even the first time. I thought for sure that would happen. It says to wait 30 days for it to really start giving you a close shave. While the Fusion is a tad bit closer right now. I am very happy with it and am guessing that it will catch it real soon.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you are looking for an electric!!</li>
    <li> it is very good productor, but it just makes a  little bit more noiser than Piliph, in  a word , I like it</li>
    <li> Husband loves it.  Says it is a good shaver</li>
    <li> After years of buzzing my head once a week or so with clippers, I decided to go totally bald and experimented with methods.  Blade in the shower worked well but was slow and laborious, so I decided to try electric shavers.  Before buying this one I tried a triple head Norelco and a Braun foil.  Neither worked satisfactorily.  I did a little online research that pointed me to Panasonic.  I am super pleased with this shaver.  In less than 3 minutes I get a shave that is the functional equivalent of a blade shave. I have not yet tried it wet in the shower, as it works perfectly for me dry before showering.  I don&#x27;t give many 5 star reviews, but this product deserves one.</li>
    <li> had this for a few yrs, still going strong, use it every day without any issues. easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> I have tried all brands of electric shavers.  Its always a question of what works best for the individual.  I have owned two Norelcos and for me they both were inferior to this model.  I was lucky as I paid $79.99 after a 20 dollar coupon here that was applied to purchase at checkout.  I always seem to return to Panasonic.  To me - it comes down to the Arc 3 or 4.  The Arc 5 is far too expensive in my opinion.  Bear in mind that the replacement cutters / foil are least expensive for the Arc 3.  So the cost of ownership for that model cannot be beat.  That would be the best choice if one was happy with results.  However - again, it comes down to what works best for the individual.  This Arc 4 model is dated and there is a newer model around now.  But for what I paid its to me blade close and noticeably better than the Arc 3 model.  Especially if you pre-treat your face with a electric shave lotion that seems to get hair to stand up in order to achieve an unbelievably close shave.  I am finished with rotary shavers.  As far as  Braun&#x27;s go - their cleaning system is gimmicky as well as an added cost.  You cannot beat simply placing a few drops of a liquid soap on this shavers head and then pressing power and holding to go into its high speed cleaning mode.  You then simply remove the foil and rinse and let dry.  For what I paid. I feel this is the very best electric shaver value around.  Absolutely superior in quality and performance with a trimmer that is not only sharp but very precise.  I highly recommend.  Panasonic says to replace outer foil once a year and inner blades every other year.  Cost wise that is not too bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Remington for about 39 nine years and always preferred a blade.  On a whim I bought this Panasonic shaver and was amazed at how well it cut a 2 day growth totally dry with no pinches or pulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this 100%.</li>
    <li> Perfect smooth shave and fast! No rubbing face with razor until your skin turns red! I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is a superior shaver. Close shaves and a solid product. Also great for travelling..I now have two of them one for backup and I love them.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  My boyfriend uses it to shave his head, so that should give you an idea of its ruggedness.</li>
    <li> I bought this over 5 years ago, going strong, I&#x27;m actually thinking of buying another one as a backup in case. Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned so far, and don&#x27;t need the extra features to go up to the higher priced ones. Good enough for me. Only problem (but this is with all electric shavers) is buying replacement blades and screens, and the cost involved, but it&#x27;s worth the trade-off.</li>
    <li> After more than a thousand reviews what can I add? Well, as a traditional wet shaver I feel that electric razors have been given a bad rap. That has been deserved to only a degree. I started out using them back in the mid 70&#x27;s and continued until about 10 years ago. I have used a couple of Norleco razors and one Braun. I still have the Braun (Model 5414) that I was using for evening touch-ups. For reference I have a moderately tough beard combined with sensitive fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been wet shaving for about a decade. I travelled the familiar route of canned shaving cream and decent disposable razors and then to a Schick Quattro. For the last 3-4 years I graduated to using a shaving brush, better shaving creams and soaps and finally to double edged razors. I still use on very rare occaisons the Edwin Jagger razor equipped with Derby, Feather or Dorco blades. That served me well for years and is a very nice way to shave for very little money long term. As mentioned previously though, I have sensitive skin and it was taking it&#x27;s toll. I tended to use 5 passes on average to get a nice close shave. Six was not out of the question. By Sunday my face was very sensitive and I was tempted to skip a day which is not something I like to do at all. Trying to shave in the evening for a night out was not a fun prospect and I would cheat and use the Braun. Not nearly as close but passable.&lt;br /&gt;To give context I will rate my shaves in order of comfort and closeness. First off, cheap disposable razors. Worst of everything. Feels like I am ripping out the hair and the skin with it. My experiences with these go all the way back to their earliest days.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the older electric razors. Not very close and I would have to go over and over my face to get the job (it really felt like a job) done. ElecricShave did not help much. Any raising of the hair was accompanied by drying of the skin as well as a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;Third, the newer Gillette and Schick 4 blade razors. Ridiculously expensive blades and the shaves are not as close as a double edge. I experimented with this several times. After about 3 passes with them it seemed they just started gliding over my face without getting any closer. They are a good compromise between comfort, no nicks, and closeness. I could easily get closer after them with my double edge. In fact, when my face was a little tender I would use my Schick for the first 3 passes and then two more with the DE.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, my trusty DE razor. If it were not for the skin irritation I would have just stuck with it. The closest shave of all and quite a pleasurable experience every morning. Very economical as well once you purchase a razor. About 10 cents a blade when bought in decent quantities.&lt;br /&gt;OK, so now you have a baseline for my review. I would like to take the opportunity here to thank previous reviewers for helping me make the decision to purchase this razor. I have been using it for 5 weeks now. My face is in better condition than before without a doubt. I don&#x27;t have to worry about touching up before going out at night anymore. As a side note, I do not use any alcohol based after shave balms or cologne. As per my previous experiences I was hesitant to purchase another electric razor. This razor is in a completely different league. I did not expect to ever be able to give up my DE razor especially with my affinity for really close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this razor to dry shave but if you want a nice, COMFORTABLE shave, use a wet shaving technique. I still use my shaving brush to apply a very small amount of shaving cream directly to my face. No need for a shaving bowl. It&#x27;s too bad since a have a couple of nice ones. If you over-apply it will be like putting Bubble-Bath in a jacuzzi. Just a big counterproductive mess. I use Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving creams. It can be applied using just your hand if you wish to avoid the cost of a brush. I tried using plain water and facial soap but the results were not nearly as good.&lt;br /&gt;I make a few passes and then rinse off the razor and some of the lather off of my face. There is plenty of cream left inside the razor to give you a nice glide for a couple more passes. Don&#x27;t let it get dried out from the friction. Just keep your face slightly wet. You will get a nice feel for it in no time. The results have surprised and pleased me. Really a great shave with almost no irritation. I can touch up at night using a dry shave method without too much irritation at all. A little (non-alcohol) aftershave balm and I feel great. Is it as close as a 5-6 pass DE shave? Not quite but it is as close as a 4 pass shave at least, and certainly IMO as close as a Shick or Gillette shave with much more comfort. Everyone&#x27;s face is different so YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;A few folks have mentioned the noise of the razor. I only have my old Braun for comparison. At 4&amp;#34; away it measures 71 db. The Panasonic measures 66 db. The Panasonic is much quiter but it&#x27;s noise is a little higher in pitch. Certainly not too much to complain about IMO.&lt;br /&gt;My final verdict; a very fine product for a reasonable price. Works better than expected. This is coming from a very dedicated DE shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I will add a couple of side notes here for guys who have not tried products outside of the norm or are just struggling with having to shave and getting no pleasure out of it at all. First off, if you are using alcohol based after shave balms or colognes and you do not like the burn or the drying sensation quit using them. Just because most guys use them they might not be suitable for you. The most widely available non-alcohol product out there is Nivea for sensitive skin. There are a few out there as well but that one is still in my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, consider quitting the shaving cream in a can. Besides not being the most environmentally freindly stuff out there it winds up costing more especially if you purchase this razor. You do not want a thick and foamy product on yourface. At the rate I am using my cream it will take me years to use one tub of this stuff.The most widely available cream that I know of is Proraso (also marketed as Bigelow at Bath and Body). It comes in a metal tube like toothpaste. Very nice &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; scent as well.</li>
    <li> First things first, this shaver is obnoxiously loud(to the point where I can shave on the 2nd floor of my home and be able to hear it from the basement, absolutely nuts). The only other shaver I&#x27;d ever owned was a $40 Philip&#x27;s Norelco(2 years) from Target. Comparatively speaking, I&#x27;d say the shave falls short of the Norelco, though the trimmer is a lot more effective(though more prone to cutting/scratching skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m disappointed with the product. Definitely was not worth the price. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will be sticking with Norelco from now on.</li>
    <li> Shaves great. It doesn&#x27;t take that many passes like it did with an old Norelco I used before. I am most likely getting one for my dad I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for shaving my head.  Can&#x27;t use them on my face unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the first time was impressive.  This thing has speed to it.  Using a pre-electric-shave balm allows you to find the spots that need more attention without the need for a mirror (huge plus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it handled the task great and in a reasonable time frame.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how well it performs once my head is used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other pluses:  It holds a charge well.  Shaved my entire head thoroughly and it only used 20% of the battery.  It&#x27;s easy to clean!</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have had yet. Coming from having different norlco models for the last 15 years.  This one blows them away. Sticking with this brand for a while now!</li>
    <li> As a girl, I bought this electric razor to shave my legs when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time.  It works pretty well, but it does leave you just a little stubbly.  It is very quick though if you are in a hurry or need a quick shave and don&#x27;t want to get in the shower.</li>
    <li> i was very happy when i used it for the first time so different then other that i tried . i been using it for 2 months its worth it</li>
    <li> I am a life time user of electric shavers, almost 55 years.  The Panasonic is the best.  It is a slooww shave, but worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt; I have tough beard especially the neck and have to go over and over in multiple directions. After a few days use I have less skin irritation than with my older more expensive rotary.  I don&#x27;t care for the wet shave, it takes longer and my face dries out before I am finished, might be better if I was a shower shaver guy.</li>
    <li> I used to use an electric a long time ago, have never been able to find another at a decent price that gave me a close shave without hurting/chaffing my skin.  This one is a keeper! Battery lasts for several shaves/cleanings and even when it looks like it&#x27;s about to die with one bar blinking (for those of us who occasionally forget to charge) I can still get a full shave, running on fumes as it were.  I can think of nothing negative about this razor.  Use it in the shower without any preshave treatment and works great.</li>
    <li> Works much better than my older 3 blade Panasonic that was failing after less than 2 years of use.  The battery was the problem with the older model.  The main problem with any of these shavers is the wear rate of the cutters and screen.  Once they get worn it takes twice as long to shave.  I shave once daily and that should be less than the design standard for these shavers.  Replacement of these items is nearly as costly as buying a whole new unit. Could it be that Panasonic does not want to sell repair parts? That being said, these are still the best thing out there for producing a clean shave with an electric.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever tried. Faster than razor in the shower, less mess, cleaner shave. Best dry shaving &amp; done in 2 min&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Everythings is perfect</li>
    <li> This was a gift to a man who is very hairy.  It sure took care of his heavy beard and moustache!!</li>
    <li> I guess I like a smooth shave on all my face and neck. This is probably the best electric shaver available without having to take out a loan to pay for it. It&#x27;s just that these electric mowers take 3 times longer to get there than a good old blade. Now for my major complaint about his particular shaver. I&#x27;m like most of us,...lazy. How lazy am I ? To lazy to plug it back in to charge after every use. Well yea, it does recharge pretty quick but when your running late [always am] you can&#x27;t just plug this in and run it off regular 120v power. Ya got to wait or go without.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews which said this was a great razor for men with a fast-growing/heavy beard and sensitive skin I ordered his razor for my son.  Unless he let several days growth accumulate before shaving, the razor did NOT cut the hair on his face.  What good is a razor that cannot be used daily?  A complete dud!!</li>
    <li> MY OLD BRAUN IS BETTER, IT GIVES A CLOSER SMOOTHER SHAVE. NOT WORTH THE PRICE I PAID. BUY A BRAUN.</li>
