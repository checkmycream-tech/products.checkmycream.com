    <li> This is a great color that blends in well.</li>
    <li> This is my color! I cannot be without it and when I forget to reorder in time, it pains me to have to use an alternative. The smooth consistency of it, the shade, and the easy fit in my purse make it just heaven!</li>
    <li> I got the product right away and it was exactly the shade that I ordered. The gloss packaging  was slight beat up which was ok since I got the lipgloss for such a good price.</li>

    <li> This gloss is very light. It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel and will stay on for a while. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay lip glosses are probably the best I&#x27;ve ever had. The colors are gorgeous and they don&#x27;t feel too sticky on your lips.</li>
    <li> Love this lip gloss. It really makes one&#x27;s lips moist and shiney. Quick service and a great price buying online.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife.  She loves it.  She has been using this color (according to her) for several years and it &amp;#34;goes with anything&amp;#34; !</li>
    <li> Seller is deleting my review because she doesn&#x27;t want me to tell you that she gave me a tester instead of a new product. Product box was old, lip gloss had been used and you could tell just by looking at it. Get it from  representative from your home town instead of getting it here. Shame on you for selling me an open product and will keep putting back my review even when you delete it. The world needs to know.</li>
    <li> I really love this lip gloss. It&#x27;s not dark like grape color, it&#x27;s soft and shiny. And the best part, it has a great durability on lips. LOVE!</li>
