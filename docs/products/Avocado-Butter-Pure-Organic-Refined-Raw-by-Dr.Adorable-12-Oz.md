      <li>Great product, fast shipping, A++</li>

      <li>Really nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t sit on top of my hair nor does it go away after a while the way coconut oil does.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
      <li>Great product highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The butter is very effective once you rub it in your warm hands, but it&#x27;s not soft like one would imagine a butter to be.</li>
      <li>I made my own soft hair cream,  love the results!</li>
      <li>Love them clean and hygienic packaging.</li>
      <li>I have not used avocado butter before but this came in the mail in good time and seems to be a high quality product.  </li>
      <li>We are loyal Dr. Adorable customers.  </li>
      <li>I suppose I was expecting it to feel smooth.  </li>
      <li>It felt like it wasn&#x27;t getting absorbed and just sat on top of my skin.  </li>
      <li>The butter has a smooth and &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; feel, is medium weight, non greasy.  </li>
      <li>If you find it a bit grainy, just put some in your palms and rub hands together until smooth.</li>
      <li>What I received was more of the latter consistency, but , I found that if I rubbed the top of the butter with my finger tips the warmth and friction softened the butter and it was nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>No matter what I put on my hair, moisture retention was at best , a few hours at a time.</li>
      <li>Worth Every penny!</li>
      <li>The avocado butter is always a reliable, clean product that is packaged well and arrives quickly.</li>
      <li>If you plan to use this by itself as a skin cream, make sure that you&#x27;re going to sit very still for a while.</li>
      <li>Very nice but gritty when you put on at first</li>
      <li>It really seals in moisture quite nicely and the texture is soft, easy to apply to hair and skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin, and does a nice job of moisturizing-though it takes longer to soak in and may feel a little greasy when first applied.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>and some said it was kind of gritty.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s in love with it too, making her 70 year skin also soft and radiant looking.</li>
      <li>I section my hair right after I wash it and use a generous amount of the butter in each section while my hair is still wet/damp.</li>
      <li>Consumers should always be aware of organic in the title.</li>
      <li>This is my first time buying avocado butter.  </li>
      <li>I will say, this is not a sealant, it is absorbed into the hair shaft and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is definitely a great investment and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Gets really skinny...</li>
      <li>My body feels very hot/overheated.</li>
      <li>It really defines my coils.  </li>
      <li>My hair stays moisturized much longer and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy the way it did when I used the Shea butter.</li>
      <li>Also be very suspicious when you look at a product on Amazon and there isn&#x27;t any ingredients listed on the page or label of the product.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, this product was better mixing with Amlactin as a lotion.</li>
      <li>Price is good but product was hard and old.</li>
      <li>Mainly because all of that has fragrance and that just makes him itchier.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only will it become smooth, but a bonus that your hands will become baby soft.</li>
      <li>Last when there is a long list of ingredients in a body care product you can bet that most of the time it isn&#x27;t really organic.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t just sit on my hair, but penetrates throughout and leaves my hair very moisturized and feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Super grainy not like the original batch I purchased wish they&#x27;d send me a new one, not sure how to get in contact with them</li>
      <li>This product is smooth and does not feel &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; like the other product I bought on ebay.</li>
      <li>The new hair regime I have put myself on uses Avocado butter</li>
      <li>It starts out a bit stiff and grainy, however after you rub it, it softens and the rest is just short of spectacular.</li>
      <li>I like use my hair natural</li>
      <li>I try to use natural oils for my hair.  </li>
      <li>In truth I probably should have tried to send it back, but that&#x27;s so much of a hassle I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
      <li>This stuff made my sons skin soooooo soft after his bath.</li>
      <li>A few reviews said the quality of this product was inconsistent, some say it was smooth</li>
      <li>My skin has never been so soft and radiant looking.</li>
      <li>I use it before bed and always wake up with soft skin.  </li>
      <li>The butter is kinda thick, but melts pretty quickly when you rub it between your palms.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend if you make lotions/salves or you just want to use it straight up on dry skin.</li>
      <li>I made a small batch of homemade body butter with it and am excited to start trying it out.</li>
      <li>The second one was grainy and my guess is it was about to go off (which would make it quite old).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but not great.  </li>
      <li>moisturizing, smells just faintly like butter(ish) and will last a good long time.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is probably one of the best moisturizers I have ever used.  I use it before bed and always wake up with soft skin.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I became allergic to palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter after years of using it, so I switched to this product.  It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin, and does a nice job of moisturizing-though it takes longer to soak in and may feel a little greasy when first applied.</li>
    <li> Great Quality!  This is now my staple product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! let me repeat, LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have extremely porous, 4C hair that is constantly dry. No matter what I put on my hair, moisture retention was at best , a few hours at a time. I got caught up in the Shea Butter hype and that was extremely too heavy for my hair. The new hair regime I have put myself on uses Avocado butter and it is wonderful. My hair stays moisturized much longer and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy the way it did when I used the Shea butter. This product doesn&#x27;t sit on top of my hair nor does it go away after a while the way coconut oil does. I will say, this is not a sealant, it is absorbed into the hair shaft and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is definitely a great investment and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that I used in the process of making body butter. Blends well with other ingredients and has no overbearing smell.</li>
    <li> Great butter for skin and hair.  Update: March 2016 - There&#x27;s a reason why I stopped using this. I think I might have a slight allergy due to a history of latex allergies or there are remanants of nuts oils and butters in this (cross contamination) I have nut allergies. After using this my eyes get hazy and I get blurred vision. My body feels very hot/overheated. Feels like my throat is closing up. Plus my face changes in structure. Gets really skinny... it&#x27;s weird...I&#x27;ve stopped using this, washed my hair out. Had to return this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from them a couple of times and their quality is inconsistent. The first time I got beautiful very smooth avocado butter. The second one was grainy and my guess is it was about to go off (which would make it quite old). So I was bummed. In truth I probably should have tried to send it back, but that&#x27;s so much of a hassle I&#x27;ve been using it. But I will only use this batch in salves because of the graininess.</li>
    <li> Super grainy not like the original batch I purchased wish they&#x27;d send me a new one, not sure how to get in contact with them</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love it and works wonderfully in my lotion recipes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Not very absorbent, and gritty.</li>
    <li> Price is good but product was hard and old. Poor customer  service to get a refund. Told to heat it up. No thanks  my money back minus shipping of course</li>
    <li> smooth, no scent, great in body butters.</li>
    <li> Love this product...smell, quality, packaging etc! It woks extremely well for my hair. Everyone raves about coconut oil, which I enjoy, but my fav would have to be this avocado oil!</li>
    <li> Love this company and their products.  May be a little higher, but I can trust what I&#x27;m buying</li>
    <li> Love love love it.&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema on my hands and the skin gets very dry and cracks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched from lotions to oils and butters and this stuff ROCKS.&lt;br /&gt;Super moisturizing, smells just faintly like butter(ish) and will last a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend if you make lotions/salves or you just want to use it straight up on dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying avocado butter.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  A little goes a long way.  I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Love them clean and hygienic packaging. Love it.</li>
    <li> Super creamy, smooth, feels great on the skin. I&#x27;ve used avocado oil for a few years and might switch to the butter from now on. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> If you find it a bit grainy, just put some in your palms and rub hands together until smooth. Not only will it become smooth, but a bonus that your hands will become baby soft. I also use it to condition the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.  I use it to moisturize the body, lips, and even use it on the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> A few reviews said the quality of this product was inconsistent, some say it was smooth and some said it was kind of gritty. What I received was more of the latter consistency, but , I found that if I rubbed the top of the butter with my finger tips the warmth and friction softened the butter and it was nice and smooth. It is a heavier butter, so it is good to apply after a bath or shower and before bed. It has been a wonderful moisturizer without all the preservatives and additives that commercial butters have. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great product highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is superior to the avocado butter I bought from another manufacturer.  This product is smooth and does not feel &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; like the other product I bought on ebay.</li>
    <li> I like it, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy!!</li>
    <li> I use it to moisturize my skin I also use it in a home made hair treatment.  Very little goes a long when making the hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> The butter is very effective once you rub it in your warm hands, but it&#x27;s not soft like one would imagine a butter to be. It starts out a bit stiff and grainy, however after you rub it, it softens and the rest is just short of spectacular. My skin has never been so soft and radiant looking. My mother was so impressed with my skin that she asked for her own jar. She&#x27;s in love with it too, making her 70 year skin also soft and radiant looking.</li>
    <li> Really nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Consumers should always be aware of organic in the title.You only need one or two ingredients in body care products in the United States to use organic in your title. Also be very suspicious when you look at a product on Amazon and there isn&#x27;t any ingredients listed on the page or label of the product. Last when there is a long list of ingredients in a body care product you can bet that most of the time it isn&#x27;t really organic. Also know the harmful chemicals that they try and hide under the title of organic in their long list of ingredients. In this product they do not list any of their ingredients on the Amazon page. I ask Amazon for help to see if the ingredients were listed on the product and two people answered and said no.</li>
    <li> We are loyal Dr. Adorable customers.  The avocado butter is always a reliable, clean product that is packaged well and arrives quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the way this butter makes my face and hair feel.</li>
    <li> Love this butter! I made a homemade whipped hair butter with it!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, A++</li>
    <li> My kid has horrible eczema stemming from allergies, and my mom suggested this. While it has not preformed a miracle and eliminated his eczema, it does moisturize his skin better than the store bought stuff. Mainly because all of that has fragrance and that just makes him itchier.&lt;br /&gt;Slathering this on after a bath, applying it liberally throughout the day, it helps. He&#x27;s definitely less itchy after applying.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works in my 4C hair. I section my hair right after I wash it and use a generous amount of the butter in each section while my hair is still wet/damp. I found that this is the only product I need in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t just sit on my hair, but penetrates throughout and leaves my hair very moisturized and feeling soft. I twist my hair with the butter, and do a twist-out after a few days and my hair and scalp is still moist and not at all dry. ALL the other products I&#x27;ve used in the past sit on my hair and ends up drying out my hair and scalp after a day. The butter is kinda thick, but melts pretty quickly when you rub it between your palms.  No need to use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this avocado butter. It really seals in moisture quite nicely and the texture is soft, easy to apply to hair and skin.</li>
    <li> This has been a great remedy for my winter skin.</li>
    <li> I made my own soft hair cream,  love the results!</li>
    <li> A label is needed to truly determine if this is in fact 100% avocado butter and not just petroleum mixed with a drop of avocado oil. Avocado oil is supposed to be greenish yellow NOT creamish white.</li>
    <li> I use this to make lotion and to pop popcorn, works great!</li>
    <li> Amazing do u have any coupons? This butter I use in everything. From my lip balms to my lotions :) anything I put this butter in make it very smooth :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase it arrived on time. The seller has more products to choose from. I bought this for me but I gave it to my daughter. This is very good for the skin as a moisturizer. Great quality!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It really defines my coils.  The butter has a smooth and &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; feel, is medium weight, non greasy.  This is a must have in my regimen.</li>
    <li> Very nice but gritty when you put on at first</li>
    <li> This stuff made my sons skin soooooo soft after his bath. He has a lot of food allergies so I cant used just anything on him.</li>
    <li> Good quality product...</li>
    <li> No complaints here! just perfect</li>
    <li> I have not used avocado butter before but this came in the mail in good time and seems to be a high quality product.  I made a small batch of homemade body butter with it and am excited to start trying it out.</li>
    <li> I am a HUUUGGEE fan. I have been using this for a year and what a difference in my skin and hair. My hair has grown, my skin is smoother than its ever been. Worth Every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure my hair likes it...it made my hair feel frizzy. I&#x27;m not sure why but I&#x27;ll try it again maybe it&#x27;s something else.</li>
    <li> My hair loves, loves, this stuff!!  I&#x27;ve purchased at least 3 - 3lb tubs by now already!  It&#x27;s a staple in my product line up for sure!</li>
    <li> Honestly I was hoping this would help with my eczema but I think it just made it worse.  It felt like it wasn&#x27;t getting absorbed and just sat on top of my skin.  After about a month of use, my hands were more cracked and painful then ever.  It also transferred onto everything I touched.  If you plan to use this by itself as a skin cream, make sure that you&#x27;re going to sit very still for a while.</li>
    <li> I found this to be good quality avocado butter. It is nourishing and creamy and works wonderfully in my lotions.</li>
    <li> love the avocado butter and its packaging</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it yet.  I try to use natural oils for my hair.  I have 3b curls.  It&#x27;s ok but not great.  It gives a bit of moisture, but it made me break out.  Also, it feels really gritty, not sure why.  I suppose I was expecting it to feel smooth.  Jojoba oil and sesame oil are much better for my hair.  On the other hand, this product was better mixing with Amlactin as a lotion.</li>
    <li> I like use my hair natural</li>
    <li> Too grainy. Don&#x27;t care for this product at all.</li>
