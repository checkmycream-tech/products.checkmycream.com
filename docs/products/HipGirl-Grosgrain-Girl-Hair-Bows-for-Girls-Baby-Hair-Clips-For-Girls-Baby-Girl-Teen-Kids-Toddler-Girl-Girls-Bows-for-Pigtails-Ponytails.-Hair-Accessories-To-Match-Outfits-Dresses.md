      <li>Came in a cute little box.</li>
      <li>It says colors may vary from picture but they were not too far off.</li>

<li> We got light pink, lavender and white large bows, and dark pink, black, purple and baby blue solid small bows.</li>
<li> These sit flat on my daughters head.</li>
<li> My 10 yr old wears bows everyday</li>
<li> I knew when I bought them that they were alligator clip bows; however, I wish they were french barrette bows because that way they don&#x27;t fall out of active kids&#x27; hair.  </li>
<li> The assortment was different than pictured, which I expected based on reviews of other products.</li>
<li> The rest were prints: Glam skulls, farm animals, horses, tutus and flowers, red with polka dots, green with pink and white flowers,zebra stripes with pink hearts and halloween.</li>
<li> Just received a different zebra with pink bow where there was black in the picture.</li>
<li> feminine designs - not just pink and purple.</li>
<li> (farm animals are a little babyish)</li>
<li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>

    <li> Cutest hair bows! I was nervous about what colors would be in this bundle, worried they wouldn&#x27;t match. But whoever assembled it took time making sure each pinwheel bow looked great on at least two of the bigger base bows. My daughter is nine and loves them. They are sized just right and not overwhelming on the head. Great quality and perfectly shaped. Just ordered different bows from HipGirl, I couldn&#x27;t resist after getting these!</li>
    <li> Super cute, cute gift box! The assortment was different than pictured, which I expected based on reviews of other products. The clips are only lined on the top part of the clip, so the bottom part is smooth metal and can slide under hair without snagging it.

The rest were prints: Glam skulls, farm animals, horses, tutus and flowers, red with polka dots, green with pink and white flowers,zebra stripes with pink hearts and halloween. (It is September, so it works!) They seem to be well made and the colors are cute. My four year old loves it. My 7 year old will like most of them (farm animals are a little babyish)</li>

    <li> I love these bows. They are so bright and perfect size. I use them on my 3 month old baby as well as my 6 year old daughter. They look great in pictures.</li>
    <li> Great  price for good quality bows! Arrived on time and will slip onto any headband because of their alligator clip!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love these bows!  Such a great price, and they match almost everything that she owns!!  Will be buying from this vendor again!  Got here quickly, and product exactly as ordered.  They are very well made, and they stay in my 3 year olds hair really well.  She loves getting to pick out her bows!  I bought a matching set, and they are just too cute on her pigtails!  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This cute hair bow clip are beautiful. I love them.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to candy for birthday giveaway. All the girls (7&amp;8 year olds )  loved them. Don&#x27;t have to worry about allergies or dietary restrictions.</li>
    <li> Super cute and well made.  Daughter loves these bows.  Colorful and unique feminine designs - not just pink and purple.</li>
    <li> delivery was fast and bows are not cheaply made. recomend to anyone for you daughter. Bows were a little bit smaller than I would have thought but, great deal.</li>
    <li> These bows are so adorable and cute</li>
    <li> Bought these for my 1 1/2 year old daughter.  They are very sweet!  Seem to be well made.  They stay in her hair. A perfect little bow for any little girl.  Nice colors too.</li>
    <li> My daughter turned 3 and we did a Minnie&#x27;s Bowtique party....these were actually part of the decorations!!! My daughter of course loved the bows....now she&#x27;s MINNIE!! lol!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful bows. My girls love them. They are varied enough that they work for any outfit. I haven&#x27;t tried making them interchangeable yet, mostly because my girls are still pretty young and it i think that with both bows it might be too much. But I look forward to doing it when the are a little older. I have bought from this seller before and I like them.</li>
    <li> All very small bows but good quality</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my 4 year daughter who likes to fix her own hair. These bows are colorful and easy to open/close. She loves to put them on and match them to her outfit. We recently gave a set to a friend&#x27;s daughter who just turned 6 and they were a hit with her, too.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift to my nieces and loved these bows.  They liked how they could change them out with all the different kinds of options.  I personally would of have liked if they had a set of two for two pig tails but quality and variety was there.</li>
    <li> I loved these bows. They came in a nice gift box, are very cute and seem to be well made. I&#x27;m going to order more so that I have two of each design.</li>
    <li> These sit flat on my daughters head. I have the 2.5&amp;#34; HipGirl bows as well, they are more upright like what I think a bow should be like. I use them all the time. These lie down more, like a decorative barrette than a bow.</li>
    <li> My 10 yr old wears bows everyday so I decided to get her these to put in her Easter basket. When she opened the box, she ran to the bathroom with it and kept screaming out of happiness. The bows are adorable and colorful and she is really enjoying all of them.</li>
    <li> These bows are small, but the assortment is great!!!  Also you can stack the smaller bows on top of the bigger bows.  They are also easy to put in a girls hair.  They came packaged in a box so that made giving them as a gift easier.</li>
    <li> Super cute, good quality bows.  Perfect size for 2-5 yr olds.  Just wish you could pick which colors.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on my daughter&#x27;s hair when she is wearing these bows.  They have fabric covered smooth alligator clips to hold them in place.  They are super cute and I would definitely order them again.</li>
    <li> The fabric is high-quality, and the colors are wonderful!  The box in which the bows are packed is pleasing, too.</li>
