      <li>Cheap and smells clean and fresh</li>
      <li>I absolutely didn&#x27;t get why so many people gave 5* reviews, that&#x27;s why I decided to order it</li>

<li> i will probably order the other adidas scents in the near future</li>
<li> i am very picky about scents because they usually give me a headache instantly</li>
<li> It might as well be a .5 ounce of regular long lasting perfume.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t last long either.</li>
<li> However, it doesn&#x27;t linger long on the skin.  </li>
<li> it lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> This is a present for an active niece who runs races, so the sports theme attracted to me to this perfume.  </li>
<li> I use it as my everyday perfume and use my expensive brand only for special occasions.  </li>
<li> So, I would have to keep it in my purse and keep spraying every few hours to even smell any scent when I press my nose against where I last sprayed the perfume on my clothes.</li>
<li> The initial spray-on is sharp (sort of smells like hamster bedding), but the dry-down is green.</li>
<li> Not a real strong scent.  </li>
<li> Would recommend for any other lovers of flowery perfume!</li>
<li> /&gt;i was looking for a little lighter floral..</li>
<li> I used it as an everyday perfume.</li>
<li> I found that it can be over powering if applied too heavily.  </li>
<li> But the 1.7 ounce is diluted and therefore it is not strong.  </li>
<li> My sister is a floral fanatic</li>
<li> Not a good scent.</li>
<li> sorry adidas.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not a good scent. Didn&#x27;t last long either.</li>
    <li> I always get many compliments when I wear this fragrance! Its in fact my favorite Addidas fragrance. This and the Fruity Rythm fragrance are the best! If you love floral and feminine fragrances give this a try. If you lean toward fruity/floral try Fruity Rythm.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is a powdery floral and is quite nice, but doesn&#x27;t last very long for an EDT; it&#x27;s more of a weak cologne.</li>
    <li> I love floral fragrances, this is really awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was too good and bottle is beautiful. :)&lt;br /&gt;good and reasonable purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my wife and she likes it. It is very good for the price. This was the second time i bought the same deodorant.</li>
    <li> Cheap and smells clean and fresh</li>
    <li> Pros: It smells good, kind of a floral base mix with fruits and air freshener. So it smells &#x27;clean&#x27;.  Cons: It lasts 2 maybe 3 hours at best for me. So, I would have to keep it in my purse and keep spraying every few hours to even smell any scent when I press my nose against where I last sprayed the perfume on my clothes. So, you WILL go through the bottle fairly quickly. It might as well be a .5 ounce of regular long lasting perfume. But the 1.7 ounce is diluted and therefore it is not strong.

    <li> Excelente, los recomiendo.</li>

    <li> I love the smell. I used it as an everyday perfume. The price was low but the perfume wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
    <li> Its floral, but just not my type. i didn&#x27;t like it. it was a bit too strong for me, and i was waiting for it to go away. but it goes away quickly, and in this case, i found it convenient.&lt;br /&gt;i was looking for a little lighter floral.. may be its all in my head . sorry adidas. didnt like it .&lt;br /&gt;may be some people like it, so i will consider gifting it.</li>
    <li> This item has a very nice smell. It smells clean and powdery. I got compliments on the first day of wearing it. I would recommend this product for day or evening wear.</li>
    <li> I love this scent it is not over powering, doesn&#x27;t fad, and doesn&#x27;t get that sour smell that they sometimes get after you have worn it a while.</li>
    <li> I absolutely didn&#x27;t get why so many people gave 5* reviews, that&#x27;s why I decided to order it , in my opinion the smell is very cheap.</li>
    <li> The bottle that I received from Amazon is very different from the one pictured above.  However I bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter and she loved it.</li>

    <li> muy buen perfume lo recomiedo , vale la pena , es suave y no fuerte. exelente. 100% . muy bueno.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive cologne that only smells so-so. It&#x27;s okay for such a cheap perfume. The initial spray-on is sharp (sort of smells like hamster bedding), but the dry-down is green. The fragrance comes across as masculine to me -- it smells more like a men&#x27;s cologne. I may use it as a room freshener ... maybe.</li>
    <li> Yes its worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not a real strong scent.  I like the Adidas Moves Pulse much better</li>
    <li> This is a very pleasant, fresh scent.  However, it doesn&#x27;t linger long on the skin.  I use it as my everyday perfume and use my expensive brand only for special occasions.  This has been my go-to Add-On Item.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is called &amp;#34;Floral Dream&amp;#34; for a reason --- It literally smells like you&#x27;re walking through a garden! It smells very nice, however, it is just not the right smell for me. My sister is a floral fanatic so I decided to give this to her and she LOVES it. Would recommend for any other lovers of flowery perfume!</li>
    <li> the item is very good. It smells comfortable. And the shape of the bottle is nice. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> My wife like it and I do also. it ok for the price but I though the volume more than what I expected. Anyway not bad staff for home use.</li>
    <li> I really like the fresh scent of Adidas Floral Dream.  I found that it can be over powering if applied too heavily.  So I use just a brief spray and the it lasts a long time.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this cologne.</li>
    <li> I would recommend you try it on before ordering it.  It smells good on certain bodies. As most perfumes are also, your body may not mix well with this perfume.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the quality of my purchase,thank you. Smells fresh not too citrus like or flowery kind of balanced</li>
    <li> I received this on time, and it included several free gifts and coupons!</li>
    <li> Shipping wad fast but not my taste in smell..</li>
    <li> Light and airy scent, its subtle and long lasting....I spray once a day....I would purchase and give as a present</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very mild yet has a great scent. It has the aroma of field flowers. I really do like it. I am buying it for all the ladies in my life.</li>
    <li> this is a really good scent for the price. the scent is not overpowering and that is a really big plus for me. i am very picky about scents because they usually give me a headache instantly and this one does not. shipping was solid and fast with no problems. i will probably order the other adidas scents in the near future</li>
    <li> The perfume smelled very good, not overpowering. It was a big bottle for a great price. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it; it smells so good and fresh. The only thing is that you have to put some on every three hours.</li>
