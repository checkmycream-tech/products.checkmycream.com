      <li>So, no it is not a bad batch!</li>
      <li>I first bought the First Remi from Boss and I was fairly happy with it for the price.</li>
      <li>It has now frizz and easy to style.</li>
      <li>When my stylist first styled my hair, I was loving this hair.</li>
      <li>This is hands down some of the best BSS hair you can get.</li>
      <li>I have had weaves in for 2 weeks that do not look as good as this 4 month old weave!</li>
      <li>This is some great hair, especially given the price.</li>
      <li>I reccommend washing and conditioning with sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
      <li>I use Soft Sheen Carson- optimum Oil Therapy ( 3-n-1 Creme Oil moisturizer).</li>
      <li>I bought so many products for this hair just for it to act right.</li>
      <li>The hair came in in its original package ( I have been wearing Bobbi Boss for a while, so I know</li>
      <li>Invest it in something that is actually worth it, like brazilian!</li>
      <li>It matches the quality of my own hair more after the second wash</li>
      <li>Pink Sponge rollers give great curls on this hair w/ no product</li>
      <li>The hair was nice and natural in the beginning-</li>
      <li>Nice luster, soft bouncy,</li>
      <li>i have a full sew in with this hair in 16 inches</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a full weave, I am wearing it with (3) sewed in tracks blended in to my hair.</li>
      <li>I loved this hair all the way up until the third week.</li>
      <li>I spent more money buying outre velvet Remy and it is a better product and softer hair!</li>
      <li>The seller sent the hair quickly.</li>
      <li>It also gets frizzy quickly.</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal customer of the indi remi line for 5 years.</li>
      <li>My own natural 4a-4b hair does not tangle as much as this weave!  </li>
      <li>This line is no more good!</li>
      <li>My favorite is the natural yaky.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I will admit, the frizz does give the hair a more natural look</li>
      <li>Rare tangles.</li>
      <li>So this is like a lil breath of fresh air.</li>
      <li>top notch best boy was they wrong!</li>
      <li>Right now, I am dealing with a problem with fizz.</li>
      <li>It did blend perfectly with my hair color but after washing it, the hair became knotty, dry, rough, and very synthetic like.</li>
      <li>I am fortunate to have a professional, salon-based stylist who washes, conditions and styles my hair on a weekly basis</li>
      <li>After initial install I can tell you it does look better after the first wash.</li>
      <li>I can tell you that this hair is the best you can get, you can buy better hair from a vendor online but in a pinch you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this hair.</li>
      <li>Let me first start out by saying, I am on week 2 of Bobby Boss, Indi Remi hair.</li>
      <li>I love this hair and find myself only looking for Bobbi Boss!</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about 4 months, so the high price is worth it.</li>
      <li>If it were not for the more than $300.00 I paid for this hair and installation, I would have trashed this hair a long time ago.</li>
      <li>The only con I have about this hair is that it looks better after the first wash (what is the point of washing a new weave?)</li>
      <li>I have had a good long use of this hair so I will be using this hair again in the future..</li>
      <li>seller is also very reliable.</li>
      <li>I washed it and it went absolutely downhill from there.</li>
      <li>I bought unprocessed hair thinking it would be better.</li>
      <li>but I miss the bone straight</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use much oils in my hair and i wrap my hair every night.</li>
      <li>to say that I have cometo agree with the more recent reviews, this hair is nowhere near the quality it used to be.</li>
      <li>For my most recent install, I decided to switch it up and try Bobbi Boss Indi Remi Natural Yaki in 12&amp;#34; and 14&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m offering up a few simple tips to keep this hair looking good throughout your install.</li>
      <li>The methods above still help but its probably better to get different hair or invest in silicon spray.</li>
      <li>I have used Bobbi Boss Indi Remi yaky for the last 3+ years and have really enjoyed the hair&#x27;s manageabilty and the fact that it matches my hair texture after the 2nd wash.</li>
      <li>I can not get my money back but will warn as many as possible.  </li>
      <li>I have had this hair as a sew-in for a little more than a month.</li>
      <li>This line is dead now and I recommend just going into a store to make sure</li>
      <li>It only looked cute for 2 days then got dry and brittle looking, I washed and conditioned it</li>
      <li>The hair still blends well with my hair but the right side of my hair is starting to tangle.</li>
      <li>Any other questions, please feel free to comment here</li>
      <li>Two weeks ago I bought their new type of hair, Pacific Ocean wave.</li>
      <li>My licensed long-term stylist installed this hair for a trip to New York.</li>
      <li>Very natural appearing.</li>
      <li>This hair rarely tangles, and as long as you tie it up with a silk scarf it dosnt shed either.</li>
      <li>Overall I would wear this hair again for a quick style only.</li>
      <li>Today, i went into the store this time to find another brand that is just as good as the indi remi used to be and the store owner told me that Bobbi Boss now has a new manufacture and that is why the quality has gone down within the past 2 years or so.</li>
      <li>it was so soft and silky.</li>
      <li>In the last 6 months, however, I have noticed a steep decline in the quality of the hair: the hair frizzes up and tangles after about 3 washes, it has become very unmanageable.</li>
      <li>So do not waste anymore of your money and time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still soft and silky.</li>
      <li>so it looks natural.</li>
      <li>However, when I called Midway, I learned that they don&#x27;t sell their hair directly to customers, they sell in bulks to distributors.</li>
      <li>In addition, the price has gone up too, which I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much if the quality was still the same.</li>
      <li>the real deal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely wear this hair again.</li>
      <li>, I know when it&#x27;s time to remove the extension because it&#x27;s starting to tangle more &amp; frizz up, usually 3-4 months after placement of the extension.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I order this hair all the time this batch shedded so bad I had to take it out and throw it away after the first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use.</li>
    <li> This is some great hair, especially given the price. This hair rarely tangles, and as long as you tie it up with a silk scarf it dosnt shed either. This is hands down some of the best BSS hair you can get.</li>
    <li> I have used Bobbi Boss Indi Remi yaky for the last 3+ years and have really enjoyed the hair&#x27;s manageabilty and the fact that it matches my hair texture after the 2nd wash. Over the years, I have mastered the product i.e. I know what shampoo, conditioner, temperature setting to use and most importantly, I know when it&#x27;s time to remove the extension because it&#x27;s starting to tangle more &amp; frizz up, usually 3-4 months after placement of the extension. In the last 6 months, however, I have noticed a steep decline in the quality of the hair: the hair frizzes up and tangles after about 3 washes, it has become very unmanageable. My sister has also used this brand for over 4 years and she noted the same complaints. In addition, the price has gone up too, which I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much if the quality was still the same. At this time, I am looking for another brand that will be comparable to the previous Bobbi Boss because I am fed up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bobbi Boss for almost a year. My favorite is the natural yaky. For the price, I&#x27;m more than pleased with the quality, ease of use and care. Some shedding but nothing inordinate. Rare tangles. Very natural appearing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair for at least 2 years and have always given it rave reviews!  I bought new hair in January 2012 and its very different from anything I&#x27;ve received in the past.  My hair is currently a frizzy mess and the texture reminds me of Barbie doll hair.  I would no longer recommend this hair to anyone.  Does anyone know a comparable brand?</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair for my graduation back in May. I had it installed around May 17, 2011 and I still have it in! I have had weaves in for 2 weeks that do not look as good as this 4 month old weave! It is beautiful and has a very natural look. No one believes that it is a not my hair! The only con I have about this hair is that it looks better after the first wash (what is the point of washing a new weave?) The only shedding I&#x27;ve noticed is when I wash the hair and it is very minimal. I also wash my hair about once a week. I use the Motions Neutralizing Shampoo and condition with Motions Detangler Conditioner. I have no regrets with this investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every BSS* hair you can buy, I&#x27;ve worn the plastic mess, \\&quot;human hair\\&quot; and had cat fight on the back of my neck. I can tell you that this hair is the best you can get, you can buy better hair from a vendor online but in a pinch you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this hair. It does tangle a little bit but not enough to keep a brush everywhere you go, and the shedding is pretty minimal for the price- you can always seal the weft before install of course. After initial install I can tell you it does look better after the first wash. I&#x27;m offering up a few simple tips to keep this hair looking good throughout your install. Trust me, all the methods work, I have done the legwork.&lt;br /&gt;1. I reccommend washing and conditioning with sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner (L&#x27;oreal is good)), or if you can&#x27;t find that, Suave Humectant shampoo is good. Follow up with a mostrurizing conditioner. If you have dandruff, dilute dandruff shamepoo in spray bottle and spray your braids and scalp underneath only.&lt;br /&gt;2. This hair get&#x27;s fried after tons of heat use, so I reccommend letting the hair air dry or sitting under a dryer, minimize heated style tool usage. Pink Sponge rollers give great curls on this hair w/ no product needed.&lt;br /&gt;3. Should you fry this hair and becomes stiff and puffy, wash with Suave Clarifying shampoo, follow with a Deep Condition of Suave Humectress for about 15-20 minutes, rinse with coldest water you can tolerate, then follow with 1/3 cup of apple cider vinegar and 2 cups cold water, let sit on the hair for about 5 minutes, then give final rinse with cool water. Use 1 nickel/dime size amount of BioMatrix Smoothing Serum after drying and style.&lt;br /&gt;4. Always, ALWAYS wrap this hair or put a satin bonnet on at night, I promise you will pro-long the life of this hair to the point it will last through a second install.  Any other questions, please feel free to comment here and I will gladly answer!&lt;br /&gt;BSS&#x3D; Beauty Supply Store&lt;br /&gt;04/09/2013 I&#x27;msorry to say that I have cometo agree with the more recent reviews, this hair is nowhere near the quality it used to be. The methods above still help but its probably better to get different hair or invest in silicon spray.</li>
    <li> This is the worse hair I have ever purchased.  I have the ocean wave.  Out of the pack the hair is gorgeous.  Nice luster, soft bouncy, no shedding etc.  2 weeks later, no shine whatsoever, shedding is excessive to the point where Im leaving a trail of hair wherever I go and the hair tagles and matts horribly.  My own natural 4a-4b hair does not tangle as much as this weave!  The hair is not virgin.  The hair is not even remy.  Remy hair means that the strands are aligned going in one direction which is done to reduce tangling.  Also this hair is coated with silicone which is why after 3 washes, my hair is very dull.  Never again.  $200.00 down the drain.  I am never purchasing beauty supply store hair again!  Bobbi Boss has some nerve calling this hair virgin remy!</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal customer of the indi remi line for 5 years. Recently, i purchased this hair in color 613 and it was horrible!!! A big shedding mess plus tangling non stop!!! This line is no more good! Today, i went into the store this time to find another brand that is just as good as the indi remi used to be and the store owner told me that Bobbi Boss now has a new manufacture and that is why the quality has gone down within the past 2 years or so. So, no it is not a bad batch! It is just the way the hair is being made now. So do not waste anymore of your money and time. This line is dead now and I recommend just going into a store to make sure you know what you are getting.</li>
    <li> I hate this hair. I have it installed as we speak. I have had this hair as a sew-in for a little more than a month. I must tell you this hair has all hype yet it does not live up to its name. Three pros: thin weft, looks natural, and bounces back temporarily after washing. Cons: sheds like a dog with the mange, tangles horribly, must be brushed every few hours, and Midway(manufacturing company) has terrible customer service. The problem began after two weeks of installation. My licensed long-term stylist installed this hair for a trip to New York. She did not cut the weft in half, in fact she did not cut it much at all. I noticed dryness, brittleness, and tons of shedding about two weeks after installation. I called the beauty supply store where I purchased it and they told me if I can get the approval from Midway that they would take the hair back they would gladly exchange. However, when I called Midway, I learned that they don&#x27;t sell their hair directly to customers, they sell in bulks to distributors. The distributor for my area (Atlanta, Ga) wanted me to take the hair out, wait two weeks for the company to test the hair, and then if the found that the hair was defective they would exchange. I was not in a position to take this option as I paid $125.00 to have this hair installed not to mention more than $200.00 for the hair. Besides what was I supposed to do with my hair for the two weeks???? If it were not for the more than $300.00 I paid for this hair and installation, I would have trashed this hair a long time ago. As I mentioned in the cons washing the hair makes it bounce back to look natural for about a day max. I do not put any products on this hair, I have three of the best flat irons, and I wrap it under a silk bonnet nightly. This hair is definitely a WASTE of money. I will be using Goddess from now on as I have always in the past. There are defiantly cheaper more efficient brands of hair on the market then this over priced disappointment. I will be uninstalling at the end of this month just so I can feel like I did completely waste my money.  Please ladies don&#x27;t fall for the hype of this hair and price does not always mean quality.</li>
    <li> This hair I had for a month used in a quickweave. I loved this hair all the way up until the third week. It started to tangle yet it maintained its sleek look which was okay for what I wore it for. I would not recommend this hair for a sew in unless you plan on washing it because once you wash it the hair does go back to similarly the way it came in packaging. Overall I would wear this hair again for a quick style only. It has alot of body for weeks but the tanglesare not tterrible but I am someone who doesn&#x27;t like tangling. This hair did not shed in the quickweave so I did appreciate that. The seller sent the hair quickly. I was very impressed with that part of the process.</li>
    <li> I love this hair! It has now frizz and easy to style. I would recommend this hair for any type of hair style...</li>
    <li> I have washed and taken this hair out at least 3 times and put it back in. I have been using it for about 4 months, so the high price is worth it. I have had a good long use of this hair so I will be using this hair again in the future.. There are weave that cost way more. So this is like a lil breath of fresh air.</li>
    <li> I love this hair and find myself only looking for Bobbi Boss! the price was the best part of it all!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair and the quality of it is declining; within a week of having it professionally installed, it began to shed and tangle horribly. I contacted Bobbi Boss through email about the hair and they basically gave me the run around on receiving an exchange. When I called the manger of sales out on it, he basically didn&#x27;t care. DO NOT purchase this hair!!!!! Invest it in something that is actually worth it, like brazilian!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT SEVERAL TIMES AND WITH THIS PACK IT HAS BEEN HARD TO COMB THROUGH THE HAIR THE HAIR SHEDS AND AS LONG AS I&#x27;VE BEEN BUYING IT IT HAS NEVER SHED WHEN BROUGHT FROM OTHER PLACES</li>
    <li> Divas, please, PUH-LEASE reconsider purchasing this hair! For my most recent install, I decided to switch it up and try Bobbi Boss Indi Remi Natural Yaki in 12&amp;#34; and 14&amp;#34;.  I have had this hair for approximately 3 weeks and it has been 2 1/2 weeks of PURE HELL.  The constant combing to detangle because of the knotting and matting up like a rats&#x27; nest teamed with the crazy shedding is a serious headache and beyond frustrating. I am fortunate to have a professional, salon-based stylist who washes, conditions and styles my hair on a weekly basis so trust me, it is not what I am doing nor due to any of the products being used on the hair.  My stylist only uses the best, most moisturizing, sulfate and paraben free products.  It&#x27;s a shame this hair and hair company compromised the quality of the hair because we as customers are suffering not only in our pockets (the hair IS NOT cheap!) but in how we appear to our friends, family, colleagues and employees because of this terrible product.  I will NEVER, EVER buy any Bobbi Boss products again.  I can not get my money back but will warn as many as possible.  Divas, please save your hard earned money - do not buy this hair!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair at my local beauty supply store. I love this hair and I&#x27;ve purchased this hair three times. It matches the quality of my own hair more after the second wash so it looks natural. Very minimal shedding and it tangles a little but brushes right out.  In response to the negative reviews I haven&#x27;t had a bad experience and I&#x27;ve had this hair in my head presently for over a month.</li>
    <li> I currently have Bobbi Boss hair in. And it&#x27;s not worth it trust me. My beautician is the weave queen herself and uses the best products and it still turns out like blah. It sheds the way a cat would. It tangles really bad. It also gets frizzy quickly. I bought so many products for this hair just for it to act right. I bought detangling and frizz control shampoo. I tried mousse. I tried washing it with conditioner every 4 days. I washed it and let the conditioner set a couple of times. I tried everything. Nothing worked. It&#x27;s frizzy. It sheds. It tangles. It&#x27;s not worth your money. I bought unprocessed hair thinking it would be better. NOPE! In the package it looks gorgeous and like it&#x27;s the real deal. It&#x27;s a lie. And anyone who tells you it&#x27;s good is lying. Trust me. I know from experience. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fancy packaging and good reviews. It sucks! I wish I could give this hair ZERO stars. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Love it outstanding ! 5 stars !!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t do it. Don&#x27;t waste ur hard earned money on this mess!  It tangles like crazy and sheds even more. I know how to take care of weaves hair and there is nothing you can do to fix this crap. Heed all the previous reviews. It looks great for about 5days, then it&#x27;s over!  Stay away from this hair and save your money. After using for 2 yrs its time to move on.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this hair for about a month now. It&#x27;s so beautiful. It&#x27;s still soft and silky. It doesn&#x27;t shed a lot. I add a little hair moisturizer to add some shine because of the extreme cold weather. I use Soft Sheen Carson- optimum Oil Therapy ( 3-n-1 Creme Oil moisturizer). The moisturizer leaves no greasy build-up and the hair looks beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;This seller is also very reliable. I received the hair within a week. The hair came in in its original package ( I have been wearing Bobbi Boss for a while, so I know the real deal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely wear this hair again. And of course I will use the same seller again 😀</li>
    <li> Please believe all the horrible reviews for Bobbie Boss Indiremy. I have purchased the yaki Remy straight hair 2 times and all were horrible. I thought maybe buying them from online and not at my local beauty supply store was my problem. It is indeed nothing but the hype and truly over rated! The yaki was very tangly, sheds uncontrollable, must be combed with a wig brush every half hour. It did blend perfectly with my hair color but after washing it, the hair became knotty, dry, rough, and very synthetic like. I spent over $80.00 for this hair. Two weeks ago I bought their new type of hair, Pacific Ocean wave. OMG!! what a horrible experience! after a week of having it in my hair again it became tangly, hard to bush, and started to loose its wave.I thought it was permanently wavy. After I washed it and after putting a bad product on it, the waves disappeared and became dry brittle, plastic like. I spent over %90.00 for this hair and it became a tangled mess when my hair stylist tried to wash it. I spent more money buying outre velvet Remy and it is a better product and softer hair! Please do not buy any of BObbie Boss products!</li>
    <li> Let me first start out by saying, I am on week 2 of Bobby Boss, Indi Remi hair. I don&#x27;t have a full weave, I am wearing it with (3) sewed in tracks blended in to my hair. When my stylist first styled my hair, I was loving this hair. It never tangled. I had just got a relaxer and the hair blended well with my hair. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with shedding which really irks me with other hair brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to present (2 weeks later). I just washed my hair the other day. The hair still blends well with my hair but the right side of my hair is starting to tangle. I don&#x27;t use much oils in my hair and i wrap my hair every night. I treat this hair much better than I treat my own. I still don&#x27;t have any problems with shedding which I am grateful for. Right now, I am dealing with a problem with fizz. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with some of the cheaper brands I brought in the past. I tried a frizz serium and it helped a little. I will admit, the frizz does give the hair a more natural look but I miss the bone straight shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure that I would recommend this hair again nor would I buy it again. I&#x27;ll see if it gets better over time...</li>
    <li> This hair is seriously THE WORST! The two, three weeks the hair is beautiful , sleek , gorgeous, I get compliments from everyone . After two three weeks pass the hair start shedding like crazy ! OMG . All that shedding makes the hair lose it&#x27;s body. I seriously wasted my money I spent almost $300 on this hair , I had the 18,16,and 14 inches , now after 3 weeks or maybe less I&#x27;m thinking of doing my hair over , well I have to cause I can&#x27;t have my hair looking like crap! Your hair is your beauty . After spending all that money I thought this hair would last me around 6-8 months. Money wasted and very pissed . SO PLEASE PLEASE LADIES, DO NOT! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR. Your going to regret it!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing a weave for almost a year so I am still a virgin and exploring different types. I first bought the First Remi from Boss and I was fairly happy with it for the price. My only concern was that I wasn&#x27;t able to use it more than one install and it tended to tangle a little and was a little hard to curl. I was persuaded to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the Indi Remi and it was the worse decision I&#x27;ve made so far. The hair was nice and natural in the beginning- that only lasted about 2 weeks. I washed it and it went absolutely downhill from there. The hair is extremely tangled to the point where i can not run my fingers through it, it literally is a birds nest. I&#x27;ve washed it a few more times, tried to flat iron it, blow dry it and nothing helps...it will look good for about an hour and then tangle up. I&#x27;m so disgusted with this product, especially for the price. I&#x27;ve only had it in 5 weeks and I&#x27;m about to get it taken out, I&#x27;ve had to wear it in a pony tail this entire time because leaving it down makes me look like I stuck my hand in a socket. I may have just gotten a bad batch of hair but I am extremely disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> This hair really SUCKS! I was told by the beauty supply store it was one of there top notch best boy was they wrong! It only looked cute for 2 days then got dry and brittle looking, I washed and conditioned it and now it puts me in the mind of baby doll hair!  I&#x27;m pissed I&#x27;ve only had it sewed in one week what a waste of 400$ for the hair and sew in! I do not recommend any one buy this hair! Never again for me</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the declining quality comments. I too had used Bobbi Boss Indi Remi for basically my entire college career (4 years) and after not having bought any in about a year I purchased the exact same Ocean Wave hair I always had a few months ago and barely could get 2 months of use out of it without tangles and matting after having used my previous ones for 6 months minimum. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what they are doing to their hair, I swore by this hair but it&#x27;s not a big deal to go find Virgin Brazilian hair for the same price that lasts much longer. I just don&#x27;t know why Bobbi Boss would want to lose valuable customers like that, oh well.</li>
    <li> this is by far THE worst bss hair ever. i have a full sew in with this hair in 16 inches and when i get had it installed it was so soft and silky. but after about 3 weeks it began to shed like a dog. the hair would just shed for no reason at all. for instance i would simply run my fingers through the hair and 4 strands would come out and it would tangle ALL the time. i dont understand why this could have happened: i wrapped it in a silk scarf at night, every night, washed and conditioned it properly, and i never put any heavy/oily products in it. and this hair is wayyyyy over priced. they claim that its \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair but it isnt at all. i am going to stick to velvet VIRGIN remi hair from the bss.</li>
