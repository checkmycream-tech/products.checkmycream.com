      <li>This product works great on my natural curly hair -</li>

      <li>It smells great, and leaves your hair shiny while bringing out your beautiful blonde highlights (natural or not).</li>

      <li>This product has a light, clean smell, not too strong.</li>

      <li>This order arrived so quickly, I thought I would be waiting for a couple weeks,  </li>
      <li>some are very cheesey and others are too strong.  </li>
      <li>It detangles your hair easily and really adds shine to it.</li>
      <li>I am letting my hair go silver, so I bought this due to a reviewer that said it was good for that.</li>
      <li>John Frieda Sheer Blonde Spot-Light Sleek &amp; Shine is a great hair product.  </li>
      <li>Great price for John Frieda Sheer Blonde Spotlight Sleek &amp; Shine Detangler 2.4 oz of $4.99 howevever shipping is $4.99.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for taming fly-aways, and just a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product  that is now hard to find.</li>
      <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this was a huge mistake.</li>
      <li>This has always been my favorite hair product - as a bleached blonde, it gives my hair softness, managability &amp; shine</li>
      <li>Pretty damaged.</li>
      <li>This comes close at first glance but doesn&#x27;t quite work the same magic.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product which I am now unable to buy in Australia so Amazon has come to my rescue once again.</li>
      <li>I apply it only on the lower 1/2 of my hair, and apply it to the top where the damage shows.  </li>
      <li>But I think the product alone (on top of flat ironing, of course) dries out</li>
      <li>All in all, my hair ends up appearing as if it&#x27;s full of healthy moisture without looking greasy or weighed down.  </li>
      <li>By the time I blow it dry and use a curling iron/flat iron, my hair miraculously looks healthy.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair very shiny and detangles my fine, blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I, too, have used this product for several years and was quite upset that it was no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t believe it was superior to other glosses on the market, there is no way I&#x27;d pay such an exorbitant price for it.</li>
      <li>It makes hair easy to comb after washing and when dry your hair really shines.  </li>
      <li>This product seems to protect her hair from dryness and split ends better than any other she has tried.</li>
      <li>It would also be nice if it came in a bigger container (I have long hair)</li>
      <li>May still break down and order one :-)</li>
      <li>BEtter to start with too little than too much.  </li>
      <li>I even contacted the main company to try to find it.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>The reason the price is sooo high is that this product is no longer being manufactured.</li>
      <li>It is a better product than any of the very expensive smoothing serums I&#x27;ve tried, and I don&#x27;t know WHAT I&#x27;m going to do when I can&#x27;t find it any more!    </li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair, but this doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp or greasy, just tames the fly aways and adds shine.  </li>
      <li>Great product, don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued, wish it was not so expensive.</li>
      <li>I buy most everything online for my wife and a big percentage is from Amazon.com, especially John Frieda Sheer Blonde Spotlight Sleek &amp; Shine Detangler because all the stores where we live no longer carry this product.</li>
      <li>And it makes them soft, not wiry.  </li>
      <li>My highlights tend to get a little dull in between appointments, but this product refreshes them quite nicely!</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to wash out the next day, just use a bit more &amp; style as usual.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t usually get excited about the fragrance added to products...</li>
      <li>Although it lasts due to the quality grade not requiring use of large amounts, at $42 this is akin to highway robbery.  </li>

<li> Although it lasts due to the quality grade not requiring use of large amounts, at $42 this is akin to highway robbery.  </li>
<li> I ordered eight tubes, which will last me a very long time (I only use a pea-size amount).</li>
<li> so it last a long time.</li>
<li> When putting it on wet hair, I have a tendency to use too much and go a little greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> /&gt;Not a horrible product, I&#x27;m sure it works better for other hair types.</li>
<li> I ordered 8 tubes because I was afraid I would not be able to find it again.  </li>
<li> It used to be well-stocked in several different stores, but it is getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
<li> Try to go extra light on the top because I&#x27;m afraid it will make my hair get too dirty too soon.  </li>
<li> It can be used on damp or dry hair.  </li>
<li> My hair is dry and over-processed</li>
<li> I partially blow my hair dry, then apply.</li>
<li> have applied it to my hair both wet and dry</li>
<li> It can be applied to either wet or dry hair (or both).  </li>
<li> Slight added smoothness when flat ironing.</li>
<li> My hair is colored with heavy blonde highlights.</li>
<li> This product has become harder to find than ever.  </li>
<li> I have medium length hair, and a tube lasts me for a few months (even with daily use).</li>
<li> It&#x27;s never greasy, use about the size of a dime (less for short hair) turn hair upside down &amp; blend through, &amp; style.</li>
<li> My only issue with this product is that it&#x27;s not easily found.  </li>
<li> Although the tube is smaller than the shampoo or conditioner, I only have to use a very small amount of product.</li>
<li> Fortunately, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> You only need a small dab</li>
<li> Tried all kinds of products, including other products that are supposed to make hair shine and look less damaged.  </li>
<li> When rubbed through my damp hair, I think it may make it a little smoother (read less frizzy) when it air dries.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product  that is now hard to find. Good price and quick service.</li>
    <li> I have been unable to find this product, which I have used for about five years, in the retail store where I formerly purchased it. I was so glad to find it at Amazon!!! I love the product!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.   You cannot find this in any of the stores anymore, you can only get it at Amazon.com.  It detangles your hair easily and really adds shine to it. This order arrived so quickly, I thought I would be waiting for a couple weeks,  it was at my house in a matter of days.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous hair detangler that has be discontinued in retail stores and I am pleased that I have found it here and am able to continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Just the thing to tame after shampoo flyaway hair, this product also gives body and sheen to hair.  It can be applied to either wet or dry hair (or both).  Just use a small pea size amount and comb through. BEtter to start with too little than too much.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great price for John Frieda Sheer Blonde Spotlight Sleek &amp; Shine Detangler 2.4 oz of $4.99 howevever shipping is $4.99. The only way to reduce cost of shipping is to buy two tubes minimum which makes cost of shipping $5.49. My wife has used this product for years because she colors her hair. This product seems to protect her hair from dryness and split ends better than any other she has tried. Her colorist recommended it, and he was right it does a great job of protecting her hair, looks natural and beautiful. I buy most everything online for my wife and a big percentage is from Amazon.com, especially John Frieda Sheer Blonde Spotlight Sleek &amp; Shine Detangler because all the stores where we live no longer carry this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m distressed that John Frieda has discontinued this product. I have curly hair, and this is the best product I have found to smooth it. Plus, it&#x27;s water soluble and not greasy. It is a better product than any of the very expensive smoothing serums I&#x27;ve tried, and I don&#x27;t know WHAT I&#x27;m going to do when I can&#x27;t find it any more!    The seller shipped very quickly, and I&#x27;m pleased with the transaction.</li>
    <li> My hair is colored with heavy blonde highlights. Layered, almost to my shoulders. Pretty damaged. Tried all kinds of products, including other products that are supposed to make hair shine and look less damaged.  One is called Silk, I think, but it&#x27;s too greasy.  This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My damaged ends become sleek and shiny without greasiness.  In fact, it does not make my hair get dirtier faster the way some products do.  I can go almost a week between washings...something I usually can&#x27;t do.  Gives my hair a glowing shine, making it look healthy and vibrant.  I apply it only on the lower 1/2 of my hair, and apply it to the top where the damage shows.  Try to go extra light on the top because I&#x27;m afraid it will make my hair get too dirty too soon.  I partially blow my hair dry, then apply. By the time I blow it dry and use a curling iron/flat iron, my hair miraculously looks healthy.  Don&#x27;t usually get excited about the fragrance added to products...some are very cheesey and others are too strong.  This product has a light, clean smell, not too strong. All in all, my hair ends up appearing as if it&#x27;s full of healthy moisture without looking greasy or weighed down.  Don&#x27;t know how the ingredients work, but they do WORK!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used.  It makes my hair very shiny and detangles my fine, blonde hair.  Although the tube is smaller than the shampoo or conditioner, I only have to use a very small amount of product. This Spotlight Sleek and Shine is almost impossible to find.  I beleive it must be discontinued by John Frieda.  I will be very sad if it is!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I, too, have used this product for several years and was quite upset that it was no longer available in stores. I love the way it detangles and adds shine to my hair, and I was so happy to find it here! I ordered eight tubes, which will last me a very long time (I only use a pea-size amount). Thank you for having this product available and for the excellent, prompt service.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and love it, can&#x27;t find it at the stores anymore. I have thin, fine hair, but this doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp or greasy, just tames the fly aways and adds shine.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make my blonde hair all that shiny. When rubbed through my damp hair, I think it may make it a little smoother (read less frizzy) when it air dries. Slight added smoothness when flat ironing. But I think the product alone (on top of flat ironing, of course) dries out my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a horrible product, I&#x27;m sure it works better for other hair types. Didn&#x27;t impress me enough to buy again, but will continue to use rest of the tube on and off, see if it changes my opinion....</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite hair product - as a bleached blonde, it gives my hair softness, managability &amp; shine</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s never greasy, use about the size of a dime (less for short hair) turn hair upside down &amp; blend through, &amp; style. You don&#x27;t have to wash out the next day, just use a bit more &amp; style as usual. It gets rid of frizzy strands &amp; leaves you hair feeling silky! The best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. The reason the price is sooo high is that this product is no longer being manufactured. They have replaced it with a liquid oil type product. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this was a huge mistake. Nothing can replace Spotlight. It is truly the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for getting rid of flyaways, something that most blondes have to deal with, no matter what the length of their hair, but it does get worse with longer hair. I wish they would continue to make this product. And by the way, this price is for only 1&lt;br /&gt;tube !!</li>
    <li> This product has become harder to find than ever.  Not sure why. I even contacted the main company to try to find it.  So glad it&#x27;s on Amazon.  I buy 2 and they last me 6 months with daily use.  This is great for curly, frizzy, blonde hair.  No oily residue.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff but it is so hard to find.  Why do they make something so good and then discontinue it?  It makse my hair more managable and silky.</li>
    <li> John Frieda Sheer Blonde Spot-Light Sleek &amp; Shine is a great hair product.  It&#x27;s perfect for taming fly-aways, and just a little goes a long way.  I have medium length hair, and a tube lasts me for a few months (even with daily use). I use about a pea-sized amount for my hair. It smells great, and leaves your hair shiny while bringing out your beautiful blonde highlights (natural or not). My highlights tend to get a little dull in between appointments, but this product refreshes them quite nicely! It can be used on damp or dry hair.  I use it after I&#x27;ve dried/styled mine. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy at all, and I have baby fine locks!  My only issue with this product is that it&#x27;s not easily found.  It used to be well-stocked in several different stores, but it is getting harder and harder to find.  I always see the John Frieda Spot-Light Sleek &amp; Shine for Brunettes, but not for Blondes. I&#x27;ll definitely keep ordering it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had used this product for several years and then it must have been taken off market and discontinued.  I looked everywhere for it and finally went online and found it at [...] through Amazon.  I ordered 8 tubes because I was afraid I would not be able to find it again.  I love it and wish it had never been discontnued by John Freida.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Spectacular product that leaves hair hydrated and shiny plus styles superbly without the greasy residue or weighing the hair down ... but unfortunately discontinued, thus the astronomical price.  I have purchased over the years at no more than $8 per tube.  Supply and demand concept rules.  Although it lasts due to the quality grade not requiring use of large amounts, at $42 this is akin to highway robbery.  May still break down and order one :-)</li>
    <li> This product works great on my natural curly hair - just wish I had bought more before the price went up! It would also be nice if it came in a bigger container (I have long hair)</li>
    <li> Great product, don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued, wish it was not so expensive. If this product fails to be available&lt;br /&gt;I will need to shop around to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for John Frieda&#x27;s Highbeam glosser that they discontinued a few years ago. This comes close at first glance but doesn&#x27;t quite work the same magic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. I have strawberry blonde hair and this product brings out the blonde highlights like nothing else. It gives me incredible shine and makes my hair feel like silk. You only need a small dab so it last a long time.</li>
    <li> I am letting my hair go silver, so I bought this due to a reviewer that said it was good for that. It is, it does not have any color added to it. (as so many silver products do, a blue-purple tint). This is colorless, and gives my dry silvers a great shine that catches in the light. And it makes them soft, not wiry.  Do apply with a light hand, you can always add more if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;I have applied it to my hair both wet and dry, I prefer to add it after I have styled it as this gives me a better idea of how much to add. When putting it on wet hair, I have a tendency to use too much and go a little greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any color hair, as it has no added color (it appears totally clear).&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find this in any store, thank goodness it is carried here.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for more of this product and cannot find it.  It makes hair easy to comb after washing and when dry your hair really shines.  Please let me know if anyone knows where to find it.</li>
    <li> Wish I could get more.  Why did they stop making it? Just when you find a product  you like and it works, they stop making it.</li>
    <li> it is impossible to find which makes me sad but i love this product so much. highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wish you could still get this stuff.  It is awesome</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product which I am now unable to buy in Australia so Amazon has come to my rescue once again. If I didn&#x27;t believe it was superior to other glosses on the market, there is no way I&#x27;d pay such an exorbitant price for it. Fortunately, a little goes a long way. My hair is dry and over-processed so I do need all the help I can get. For those who have strong, healthy hair, there are excellent, cheaper options available.</li>
