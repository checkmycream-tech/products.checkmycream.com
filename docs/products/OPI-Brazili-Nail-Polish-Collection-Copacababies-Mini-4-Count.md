<li> like that the bottles are small because if i dont like a color , i dont feel like i have to commit for too long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Get it if you&#x27;re not sure because they&#x27;re so small you don&#x27;t have to commit to finishing the bottle</li>
<li> Orange one is a bit thick, would prefer a pearlier finish</li>
<li> the bottles are very small.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, the peachy one looks bad on me</li>
