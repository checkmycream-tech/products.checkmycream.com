<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this product. The texture of moisturizer is very great, not too heavy for men skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feel oily. Really recommend for everyone especially for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I truly wish I could give this 5 stars but the lotion doesn&#x27;t work well on my face, it could be the kind of skin I have but whenever I use it on my face it brings about pimples.</li>
    <li> Great product. Not oily, no real smell. Does what is says on the packet.</li>
    <li> Excellent product..perfect consistency, organic ingredients, pleasurable scent, and good results. My only issue is with the packaging as the pump does not work well. If they put this moisturizer in a squeeze tube it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Not greasy and no sunscreen smell.</li>
    <li> Face feels dry after I put it on.</li>
    <li> Light-weight, not oily, and not &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34;. Like R&amp;D&#x27;s cleanser, was perfect a guy looking for a quality, no-nonsense facial product.</li>
    <li> A clean, greaseless moisturizer without harsh chemicals and fragrance.  Also, Rugged and Dapper goes out of its way to make sure you are satisfied with their product.  Very impressive.</li>
    <li> Love it. Leaves my face feeling very moisturized and with a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> After 30 days I feel like my skin is smoother and the wrinkles have subsided a little</li>
    <li> just started using it few days ago and i must say I&#x27;m very pleased with the result sofar.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer. Wish it had SPF in it. SPF ingredients not included because they (the manufacture) say SPF products aren&#x27;t supposed to be good for you, but I would like to see it in there anyway in oder to replace the OTHER face lotion I have WITH SPF.</li>
    <li> Fantastic lotion!  My husband bought it for himself and I have taken over it  :-) living in the unfortunate midwest, the weather is very tough on your skin and I have tried numerous face lotions to help with redness/dryness etc.  This stuff is pretty AMAZING!  My skin has never looked as smooth, clear, and soft as it does now!  I always used full coverage foundation but now I just need a little under-eye concealer and that&#x27;s it.  5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty rugged guy and this keeps me quite dapper. The organic and natural ingredients sold me on this product! Great facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I aply it after shaving and it works like a charm!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff has amazing ingredients. All organic and natural. I gave a couple of these away as gifts. The men in my life use gross chemicals on their faces and this makes me feel much better. It makes their faces softer and smoother and doesn&#x27;t smell at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple times but I really I really like it. I work in grease/flue cleaning and get very dirty daily and after my daily shower my face gets dry and this Organic/Natural product works for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased Rugged &amp; Dapper for my boyfriend as a gift. He absolutely loves this moisturizer as his skin is smoother and his color looks great. No doubt the ingredients are amazing or these results wouldn&#x27;t be possible. I am going to try it!</li>
    <li> I have now been using this for a week or so and am not only not getting any razor burn but it has been helping my whole face look smother and cleaner. I use a bit under my eyes and have noticed I don&#x27;t have the black bags under them anymore. good stuff.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It smells good. But just used it. I am not sure whether it really can make a difference...</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer! My face has definitely been clearer and more healthy since using it. I use 1 pump for each side of my face in the morning after washing, and another 2 (1 on each side) at night after shower. It also dries nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave oily feeling like Burt&#x27;s Bees did. Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I was able to use it once or twice before my son in college took it back to school with him. It worked great for me and I am sure he took it because he liked it as well.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the pprpduct.  Nice feeling on my skin and minimal fragrance</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok....just like all other facial moisturizers for men.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband so I asked him to write the review for me to post....&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This is a very good moisturizer and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it. I am pretty much the text book definition of a metro-sexual, 42 year old male (although I&#x27;d like to think of myself as more of a manly man) and I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I use on my skin. My wife got this for me to try. Honestly I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to think but I have to say that I really like it. It goes on smooth and non-greasy, which is a must for me. It is also unscented which is nice because I don&#x27;t like smelling like a woman at work or around the house. I noticed that it soaked right in and  kept my skin moisturized for hours. As an added bonus, I found that it also works really well on my hands which tend to get dry and cracked, especially in the colder months. One application on my hands lasted me almost all day, which was awesome. I know it&#x27;s not a hand-lotion, I&#x27;m just saying I found that it works well for me in that regard too. So basically, it seems that I can use this as an all around moisturizer which is cool. Good price point, great packing and really good value for how much you get. I also appreciated the additional insert inside the packaging from the company thanking me for being their customer and giving a way to get 25% off my next purchase from them. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> its actually deceptively hard to find a skin care product that isn&#x27;t full of damaging chemicals - and this one is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this moisturizer, especially right now with the weather change we&#x27;re cracking everywhere and this stuff is great! (Yes I am the wife and I&#x27;m using it too!) My husband who never uses products loves it and his skin looks great. I am personally a bit of an ingredient snob and don&#x27;t allow any chemicals and harsh ingredients in my family&#x27;s products and I am very impressed with these ones!</li>
    <li> Solid moisturizer, but not heavy enough. I have to use way more than the recommended amount.</li>
    <li> Great product. Nice and smooth, not oily feeling at all. I only have to apply once a day and seems to keep my face nicely moisturized. I like that there&#x27;s no scent or fragrance, but not waxy or chemically scented either (which I&#x27;ve experienced in other no-scent products). Bonus points for being made from natural, organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. His skin gets super dry in the winter and other moisturizers make him break out, and after using it for a week his skin looks so much better, is moisturized and doesn&#x27;t look oily at all. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Today, I just noticed lighter sun spots on my face. Definite change in skin tone while not feeling heavy on the face like a coating but absorbed into my skin. This is my review after 3-4 days. I find my face absorbing more then 2 pumps, without being overly shiny but not concerned as my skin is reacting in a positive way.</li>
    <li> This product is truly fragrance free for those who are sensitive to smell. Nice texture and generally a good product. Typically I use Cade Aftershave balm ($34/2.5 oz). So I miss the smell, but only paying $25 for this 4 oz. product is a great value for a premium, natural product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now. Not one to use moisturizers but with this dry weather I found a need. Gave it a shot. Been great. Because I don&#x27;t use moisturizers, my skin breaks out when I do. Haven&#x27;t had an issue, which is good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I don&#x27;t use it much and I don&#x27;t shave much, I think it&#x27;s going to last a long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the kind of guy who buys a lot of skin care products.  I recently realized it was time to start using a good moisturizer.  I&#x27;m really glad I gave this new company a shot.  The product is super light, fragrance free and by the time I walk out of the bathroom, I can&#x27;t even feel it on my skin.  I like that, the feeling of heavy oils on my face turns me off of most products.  The ingredient list is impressive, chock full of organic goods to nourish the skin.  The last product I tried was khiels, I like this far better.  The packaging is cool too so I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out on a shelf in my bath.  Great customer service as well as super fast shipping.  Will definitely return to this product and look forward to seeing what else they come out with.</li>
    <li> I used to have really dry and unhealthy skin, my wife got me this lotion and after 2 1/2 weeks I can honestly say I feel a big change! My skin feels like it&#x27;s actually breathing, blotchy marks have cleared up, red areas gone! Dry skin a thing of the past! I&#x27;m a married man, and am used to not have any attention, (from other females) now it&#x27;s like everywhere I go ladies are just throwing themselves at me! It&#x27;s nuts! Thanks Rugged and Dapper! I&#x27;m sold! Can&#x27;t wait to use this stuff for the rest of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week now, it is great as a daily moisturizer but I find it particularly good after the hot tub or pool. It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t have a smell and is organic, I will probably buy this product again.</li>
    <li> good product. didn&#x27;t notice the fragrance other reviewers mentioned. but definitely noticing the freshness in the face. only been two days since i started using it. will update the review after more usage.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! A non greasy moisturizer that soothes and softens skin while making feel firm!</li>
    <li> He loves it! Of course, he was skeptical, but a quick glance over the ingredient list had him trying it out immediately! I am with a man twice my age, so I don&#x27;t mind the softening effects it has on his face, and he likes it when he&#x27;s getting out of the shower or getting all fancy for a night out. Good stuff, he loves it, I like it too- what else can I say?</li>
    <li> I surf year around and therefore am in the sun all the time. So I needed something to help with my dried out and often sun burnt skin. This stuff is perfect, it feels great on my skin and I can feel my skin absorbing it like a drink of water.  I definitely recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now and it has helped transform my skin. I have tried other men&#x27;s lotions and they didn&#x27;t hydrate as well, I would need to reapply throughout the day. Excellent product, glad they started selling on Amazon. One bottle lasts about 4 months so it is a great value.</li>
    <li> Hi,  I just wanted to say a few word about this moisturizer exclusively for men. First of all I&#x27;ve never used or heard of moisturizers for men so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I applied the moisturizer on after I had shaven and it was a very cool (Aloe) and soothing experience and also because of it&#x27;s light fragrance, I was able to spray on some cologne without the burning sensation you get after shaving. I haven&#x27;t used the moisturizer long enough to comment on some of it&#x27;s other qualities but anxious to find out. In closing, I wanted to mention that the delivery time took only three day&#x27;s from the day I ordered...Thanks, Rugged &amp; Dapper</li>
    <li> I loved the cleanser so much that I thought I would give this a try. After using the cleanser a couple times a day, my face was getting a little dry. This helped keep my skin hydrated without making my skin feel oily. There&#x27;s also not a strong scent, and what scent there is I only smell when applying it. So no worries about your face smelling odd all day. It also works great as an aftershave!</li>
    <li> Product arrived super quick.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like or use lotion, but it&#x27;s been a cold and dry winter and my face and hands are feeling it. This moisturizer goes on clean, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs fast. It definitely helps put some moisture back into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and there is no scent.</li>
    <li> does everything they claim. I have very oily skin and it keeps the shine away without leaving me feeling dry like other mattifying products. I&#x27;m definitely buying this one again!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I originally was using the other popular product on Amazon that comes in the blue bottle.  Unfortunately that product made my skin breakout, likely because of the added SPF.  Since switching to this product, my breakouts have vanished.  If you have sensitive skin like me, this is your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth. Love that it has great ingredients.</li>
    <li> This cream performs well. Not greasy and has absolutely no scent. Just started using it, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does as advertised</li>
    <li> Unscented, great relief from stinging after shaving.  Just about right &amp;#34;thickness&amp;#34; -- spreads across the face easily.  Also:  for once, &amp;#34;glycerin&amp;#34; is not the chief ingredient.  The &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; ingredients are up-to-date.  A better name for this might be &amp;#34;R &amp; D,&amp;#34; as in &amp;#34;Research and Development.&amp;#34;  The &amp;#34;Rugged and Dapper&amp;#34; name is goofy.</li>
    <li> Great product, light and near odorless, that absorbs quickly on your skin. Non-greasy, yet moisturizes effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service to boot.</li>
    <li> For $25 I thought this lotion would be god&#x27;s gift to man. I apply it after showers and in the morning before work. I use about 4 squirts per application. The scent is ok, not much to it. The consistency is nice but I don&#x27;t feel this product is superior in any way over Cerave and whatever else I periodically use. I probably won&#x27;t be buying this again, unless it was priced at $12.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging and quality ingredients.  I have never had an allergic reaction to a moisturizer before, but after applying this product my face became irritated and itchy.</li>
    <li> This is really nice stuff. I got it for my husband. I tried a little on my hand. felt good. I put it on my face, felt amazing. My husband loves that its fragrance free and doesnt&#x27;t make his face shiny. Thank you for making a great product with high quality ingredients and none of the bad preservatives in it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Just wish it had more UV protection so it would suit all occasions. Otherwise I use this everyday and it is a great product and alternative to many of the toxic products on the market. Big thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Been using for a little over a week and there&#x27;s already a noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Talk about awesomeness! When I opened the box this came in, I immediately grew an extra half inch of chest hair. I went to tell my wife and I found that all of my whiskey bottles had magically filled themselves back up. My cat had also turned into a Alaskan Malamute, and she now barks in six different Germanic languages. I also found an axe and a plaid flannel shirt in my closet, which is cool.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s thoughts about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I have been using it for about a week now. The consistency of this moisturizer is nice. I like the matte finish after applying it. My face feels really smooth after applying this moisturizer. I like all the all natural/organic ingredients in it too. I will keep on using it and hopefully it will help keep my skin healthy and moisturized.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am very pleased to have discovered this product for my boyfriend. First, I love the name. It&#x27;s so manly. I know that may seem silly but, really, I think they&#x27;re products should pick them up. Why not?!&lt;br /&gt;What really drew me to this product was the fact that it does SO MUCH. I mean, my boyfriend generally has to buy separate products to get all that this one provides.&lt;br /&gt;Age+Damage Defense Facial Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Aging Cream Hydrator&lt;br /&gt;After Shave Lotion&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance Free&lt;br /&gt;Rugged and Dapper contains 100% all natural, nutrient rich ingredients that are certified organic. Ingredients you recognize and can pronounce:  Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Green Tea and other plant based botanicals. No chemicals, toxins or preservatives that can be harmful to you.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; It is ideal for all ages and skin types including: normal, sensitive, oily, rough &amp; dry, combination, and acne prone complexions. It absorbs quickly and completely for a smooth matte appearance and won&#x27;t make you break out or leave your face looking greasy and shiny.&amp;#34; Now, we see this in female products, too. You apply a lotion, serum, cleanser, moisturizer... next morning your face is oily, red, sensitive, broken out.... Then that product gets thrown in a drawer or tossed in the trash. Money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;Let me quote this to you so you can really see what you&#x27;re getting:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;HOW IT WORKS... Peptides boost Collagen and Elastin production at the dermal layer to repair and prevent wrinkles. Hyaluronic Acid deeply hydrates, restores healthy elasticity &amp; firmness and protects skin from destructive UV damage without chemical SPF. Aloe Vera has strong healing and anti inflammatory properties that soothes shaving and acne irritation, while allowing the skin to heal quickly with less scarring through the growth of new cells. Jojoba Oil fuels the skin by providing a ton of essential vitamins, minerals and antioxidants while preventing an oily complexion by mimicking the activity ofyour bodies natural oils, so your skin won&#x27;t go overboard.&amp;#34; All very important facts to know. We can look for other products containing some of the same components and expect the same general effects.&lt;br /&gt;Now,  all I can do right now is tell you about it from my observations and from what we are to expect from the company who has a 100% No Risk, Money Back Guarantee.... that says a lot. In a couple weeks, my boyfriend will be in and I&#x27;ll update you on what it does for him and his outside skin that&#x27;s in the hot and cold, even when it&#x27;s at extreme levels and a handsome but aging skin. He&#x27;ll be 63 next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me finish by telling you that it&#x27;s also MADE IN THE USA!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything, great stuff, I think I use less than others, I alternate between electric and razor to shave, makes it easier!!!! Highly recommended,  big thumbs up!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this age and damage defense facial moisturizer for men in the mail for a product review. My husband has been using it after washing his face in the morning and after his shower in the evening. He really likes that the moisturizer moistens his skin without making it feel greasy or oily. Once it has absorbed he no longer knows that he is wearing it. There is no scent for this lotion and that is important to my husband and I am sure it is at the top of the list of preferences for all men. The ingredients are natural and organic so it is safe to use if you have sensitive skin. My husband breaks out in hives if you look at him cross eyed, but he is able to use this product with no problems. Also important in our household is to boost the sales of homegrown items. This product is proudly made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Just great...&amp;#34;A man&#x27;s man moisturizer..&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time last week and overall I am very happy for the price. I have tried moisturizers twice as much which didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> pretty decent for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my dad, and he loves it. He no longer complains of dry skin and his skin wasn&#x27;t irritated by this product. Well done.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing from this company.  The product is great!  Absorbs quickly with no greasy or oily feeling and the ingredients are all natural.  I will definitely continue to be a loyal customer and can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a moisturizer for quite some time, even buying more expensive lotions. This product is absolutely perfect. I have sensitive and oily skin, this does a fantastic job and doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking red like so many other lotions did. Buy this, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a lotion that I could use after shaving when I stumbled upon this product.  I was reluctant at first to try since its pricey but I no longer wanted to use another brand that was loaded with chemicals.  I deal with a lot of allergy issues and have very sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t want to give a review until I had tried Rugged and Dapper for a few weeks.  I am happy to report that this product has met my expectations, helps soothe the razor burn and I have had zero issues with any type of skin irritation or breakouts.  I am going to continue using his product as long as it performs like I have experienced so far.  I like the fact that that this product is all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin. The name is kinda funky but no doubt it sticks in your head.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s working great.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my husband after doing a lot of research.  He is a runner, and his face gets wind burnt and dry.  This is a lightweight cream with a very slight smell that is pleasant (it is fragrance free, so the smell is from the ingredients), and it moisturizes his face very well after shaving and at other times.  It is non-greasy and blends in well.  It is made with natural ingredients and contains shea butter, jojoba oil, sunflower oil and vitamin E.  His skin is sensitive, and this product causes no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> In my line of work, being an inspector of commercial and residential buildings, my face and hands are exposed to the elements throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Either incessant blasts of photonic raze burning the skin on my head and face or the crawling through attics and under buildings to assess it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;integrity, my skin is covered in dirt and grime in no-time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I use &amp;#34;Rugged &amp; Dapper&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a fresh feeling and revitalizes my skin. And for a rough hairy sophisticated Mountaineer such as myself, that&#x27;s just the back-up I need&lt;br /&gt;when I am home from a day out in the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Rugged &amp; Dapper&amp;#34; don&#x27;t be shy, Man-Up!</li>
    <li> Rugged &amp; Dapper skin fuel for men is an age &amp; damage facial moisturizer. It comes in a 4 oz bottle with a small pump at the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer comes out of the pump in a very small stream. You definitely need 2-3 pumps to cover your whole face. The moisturizer itself is white and medium thick in consistency. It does not smell particularly &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;. It actually smells like Vaseline and maybe cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first ingredient is aloe. Which is refreshing because a lot of moisturizers have water as the first ingredient. The next couple of ingredients are sunflower oil and then palm oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion absorbs very quickly and is not tacky after absorption. There is no smell after application. The men in my life do not particularly care for lotion so it will be interesting to see if they notice a difference with this lotion and continue to use it! I think using lotion especially in the winter is essential especially if you want to keep your skin looking young and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!</li>
    <li> This is great for the man in your life that needs to moisturize but is frightened by all of the products geared toward females. My boyfriend has been using this for a few weeks now and his skin looks amazing. He really likes the pump feature and the very light scent. His skin has never looked better after shaving since he started using this. The dry patches he once had are gone and he looks younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Highly recommend for men looking for a face moisturizer.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised Pleased with product</li>
    <li> This product was excellent. Smooth, not too oily, absorbs into the skin easily, no annoying fragrance.  My husband loved it immediately and started using it every day.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad. We were having a spa day and thought this would be perfect for him. It was!!!! After applying to his face was radiant and glowing. There is a light fragrance to it that&#x27;s not overwhelming.  He got so much complaints about how good he looks. ...great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product....anti-aging moisturizer and after shave lotion all in one!  My husband was so excited when I was given the chance to get this product during a promotion.  He was happy to try it out and give his opinion for me.  He loves it.  I have tried for years to get him to use some kind of anti-aging moisturizer but he insists that he doesn&#x27;t need it (he needs it).  I guess just because he is a man he thinks that isn&#x27;t necessary but who said men can&#x27;t take care of their skin?  My husband said that since using this his skin has looked and felt better and he has not had any razor burn.  He has also not had any ingrown hairs.  This product has changed his mind about skincare for men and I am so grateful! Now if I can get him to add a sunscreen on top of this we will be great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff - a little goes a long way, natural ingredients - shipped quickly as always, I will definitely be using this for my face go forward.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Will use again.</li>
    <li> Pump does not work, I have to unscrew the pump to get the lotion out. Bottle seemed half empty. However, it is a great face lotion.</li>
    <li> Product works very well. Goes on smoothly and does not leave a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; film. The 4 OZ bottle should last a long time, moisturizer spreads out nicely on skin so minimal product is used per application. Would highly recommend and will order again.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this product but when I tried it the pump did not work, making it very difficult to use. It must be defective because I don&#x27;t see very many bad reviews. I hope they will reimburse me with a new bottle or pump so I can use it without having to unscrew the top.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My skin is super sensitive - some areas very dry and some extremely oily. This product works well on both the dry sections and the oily-prone sections of my face. I only need one squirt every morning and evening (two in the MN winters), and it goes easily and absorbs pretty fast. I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I was nearing the bottom of my Jack Black moisturizer and wanted to see what else was out there. Comparing the two, they are both excellent products and would recommend both without hesitation. I upgraded from Avenno after I developed rosacea, I needed something less greasy and both the R&amp;D and JB are just that...much less greasy. This product leaves my skin feeling more supple and in great condition long after using...a bit more so than the JB, but not by much. It also smells rather neutral, kind of like a light olive or grape seed oil though not overpowering. The JB has a light fragrance that is manly and pleasant. I would say this is an overall better value for the size.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible. I love that it goes on smooth with a light feel and no shine. It has made a huge difference in my complexion and skin tone in a short time. I finally found a keeper.</li>
    <li> Impressed by the result. Not greasy at all, controls oil as well. But little expensive on the price side.</li>
    <li> They really should not call it &amp;#34;Age + Damage Defense...&amp;#34; because UV light is the #1 cause of wrinkles, skin aging and skin damage; that is a fact.  I would not recommend any facial moisturizer/lotion to any patient that didn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it. I do not recommend a chemical sunscreen (it&#x27;s better than no SPF though), but a physical sunscreen (Zinc Oxide). If you wish to continue looking young for years to come I suggest you do the same.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! I works well, and it looks good on the shelf.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for men with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The hand pump ejects small portions of the product, with about 5 actions for a quarter sized amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the scrub of the product, less dense scrub beads make for a better daily scrub and isn&#x27;t as harsh as some scrubs.  After drying my face, my face isn&#x27;t oily or dry.  No heavy scents that aggravate your eyes or nose either</li>
    <li> No scent and puts what would be in two bottles into one what else can I say its a time saver I like the product I have not tried any of the rest of their line but for now this combined two steps in my skin care into one and I like the results. Its far superior to the alcohol based stinging night mare aftershaves I learned to shave with and not only does it not dry out my skin creating more dead cells to clog my pores like them it moisturizes my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I&#x27;m loving the black bottle, too!</li>
    <li> Rugged &amp; Dapper is a brand that has seemingly come out of nowhere and won over a pretty substantial male fan base. It&#x27;s pretty easy to see why. This moisturizer is a multi-purpose product that not only acts as a natural (all natural ingredients - see full ingredients on product description) moisturizer, it can also be used as an aftershave product. For me, that&#x27;s a HUGE convenience as it&#x27;s not necessary to purchase both a facial moisturizer and a post shave product. The fact that this moisturizer is also all natural is icing on the cake as I was looking for a moisturizer that lacked all of the harsh chemicals and ingredients a lot of the major brands contain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this product goes a long way and it leaves your face feeling well moisturized without feeling &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34;. It is easily absorbed by the skin and lasts all day long. Also, for skin conscious folk like myself, this product will NOT break you out or cause any irritation and is completely non-comedogenic so have no fear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique with this product is the bottle design. Like many pumps, once you get toward the bottom, it becomes more and more challenging to use the pump to dispense the moisturizer. An obvious workaround is to remove the top and simply bang out the remaining moisturizer like hitting a ketchup bottle. But, I hope that Rugged &amp; Dapper makes some cosmetic changes to their bottle design down the road to increase it&#x27;s efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a design issue should not stop anyone from purchasing this moisturizer. This is a fantastic product produced by an even better brand. If you haven&#x27;t given Rugged &amp; Dapper a chance to win you over, you absolutely should.</li>
    <li> This works very well keeping face moisturize and great aftershave no side effects at all</li>
    <li> I was provided this product to test since there is a man in my house who has never tried facial moisturizer. This would be my 20 year old college student. I personally am a moisturizer enthusiast so he completely understood when I asked him to try this product. He used it for quite a few days and though I was expecting him to say &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; when I asked how it was going so far, he actually said it&#x27;s nice and that his girlfriend loves how soft his face is. It has a mild scent, not perfumy at all. I think I&#x27;ve converted him! Hopefully it will keep him looking as young as he does today for years to come.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I am impressed. I have very sensitive skin and usually break out from most moisturizers, but after using rugged and dapper I have even clearer skin. Best product I&#x27;ve used for after shave moisturizer. This is the first face moisturizing product I&#x27;ve used that just does what it suppose to without any breakouts or reactions to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I got it for my brother who is a big of a man&#x27;s man and he loves it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week so far and I can see difference in my face already in a better way. It absorbs well on my skin and doesn&#x27;t make it oily. Have to really use for couple of months to see how it works on wrinkles and age defense.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the quality of the ingredients. I loved the way it felt on and it did not leave me feeling greasy, however, I had a slight reaction to it. My face got red and puffy and broke out in little hives. I contacted them and told them of my reaction and they were EXTREMELY polite and issued me a refund right away. Very thankful for their customer service. Loved the product it just didn&#x27;t work well with my skin. I gifted it to a friend and he loved it.</li>
    <li> I can really feel the cleanser working on my face and definitely reordering!</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Have not had to use aftershave since I started using it.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes it. It has very little scent, which is nice. His skin is much softer and wrinkles are less pronounced. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product; I been using it for only a little over a week and can already see a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, non greasy and no odor at all. It seemed expensive at first, but a little goes a long way and it works. And it&#x27;s all natural and organic. Good job, R&amp;D!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer non sented works great</li>
    <li> Fantastic face lotion! I have never liked using face lotion because it always makes me break out.. As I am no longer in my twenties, I realize i need to start using something to help reduce the effects of aging hahahha... Well this is the stuff! I have been using this for a couple of months and absolutely love it. will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> Nice and light, I like!!!</li>
    <li> This is great! I&#x27;ve had some serious ingrown hairs on my face for the past 7 to 8 years of my life. After using this for three weeks now I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction, as well as improved skin tone. I look forward for more results as I continue to use this. It also smelles and feels 100% Natrual.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it. Says it is light and gentle on his skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, I recommended to everyone who likes to take care of themselves. Leave my face nice and hydrated all the times, even when is dry out. Not greasy or anything like that, you can tell that it has the right combination of ingredients. You will see, you will come back for more!</li>
    <li> Leaves face smooth, no oil left behind and doesnt leave my face feeling dry . I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Rugged and dapper! It&#x27;s a really nice creamy moisturizer.  My husband loves to use it after saving.  The moisturizer comes sealed in a black box. It&#x27;s very nourishing and great for your skin. This product can be used as a daily moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a face lotion that doesn&#x27;t make you look shiny and greasy.  This is not that lotion.  This lotion will make you look shiny and oily.  I suspect that any face lotion with oil in it will make you look oily but I&#x27;m not a skin expert.  The hunt continues.</li>
    <li> although I have only had this Moisturizer for a short time it is right up there with my other two favorites I&#x27;m sure I will order it again</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever had!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel a lot better after a close shave.  No real fragrance either, which I like.  I never did like alcohol-based after shaves, as they always stung and did nothing to moisturize my face (I&#x27;m 57 and getting enough wrinkles as it is).  Altogether, I highly recommend the product, although to be fair I haven&#x27;t tried any other similar brands so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  Think I&#x27;ll be trying the facial cleanser next.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  My son had a problem with razor burn and patches of dry skin.  No more of either.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave you looking shiny.</li>
    <li> A very light moisturizer that I use as after shave.  Since I have sensitive skin this product is awesome. Its part of my daily routine now.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a couple of weeks now and am very happy with the product. Unlike many organic moisturizers I have tried Rugged &amp; Dapper does not have that pungent smell, in fact I believe it is unscented. Its has a good consistency and covers well with a small amount of product. For the cost its worth a try. I think you may like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an asian in my late 20&#x27;s with fairly clear skin but dry. This product helped immensely through the brutal winter we had here in NYC. It kept my face moisturized. I saw a notable difference in my skin. It was easier to shave and smoother altogether. I&#x27;m not sure about the age thing as i do look young for my age. However, when i went to my local bodega to buy a lotto ticket i was prompted for ID which they never asked for before! Go figure.</li>
    <li> I got this moisturizer over others because it advertised a matte finish. I am not sure I agree with that. It might not make you much shinier, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t make you less shiny. Could be my mistake, maybe I need something &amp;#34;mattifying&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Non-greasy feeling and hydrates skin. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my husband.  I asked his opinion about RUGGED AND DAPPER. He stated he was so glad that this product was made for men.  It does not have that frilly girl smell.  He loved that it was made from all natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some if the ingredients are hyaluronic acid, aplenty vera, non comedogenic, jojoba oil, Shea butter, green Tea,and several plant based botanicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love knowing that I am giving my husband something that is good for his skin and also made from natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked him what the best part of the product was.  He stated that he loved how it soothed his face after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I was given the opportunity to review this product.  I am so glad that RUGGED AND DAPPER made such a great product for my husband.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s a light weight moisturizer.  Has no smell so that is good.  Got the stubble butter oil to apply before shaving. The two work really well together</li>
    <li> I was using an after shave lotion before but this is far superior.  My skin has a healthier look and feels great to the touch.  It also has the added benefit of making the shaver run smoother around the more contoured facial areas.  The pump dispenser is designed to give you a fine stream of moisturizer which is needed because you do not need an overabundance of lotion. Obviously I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband says it may be great as a moisturizer, but as an aftershave it was a fail for him.</li>
    <li> This moisturizes my face pretty well. It&#x27;s not too greasy at all and it is gentle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week,  and my skin already feels softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom&#x27;s husband he said it was okay but didn&#x27;t continue to use it after a couple yime</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, makes my face feel very soft and smooth. I like the way that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny. Very  satisfied, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good service, good product. Would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> A fine product.  After using daily (I shave every day) for a week now,  I am pleased with how well the product performs on the skin.  A very small amount covers the face, leaving a non-greasy, smooth appearance.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. This is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I purchased the facial moisturizer and the facial scrub 3 weeks ago. All I have to say is WOW. My skin is so much clearer , smooth ,and def have seen a difference in fine lines shrinking . This is an AWSOME product and every guy should have this in there medicine cabinet .</li>
    <li> Cools &amp; tones my freshly shaved face like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used.  Isn&#x27;t greasy or &#x27;shiny&#x27;. Good product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bf and he loves it!</li>
    <li> I really like this unscented moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy.  Also, it seems like you may not get enough lotion from the bottle at one time, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works for me not too greasy just about right ;)</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Update 4.16.16 - I was given a 25% discount for a future order for submitting my first review.  The discount is not usable and they refuse to reply to my requests.    This moisturizer does not leave a nasty residue on my face and soaks in nicely. The complexion of my face has become even and the occasional pimple just falls right off.  This seems to keep my face perfectly balanced.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It was so nice! It helped me to restore my skin and I love it because it is not sticky</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 28 year old male and I use this product every morning.  It moisturizes very well and keeps my skin very soft.  It also gives your face the appearance of looking a little brighter/shinier making your look more healthy.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Immediately makes you smarter, more interesting, and more attractive to women!</li>
    <li> Another great product from this awesome company!  Non greasy, very light smell.  Works well for my slightly oily skin.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well. No need for additional aftershave.</li>
    <li> Great non-greasy/smelly product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the hubby because he has dry patches on his face and I thought this might help.  And it really has helped not only the dryness but is smoothing out some of his wrinkles.  He has a problem that when he shaves, his face gets really red and irritated.  It has helped to soothe the sting.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself is great. It&#x27;s thick, not greasy,  goes on smooth and light for how thick it is. Absorbs pretty quickly. The reason for the 3 stars is the delivery system. The pump is pretty terrible, I&#x27;d say on average I have to pump it 15+ times for it to even begin to squirt. If you use it on the go, in the gym and carry it in a dopp kit then you will likely have issues. I know this isn&#x27;t a big deal but I&#x27;m in the military and after physical training I only have so much time to get to work.</li>
    <li> nice exfoliation and a little amount goes a long way. still keeps your face moisturized and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many brand moisturizers - Kiehls, Peter Thomas Roth, Skinceuticals, and a lot more.  This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  Does not leave the skin oily.  Give the skin a nice glow and helps conceal large pores.  This is a real, unsolicited review from a long time Amazon buyer.  I only wish Rugged &amp; Dapper had more products.</li>
    <li> This product clogged my pores. My face felt dry and appeared ashy when applied. Later in the day my face was super oily. When I rinse my face at night before I cleanse, I can see the product like it was cheap makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product, great company, great people....have always loved LA! I am no longer safe on the UES of NYC It&#x27;s madness....all madness C.A. Bayer 3rd/AKA Nigel McCall THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It makes your skin feel amazing!</li>
    <li> Incredible product. Long lasting moisture with little to no shine. Not expensive when you consider the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Still trying it out..</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer ever since it first came out. I haven&#x27;t used any other moisturizer ever since then because it&#x27;s been so good to my face. I love that it is made with amazing organic ingredients,no scent to it, it&#x27;s lightweight, a little goes a long way (2 to 3 pumps max depending on season change), one bottle lasts me so long, and it&#x27;s cost efficient.My face is always left feeling moisturized. I love the Rugged and Dapper line!</li>
    <li> I am on the brink of 50 and never felt the need to wash my face, moisturize or follow any kind of daily skin care regimen. However, in the last year I have started to notice fine lines appearing around my mouth and forehead along with random darker spots from the sun. I am newly divorced and decided that I want to look and feel my best as I approach this next chapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased an array of different products over the last 6 months and this product is by far the best moisturizer. I am on my 2nd bottle, it is much more affordable on Amazon.  My dry, coarse skin has dramtically softened, my wrinkles are less noticeable and pronounced and overall my skin feels healthy for once. I have even gotten complements about my complexion from female coworkers in the office. You don’t need to use very much, so a 4 oz. bottle lasted a good 3 months for me (less than $10.00/ month). It starts working right away but for real results takes consistent everyday use. Excellent investment for your face!</li>
    <li> I bought this face moisturizer for my husband and it&#x27;s a rare moisturizer that he actually likes to use. I&#x27;ve also found myself using it because it&#x27;s all natural and Organic and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! Anyone can use this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for several months and it seems to have improved my skin. Hopefully continues use will continue to see improved results</li>
    <li> Bought it for my boyfriend, he is 53, didn&#x27;t like it, prefers to use my burt&#x27;s bees radiance cream</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for those looking for something fragrance free. I was under the impression it would have some type of scent.</li>
    <li> Really like this product! I was skeptical because of my beard that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to fully enjoy this, but I was hella wrong! It works really well! I only use this once a week, and that has been plenty! I could tell results almost instantly! I recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I don&#x27;t feel greasy or like I&#x27;m using my wife&#x27;s moisturizer.  It&#x27;s a good value too and the customer service is great.</li>
    <li> Great natural/organic moisturizer. Even has a sort of hoppy/beer scent that induces feelings of manliness.</li>
    <li> Quality product that does just what a guy needs.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday. He says it feels nice on his skin and I say that the scent is an aphrodisiac. Will surely continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Works better at keeping my skin fresh and young looking than any other product I have used, most of them being more expensive.</li>
    <li> Vitamins for your skin! I really love that there are no chemicals in this product. The feel is great on your fingertips and feels light on your face. The scent from the aloe is very subtle yet very pleasant. Not too perfume-y for a man. After only two weeks of usage, co-workers have already commented on more of a natural glow to my skin. I am assuming it is an effect from the Hyaluronic Acid, but whatever is happening is making me happy. This is one of the best replacements for previous skin care products that I have ever tried. Loving it!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Reasonable size too! Even men need to take care of their skin and not ignore it! This helps!</li>
    <li> hubby love the way this softens his beard and also his hands !!</li>
    <li> My wife had no idea I started using this. After just a week or so of use she mentioned to me the other day that my skin looked great. I have never used stuff like this before so I have nothing to compare it to, but i have no complaints either. Purchased based on other reviews and I liked the name. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, fast shipping and kept me informed of the status the whole time.  My boyfriend is obsessed with it.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what other products Rugged&amp;Dapper will come out with.</li>
    <li> Very good products and at a very good price. Thanks &amp;#34;Rugged &amp; Dapper for my clay mask.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product had great shipping and the product really does work!  It is a lot more than just a moisturizer as we&#x27;ll it has many benefits... I will be buying again</li>
    <li> This is an excellent everyday moisturizer and aftershave which is a bonus. It helps reduce bumps and has a cooling effect which feels great. My skin feels a lot healthier since I started using it and the fine lines on my forehead seem to be less noticeable. Hooked!</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using twice a day, it feels great and my complexion has really improved. I will be ordering again for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this amazing product. I want to mention that I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for anything but this rugged and dapper bottle is HEAVENLY made. Did I mention it&#x27;s organic? The only reason I took off 2 stars off the rating is because my pump does not work for facial cleanser I am not sure if it&#x27;s faulty or it comes like that. Hope the seller will do  take an note on this but hey I will be buying more of this once I run out of old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;Seller resolved my problem quickly. Heads up</li>
    <li> Love the product, but would be MUCH better in a tube. There is just too much wasted/left inside the bottle with the pump design, that I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer daily for about 2 months.  All I can say is wow! I have had people comment on the change in my skin complexion.  I have always had problems with combination skin (oily forehead and nose and dry neck and cheeks). This moisturizer has magically balanced things out! Even on a warm day, it take 5 plus hours for any hint of shine to appear on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I grumbled at the price tag, but it seems this one bottle is going to last me at least 6 months and for the results I am getting, its worth it!!</li>
    <li> It does what it claims. Moisturizes well and smells great. It contains little beads or grains of sand which help clean all the gunk off of your skin. I use it before bed and after I wake up. It&#x27;s a solid product and I don&#x27;t think I could ask for more.</li>
    <li> Ran out of my usual stuff and wanted to try something else out.  Read some reviews on this and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer has a very slight chemically smell to it, but it went on smooth and didn&#x27;t leave my face looking oily or shiny.  My face never got dry from the cold wind when I was outside.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough to notice anything about the aging aspect, but if I keep getting comments that I look younger than my actual age, I&#x27;ll be happy, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for over a week now &amp; I love it!!!! it&#x27;s so light weight and when it goes on, my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily and greasy and like other moisturizers do. so thumbs up here!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent daily moisturizer, and the size makes it even more enjoyable as it will last a while.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a good product.  I&#x27;m not really a critique of this kind of stuff.  I know that my face does not feel oily which is good.  I put it on after shaving.  I would purchase again i think.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> So far bought 2 of these. Works great. I have oily skin and I do breakout but this works. No oily residue. Keeps my face soft and I can see an improvement.</li>
    <li> I love it. I was looking for a nice face cream to replace the over-priced moisturizer that I currently use. Rugged and Dapper is not too oily and I feel like I&#x27;m pampering my skin every time I apply it.</li>
    <li> light, non-greasy, scentless moisturizer where a little goes a long way. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product; great price. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a smell!! It really keeps my skin healthy looking.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me.  I really like it.  It&#x27;s not oily and it doesn&#x27;t smell too fragrant (has a pleasant slight fragrance).  Winter is hell on my face but - knock on wood - this is helping.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has absolutely no skin care regimen, and I&#x27;ve finally converted him! I&#x27;m already noticing a difference in his complexion after a couple weeks of use, so much so that I&#x27;ve begun using it on my own face! Ladies take note--this cream may be marketed towards men, but the organic and vitamin-packed ingredients make it a treat for the delicate skin of a female. I&#x27;ll be order twice as much for the both of us when we run out!</li>
    <li> Really good moisturizer. I can feel it working for several hours after applying it. Not too creamy and not too watery.</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast, been using it for a week now, I use to have to wear two different face lotions lotions to achieve what this one can do. I specially like to use it right after I shave.</li>
    <li> Rugged &amp; Dapper is as good as advertised. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of days and already my skin feels better. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel and absorbs nicely. I really like that it&#x27;s organic in this world of harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy who likes working hard, and after a hard day of work, it&#x27;s good to recover and feel good when going out.</li>
    <li> This product is truly wonderful! I started applying it every night before I go to bed and I can already see the difference! As I am getting older, I was starting to show my age a bit, with this product I feel and look younger!</li>
    <li> Pros would be no scent, stellar ingredients, nice label design (aka looks good on the shelf!). Cons unfortunately outweigh the pros as this moisturizer just doesn&#x27;t have any staying power. I have non sensitive skin but dry due to cold weather and this stuff disappears within seconds and my skin is back to being dry and tight feeling. I&#x27;ve tried layering it and adding some oil in with it but it&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m not putting anything on. I&#x27;ve not seen a change in my skin&#x27;s hydration since I began using it which has been a good month.</li>
    <li> First time using this product. I am always willing to try out products that have a pretty good track record and so far so good with this product.  I have only been using it for a short period of time (1 week) and it has been doing it&#x27;s job to keep my face hydrated in these &amp;#34;chilly&amp;#34; times in California.  I do have sensitive skin and have not had any issues with the moisturizer causing negative effects.  The packaging is sweet; I do like things that look good and it is clean and simple.  The bottle, when looking at the pictures before purchase, I thought was made of glass which would&#x27;ve made it extra sweet and dapper, but I&#x27;m okay with it.  So far so good though. Cheers,  LM</li>
    <li> Search &amp;#34;anti-aging lotion&amp;#34; on Amazon and you&#x27;ll find a long list of moisturizers with very high marks, making the selection process difficult. I&#x27;m also pretty skeptical of products that have hundreds of 5-star ratings. As a guy, I didn&#x27;t really know what I was really looking for, other than something that seemed natural and specific to improve the skin condition of my face. I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this brand because of the long title, but went ahead and ordered it because it was specific for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week in and I can already tell the difference. Skin looks a lot smoother and it seems to be help reduce the puffy bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and have never used a moisturizer before. With the harsh winter ahead and my dry skin I decided I needed to try one. My hesitation is that moisturizers have a feminine connotation. When I found this product, just the name made me take a closer look. The reviews were pretty good so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks now and don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I will say that it goes on very easy, feels very good and is non greasy. I really like it. Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a long term use review. I&#x27;ll follow up in a couple months. It just makes my face feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I say give it a try! I don&#x27;t mind having it on my bathroom countertop one bit, as opposed to something like &amp;#34;wrinkle smoother moisturizer&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes without being greasy. Time will tell if it works.</li>
    <li> I was never a lotion person myself for many years, and because of that I think my skin has suffered. I did not like the oily and greasy feeling lotions left on my hand, so naturally I did not want that same feeling on my face, however, I do not get that feeling from this product. It does absorb quickly into your skin, and it does not have an over powering smell either which is what I like. You do not have to use a lot to have your face smooth throughout the day. I use at most four pumps, but that&#x27;t about it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29, failry good skin, maybe that&#x27;s the problem, but I bought it to protect against  crows feet around my eyes and wrinkles developing on my forehead.  Tow months of almost daily use and I don&#x27;t notice a single difference.  Maybe I have naturally semi-oily skin, maybe I don&#x27;t use it enough or maybe it doesn&#x27;t work well, but the raving reviews I read mislead me to think that I would see at least some sort of difference; I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Although I like the creme, the little flask pump doesnt seem of high quality and sometimes have to keep pressing to get some cream out.</li>
    <li> Great facial lotion, I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product I use it after shaving. I have a safty razer so it&#x27;s nice to have a moisturizer afterwards that&#x27;s not to grease a little bit goes a long way I only used it twice I&#x27;m thinking it will last at least a year.</li>
    <li> Best all in one moisturizer I have used I would highly recommend this to all my coworkers</li>
    <li> Wife bought this for me as a gift and it&#x27;s simply the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. As a professional golfer, I&#x27;m under the sun quite a bit and my skin has been damaged over the years. Since using this product, my skin&#x27;s condition has improved dramatically. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this cleanser, he says it leaves his face feeling nice and clean</li>
    <li> I have very acne-prone skin that shaving regularly helps keep healthy, but if I don&#x27;t shave perfectly then it can easily cause bumps and irritation. I&#x27;ve been applying a couple pumps of this morning and night focusing on my beard area and only a little on the rest of my face, and I didn&#x27;t expect much because I was already using a good moisturizer (CeraVe), but it really has made my skin feel and look so much healthier. Less acne, less irritation, and my skin seems less oily than it was prior. It really calms my skin after dragging a razor across it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say hypoallergenic or noncomedogenic on the label, but I&#x27;d be surprised if it did anything but help someone&#x27;s skin. Girls can obviously use it too, but I was looking specifically for something for guy&#x27;s skin formulated as an aftershave, and I also liked the branding towards men so that it looks cool for whoever snoops through my bathroom cabinets.</li>
    <li> I have used many different products, usually pricier and greasier.  I am very happy with this, having used it for several days.  Feels great, no greasy residue everywhere. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my dad to use. He loves it so far! He uses it after shaving in the morning. It works well as an aftershave and moisturizer. He said his face feels smoother after using it. He also really likes the bottle design. I received this for free to test and review.</li>
    <li> One of the best men moisterizer out there.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for me... so I guess I am looking old or something. In all seriousness, she has been tell me to get something to help take care of my face for awhile now. Other skin care products I have tried made my skin feel greasy. This one absorbs into the skin rapidly and doesn&#x27;t require too much product to cover the entire face and forehead. Be nice if they had a shaving cream and sunscreen to go along with it.  It is now several weeks that I have been using this product and there is definitely a difference in the way my face feels and looks. My wife likes it too. she loves it when she is right.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my dad and he absolutely loves it.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, non greasy, organic ingredients, &amp; a customer service oriented company.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I love how it&#x27;s not greasy.  It came in a premium looking bottle.  It moisturizes well and I feel it&#x27;s become an essential part of my grooming routine.  I wish they made other products, because I definitely would buy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the nozzle hole of the pump is quite small, which gives it more than ideal resistance when you pump.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far but seems to be pretty good stuff. I use it after a cleanser and  a microderm creme with the spa sonic rotating brush. It has the ability to soothe and replenish my skin after such a rough cleaning.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin refreshed and smooth, the amount could be more</li>
    <li> I never really cared about face care but I love how it works and how it makes my skin feel when using. i give it an A+</li>
    <li> So far so good. My face feels and looks better when I use the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff just awesome. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and my skin feels smoother and healthier. Been looking something like this for a long time now.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer for men I have ever used. I use a gentle cleanser and toner and then apply R&amp;D. My skin looks and feels great all day long. If you have been wasting money looking for the best moisturizer, stop now and buy some R&amp;D.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product, have been using it for a few days now and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed how well it works. On that I would rate this a 5/5. That said, for the size bottle you&#x27;re getting (4oz.), its overpriced. I can&#x27;t justify spending $25 on such a small amount, regardless how well it works. At $10-15 I&#x27;m in, for $25 I&#x27;d expect a larger bottle. 4oz.&#x27;s I&#x27;d predict will only last me a month at absolute most. I&#x27;m sorry to say I&#x27;m not going to be re-purchasing based on price alone.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion, hydrates very well and not oily.</li>
    <li> Great product a little bit goes a long way.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is everything I have been looking for since I started my love of skincare 10 years ago. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Love the way this one feels. Easy moisture without the greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancé because he likes to use my skincare line. He loves it! The Rugged &amp; Dapper products make his skin so soft and it smells intoxicating!</li>
    <li> Works well. Not too greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> I live in a fairly dry climate in Colorado and have been using moisturizers for several years. I&#x27;ve bounced around many men&#x27;s products trying to find the best for my face such as L&#x27;Oreal Men&#x27;s Expert (too oily &amp; stinks big time), Neutrogena Men (too oily &amp; stinks) Every Man Jack (too oily), Dove Men&#x27;s (hated it) and finally settled w/Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel for last few years. I was needing a refill and just out of curiosity landed on Rugged &amp; Dapper. The reviews where strong so I ordered to give it a shot. Been using it for over a week and it&#x27;s just as good or better than Kiehl&#x27;s. R&amp;Dapper absorbed into my skin very quickly without any oily build-up or perfumery scent. It seems to last all day. BTW... it&#x27;s funny reading women&#x27;s comments buying this stuff for their guys. Fellas - just man up and buy it yourself, lol. It&#x27;s not a big deal to take care of your face. I&#x27;m really happy with it and def recommend giving it a shot.</li>
    <li> Need to use a lot if you have dry skin&lt;br /&gt;  Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have much scent and doesn&#x27;t make skin oily which is all very good.  But not the best for dry skin.</li>
    <li> The product came surprisingly fast in the mail.  I tried it the next day.  The cream has no smell which is my preference - and seemed to absorb well.  I tend to ignore taking care of my skin - but given that it is the largest organ of my body and I have let it get as dry and untreated as I have, this product filled the bill for me.  Although its just a name, Rugged &amp; Dapper sounds like it was made for me.  All in all, I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Noticeably moisturized skin after just three days!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I hate creams, lotion and crap like that but my face takes a beating from the elements and needs something. This stuff is non greasy, no smell all natural. My face absorbs in quickly with no residue. My wife tells me my skin looks and feels a lot better. The dispenser is a tiny hole so only a little comes out, very easy to use. I am of Italian decent and normal olive skin. Definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Been using it my hands as well. Plus I&#x27;m not getting the weird looks from my friends that I get when using feminine skincare products. I work in a shop and my hands are dry from all the weird materials I work with. This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> Product shipped fast, was to my house a day early! I have some friends that use it and they love it, me on the other hand, not so much. The only issue I had with it is that it didn&#x27;t soothe my skin, it just irritated it, leaving a red-ish rash on my face for a few days after using it, and made my skin very sensitive for about a week after use. I just gave the rest of the bottle to a friend. I wont say its a bad product, some products aren&#x27;t meant for everyone. Not sure why, but my face just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Really great product for men. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I got to say this cream is awesome. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love this all natural product!!! I use it every morning before headin out .. I ordered it and it was at my door step the second day! I can&#x27;t wait for more products :)</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, but because my skin is very sensitive I did not feel the soothing sensation that I felt when I used another product. On the other hand, my brother tried it and he said that the product is great and he will use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Lotion leaves no smell, I have been using it twice a day and I havent seen noticeable difference. Will keep using to see if I notice any change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this product.  It leaves my face feeling moist but not oily, and feels great.  My girlfriend, who goes through myriad facial products via Birch Box and her own shopping, absolutely loves it as well.  I also like that it isn&#x27;t scented; the ingredients themselves seem to give off a mild almost coconut-like scent, but the scent is subtle enough that you don&#x27;t notice it unless you&#x27;re specifically looking for it.  Once I run out of my current bottle (which might take a while; the stuff seems to last!), I plan on buying it again.</li>
    <li> Nice. Works well, quality. Don&#x27;t use too much - a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new facial moisterizer. I wanted something that was naturally made and also would help with the fact that as much as I hate to admit, I&#x27;m getting older. Well Rugged and Dapper delivers all of this and more!  After using this product for several weeks I can attest to the fact that this product is starting to minimize my fine lines.  I have also noticed that my redness in my face is gone.  The best part of this product is that it is not greasy at all!  I tend to have more oiky skin and this product has actually help minimize that.  I am definitely happy that I discovered this product and know that I will continue to use it for a long time!</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible. I only buy non-GMO or organic products, and it took a lot of research to find something as good as this. The ingredients are great, and most importantly the moisturizer is fantastic. A little goes a long way, and it leaves your face moisturized and completely non-greasy. My husband and I both have dermatitis on our faces, and this stuff helps with dryness and does not make it worse. It also does not break us out, and we have very sensitive skin. It&#x27;s lasted us 4 months with both of us using it every day. GREAT product. With this bottle being 4oz, and the ingredients being as good as they are, you would be hard pressed to find something better- I&#x27;ve tried. Buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and I love it. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use scented products on my face so this is so great!</li>
    <li> I bought this Rugged &amp; Dapper for my husband. He is not normally one to use beauty products , but he agreed to try it after seeing the bottle. Nothing feminine about it, although it would work on any skin. He says that he really likes the way it makes his skin feel, soft and moisturized without being greasy. And the fact that it has no smell so it wont interfere with your cologne&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it has all natural and organic ingredients and it is made in the USA..&lt;br /&gt;We have a winner !</li>
    <li> I have used several different moisturizers and this is my favorite so far. Everyday after my evening shower I use it for my face to avoid dry skin, this one not only works the best to prevent dry skin, it also feels good when first applied, its not too greasy or too thin, I think it is the perfect texture for a guy.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this for my best friend. He was looking for a facial moisturizer that didn&#x27;t leave him &amp;#34;Feeling like an oil slick&amp;#34;. His exact words. So when I had the opportunity to get my hands on this product, based on the description, I knew it&#x27;d be a perfect fit for him. That is.... until I tested a little on the back of my hand. Now it&#x27;s mine. And he has to buy his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This generously sized 4oz moisturizer wonderfully creamy and not scented! It MELTED into my skin and left my hands feeling sinfully soft. I just wanted to roll around in this stuff! Truly a great product.</li>
    <li> Like many guys, I used moisturizers targeted toward women obsessed with youth because there’s not much out there specifically for men.  Ole Henriksen was previously my cream of choice, and while pretty good overall, it left my face a bit greasy and shiny.  Women will typically apply foundation, powder, caulking and anything they get their hands on to counteract the glossy sheen, but I just lived with it.  After reading some reviews on Rugged &amp; Dapper suggesting it goes on clean, dry and helps protect the face from effects of shaving, I decided to give it a try.  Glad I did!  The product has made noticeable improvement in my complexion, and leaves no gloss like the previous axel grease. The thing I like best; two pumps the size of a pea covers my entire face including forehead! This in MHO makes it a best buy given the generous 4 oz bottle.  Note that most moisturizers targeted to the opposite sex are 1 oz, and come in packaging to make it look like more.  I won’t go on to say that the R&amp;D  Age + Damage Defense Facial Moisturizer has changed my life, but I will say that I will buy again until, and unless, I find a better product.  At this time, this is the only game in town.  Give it a try, I think you’ll like it.  Cons:  A product this good, should contain a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few weeks and so far, the results have been great! I have fairly normal skin, but it can occasionally get dry in the winter. After using this product, it really leaves the skin feeling soft. I&#x27;ve tried other brands (i.e. Jack Black, Anthony, etc.), but decided to change it up a bit when I made this purchase. While they worked well (some better than others...), the Rugged &amp; Dapper product has probably worked the best for me since it leaves a lasting softness throughout the day. I highly recommend this. It may be pricier than the typical moisturizer that you can find in your standard retail store, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> I was gifted this product over the holidays and i have to say that I really like this product. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and it absorbs really well as soon as I appy it. My girlfriend has also been using it and she really likes it as well. Looks like I&#x27;m going to have to buy it for the both of us now!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to write a review until after using the product for a significant time and determining its effectiveness. Different from others I was not expecting much but to my surprise this product is deserving of its good reviews. My skin after shaving has always been very sensitive but besides moisturizing, it has acted as a calming effect on my skin. I will continue to use and will but again.</li>
    <li> My son loves your product!  H e told me that it stops the burn after he shaves and makes his skin feel silky smooth. I&#x27;m going to purchase for all the men in my life.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t really have a strong scent, which I love and absorbs well, not leaving my face looking shiny. I have naturally oily skin, so it&#x27;s nice that it isn&#x27;t left feeling like it&#x27;s sitting on your face. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product! Goes on easy and can see noticeable changes after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> My husband hates to put anything on his face and I really want to keep his face hydrated and healthy. I got this face moisturizer and so happy I did! After a bit of convincing and reminding my husband to use this moisturizer, it has become his routine and he loves it! His face is looking better and feel better knowing his skin is protected from the elements. He also loves the fact that it does not have a &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34; smell. Yes I forced him to use my moisturizer but now happy he has something he is happy with and can call his own</li>
    <li> Great face cream. No odor. Leaves my face feeling smooth &amp; refreshed. Wish I discovered this a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Outstanding. My face/complexion/skin tone looked better immediately. Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Having virtually no experience with skincare products, I was a little skeptical at first. But after using the product for a few weeks, I can confidently say that it really works. There is a visible difference. Skin looks so much more nourished and I have dry skin, so this helps a lot. Also makes the wrinkles less visible, or just more naturally blended with the rest of the skin, so it doesn&#x27;t draw attention like it used to. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Husband love&#x27;s this stuff.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Goes on smooth, not greasy and absorbs well.  Just started using it but off to a very promising start.</li>
    <li> Good product; as a man, it does what I want: goes on without leaving any residue or oily finish.  It also lacks any weird smell that you notice for a prolonged amount of time after application.  I&#x27;m no chemist or scientist but numerous listed ingredients are organic so I trust that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve had no side effects in way of allergic reactions, etc.  I would buy it (and likely will when it runs out) again.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturising lotion. From the first application I noticed a difference in my skin and after using it for a couple of weeks now, I am very happy with the results. It absorbs completely and solved the dry skin problem I was having this winter. Usually fragrences irritate my skin, but this product has very little fragrance and does not. Overall my skill looks smoother than before and has a nice healthy glow. Will definitly order again.</li>
    <li> Impressed by the lack of scent. As much odor as a glass of ice water with maybe a spoonful of sugar. Feels great. I forget it&#x27;s on my face in about ten seconds.</li>
    <li> The husband really like this cream! I have already noticed less fine lines on his face! Its fragrance free and good for all skin types. It&#x27;s all natural and organic but still heavy duty. Makes his his skin feel nice and soft. I am happy to recieve this item to review.</li>
    <li> This product has a great scent I adore. I got it for my husband who always gets horrible razor rash. After a week his face is like a baby&#x27;s butt and I don&#x27;t mind cuddling with him after he shaves at night. He says its only the 2nd cream to almost eliminate his razor burns and it doesn&#x27;t sting after applying. Will buy agajn</li>
    <li> Great product…not greasy at all - perfect moisturizer for my face, especially since I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product initially but it turned out to be a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this moisturizer everyday. It takes great care of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are not many of similar type specially designed for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet tried their scrub (Daily Power Scrub Facial Cleanser For Men). I do see good rating for this product too.</li>
    <li> I got this product for review. My husband had the opportunity to use this product for the past week when he shaves. He does not shave every day, nor does he shave a lot... however he has very sensitive skin. He told me this does not burn or irritate his skin like some after shave lotion. All and all the over all smell and texture is pleasant. It leaves his face nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has sensitive skin. I asked him his opinion so I could write this review for him. He said it was non-greasy, nice scented and left his face smooth and did not harm his sensitive skin. He likes the way it smells and that it lasts all day long. He has noticed his skin on his face is softer and more supple and it does not get as irritated when he shaves. He has even gone as far as using this on his face, neck, head, hands and feet. He said his feet are not as dry and scaly since he started using this and he likes it a lot over normal foot cream.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband. I was not sure at first if he would use it or not because he is normally very picky on the products he will use but I convinced him to atleast give it a shot. He says he really likes it. He said it is easy to apply and he loves the way it makes his facial hair feel after he uses it. He actually asked me the other day if I could get him some more and for him that is a huge deal. If you have a picky man this is a great product for him.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks using this product. I can&#x27;t say enough about how great it makes your skin feel. I have never used moisturizer on my face for fear of breaking out. This product has not caused any reaction on my sensitive skin! Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive skin on the planet. I hate putting product on my face. I was keen to try something that would actually work. Its that time of your year where the seasons are a changing -  My skin reacts every time and is super dry. I needed a product that would actually help without being harmful to my skin. I tried rugged and dapper and i&#x27;ve gotta say this seriously is the most calm moisturizing product i&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend it to anyone (male or female) with REALLY sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This a great product.  It is easy to apply and leaves my face feeling moisturized all day.  I use it all over my face.  At it&#x27;s price point, it is expensive.  But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Greet feeling after using it!</li>
    <li> I finally found a natural and organic moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t smell like a dumpster of perfume or that chemically burns my skin into oblivion! It&#x27;s not greasy and keeps me fresh all day! I highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin or for anyone who has skin problems! Rugged is not for the faint-hearted and Dapper is just how the ladies like it. :) Thank you for making an incredible product! I will spread the love and word!</li>
    <li> A really great all-around facial moisturizer for men.</li>
    <li> Adding to my previous review. This product is great but the bottle design isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s impossible to get all of the lotion out with this pump bottle. Quite a bit left in the bottle when the pump stops working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face with a shiny look. Lots of previous products I put on my face left me with a shine that would never fade. This is not shiny and it&#x27;s absorbed in to the skin quickly. I like it.</li>
    <li> Great product - had it for just over a week and already can see &amp;amp; feel the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> RUGGED &amp; DAPPER understands that men&#x27;s facial skin is different form women&#x27;s. Yes, fine lines and wrinkles and age spot occur post extended exposure to sun just as in women, but men scrape sharp steel across their faces everyday (unless of course the choice is to sport a bear or the ubiquitous &#x60;5&#x27;ocolck shadow look&#x27;. But her at last is a combination after shave and facial moisturizer that is heavy duty enough to make and immediate impact after using it the first time. No wonder they titled it &#x60;skin fuel for men&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most prominent ingredients are hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, non comedogenic jojoba oil, Shea butter, Green Tea and a half dozen nourishing plant based botanicals - all free of the usual toxins and chemicals that cause their own level of damage.  The peptides stimulate collagen and elastin production to treat dermal wrinkles while the hyaluronic acid penetrates to a deeper level to attack the same problems. All the while the aloe vera and jojoba oil refresh the skin giving that soothing feeling while healing razor nicks and aftereffects of shaving  - or overdosing on sun! It feels great going on, makes you feel protected when out of doors, and right away gives your skin that fresh and more youthful look. This is a great product! Highly recommended.

    <li> I purchase this NEW Age + Damage Defense Facial Moisturizer for my husband and he loves it.You should try it if you want to have a soft face ;)</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer. Leaves my skin feeling very soft. Would recommend this product, especially for people suffering from dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great and makes the skin soft. Grab thick thick black and pump it until it squirts the white goo out on your face.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Hydrates without making you greasy</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no scent to it at all, which wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but because of that it wont interfere with your soap, shampoo, cologne, or any other fragarance that you may be wearing. I like it. It&#x27;s light, allows me to moisturize and fight against my normal, genetically unperfect skin as well as slow the appearance that i&#x27;m getting older, and all in a way that doesn&#x27;t involve me having to buy multiple things or any feminine products. However, there does seem something about it that makes me feel like there is something is missing. Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I have become so accostomed to doing more for my skin that this thing does it all.</li>
    <li> Works and feels great!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, I have been trying to get my boyfriend to use moisturizer as we are both over 45.  Until now, finally I found him a mens product that he likes.  Like all guys he was being tough or whatever its called.  He tried it and then said he would use it for special occasions only.  So I read him that night all the benefits in it by using daily.  He uses it every day after shaving now.  I act like I don&#x27;t know, but have seen him use it almost daily now.  This is my honest opinion of product.  Thank you for a great product</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teen son because he has allergies and it is free of dyes, chemicals and nuts. I tried it myself and love it! I have used many expensive women&#x27;s moisturizers throughout the years but I am throwing them all out and switching to this product. It is a light moisturizer so it doesn&#x27;t make your skin greasy and tightens pores.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good stuff.  Expensive but worth the money for the following reasons:  1.  It works well, 2.  Matt finish --doesn&#x27;t leave a sheen or shine on the skin. 3.  Very small amount required so the cost per &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; is mitigated, 4. After using this product for the past few months I would say it actually works.  Maybe not a miracle to return your youth but it does help.  ADD SUNSCREEN to make this product better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this for my husband. He will never get around to this...not to mention technology isn&#x27;t exactly his best friend. However, I really wanted to let everyone know how wonderful this product is. First of all, my husband has extremely sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t even bleach his whites because the chlorine irritates his skin (even after the rinse cycle!). Shaving causes him issues so many issues, he just beards up for most of the winter since the air is so dry here in Montana. He was raving so much about his new &amp;#34;face lotion&amp;#34;, I decided to give it a try. As a woman who loves makeup and all things skincare, I&#x27;ve been around the block a few times and I&#x27;m honestly impressed with this product for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) First and foremost, my husband has used this issue free with his sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t tell you what a relief that was! I&#x27;ve searched for something that will work for him and I&#x27;ve found it! Eureka!&lt;br /&gt;2) When it says fragrance free, they mean it. This is such a nice thing, I don&#x27;t know how many products I&#x27;ve purchased that say fragrance free and then they&#x27;re not.&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s rich and smooth, quickly replenishing moisture without feeling greasy. Plus it soaks in quickly which is a nice thing before bed or for me, before I apply makeup. Not that really matters for guys ;-)&lt;br /&gt;4) Truly moisturizes, sometimes moisturizers soak in but make you feel like you need additional applications. Not this stuff, it&#x27;s very creamy and nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;5) I love the ingredients. Nothing too weird but at the same time a lot of good stuff, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 1 and ONLY complaint is a lack of sunscreen. It&#x27;s hard enough to corral a man long enough to make him moisturize without also saying &amp;#34;oh by the way, you need sunscreen too&amp;#34;...now keep in mind I live in Montana...sometimes the boys can be a little wild and hard to tame in these parts ;-). That&#x27;s it though, no other complaints! There&#x27;s really nothing to complain about. Great product, no issues with the bottle and I&#x27;ve managed to get him in a routine of using it almost every day since Christmas. Personally, I think I&#x27;m winning!t product, no issues with the bottle and I&#x27;ve managed to get him in a routine of using it almost every day since Christmas. Personally, I think I&#x27;m winning!</li>
    <li> Took care of my winter dried face without irritation. It worked a lot better than my unscented neutrogena facial lotion.</li>
    <li> Works very good, goes on a little greasy, but then after 30 minutes or so it&#x27;s not greasy!</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this moisturizer. I received a wonderful price and in return I am choosing to tell my thoughts about Rugged and Dapper.&lt;br /&gt;He uses is Morning and night and last week when he went on a business trip he packed it with him. This may not sound significant but this is a guy who say the only things he needs are socks, underware and a toothbrush. Accept not he has to include his moisturizer. Lol that just make me chuckle.&lt;br /&gt;I give this moisturizer an extra star because I think they did a great job on the packaging. The coloring and the bottle I just really think it appeals to men like my hubby. As always, these words are my own!</li>
    <li> Works well,  goes on clean,  isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that it isn&#x27;t the best smell.  That may just be my liking.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, no doubt. But the three stars is for the price and quantity. I dont mind spending money on good stuff but the small amount of aftetshave plus the big price doesnt add up in my book. I go for nivea sensitive skin balm, way better fellas!</li>
    <li> Great product after a few day of using it, I can notice a different. A+++++  *Updated review*  I would give this product a 5 stars. But after using the second bottle i&#x27;m get annoy with this pumping bottle and especially when it get really low it hard to use every drop of it. I would recommend Rugged &amp; Dapper using a jar instead of this pumping bottle it really suck when travel in the cold weather too, it get really sticky the pumping doesn&#x27;t work. I have to uncap it and dapping using the pumping tube. Put this product in a jar would be a perfect solution so we can use every drop of the product and user friendly.</li>
    <li> I hate putting lotions/cream on my face in general. i have tried several lotions and creams in the past including expensive Keihls . Result has been 2-3 days per week of reluctant usage. With the brutal winter in NorthEast, i ended up looking for a face moisturizer and came across Rugged &amp; Dapper. Seeing the unbelievable reviews, i just ordered it. Overall very happy with the purchase, here&#x27;s my 2 cents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- its non greasy and has a very nice feel to it. this is coming from face cream hater.&lt;br /&gt;- Smell is very neutral or almost non existent . Good its neutral, bad i personally like a little pleasant scent though overall not a deal breaker&lt;br /&gt;- Lotion is in a pump which is very convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i love the product, only concern i have is for Summer when i will need some SPF but currently i have using it twice a day ... Imagine that :)</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t smell to much and it goes on matte.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  The product seemed like it had been sitting in a back shelf for years and was dry.  I had to add water for it to work at all.  Not what it was touted to be at all.  Very disappointed......</li>
    <li> Natural product that leaves skin feeling great</li>
    <li> I have not seen clear results as of yet but I can tell you that my face is getting softer.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this.  I got an eye roll when I bought it for him but he actually likes to use it now.  Usually after he shaves, his skin is very flaky.  This helps take care of it.  So far it hasn&#x27;t cause him any sort of irritation, but he&#x27;s only been using it a week.</li>
    <li> For the price, I&#x27;m not too impressed for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The cream doesn&#x27;t smell or feel luxurious&lt;br /&gt;2.  The product packaging and bottle is cheap&lt;br /&gt;3.  After 2 weeks there is no noticeable improvement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotherm or Khiels are much better for me..  and about the same price.</li>
    <li> I like it. I was surprised how difficult it was to find a men&#x27;s moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t your typical mega-conglomerate drug store creation or a super expensive girly-man cream. I looked into the company before purchasing and it seems like a couple in LA started the company with a focus on proven ingredients. I liked the ingredients and the fact that this is a small business owned by people that seem to really care. Soaks in very well without smell or residue. Works really well after exfoliating heavily. I plan on purchasing again as long as everything stays the same.</li>
    <li> Much better than Jack Black or Clinique  (spelling? ) anyway you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.... Lives up to claims and then some!!</li>
    <li> Goes on really well and doesn&#x27;t make skin look greasy. You also don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your whole face, I just use three squirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but worth it for me at least</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions and after shaves over the years. I haven&#x27;t had much success always having chronic dry skin. This is hands down the best and a little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on this product. I have been using this moisturizer for nearly three weeks and have loved the results. I suffer from mild adult acne and slightly sensitive skin so I&#x27;ve had a lot of difficulty finding a moisturizer that works. Since I begun using this product I have experienced less bumps and irritation after I shave, as well as much less acne. Additionally, though I&#x27;m only in my mid-twenties with no dramatic signs of aging, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin appears younger and firmer. I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
    <li> keeping razer bumps at bay.</li>
    <li> Rugged and Dapper has quickly become one&#x27;s of my favorite go to products...as a professional barber, I can always count on them to give me quality product the delivers amazing results. Thanks a mil:)</li>
    <li> Good concept but not for me. The facial cleaner impacted my face negatively so did not use this product much. Just stored in a cupboard somewhere.</li>
    <li> shipped fast! great product.</li>
    <li> Great moisturiser. Not Greasey, dries matte.</li>
    <li> Greasy and clogged my pores - don&#x27;t believe all the hype and advertisements on the label - I&#x27;m pretty sure its just a rebranded cheap lotion</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase! I&#x27;ve tried many high-end face moisturizers over the years, and Rugged &amp; Dapper definitely beats them all!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the founders provide amazing customer service and will personally answer any questions you have. I can&#x27;t wait to buy this as gifts for my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I found that this moisturizer felt pretty good initially but never really absorbed into the skin. It left my facell really greasy. Not for me.</li>
    <li> As a male model I need to keep my face young, this product does exactly that. Not greasy and isn&#x27;t sticky. I&#x27;ll use this forever!!!</li>
    <li> We have been using this cream for a few weeks. It&#x27;s light and fluffy and oil free. No scent and rubs in well. I even started using it on the kids guilt free due to it&#x27;s all natural and organic properties.</li>
    <li> Bought this product as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! It&#x27;s perfect for him as it&#x27;s super easy to use. Makes a great gift for your scruffy guy.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me because my skin is always a little dry in winter and I absolutely LOVE it. It moisturizes my skin really well without being greasy and it does not make me break out. On top of that it is all natural without any chemicals and does not smell like perfume. It has a really nice natural unscented smell. I love this product and actually so does my wife. She started using it too and is now addicted. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone male or female.</li>
    <li> Great product. I got it for my husband but I&#x27;m using it too. I&#x27;ll need to get another one soon. I&#x27;ve tried many of this type of product and what appeals to me the most is that it is natural. There are many products on the market similar but this one makes my face feel great. It is a great make-up base too! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I heard about this product, but after using it a couple days I notice a huge difference. I am a comedian and keep some pretty insane hours. But even after long nights and waking up feeling haggard....I DON&#x27;T LOOK IT! I Love this product and would highly recommend it to anybody...Travis</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and so far he really likes it. It has no smell which is perfect. I think he&#x27;s pretty rugged and dapper (truthfully he&#x27;s a little more rugged than dapper) already but he loves having something to help keep his face protected from the damage it&#x27;s subjected to in his daily work life.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  He tried it for the first time 2 days ago and said it was the best moisturizer he has ever had.  It is not greasy on his face. He likes the feel of it and he said it really keeps his face hydrated.  Thank you! Great Product!</li>
    <li> This is  one of the best facial moisturizers I ever used. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and it does not have any odor that I could notice. My face has a much more even tone after I apply it. A lot of the small wrinkles around my eyes seem to vanish as well. I definitely plan on buying more!</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this. He&#x27;s crazy picky about face lotion and we&#x27;ve tried much more expensive brands and he likes this one more. He loves the clean scent and texture.</li>
    <li> Wow wow wow. what else can i say? Got this for my husband and thanks to the other reviews from other ladies I tried it on myself. This replaced about three bottles that I was using on my face and completely gave me a new face. I used to have really oily face but thanks to Rugged and Dapper, this is now an issue of the past. Love the natural and organic ingredients! the best part of it all is that it saves me about 75% on facial lotion since the other products that i was using was costly. Thanks Rugged and Dapper... I am a believer!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used. Makes an immediate impact on my complexion and keeps my face from getting dry. I have sensitive skin and this is the only moisturizer that has not caused me to break out.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer does what&#x27;s advertised, but it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s also anti-aging. I looked all throughout the box and the bottle and no where does it say this thing fights aging. The packaging is very nice and the the moisturizer leaves my face dry-free. My issue with the moisturizer is  that you need to apply 3-4 pumps to really get this thing applied all over your face. The directions recommend 2 pumps, which I&#x27;ve tried and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was able to apply the moisturizer all over my face and neck area. I use this every morning after my thorough face washing regiment (morning cleanser+exfoliating+toning) and it leaves my face moist all throughout the day. It does make my face feeling a bit greasy around 2pm though. I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars, because it leaves my face dry-free throughout most of the day and the packaging and bottle is very nice, but no where does it say this thing is age fighting and too many pumps are needed to work for me.</li>
    <li> This is just what my husband needed for his winter dry skin as it get so dry here and it is very cold. He works with people everyday so he has to looks his very best and with this he found the facial moisturizer helped relieve his dry skin and without any reactions to the ingredients. He will be using this daily for better looking skin.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and i got to say this is one of the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. It last all day and as soon as i used it i could feel and tell the difference from other creams.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer for sensitive acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used it every day (for the past week)and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s really non-greasy and disappears from your face very fast. I used it under my  eye&#x27;s and it didn&#x27;t burn which is an issue I have had in the past</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 and have two pretty distinct wrinkles in the middle of my forehead.  While this works well as a lotion, it&#x27;s not really doing anything for the wrinkles except helpping prevent them from getting worse -- maybe.  I&#x27;ll buy plain &#x27;ol face lotion next time.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and thought this product would be perfect for daily application. Unfortunately, this moisturizer is relatively heavy and leaves your face feeling oily and weighed down.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I moisturizer extremely well and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face shiny or feeling super &amp;#34;oily.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face lotion and most would cause my face irritation but this has worked quite well for me and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  I will probably buy another bottle or two.</li>
    <li> Replaced another high end mens moisturizer with R&amp;D and am very impressed.  This is much thicker yet absorbs quicker into the skin and does a great job of hydrating my face and hands.  Smell is very neutral so no issue there.&lt;br /&gt;If I were to nit pick I would like the pump to be a bit bigger.  Takes a lot of pumps to get the amount I need because again my skin just absorbs it so quickly.</li>
